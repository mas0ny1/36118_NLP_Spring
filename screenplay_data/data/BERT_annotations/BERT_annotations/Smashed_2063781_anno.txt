scene_heading: 1 INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 1
text: CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and, *
text: oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny
speaker_heading: KARAOKE STAGE
text: in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.
text: Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke
text: version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent
text: she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.
text: At a table near the stage is --
text: -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but *
text: handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps
text: and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --
dialog: -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's -- *
dialog: who sings along with --
text: -- the small but energetic CROWD.
text: Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points
dialog: to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the
dialog: Queen of Karaoke.
speaker_heading: LATER
dialog: 2.
text: Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to
text: join Charlie and Owen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That was so good, baby!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm serious. You sing like an angel
dialog: -- a drunk angel.
text: Owen and Kate LAUGH.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: If you were writing about my
dialog: performance for your blog, what
dialog: would you say?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'd say that, uh...my wife is the
dialog: sexiest, most amazing woman alive.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That would be such a shitty article
dialog: -- nobody would read it.
text: Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at
text: Owen and makes a puppy dog face.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Owen)
dialog: Aw...we need to find you a lady,
dialog: Owen.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt
dialog: with the bartender, but...I can't
dialog: tell.
dialog: Owen motions to the --
scene_heading: -- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's. *
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: She's hot! What can't you tell?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: She looks like she could kick my
dialog: ass. No way would she go for a guy
dialog: like me.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're being a little girl -- just
dialog: go talk to her.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (clearly shy)
dialog: I don't know...forget about it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (not going to take "no"
dialog: for an answer)
dialog: I'll take point -- follow me.
text: Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts
text: her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to buy a gimlet for me and a
dialog: double-shot of whiskey for my
dialog: brother-in-law `cause he's had a
dialog: hard week.
speaker_heading: FEMALE BARTENDER
dialog: `Kay.
text: The bartender quickly pours the drinks.
speaker_heading: FEMALE BARTENDER (CONT'D)
dialog: That's fifteen.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wait -- don't you wanna know what
dialog: happened to him?
text: The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see
dialog: if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she
dialog: listens.
speaker_heading: FEMALE BARTENDER
dialog: (unenthused)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He just got back from England --
dialog: because he went there for a girl! A
dialog: preppy, bitchy girl. Diane
dialog: Court...that was her name. He loved
dialog: her so much that he went with her
dialog: because she had a fellowship or
dialog: something. He gave up being a
dialog: kickboxer. A kickboxer! *
dialog: (sad)
dialog: And she dumped him.
dialog: 4.
text: The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation
dialog: to hear her response, which is --
speaker_heading: FEMALE BARTENDER
dialog: (to Owen)
dialog: You kickbox?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (caught in the headlights)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: And...that's all Owen's got.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (jumping in)
dialog: And he teaches kids at the
dialog: kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so
dialog: cute!
text: The bartender glances back to Owen.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (finally)
dialog: A lot of `em don't have parents --
dialog: so...it's kinda more than just a
dialog: teacher/student thing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know it sounds silly, but I feel
dialog: responsible for them -- like...
dialog: (emotional)
dialog: ...I could be their parent.
text: Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: I think I got him laid.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: She seems totally game.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sure she just didn't want to get
dialog: into your pants?
text: Kate rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I think I'm done for the night.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah?
text: Owen wanders over, dejected. *
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: She's seen "Say Anything."
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Eh, well...what're you gonna do,
dialog: huh?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wanna drive us home?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No -- he needs to keep working it! *
dialog: You guys stay here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't want to watch my brother
dialog: not score. I want to go to bed with
dialog: you and...
dialog: (whispered into Kate's
dialog: ear)
dialog: ...you know.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'll be home when you get there. We
dialog: can "you know" then.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: Yeah, man -- you don't have a job
dialog: to wake up for in the morning or
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Writing is a job! Not having to
dialog: report to an office only makes work
dialog: harder.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen
dialog: should take us home -- you're too
dialog: drunk to drive.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So's Owen.
dialog: (suddenly focused)
dialog: I'm not that drunk. Besides, you
dialog: know I focus when I drive -- it
dialog: sobers me up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tell that to the cops.
dialog: 6.
text: Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: I love you, baby. I'll be waiting
dialog: for you in a nice warm bed. You
dialog: have exactly one mission: get your
dialog: brother laid -- and don't talk to
dialog: any other women.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That sounds like two missions.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, it's just one.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (to Owen)
dialog: It kinda sounded like two, right?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: It did.
text: Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (really fast)
dialog: GoodbyeIloveyouboth!
scene_heading: 2 EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 2 *
text: Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances
dialog: over and sees:
text: A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS
dialog: again.
text: Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and
dialog: Freda.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: (quick)
dialog: Yeah. Are you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Um...sure.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Good.
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Hey, I'm not really okay.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: My bitch sister just took off and
dialog: left me here so she could hook up
dialog: with some asshole. Now what am I
dialog: supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a
dialog: car here.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I guess I could...
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: You'll give me a ride? Oh my god!
dialog: Thank you!
text: Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over. *
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I was gonna say "call you a cab,"
dialog: `cause, you know -- I don't even
dialog: know you.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: It's not far. Please? Pretty
dialog: please...?
text: Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 3 INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT 3 *
text: The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown. *
text: Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances
text: down at the floor and notices a FLASK. *
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: You know, you shouldn't drink and
dialog: drive.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I wasn't --
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Just kidding. Can I have a sip?
dialog: 8.
text: Kate's speechless.
speaker_heading: FREDA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm really thirsty.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's, uh...whiskey.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love
dialog: whiskey. You're the real thing,
dialog: huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like
dialog: me!
text: Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know. No.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Can I smoke in your car?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (slightly annoyed)
dialog: Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you
dialog: just roll down the window?
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.
dialog: Freda takes out a --
text: -- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (in disbelief)
speaker_heading: WHOA!
text: Kate immediately pulls the car over.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not what I thought you meant.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Want a hit?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, I...is that pot?
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: (as though it's a
dialog: ridiculous question)
dialog: Of course not! What do I look like?
dialog: A stoner?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: FREDA (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's crack.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, shit! No...no thank you.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: C'mon -- it's good crack.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't, um...I've never smoked
dialog: crack.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Really? This stuff is the truth --
dialog: and it'll sober you up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh...I think you should go.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: I'm not getting out in the middle
dialog: of nowhere. Do you know what could
dialog: happen to me all alone out here at *
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know -- people might offer
dialog: you crack?
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: Seriously? It's not a big deal --
dialog: just take a little hit.
text: Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I said no.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober
dialog: you up.
text: Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: FREDA (CONT'D)
dialog: (high-pitched cartoon
dialog: voice)
dialog: Smoke me!
text: Kate LAUGHS.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: One puff. Then we are both going
dialog: home.
text: Freda nods. Long beat.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine.
text: Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate
text: sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.
speaker_heading: FREDA
dialog: You've got money, right?
scene_heading: 4 EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - NIGHT 4
text: Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS --
text: -- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass
text: around TWO PIPES.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk.
text: Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're
text: still smoking crack.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (mile-a-minute fast)
dialog: ...'cause I feel like I understand
dialog: what it's like to be homeless, ya
dialog: know? I mean, if you didn't know
dialog: me, if we hadn't connected tonight,
dialog: you might think: "There's some
dialog: upper-middle-class, NPR listening,
text: self-congratulatory, insulated,
dialog: lazy liberal bitch. Probably never
dialog: had to worry about anything." But
dialog: that's not true at all! I grew up
dialog: poor, man. Single mother.
dialog: McDonald's used to have one day a
dialog: week where they sold 29 cent
dialog: hamburgers, and another day where
dialog: they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My
dialog: mom and me would go there and she'd
dialog: get twenty burgers -- that was the
dialog: limit, probably set up for folks
dialog: just like us -- and then she'd put
dialog: `em in the freezer and we'd
dialog: microwave `em for dinner throughout
dialog: the week.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was kinda overweight until high
dialog: school, to be perfectly honest.
dialog: Eating used to be my thing. When I
dialog: started drinking, though, I kinda
dialog: stopped eating so much.
dialog: (back on track)
dialog: But anyway, the point is: You and
dialog: me, we're not so different.
text: The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate. They're
text: more concerned with their crack pipe.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN 5
text: Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's
text: eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused,

scene_heading: 7 INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN 7

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Huh?!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What happened? I came home and you
dialog: were gone and I waited and waited.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's a long story.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I was worried. I kept calling you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I ended up...
dialog: Charlie SNIFFS Kate.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You smell funny. What do you smell
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I fell asleep in my car. Near the
dialog: bar. I was too drunk to drive.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So, why didn't you come back or
dialog: call me?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie --

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby.
dialog: I love you -- and you know how you
dialog: get sometimes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I love you too. But I'm home. It's
dialog: over. I gotta get to work.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can't be worried about you all

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Check for your mom's on the table.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thanks, baby.
text: Kate takes a sip of coffee.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, Hillary? *
speaker_heading: HILLARY *
dialog: Can?
speaker_heading: KATE

text: classroom. Through the glass she sees --
text: -- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned
dialog: smile you give someone right after they've publicly
dialog: embarrassed themselves).
text: Kate mouths the words --
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (silent)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: -- and gestures "come here."
text: Mr. Davies gestures to the class that he'll be right back --
text: before he walks out to talk to Kate. He's got a slightly
dialog: nervous demeanor -- somewhere between "I never became
dialog: comfortable talking to women" and Asperger's.
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: Is everything, um...okay, Mrs.
dialog: Hannah?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed
dialog: -- but I feel a lot better. And I
dialog: just wanted to say thank you.
text: Mr. Davies glances down the hall.
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: Look -- I'm not a fool.
dialog: (whispered)
dialog: I know you were drinking this
dialog: morning.
text: Kate looks shocked.
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
dialog: I saw you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: Oh, no, I...
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: Drinking when you're pregnant is
dialog: really dangerous.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know that! Oh, God, I...
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: ...listen -- I'm not actually
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm just really hung over. The kids
dialog: started asking me questions after I
dialog: vomited and I panicked.
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: Oh. That's...not good.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know. I...please don't say
dialog: anything.
text: Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: Just...go home. Get some sleep.
text: Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the
dialog: classroom.
scene_heading: 17 INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY 17
text: Kate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it
dialog: and --
text: -- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch.
scene_heading: 18 INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - DAY 18 *
text: Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER.
dialog: It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I had such a crappy morning.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Me too. I spent like three hours at
dialog: the post office trying to buy
dialog: stamps and stuff.
text: Kate takes a long sip of beer.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I told my class I was pregnant.
text: Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over
text: and grabs her hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (excited and sort of
dialog: confused)
dialog: Oh, baby, that's --
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (deflated)
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: `Cause it would be great news -- if
dialog: it was true.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: `Course then I'd have to drink your
dialog: beer...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, it was a lie. I just lied to
dialog: my class. After barfing in front of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (cringes)
dialog: Ooh...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, that's what they said.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: Listen...I can't do this anymore.
text: A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I dunno. I think I might...drink
dialog: too much.
speaker_heading: Charlie LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.
text: Charlie swigs his beer.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know I do -- I'm a fucking
dialog: mess...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Baby -- that's not true. You're
dialog: beautiful. And brilliant. And I
dialog: love you. I wouldn't be married to
dialog: a "mess."
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I left work after puking in front *
dialog: of little kids. And...now I'm *
dialog: drinking in the middle of the day. *
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, those things happen
dialog: sometimes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean, they shouldn't happen all
dialog: the time, but...it's the price of,
dialog: uh, truly living life.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Isn't that like a slogan for some
dialog: kind of beer or toothpaste or
dialog: something...?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. And it's true -- you and me,
dialog: we're not just some boring couple
dialog: in the suburbs who don't sleep with
dialog: each other and have nothing to talk
dialog: about except whatever TV show
dialog: they're currently into.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We, like...still know how to party.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...I think I need to slow down.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I might need help.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll help you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know, but...I might need more
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah? Like a therapist?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know -- I just get stupid
dialog: when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We just like to have a good time.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, well...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...you've gotta promise not to tell
dialog: this to anyone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (curious)
dialog: I promise.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That includes Owen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, last night I kinda, um...
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: ...smoked some crack.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: WHAT?!
text: Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: After I left the bar, I, uh, picked
dialog: up this drunk girl and...I don't
dialog: really remember what came next, but
dialog: I ended up smoking crack with her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Uh...how's that even happen?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You give someone a ride and she
dialog: rewards you with crack?!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well...she seemed desperate. She
dialog: really needed a ride home.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Where?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Downtown. I think she maybe lives
dialog: in...a tent?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well...she might be homeless. Or a
dialog: prostitute. Or just some lost
dialog: sorority girl.
dialog: (thinks about it)
dialog: To be honest, I'm not sure...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Oh, my god...you smoked crack with
dialog: some random stranger? Did
dialog: you...share a pipe?
text: Kate doesn't answer. She doesn't need to.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ughhh...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just playing Devil's advocate, but
dialog: maybe it's the crack-smoking you
dialog: need help with and not the
dialog: drinking.
text: Kate gives Charlie a dirty look.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just saying.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: The drinking led to the crack-
dialog: smoking. The drinking leads to
dialog: everything stupid I do.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I mean...can you even remember the
dialog: last time we had sober sex?
text: Charlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. He tries to
dialog: remember. And can't.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We'll chill out with the booze for
dialog: a while. We can just be wine-with- *
dialog: dinner people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How's that sound?
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. STREET - DAY 19
text: Kate and Charlie joyfully ride BICYCLES home from the bar.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Maybe you should go to, uh... one
dialog: of those meetings. They have `em
dialog: over there.
text: Charlie gestures to a
dialog: BUILDING (could be a church or different type of building
dialog: where AA meets).
text: Kate LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Remember when I was shit-faced and
dialog: took that Q &amp; A pamphlet from
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to
dialog: like every question and at the end
dialog: it was like, "If you answered `yes'
dialog: to any of these you're an
dialog: alcoholic!"
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: (nostalgic)
dialog: ...that was fun, wasn't it?
text: Kate smiles and nods.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey --
text: Charlie gestures to the street.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- look out for that crack!
text: Kate looks down but sees nothing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What crack?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a
dialog: crack there...
dialog: (grins)
dialog: ...but you must have smoked it last
dialog: night.
text: Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards
text: Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away.
text: Kate chases after him.
scene_heading: 20 INT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER 20
text: While an old 70's R &amp; B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which
text: is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS --
text: -- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and *
text: LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: "Have you missed days of work or
dialog: school because of drinking?"
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: "Do you envy people who can drink
dialog: without getting into trouble?"
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Envy isn't exactly the right
dialog: word...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: "Do you have `blackouts'?"
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, but who doesn't?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: "Has your drinking caused trouble
dialog: at home?"
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No! We're great.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. Definitely. But we still had
text: a lot of "yes" answers.
dialog: (refers to pamphlet)
dialog: Yep...we still qualify as drunks.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm gonna go!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (disbelief)
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go.
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Eight.
text: Kate gets up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: See ya.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (doesn't believe her)
dialog: Uh-huh...
text: Kate takes a big sip of wine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (quite serious)
dialog: This is me: going.
text: Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You've been boozing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So? You should come too!
speaker_heading: Charlie LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, right. You can't go to AA
dialog: wasted. It's like a rule or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, yeah? Watch me!
scene_heading: 21 INT. MEETING HALL - NIGHT 21
text: An AA meeting is in progress.
text: An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story.
dialog: 29.
text: The room is filled with --
text: -- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their
dialog: "own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people
dialog: are adults. There are distinct groups of --
scene_heading: -- "PRETTY WOMEN" --
scene_heading: -- "OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE" --
scene_heading: -- "BUSINESSMEN" --
dialog: -- and "HIPSTERS."
text: As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a
text: hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!
text: Donovan "shushes" Kate.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: You must be a newcomer, huh?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Um, I'm not really allowed to talk
dialog: to new chicks, but there are lots
dialog: of women here who can help you out.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do I just sit wherever?
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: The meeting already started so just
dialog: try to find a spot anywhere.
text: Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying
text: things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a
text: seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.
dialog: 30.
text: As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next
text: to Kate quietly try to welcome her.
speaker_heading: LILY *
dialog: Are you new?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: To this? Yeah. Why's everyone
dialog: whispering?
speaker_heading: SHANA *
dialog: It's hard, huh?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: LILY *
dialog: Everything's going to be fine.
dialog: You're home.
text: Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear
dialog: anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally
dialog: joined Jim Jones' church.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE.
text: The tattooed man stands at the podium.
speaker_heading: TATTOO MAN
dialog: Not to embarrass anyone, but so
dialog: that we may get to know you better -
dialog: - is there anybody here in their
dialog: first thirty days of recovery?
text: Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and
dialog: introduce themselves as alcoholics.
text: Kate stands up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a
text: little drunk right now.
text: People burst into LAUGHTER.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want me to talk about my
dialog: childhood or something?
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: TATTOO MAN
dialog: (painfully polite)
dialog: You know, Kate, we actually ask
dialog: that you don't share if you've had *
dialog: a drink or any mind-altering
dialog: substance in the past 24 hours.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (not listening)
dialog: I can -- I kinda hate my dad and
dialog: don't talk to him. And my mom...oh,
dialog: man...I don't even know where to
dialog: start. She's, like, stuck in the
dialog: 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her
dialog: last boyfriend called himself a
dialog: drummer but really just gave drum
dialog: lessons to little kids and --
speaker_heading: TATTOO MAN
dialog: (tries to shut Kate up)
dialog: Welcome, Kate.
dialog: (forces a smile)
dialog: It gets better.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (not picking up the hint)
dialog: I like drinking is the thing. I
dialog: mean, I don't want to say you guys
dialog: are wrong or anything...
text: Kate nervously LAUGHS.
text: Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.
speaker_heading: TATTOO MAN
dialog: Thank you -- we're all here to
dialog: help. We do have to move on,
dialog: though.
text: The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down.
speaker_heading: LILY *
dialog: Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be
dialog: plenty of time to tell your story.
text: A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't
dialog: really believe that it's been five
dialog: years. I mean, my life was a mess
dialog: back then. Now I'm back in school,
dialog: I have an amazing man, I love my
dialog: parents -- it's crazy...
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (way too loud)
dialog: How old is that girl?! Can she even
dialog: go to bars?
dialog: (to Amber)
dialog: How old are you, Amber?
speaker_heading: SHANA *
dialog: Be respectful.
text: Kate seems surprised at being chastised.
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: (gaining intensity)
dialog: Um...okay? It's because I did the
dialog: work. I got down on my knees and
dialog: prayed every night! I went to a
dialog: meeting everyday!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Everyday?
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say,
dialog: I owe everything to AA. Well, AA --
dialog: and God, of course!
text: The whole room APPLAUDS.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY
speaker_heading: PRAYER.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: God grant me the serenity to accept
dialog: the things I cannot change --
dialog: courage to change the things I can -
dialog: - and wisdom to know the
dialog: difference.
speaker_heading: KATE
speaker_heading: AMEN!
text: Everyone turns and looks at Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Okay...I think I'm good.
text: Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived.
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: 22 EXT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT 22
text: Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So much for that.
text: Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-
text: crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN
speaker_heading: FURNITURE.
text: They drunkenly play CROQUET. *
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Was it a bunch of old biker guys?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, it was...I don't know.
dialog: Enthusiastic people. A lot of
dialog: really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm
dialog: sorry it wasn't cool.
text: Charlie thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't really imagine never
dialog: drinking. I guess I don't have to,
dialog: though --
dialog: (beat)
dialog: -- you're the one with the problem.
text: Kate nods in agreement. *
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey -- I love you. I don't want you
dialog: to have to drink.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't have to drink.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just really like to drink. *
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (sincere)
dialog: Good -- `cause you're my favorite
dialog: person to drink with in the whole
dialog: damn world.
text: Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment,
dialog: and then Kate...
dialog: 34.
text: ...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate
text: grins mischievously.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, no you didn't!
text: Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie
text: dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in
dialog: the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too
dialog: intense.
scene_heading: 23 INT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 23
text: Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to
text: unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's
text: extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and
dialog: voice).
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are you trying to have some sex?
text: Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She
text: climbs on top of him and --
text: -- they start having sloppy, drunk sex.
text: After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving.
dialog: She looks down to discover that --
text: -- he's passed out.
text: Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her
text: unconscious husband.
scene_heading: 24 INT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 24
text: Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she
text: drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more
text: booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a
text: couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there
dialog: isn't more alcohol in the house.
scene_heading: A FEW MOMENTS LATER
text: Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --
scene_heading: 25 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 25
text: Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her
dialog: robe and slippers).
dialog: 35.
scene_heading: 26 INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT 26
text: Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is
text: kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO
text: BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf.
text: Kate sets the bottles on the counter. *
text: The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate
dialog: with pity.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: You know I can't sell you this,
dialog: Kate.
text: An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at
dialog: Kate. *
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come
dialog: on -- I'm in here all the time. You
dialog: know me.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're
dialog: old enough -- but it's too late.
text: The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45).
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: C'mon -- we can just pretend it's
dialog: before two...
text: Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (not amused)
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's just a little wine. I'm not
dialog: driving or anything.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I don't think so. Sorry.
text: Kate gives him a big, flirty smile.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Come on, dude -- I'll let you have
dialog: a sip if you want.
text: Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: It's the law. I can't sell alcohol
dialog: after 2 a.m. You know that.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why don't you give it to me, then?
dialog: That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift
dialog: -- because we're friends.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I could lose my job.
text: Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at
text: the Elderly Man in the frozen food section. *
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to the elderly man; meant
dialog: to be a whisper, but way
dialog: too loud)
dialog: You distract him, okay?!
text: The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Look -- why don't you get a bottle
dialog: of water or a coffee or something
dialog: instead?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Water or coffee? Fuck you. What --
dialog: just cause I won't suck your dick?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (had enough)
dialog: Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you
dialog: gotta go.
text: Kate doesn't budge.
speaker_heading: CLERK (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously, Kate. You should go.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
text: Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with
dialog: tears.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is bullshit!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I have to pee.
dialog: 37.
text: Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door -
text: - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down
text: and begins to pull up her robe.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: What the fuck are you doing?!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (caught)
dialog: I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just
dialog: have to pee really, really bad. *
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Get outta here NOW!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (pleads)
dialog: C'mon...can't we drink together?
text: The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned,
dialog: and then...
text: ...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN 27
text: Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles
text: River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her.
text: Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.
text: A bird SQUAWKS.
text: Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state
text: she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.
scene_heading: 28 INT. KATE &amp; CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING 28
text: Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the
text: sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and
dialog: realizes that --
dialog: -- it's 7:30.
text: She jumps out of bed in a panic.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie!
text: Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down
dialog: at the bed, which is --
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: -- COMPLETELY SOAKED.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: (mumbled)
dialog: Not again.
text: Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of
dialog: the bed.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come back to bed, baby.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I have to go to work. You snoozed
dialog: my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, you peed on me so I guess *
dialog: we're even. *
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I have a weak bladder.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well...I can't go to work like
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You work from our kitchen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, but changing the sheets is my
dialog: real job.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey -- where were you last night?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you
dialog: were gone.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone?
dialog: You must've been dreaming.
text: Kate then glances down and notices --
text: -- that HER FEET ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND GRASS.

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: ANGELA

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: There won't be another time.

speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)

dialog: little groups.
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Maybe that would be good...I don't

text: Charlie goes silent.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing -- I just...I didn't think

dialog: sounded like you hated it. So I'm
dialog: kinda surprised you're going back.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well...this is a smaller meeting.

speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Does everybody just...kinda, you
dialog: know -- talk here?
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells
dialog: their story. And then everyone else
dialog: shares -- talks.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So since you're taking me here does
dialog: that make you my sponsor?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: No -- I don't think I could do *

dialog: Now I pay my bills online.
text: The group CHUCKLES.
speaker_heading: JENNY (CONT'D) *
dialog: And I found a love in cooking. I've *
dialog: got my own catering business now. *

dialog: cigarettes, but still...it's been
dialog: years since I woke up in a park --
dialog: in a different state.
speaker_heading: LAUGHTER.

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES
dialog: Sponsor potential?

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: entertaining.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Kate. This is my first meeting.
dialog: Or... first meeting where I'm not
dialog: wasted.

speaker_heading: JENNY *
dialog: Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some
dialog: of that.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't really know how this stuff
dialog: works.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: But...could I get your number? I
dialog: mean, I may not need it, but...
speaker_heading: JENNY *
dialog: Yeah, of course. I can help explain
dialog: it to you -- and also, we can just
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay. Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've been sober since you were
dialog: 24?
dialog: Jenny nods. *
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: That seems really young.
speaker_heading: JENNY *
dialog: I didn't have much of a choice -- I
dialog: crashed my car into a nursing home.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think the break is just about
dialog: over. This meeting is the kind
dialog: where everyone can share. Sharing
dialog: always helps me, so...if it's not
dialog: too weird -- try introducing
dialog: yourself and telling the group
dialog: what's going on.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman (TINA) next *
text: to Kate is finishing up.
speaker_heading: TINA *

speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: Hi, Kate.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sorry. I don't mean to laugh --
dialog: it's just saying those words...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I
dialog: don't really know. I drink -- a
dialog: lot. I've always drank. Everyone I
dialog: know drinks a lot. I never really
dialog: thought I had a problem -- lately
dialog: though it seems like maybe I do. I
dialog: just want to be able to drink a
dialog: beer without it turning into twenty
dialog: -- or wetting my bed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It seems like every time I drink
dialog: something awful happens. All the
dialog: shit that I used to laugh off isn't

dialog: And then there's my marriage. I
dialog: mean, Charlie's great. Really
dialog: great, he's supportive, especially

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Um...I think I should go alone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Come on, if you do that you'll just

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, if you go, don't take this

speaker_heading: ROCHELLE (O.S.)

dialog: Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna
dialog: be a grandma!
dialog: (to Charlie)
dialog: And you know that "no drinking when
dialog: you're pregnant" thing is just a
dialog: myth. I drank plenty when I was

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm not pregnant, mom.
speaker_heading: ROCHELLE
dialog: Oh.

speaker_heading: ROCHELLE
dialog: Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: This place shut down a decade ago
dialog: and then there was a fire and now

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: We came here every year the week

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)

text: Kate points at the remains of a PEN.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)

dialog: Thanks for coming up here with me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm sorry my mom's so awful.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: She just can't handle her liquor.
text: Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you ever hook up with guys when
dialog: you worked here?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know -- sneak off with a co-
dialog: worker and do it against a pine
dialog: tree or something?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Um...no.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I mean, if I were a teenage boy
dialog: working with a stone cold fox like
dialog: you I'd totally want to hook up
dialog: with you here. Like...in the ginger
dialog: bread house.
text: Charlie puts his arms around Kate.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MR. DAVIES

dialog: God, Kate -- come on. What else
dialog: were you supposed to do?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, I feel like a piece of shit
dialog: for lying.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is
dialog: this what those meetings teach you?
dialog: To make drama out of nothing?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's not nothing. I lied to little
dialog: kids and to my boss because I can't
dialog: take responsibility for my actions.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why don't you go and tell the
dialog: Principal that you were never
dialog: pregnant? That the reason you puked
dialog: is because you smoked crack all
dialog: night? Would you feel better about
dialog: yourself then?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I've been thinking about doing
dialog: that, actually.
dialog: (thinks about it)
dialog: Yeah. I think I would feel better

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fine. Do it, then. I guess you

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I could be like you -- I could stay

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: I never do anything responsible?
dialog: What about buying this house that

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Having rich parents doesn't make

text: Charlie looks stunned. *
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What the fuck is that supposed to

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I wouldn't care if we struggled

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What the fuck are you talking

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I fucking hate AA! It turned you

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: At least I'm not drunk all the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah, you don't drink booze for

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to

dialog: You're different and maybe it's

dialog: I'm bad and bad for you or
dialog: something -- because I didn't think
dialog: the person you were before was so
dialog: awful. I loved that person. Yeah,
dialog: she drank a lot and she did some
dialog: silly things...but she was my Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You loved that person? Do you not

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I freaked out -- a student asked

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BARNES
dialog: I'm not angry with you -- but I

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know. And when that happened I

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BARNES
dialog: Oh, my god -- are you really ill?
dialog: Is it cancer?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, well, yes. I have a disease,

text: Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BARNES
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I've been working on it. I'm one-

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BARNES
dialog: You vomited in front of children
dialog: because you were hung over?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BARNES
dialog: And lied, saying that you were

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BARNES
dialog: I threw you a baby shower.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm really sorry. I am. I've been

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BARNES

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I've heard that your best day
dialog: drinking is worse than your worst
dialog: day sober.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well...that is SO not true! I had
dialog: amazing times drinking, dancing,
dialog: and laughing...feeling like the
dialog: most adorable, charming girl in the
dialog: world. And I was adorable.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'd piss my pants, but I was still

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: When I first tried getting sober, I
dialog: figured that as long as I didn't
dialog: drink...everything else would just
dialog: magically work out. But it didn't.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My marriage fell apart. I got fired
dialog: from my job. And that shit happened
dialog: SOBER! I never read that in any
dialog: pamphlet...
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: ...that isn't what I signed up for.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty
dialog: slogan I've heard in the rooms is
dialog: that when you're sober for a bit
dialog: and drink again "the disease waits
dialog: for you, picks up where it left
dialog: off."
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE
dialog: those slogans. They all sound like
dialog: bumper stickers. But, I have to
dialog: admit...for me, that last one is
dialog: pretty damn true.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When I drink...I become another
dialog: person. And that person is a pretty
dialog: big asshole. Well, unless you want
dialog: to give me drugs or buy me drinks --
dialog: then that person is awesome.
text: People knowingly LAUGH.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I wasn't happy being the "good-time

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: My life is really different than it

dialog: my friends in here who took the
dialog: time to help me and give a shit
dialog: about me.

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: I was in North Carolina for a while *
dialog: -- Durham -- playing minor league

dialog: when I met Crash, here.
dialog: (gestures to Charlie)
dialog: He'd been sent down to single-A to
dialog: teach me how to carry myself as a
dialog: pro ball-player. We got involved

speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: "Bull"...something? What is it?

speaker_heading: MILLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatever. It'll come to me.

dialog: So...what do you do now, Crash?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I write about music.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Really?
text: Owen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of
dialog: magazines. But print really is
dialog: dead. So now most of my stuff winds
dialog: up on websites. Which is
dialog: depressing. `Cause you can't hold
dialog: it -- you can just look at it. It's
dialog: like...
text: Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence.
text: Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You were talking about writing for
dialog: websites and you kinda trailed off,
dialog: honey.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (trying to save the
dialog: situation)
dialog: So, Crash -- why don't you tell

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It was crazy. I...

speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: He rides a bicycle?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Oh, yeah --
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: -- as a teenager, he was a bike
dialog: racing champion growing up in
dialog: Bloomington, Indiana. He and his
dialog: friends were called the "Cutters" --

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No.
text: Charlie seems relieved.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Me either. Owen keeps trying to get
dialog: me to be his "wing-man" and it's
dialog: ridiculous and these girls in bars
dialog: are so lame and I just keep
dialog: thinking how I wish I was meeting
dialog: you in a bar for the first time and

dialog: even want to look me in the eyes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie, please don't do this.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I miss you. I miss the way you
dialog: taste and smell and...I miss things
dialog: about you that used to drive me
dialog: nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's
dialog: music and fake punk-rock from the
dialog: 90's...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't like shitty 80's music.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I like good 80's music.
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ...and all I want to do is touch
dialog: you one more time to just, remember
dialog: -- to make sure it was real.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: When did you last eat?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Should we order something?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sure, yeah -- or I could make a
dialog: bacon and egg sandwich...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't know. I haven't really been
dialog: doing the meat thing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then
dialog: meat.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Have you given up fun, too?
text: Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she
dialog: finds him funny.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (off Kate)
dialog: Sorry. Bad joke.
text: Kate cracks a smile.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But
dialog: I'm gonna make them.
text: Charlie raises his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: LATER

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I haven't played in over a year.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

dialog: I've been masturbating like crazy.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Charlie --
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I miss you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Stop it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay. Fine.

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But I wasn't.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: But is that really the point?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What are trying to say?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I worry about you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah, I can understand that. I used
dialog: to worry about you. But now I know
dialog: you're okay.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That makes me happy...I mean, it
dialog: fucking sucks that you're better
dialog: off without me but I'm glad you're
dialog: doing well.
dialog: No reply from Kate.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you move back in if I came to
dialog: meetings?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You should go for yourself, not to
dialog: make me happy.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But, would you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'm not moving back in.
dialog: That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, I should go. It's gonna get

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: We can always turn the lights on.
speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: Beat.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So, would you at least...let me

speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
dialog: (new direction)
dialog: Last question: can we just...play
dialog: one more game?
text: Kate doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon...you keep kicking my ass.
dialog: It's embarrassing. You've gotta
dialog: give me a chance to redeem myself.
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Please.
text: Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...
text: ...but she also doesn't say no.
