speaker_heading: BLACK
text: No image. A bleak WIND MOANS. HOLD.
dialog: With a STINGING CHORD we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958)
text: Lights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS.
text: After a beat, the voice of an elderly black man:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: The's right... New York.
text: We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets
text: far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling
text: snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING.
text: We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers
text: slip by left and right.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo'
dialog: minutes it is. Come midnight it's
dialog: gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother
dialog: feelin'. The New Year. The future...
text: The SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is
dialog: "Auld Lang Syne."
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to
dialog: start one mo' trip 'round the sun,
dialog: an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round
dialog: be a little mo' giddy, a little mo'
dialog: gay...
text: We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top
text: is a large illuminated clock.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Yep...
text: We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...All over town champagne corks is
dialog: a-poppin'.
text: A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...Over in the Waldorf the big shots
dialog: is dancin' to the strains of Guy
text: Lombardo... Down in Times Square the
dialog: little folks is a-watchin' and a-
dialog: waitin' fo' that big ball to drop...
text: The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant
dialog: CROWD: "Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!"
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...They all tryin' to catch holt a
dialog: one moment of time...
text: The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the
text: WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we
text: begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads
text: a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name:
text: "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES." Below it, in neon, the company's
text: motto: "THE FUTURE IS NOW."
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...to be able to say -- 'Right now!
dialog: This is it! I got it!' 'Course by
dialog: then it'll be past.
dialog: (more cheerfully)
dialog: But they all happy, evvybody havin'
dialog: a good time.
text: We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the
text: clock. The window starts to open.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...Well, almost evvybody. They's a
dialog: few lost souls floatin' 'round out
dialog: there...
text: A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge.
text: With the opening of the window, "AULD LANG SYNE" filters out
dialog: with greater volume.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...This one's Norville Barnes.
text: The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps
text: in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on
text: the apron: "HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now."
text: He looks with nervous determination into the void.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...Let's move in for a closer look.
text: The CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...That office he jes stepped out of
dialog: is the office of the president of
dialog: Hudsucker Industries. It's his
dialog: office...
text: Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows
text: louder and the WIND blows in his face.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...How'd he get so high? An' why is
dialog: he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna
dialog: do it -- is Norville really gonna
dialog: jelly up the sidewalk?
text: Norville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge,
text: preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the
text: CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME.
text: We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL
text: THRUM becomes very loud indeed.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...Well the future, that's something
dialog: you can't never tell about...
text: The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare
text: seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES
dialog: UP: "Nine! Eight! Seven!"
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...But the past... That's another
dialog: story...
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK
text: The HUM of the CLOCK SINKS UNDER the HISS of an AIRBRAKE and
dialog: GRINDING GEARS as we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: DESTINATION DISPLAY
text: On the front of a bus just rocking to a halt. The display
text: says "MUNCIE-NEW YORK."
speaker_heading: LINE OF BAGS
text: is being set out on the pavement. A man with the cuffs of a
text: redcap uniform swings one into the f.g.:
text: It has a sticker on it: CLASS OF '58, and below an
text: illustration of crossed right and left hands, their thumbs
text: hooked and fingers spread like wings: MUNCIE COLLEGE OF
scene_heading: BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.
text: After a beat the hand of its claimant ENTERS to pick it up.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: STREET
text: FOLLOWING the bag as its owner carries it down the street.
text: He pauses, sets it down.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
text: Fresh-faced, eager -- NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at:
scene_heading: WESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY
text: The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock
text: shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture
dialog: window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures
text: board in a great train station, with each of its individual
text: entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new
text: opportunity. On offer are jobs like: PASTRY CHEF, STEAMFITTER,
scene_heading: LAY-OUT MAN, GRAVEDIGGER, etc.
speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the
dialog: board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and
text: vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug
text: into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads,
text: bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering
text: board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a
dialog: prospect they like.
text: Norville stands pat, watching.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: He brightens.
speaker_heading: BOARD
text: We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: He frowns.
text: Around him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply
dialog: for their respective jobs.
scene_heading: We see other entries: JUNIOR EXECUTIVE. PAN TO EXPERIENCE
scene_heading: ONLY. EXECUTIVE MANAGER... MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE.
scene_heading: BUSINESSMAN... EXPERIENCED.
text: The CROSS-CUTTING ENDS in a wash of SUPER-IMPOSITIONS PANNING
text: OVER Norviille, now alone on the sidewalk:
scene_heading: EXPERIENCED ONLY... EXPERIENCED... EXPERIENCED...
scene_heading: EXPERIENCED...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - EXECUTIVE
text: A middle-aged, mousy-looking man in a conservative suit and
text: wire-rimmed spectacles is addressing his remarks to someone
text: O.S. Behind the Executive we see only the skyline of New
dialog: York City.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: -- So in the third quarter we saw no
dialog: signs of weakening. We're up 18
dialog: percent over last year's third quarter
dialog: gross and, needless to say, that's a
dialog: new record...
speaker_heading: TRACKING
text: DOWN the LENGTH OF the board room table. Executives line
text: either side. We are APPROACHING the man at the far end of
text: the table, to whom the report is being directed.
text: He is late middle-aged, dressed expensively but
text: conservatively, his attention smilingly fixed on the Executive
text: who drones on.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: ...The competition continues to flag
dialog: and we continue to take up the slack.
dialog: Market share in most divisions is
dialog: increasing and we've opened seven
dialog: new regional offices...
text: The TRACK has ENDED IN a CLOSEUP of the man at the end of
text: the table, who still smiles benignantly at the droning
text: Executive. The smile is serene, almost otherwordly.
text: This is WARING HUDSUCKER.
speaker_heading: REPORTING EXECUTIVE
text: He drones on.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: ...Our international division has
dialog: also shown vigorous upward movement
dialog: in the past six months and we're
dialog: looking at some exciting things in
dialog: R&amp;D...
text: The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OFF the droning Executive as the big
text: man's attention apparently wanders; we FRAME UP ON the picture
text: window skyline of New York.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
dialog: Sub-franchising. Don't talk to me
dialog: about sub-franchising; we're making
dialog: so much money in sub-franchising it
dialog: isn't even funny.
scene_heading: FOLDED-BACK WANT ADS
text: A hand with pencil goes down a list of positions, ticking
scene_heading: each one: STREETSWEEPER -- EXPERIENCED; LINOTYPE MAN --
scene_heading: EXPERIENCED; CANTOR (REFORM) -- EXPERIENCED; SPARRING PARTNER --
scene_heading: EXPERIENCED.
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil
text: down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm.
text: His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs
text: his coffee with his spoon.
text: He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down
text: on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change,
text: turning it inside-out.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON COUNTER
text: As Norville puts all his change on the counter. His hand
text: hesitates; he takes a little of it back. He LEAVES FRAME.
text: A waitress's hand ENTERS from the far side of the counter.
text: She clears away the saucer, then the cup -- which has been
text: resting on the want ads. It leaves a perfect brown circle
dialog: around one entry:
text: THE FUTURE IS NOW.
dialog: Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries.
dialog: Low pay. Long Hours.
scene_heading: NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY.
dialog: Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue.
text: As we hear the COFFEESHOP DOOR OPENING O.S., a draft wafts
text: the sheet of newspaper off the counter and OUT OF FRAME.
scene_heading: NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE
text: Again LOOKING THROUGH the WINDOW as, O.S., the reporting
text: Executive drones on.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...Our owned-and-operateds are
dialog: performing far above expectations
dialog: both here and abroad, and the Federal
dialog: Tax Act of 1958 is giving us a swell
dialog: writeoff on our plant and heavies...
speaker_heading: WARING HUDSUCKER
text: looks dreamily out the window. His attention returns to the
text: droning Executive and the benignant smile returns to his
dialog: lips.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: ...The news in the money market isn't
dialog: good -- it's excellent...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE'S BACK
text: He walks dejectedly down the street, hands shoved into his
dialog: pockets.
text: A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it
dialog: this way and that.
text: Slap! -- It plasters against another pedestrian, who bats it
dialog: away.
text: The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against
dialog: Norville.
text: He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops,
text: noticing something.
speaker_heading: NEWSPAPER SCRAP
text: It is a section of the want ads. One entry is perfectly
text: circled by a coffee stain.
text: BACK TO NORVILLE
text: He looks up from the paper. There is purpose in his gaze.
text: Wind whips his hair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - WARING HUDSUCKER
text: As the Executive drones on, O.S., Hudsucker is carefully
text: winding his wristwatch.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...Our nominees and assigns continue
dialog: to multiply and expand extending our
dialog: influence regionally, nationally and
dialog: globally. So, third quarter and year-
dialog: to-date, we've set a new record for
dialog: sales...
text: Hudsucker looks up from his watch, smiles, runs his palms
text: back over his fringe of hair.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...new record in gross...
text: Hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right
dialog: amount under the suit.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...new record in pre-tax earnings...
text: Hudsucker takes one puff from his cigar and carefully sets
text: it in his ashtray.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...new record in after-tax profit...
text: He deliberately unstraps his wristwatch and looks at its
dialog: face.
text: The sweep second hand is starting the last revolution that
dialog: will end at precisely noon.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...and our stock has split twice
dialog: this year...
text: Hudsucker lays the watch carefully on the table.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
dialog: ...In short...
text: Savoring a pause, the Executive looks around the board table.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: ...we're loaded.
text: This draws an appreciative chuckle from the board. It is cut
dialog: off by:
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Ahem...
text: The board turns expectantly to Hudsucker, who sits in the
text: f.g. Beyond him is the length of the board table and the
text: large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and
text: deliberately, and rubs his palms together.
text: He swings his chair out.
text: He steps up onto the chair.
text: The board stares.
text: He steps up from the chair onto the board table.
text: The heads of the board members swing up in unison.
text: Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension
text: loose from each leg, then waggles both arms dangling at his
text: sides, like an athlete preparing for a sprint.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: ...Mr. Hudsucker?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON WANT ADS
speaker_heading: THE CIRCLED AD
text: THE FUTURE IS NOW.
dialog: Start building yours at Hudsucker Industries.
dialog: Low pay. Long Hours.
scene_heading: NO EXPERIENCED NECESSARY.
dialog: Apply Personnel, 285 Madison Avenue.
text: The hand holding the paper DROPS AWAY and we TILT UP, as
text: Norville walks AWAY FROM us into the b.g., towards the office
text: building across the street. Its street number tops its
text: imposing entryway in large gilt letters: 285.
text: We continue TILTING UP the length of the skyscraper, to reveal
text: a huge clock capping its facade. Above the clock is the
text: identification "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES." Below the clock is
text: the motto "THE FUTURE IS NOW."
text: The huge clock's sweep second hand is just approaching the
text: position that will make the time 12:00 sharp.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: As the second hand hits the twelve, the CLOCK TOLLS, the
text: board room WINDOW SHATTERS and Waring Hudsucker comes flying
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh...
speaker_heading: SECRETARIAL AREA
text: Somewhere in the Hudsucker Building. A secretary sits typing
text: next to an open window, finished pages sitting stacked beside
text: her. As we hear ANOTHER TOLL of the CLOCK.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh...
text: As Hudsucker shoots past the window, his draft sends the
text: stack of papers wafting this way and that. As the secretary
text: turns to look out the window, FREEZE FRAME (wafting papers
text: have their motion arrested) and SUPER A TITLE.
speaker_heading: TRACKING
text: WITH Hudsucker, the building slipping by behind him. As he
text: yells he calmly runs his palms back over his fringe of hair.
text: The CLOCK TOLLS.
text: FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.
speaker_heading: HOT DOG VENDOR
text: on the street, handing a steaming frank to a customer who is
text: handing him some change. As we hear the APPROACHING HUDSUCKER,
text: both men look up. As the CLOCK TOLLS:
text: FREEZE FRAME and SUPER A TITLE.
scene_heading: PASSERBY ON SIDEWALK
text: The man, wearing a fedora, is in the f.g. of an EXTREME LOW
text: ANGLE whose b.g. is the bottom three or four stories of the
dialog: Hudsucker Building.
text: The passerby reacts to the approaching yell, looking up just
text: as Hudsucker ENTERS FRAME.
text: FREEZE FRAME to suspend Hudsucker a good twenty feet above
text: the sidewalk, arms and legs splayed, comically arrested. The
text: passerby is frozen in an attitude of surprise and disbelief.
text: SUPER the title of the film: THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.
text: UNFREEZE to send Hudsucker plummeting THROUGH the FRAME to
text: his rendezvous with the sidewalk, BELOW FRAME.
speaker_heading: DUTCH ANGLE
text: The Hudsucker Building lists up into the distance. A woman
text: in a fancy fruited hat with a black veil rises INTO FRAME AT
text: an OPPOSING SLANT. Looking down at the sidewalk, she sends
text: two dismayed hands to her cheek and screeeeeeeeeams.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOP FLOOR
text: With the LAST TOLL of the CLOCK punctuating the CUT, we are
text: FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window.
text: The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING,
text: MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN.
text: THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting
text: around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and
text: disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g.
text: At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and
text: oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray.
text: There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak
dialog: table.
text: One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to
text: his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to
text: his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from
text: his nose.
text: We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.
text: SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle-
text: aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a
text: commanding presence.
text: He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his
text: knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in.
text: The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members'
text: heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately
text: for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader.
text: Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers.
text: Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair.
text: He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's
dialog: ashtray.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Pity to waste a whole Monte Cristo.
text: The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.
speaker_heading: AN EXECUTIVE
text: He could've opened the window.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
dialog: Waring Hudsucker never did anything
dialog: the easy way.
speaker_heading: ADDISON
dialog: My God, why?! Why did he do it?!
dialog: Things were going so well!
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the
dialog: man was unhappy.
speaker_heading: ADDISON
dialog: He didn't look unhappy!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Yeah, well, he didn't look rich.
speaker_heading: ELDERY EXECUTIVE
dialog: Waring Hudsucker was never an easy
dialog: man to figure out.
dialog: (reminiscing)
dialog: He built this company with his bare
dialog: hands. Every step he took was a step
dialog: up. Except of course this last one.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Sure, sure, he was a swell guy, but
dialog: when the president, chairman of the
dialog: board and holder of eighty-seven
dialog: percent of the company's stock drops
dialog: forty-four floors --
speaker_heading: PRECISE EXECUTIVE
dialog: Forty-five --
speaker_heading: ELDERY EXECUTIVE
dialog: Counting the mezzanine --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: -- Then the company has a problem.
dialog: Stillson, what exactly is the
dialog: disposition of Waring's stock?
speaker_heading: STILLSON
dialog: Well, as you know, Hud left no will
dialog: and had no family. The company bylaws
dialog: are quite clear in that event. His
dialog: entire portfolio will be converted
dialog: to common stock and will be sold
text: over the counter as of the first of
dialog: the fiscal year following his demise.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: STILLSON
dialog: Meaning simply that Waring's stock,
dialog: and control of the company, will be
dialog: available to the public on January
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: You mean to tell me that any slob in
dialog: a smelly T-shirt will be able to buy
dialog: Hudsucker stock?
text: Stillson shrugs.
speaker_heading: STILLSON
dialog: The company bylaws are quite clear.
speaker_heading: ADDISON
dialog: My God! You're animals! How can you
dialog: discuss his stock when the man has
dialog: just leapt forty-five floors --
speaker_heading: PRECISE EXECUTIVE
dialog: Forty-four --
speaker_heading: ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
dialog: -- Not counting the mezzanine.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Quit showboating, Addison, the man
dialog: is gone. The question now is whether
dialog: we're going to let John Q. Public
dialog: waltz in and buy 87 percent of our
dialog: company.
scene_heading: PIPE-SMOKING EXECUTIVE
dialog: What're you suggesting, Sidney?
dialog: Certainly we can't afford to buy a
dialog: controlling interest.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Not while the stock is this strong.
dialog: How long before Hud's paper hits the
dialog: market?
speaker_heading: STILLSON
dialog: January first.
speaker_heading: AN EXECUTIVE
dialog: Thirty days.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
dialog: Four weeks.
speaker_heading: ADDISON
dialog: A month at the most.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: One month to make the blue-chip
dialog: investment of the century look like
text: a round-trip ticket on the Titanic.
speaker_heading: AN EXECUTIVE
text: We play up the fact that Hud is dead.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Long live the Hud!!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
dialog: We depress the stock --
scene_heading: YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
dialog: -- to the point where we can buy
dialog: fifty-percent.
speaker_heading: PRECISE EXECUTIVE
dialog: Fifty-one.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
dialog: Not counting the mezzanine.
speaker_heading: CAUTIOUS EXECUTIVE
dialog: It could work.
speaker_heading: OPTIMISTIC EXECUTIVE
dialog: It should work.
speaker_heading: PRACTICAL EXECUTIVE
dialog: It would work.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: (at ticker tape machine)
dialog: It's working already. Waring Hudsucker
text: is abstract art on Madison Avenue.
dialog: All we need now is a new president
dialog: who will inspire real panic in our
dialog: stockholders.
speaker_heading: ENTHUSIASTIC EXECUTIVE
dialog: Yeah, a puppet!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
dialog: A proxy!
scene_heading: YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE
dialog: A pawn!
text: Mussburger strides across the room from the still CHATTERING
text: TICKER TAPE MACHINE and lowers himself into Waring Hudsucker's
text: chair. He takes a last puff from his cigar and slowly exhales
text: a cloud of smoke.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Sure, sure. Some jerk we can really
dialog: push around.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SWINGING STEEL DOORS
text: that read, "MAILROOM." They burst open as Norville, who wears
text: a mail clerk's leather apron, imprinted: HUDSUCKER
text: MAILROOM/The Future is Now. The hellish mailroom is criss-
text: crossed by pipes that emit HISSING jets of STEAM.
text: As he wheels a piled-high mail cart down the aisle, Norville
text: is accompanied by an orientation AGENT who bellows at him
text: over the clamor and roar of many men laboring in the bowels
dialog: of a great corporation.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: You punch in at 8:30 every morning
dialog: except you punch in at 7:30 following
dialog: a business holiday unless it's a
dialog: Monday and then you punch in at eight
dialog: o'clock! You punch in at 7:45
dialog: whenever we work extended day and
dialog: you punch out at the regular time
dialog: unless you've worked through lunch!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE

speaker_heading: AGENT

text: People on either side bellow at Norville and stuff envelopes

speaker_heading: FIRST SCREAMER
dialog: This goes to seven! Mr. Mutuszak!

speaker_heading: FOURTH SCREAMER

text: DON'T COME BACK DOWN HERE WITHOUT A
dialog: SIGNED WAIVER!!
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Inter-office mail is code 37! INTRA-

dialog: they dock ya!
speaker_heading: FIFTH SCREAMER
dialog: I was supposed to have this on twenty-
dialog: eight ten minutes ago! Cover for me!
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: This has been your orientation! Is
dialog: there anything you do not understand?
dialog: Is there anything you understand
dialog: only partially? If you have not been
dialog: fully oriented -- if there is
dialog: something you do not understand in
dialog: all of its particulars you must file
dialog: a complaint with personnel! File a
dialog: faulty complaint... and they dock
dialog: ya!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: (muttering to himself)
dialog: ...Bring it down to fif(?)...
dialog: fifteen... sign the voucher, uh,
dialog: waiver... cover for Mr. Anatole...
dialog: he's a swell guy... Morgatross...
dialog: He was on, uh...
text: He is COASTING ACROSS the "K" mail slots, finally COMES TO
text: Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max
text: Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others.
dialog: The envelope will not fit in.
text: He frowns.
text: He is about to fold the envelope, but notices something
text: stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD.
text: Norville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see
text: envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in

text: An old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail.
text: Without ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed
text: back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking
text: pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his
dialog: left hand.
scene_heading: ANCIENT SORTER'S SHELF
text: As his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: He raises his voice over the mailroom din:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Say, what do you do when the envelope
dialog: is too big for the slot?
text: The ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking
dialog: his mail.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: Well... if ya fold 'em, they fire
dialog: ya...
text: Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: ...I usually throw 'em out.
text: Norville takes out a pencil and writes on the face of the
dialog: envelope:
speaker_heading: INSERT - LETTER
dialog: Dear Mr. Kloppit, Please give this letter to your son. Thank
dialog: you, Norville Barnes.
dialog: After a moment he adds:
dialog: Your friend in the mailroom.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: (talking as he writes)
dialog: Just got hired today!
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: Terrific.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Ya know, entry level!
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: Tell me about it.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I got big ideas, though!
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: I'm sure you do.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: For instance, take a look at this
dialog: sweet baby...
text: Norville is taking an envelope from his pocket and handing
dialog: it to the Ancient Sorter.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...you look like you can keep a
dialog: secret...
text: The Ancient Sorter is pulling a ragged piece of paper from
text: the envelope. On the paper is a crudely-drawn circle.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Something I developed myself.
dialog: Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs.
text: The Ancient Sorter looks questioningly from the circle to
dialog: Norville.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: (explains)
dialog: ...You know, for kids!
text: The Ancient Sorter nods with feigned understanding as Norville
text: takes the paper back.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: Terrific.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
text: He resumes his sorting.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: How long've you been down here?
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: Forty-eight years...
dialog: Whisk. Whisk.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: ...Next year they move me up to
dialog: parcels...
text: Whisk. Whisk. Whisk.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: ...If I'm lucky.
text: A BELL CLANGS.
text: The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM SPUTTERS to life.
speaker_heading: PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
dialog: Attention Hudsucker employees. We
dialog: regretfully announce that at 12:01
dialog: this afternoon, Hudsucker time, Waring
dialog: Hudsucker, Founder, President, and
dialog: Chairman of the Board of Hudsucker
dialog: Industries, merged with the infinite.
dialog: To mark this occasion of corporate
dialog: loss, we ask that all employees
dialog: observe a moment of silent
text: contemplation.
text: All HUBBUB ABRUPTLY STOPS and the sounds of HEAVY MACHINERY,
text: HISSING STEAM PIPES, and GENERATORS WIND DOWN TO leave total
text: SILENCE. After a moment:
speaker_heading: PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
dialog: ...Thank you for your kind attention.
dialog: This moment has been duly-noted on
dialog: your time cards and will be deducted
dialog: from your pay. That is all.
text: The MACHINERY GROANS back INTO ACTION and the people return
dialog: to their jobs just as:
text: A STEAM WHISTLE SCREECHES.
text: ALARM BELLS go OFF.
scene_heading: From the PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM:
speaker_heading: PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM (V.O.)
dialog: 'Blue letter! Blue letter!'
text: The mail room is thrown into pandemonium.
speaker_heading: VARIOUS VOICES
dialog: Blue letter...! It's a blue letter...!
dialog: They're bringing down a blue letter!
text: One MAN spins to face the CAMERA, his hands pressed over his
text: ears. STEAM JETS and HISSES behind him.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Blue letter!!
dialog: Animated for the first time:
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
dialog: Jumpin' Jehosephat, a blue letter!
text: Mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept out of
text: the crowded aisle to form a clear path running down to an
dialog: elevator in the b.g.
text: With a SIREN SOUND, a light above the elevator goes on.
text: The elevator door sweeps open. It reveals a wall into which
text: a four-foot high hinged door is set.
text: This door swings open and an old dwarf emerges: Old man
text: HUTCHINSON, the boss of the mailroom. He emerges from the
text: blinding light of the interior of the elevator.
text: He is holding aloft a letter.
text: He takes loping drawf strides down the aisle.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - LETTER
text: TRACKING ON letter as Hutchinson bears it along. In the b.g.,
text: the faces that the letter passes are agog.
text: CROSSCUT the approaching blue letter WITH: Norville and the
dialog: Ancient Sorter.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
text: The Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT SORTER
text: It's a blue letter... top, top
dialog: level... confidential communication
dialog: between the brass... usually bad
dialog: news... they hate blue letters
dialog: upstairs... Hate 'em!
text: Norville gulps.
speaker_heading: HUTCHINSON
dialog: You!
text: Norville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has
dialog: disappeared.
speaker_heading: HUTCHINSON
dialog: ...Yeah, you! Barnes!
text: As he points, the people around Norville shrink away.
speaker_heading: HUTCHINSON
dialog: ...You don't look busy! Think you
dialog: can handle a blue letter?
dialog: (laughs sadistically)
dialog: ...This letter was sent down this
dialog: morning by the big guy himself! 'At's
dialog: right, Waring Hudsucker! It's
dialog: addressed to Sid Mussburger!
dialog: Hudsucker's right-hand man! It's a
dialog: blue letter! That means you put it
text: right in Mussburger's hand. No
dialog: secretaries! No receptionists! No
dialog: colleagues! No excuses!
text: DRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts
text: the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it
text: with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we
text: are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face.
scene_heading: COMPLEMENTARY TIGHT DUTCH ANGLE ON HUTCHINSON
text: We can see the veins in his eyes, the veins in his nose, the
text: hairs in his ears.
speaker_heading: HUTCHINSON
dialog: Mussburger!!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR DOORS
text: ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator
text: who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform,
text: white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched
text: onto his breast pocket.
text: As Norville enters the elevators:
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Hiya, buddy! The name is Buzz, I got
dialog: the fuzz...
text: He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then
text: lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...I make the elevator do what she
dialog: duzz!
text: He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he
text: snaps it away and pats down his crewcut:
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...Hang it up to dry.
text: He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's
text: knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed
dialog: to it.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...What's your pleasure, buddy?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: (regaining his balance)
dialog: Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Forty-four, the top brass floor say,
dialog: buddy! What takes fifty years to get
text: up to the top floor and thirty seconds
dialog: to get down?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I --
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!
dialog: Say, buddy!
text: With a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator
text: to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia,
text: painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator.
text: Buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Mr. Kline, up to nine. Mrs. Dell,
dialog: personnel. Mr. Levin, thirty-seven.
speaker_heading: MR. LEVIN
dialog: Thirty-six.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Walk down. Ladies and gentlemen,
dialog: step to the rear; here comes
text: gargantuan Mr. Grier.
text: An obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar:
speaker_heading: FAT MAN
dialog: Buzz.
text: Buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator
text: into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks
text: only a little under the G-force.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid
dialog: businessman on the street?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, I --
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha!
dialog: Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk
dialog: fully dressed? When it's 'wearing'
dialog: Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
text: He turns to look at Norville.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...Ya get it, buddy, it's a pun,
dialog: it's a knee-slapper, it's a play on
dialog: Jesus, Joseph and Mary, is that a
dialog: blue letter?!
text: All heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those
text: near Norville shrink away.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...Cripes a'mighty, whyn't ya tell a
dialog: guy?! Hold on, folks, we're express
dialog: to the top floor!
text: The ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR DOORS
text: Sweeping open. Norville staggers out.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: Good luck, buddy!
text: The door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around.
text: Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: -- You'll need it!
text: The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES SCREAM
text: as it power-dives away.
text: Norville turns toward the executive offices.
text: Plush, thick-carpeted silence.
text: Norville starts walking.
text: A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive
text: quiet. Norville looks to one side.
text: A workman in painter's overalls squats in front of a pair of
text: heavy oak doors. With a razor blade he is scraping off the
text: name "WARING HUDSUCKER."
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Mr. Mussburger's office?
text: The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville.
text: With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction.
text: Norville enters the adjacent office.
speaker_heading: OUTER OFFICE
text: Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office.
text: The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the
text: f.g., her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder,
text: as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious
text: sneer which stays pasted on throughout.
text: The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated behind
text: a desk in the b.g. that flanks the door to Mussburger's
text: private office. The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped
text: on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered
text: down-from-under look of a patient vulture.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Do you have an appointment?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Uhh, no, I --
text: The filing secretary sneers.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Shall we look in the book, hmmmmmmmmm?
text: She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed crinkly
dialog: pages.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: No, ma'am, ya see, I wouldn't be in
dialog: the --
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
text: We don't seem to be in the boooook.
text: Norville is groping in his apron pocket.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: No, ma'am, ya see I don't have an --
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: If we had an appointment we'd be in
dialog: the booook.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I know but ya see I have this --
dialog: here it is, this letter --
text: A low, unearthly WAIL fills the room, the sound of a million
text: souls moaning in purgatory.
text: The Receptionist looks up.
text: FAST TRACK IN ON SNEERING FILE SECRETARY
text: who is no longer sneering. Her mouth is stretched wide as
text: she wails and her finger points...
scene_heading: FAST TRACK IN ON BLUE LETTER
text: that Norville holds innocently at his side.
text: BACK TO TRACK IN ON WAILING SECRETARY
text: As her wail becomes deafening and we TRACK INTO her mouth
dialog: and the SCREEN GOES BLACK and:
speaker_heading: CLICK
text: The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound
dialog: of a DOOR OPENING. We are:
scene_heading: INT. MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE
text: its door swinging open to admit Norville.
text: In the b.g., in the outer office, we can see the filing
text: secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag
text: draped across her forehead. The Receptionist is fanning her
text: with a towel.
text: The door closes behind Norville.
text: We hear a rhythmic CLICK-CLICK-CLICK and the HUM of
speaker_heading: VENTILATION.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE'S POV
text: Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which
text: is a large executive chair facing the window. From above the
text: back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up. A telephone cord
text: snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden from
text: us. On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large
text: swinging ball bearings. Click-click-click.
text: A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in the
text: far corner of the office.
text: A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the
text: Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES by
text: immediately outside the window, describing an arc that throws
text: a moving shadow across the office.
text: His BACK TO us, into the phone:
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: -- Sure sure, Parkinson's stupid but
dialog: he's ambitious, too hard to control...
text: He swivels around to face Norville, who stands deferentially
text: at the door. Still listening at the phone, Mussburger waves
dialog: Norville forward.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...No! Not McClanahan; sure he bungled
dialog: the Teleyard merger, but that means
dialog: he's got something to prove...
text: He covers the mouth piece.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Who let you in?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I --
dialog: Into the phone:
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Atwater? Tremendous. Except I fired
dialog: him last week --
text: The INTERCOM BUZZES fiercely.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
text: Mr. Bumstead is waiting downstairs.
text: Mussburger hits the intercom.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Tell him I'll be right there...
dialog: (looks at Norville)
dialog: Well, what is it?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I --
text: But Mussburger is listening to the TINNY VOICE issuing from
speaker_heading: the PHONE.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: You, maybe you're the company's
dialog: biggest moron. We can't use Morris,
dialog: he's been with us too long, he's a
dialog: nice guy, too many friends. Matter
dialog: of fact, why don't you fire him. No --
dialog: scratch that; I'll fire him.
dialog: (looks up at Norville)
dialog: ...Make it fast, make it fast.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: You --
text: The INTERCOM SQUAWKS.
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Mr. Bumstead is getting very --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: I'll be right there. Give him a
dialog: magazine.
dialog: (to Norville)
dialog: ...What're you, a mute?
text: The second PHONE on Mussburger's desk RINGS.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Yeah, how's the stock doing?
dialog: ...Bad, huh? Well it's not bad enough.
dialog: (into the first phone)
dialog: ...Look, chump, either you find me a
dialog: grade A ding-dong or you can tender
dialog: your key to the executive washroom.
dialog: (into the second phone)
dialog: And that goes double for you.
dialog: (into the first phone)
dialog: Ear-clay?
dialog: (into both phones)
dialog: Ood-gay!
dialog: (slams down both
dialog: phones, looks at
dialog: Norville)
dialog: This better be good. I'm in a bad
dialog: mood.
text: Norville clears his throat.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, sir. I've got something for
dialog: you from the mailroom, but first if
dialog: I could just take a minute or so
dialog: from your very busy time...
text: He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper
text: across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at
text: Norville, making no move to take the paper.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...to show you a, uh...
text: Norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger
text: will not take it. Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his
text: eyes are locked on Norville's. Mussburger smolders.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...a little something I've been
dialog: working on for the last two or three
dialog: years...
text: Mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look
text: at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at
dialog: Norville.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...You know, for kids! Which is
dialog: perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I
dialog: claim to be any great genius; like
dialog: they say, inspiration is 99 percent
dialog: perspiration, and in my case I'd say
dialog: it's at least twice that, but I gotta
dialog: tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this
dialog: sweet baby --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Wait a minute!
text: Sudden quiet.
text: With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings
text: abruptly stop.
text: As Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute
dialog: and paralyzed.
text: His eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk.
text: He stands toe-to-toe with Norville.
text: He thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves
text: reflexively back. Mussburger's nose is almost touching
text: Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying,
dialog: evaluating.
text: Finally he draws his head back.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Hmmm...
text: With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping
text: mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that
text: his teeth clench it.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Umm-hmm...
text: He steps back, eyes still on Norville.
text: He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair
text: behind the desk.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Siddown.
text: Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger,
text: looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Go ahead. Try it on.
text: Norville obeys, reluctantly, stiffly.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Put your feet up.
text: Norville is again reluctant.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Go ahead.
text: Norville obeys. Mussburger studies.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Hmmmm... Let's get to know one
dialog: another, shall we?
text: Norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing
text: from between his teeth. Mussburger seems to relax.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Let's chat!
dialog: (beams)
dialog: ...Man to man!
text: Norville beams.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...You weren't blessed with much...
text: He waves vaguely towards his head and searches for a
dialog: euphemism.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...education, were you?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, I'm a college graduate --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: All right, but you didn't excel in
dialog: your studies...?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, I made the dean's list.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: (worried)
dialog: Hmmm.
text: Norville sputters out some more cigar smoke.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: At the Muncie College of Business
dialog: Administration.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Sure, sure. And did your classmates
dialog: there call you 'jerk' or...
dialog: (searches again)
dialog: ...'schmoe'?
text: Norville shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'?
dialog: 'Lamebrain'?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Not even behind your back?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Sir! They voted me most likely to
dialog: succeed!
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: (curtly)
dialog: You're fired.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: But, sir! --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Get your feet off that desk.
text: As he struggles to comply:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Get out of my sight.
text: Norville, squinting against the cigar smoke, pulls the cigar
text: out of his mouth as he doubles forward, feet still up, groping
text: for a place to set down the cigar. He sets it blindly on a
text: loose stack of papers.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh my God, sir!
text: The top page radiates a circle of incipient flame from the
text: cigar's live end.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: You nitwit! I worked for three years
dialog: on this deal!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh my God, sir!
text: Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: I'll take care of it. Just get out!
text: Mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it
text: into a wastebasket. He pats the fingertips of one hand against
text: his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange
text: circle on the top sheet of the contract.
text: At the other end of the office, Norville is wrapping his
text: arms around the glass water tank, which he pulls off its
text: base. He runs back across the vast expanse of office toward
text: the desk, hugging the water tank whose WATER GLOOB-GLOOBS
text: out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees.
text: As he reaches the desk, the near-empty tank is now light
text: enough for him to hoist with one arm, which he does, and
text: cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water.
text: He tosses the TANK to the floor where --
text: CRASH -- it SHATTERS, and stands looking about for a place
text: to dump his handful of water.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed
dialog: the most sensitive deal of my career!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh my God, sir!
text: He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk,
text: which Mussburger cannot see.
text: It is sprouting flame, at which Norville ineffectually flecks
text: his remaining drops of water.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Now out of here! Out!
text: Norville is already running to the window, which he runs
text: both palms over, desperately seeking a way to open it.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Not that way! Through the door!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: But, sir!
text: The windows do not open. Norville furiously stomps on the
text: flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks.
text: Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up
text: and down with his foot.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Right away, buster! Out of my office!
text: Norville has dropped to the floor, trying to wrench the
text: flaming wastebasket off his leg.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Up on your feet! We don't crawl at
dialog: Hudsucker Industries!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Sir, my leg is on fire!
text: Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket
dialog: off his foot. Now the problem is what to do with it.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Get out of this office, you dithering
dialog: nincompoop!
text: Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh my God, sir!
text: He winds up and throws it through the closed window.
text: The GLASS SHATTERS and the flaming basket plummets to
text: oblivion.
text: With the picture window broken a FEROCIOUS DRAFT ROARS through
text: the penthouse office.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - BUMSTEAD CONTRACTS
text: On the desk. The pages are sucked away by the draft.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: My God! The Bumstead contracts!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh my God, sir!
text: Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out
dialog: the window.
text: He runs, jumps onto the sill, grabs -- his fist clenches
text: around one wafting page -- he is about to fall --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Eeeeeeaaaahhhhh!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM
text: BUMSTEAD, a short, fat, heavily perspiring executive, is
text: screaming at an O.S. secretary. He holds a pot of coffee in
text: one hand and a copy of Boy's Life in the other.
speaker_heading: BUMSTEAD
dialog: No magazine. No coffee. Mussburger!
dialog: I wanna see Mussburger! Or did he
dialog: jump out a window too?!
text: In the window behind him we see loose sheets of paper
text: fluttering down.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: Desperately hanging onto Mussburger by his legs.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Don't worry, Mr. Mussburger! I gotcha.
dialog: I gotcha by your pants!
text: Mussburger's screaming abruptly stops.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - MUSSBURGER'S HORROR-STRICKEN FACE REMEMBERING (THE
scene_heading: SCREEN GOES WATERY):
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER

speaker_heading: LUIGI
dialog: Meester Moosaburger, I give-a you
dialog: pants a nice-a dooble stitch. Make
dialog: 'em strong, and they look-a real
dialog: sharp.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER

dialog: No! Single stitch is fine.
speaker_heading: LUIGI
dialog: (begging)
dialog: But please-a, Meester Moosaburger,
dialog: the dooble stitch she last-a forever --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Why on earth would I need a double

text: BACK TO MUSSBURGER'S PANTS
text: The tearing fabric abruptly catches and stops; the rest of
text: the pants hold intact.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
text: sighs with relief.
text: He looks up.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: Norville's arms are wrapped around Mussburger's ankles; the
text: heels of Mussburger's shoes are digging into his face.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Looking. Thinking.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: Struggling to hold on.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
text: Calm. Contemplating.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Hmmm...
text: He absently removes a cigar from his breast pocket and sticks
text: it in his mouth. He holds his lighter under the cigar, not
text: noticing that the flame is pointing the wrong way.
text: He looks at Norville.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: His face drawn with effort, still struggling to hang on.
text: A PULL BACK FROM the EXTREME CLOSE SHOT REVEALS, however,
text: that Norville's arms are now wrapped around -- emptiness.
text: Mussburger's legs are gone.
text: Norville throws his head back and laughs, it seems, insanely --
text: but CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that Norville is merely
text: pantomiming the adventure for the benefit of the board
text: members, including Mussburger. They stand around Mussburger's
text: office, laughing gaily. All safe now, no harm done. This
dialog: inaugurates:
speaker_heading: LAUGHING MONTAGE
text: Montage silent but for MUSIC.
text: A) Norville is entertaining the board with his depiction of
text: the near-disaster. Mussburger is slapping him merrily on the
dialog: back.
dialog: B) CLOSE SHOT - Board member laughing.
text: C) Another board member. Laughing.
text: D) Mussburger. Laughing.
dialog: E) Norville laughing.
text: F) FREEZE FRAME ON Norville's laughing face.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: PULL BACK to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper
text: photo on the front page of the Manhattan Argus.
text: Its headline reads: UNTRIED YOUTH TO HELM HUDSUCKER.
text: The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary. The sub-subhead reads:
dialog: Meteoric Rise From Mailroom.
text: The article is under the byline of Amy Archer.
text: CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that we are looking at the
text: newspaper OVER someone's SHOULDER. The person swivels around
text: and away -- his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville
text: looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs
dialog: merrily.
text: As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto
text: his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK
text: REVEALS that he is in a barber chair.
text: His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair
text: is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning --
text: -- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again.
text: Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a
text: slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade.
text: FREEZE ON Norville's laughing face.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: PULL BACK to reveal it is another front page photo next to
text: the headline: Hud Board To Street: GIVE MAN FROM MUNCIE A
dialog: CHANCE. Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas.
text: CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a
text: chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to
dialog: cover it.
text: PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a
text: tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes
text: his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts,
text: hose stockings and garters.
text: The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and
text: spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape.
text: Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.
speaker_heading: BOARD MEMBER
text: laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching
text: between his hands. He joyously tosses away the tickertape.
speaker_heading: FLOOR
text: where the tickertape lands on a pile of previously discharged
dialog: tape.
text: PAN UP to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its
text: disastrous tale of good news for the board.
text: PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's
text: office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk,
text: Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper.
text: TRACK IN TOWARDS him.
text: On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his
text: window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles
text: by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails.
text: As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN
text: shows its front page headline: HUD STOCK DIPS. Subhead: Just
dialog: Good Is He?
text: TRACK IN ON the front page photo: Norville laughing, his
text: chin propped in his hand.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPH
text: COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing.
text: We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak
text: desk, newly coifed and tailored.
text: The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE
text: OF THE PRESIDENT.
text: TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office, leaving
text: Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT.
text: His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office.
text: Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him
text: exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several
text: days. He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: NEW YORK SKYLINE - DAY
text: In the skyline we can see the Hudsucker building topped by
text: the Hudsucker clock.
text: A cigar ENTERS FRAME in the f.g., then the face of the man
text: smoking it. Staring contemplatively at the Hudsucker building,
text: he takes a puff from the cigar and then plucks it from his
text: mouth and waves it, as if painting a headline.

text: The Editor slams a newspaper down onto his desk in disgust.
speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Facts, figures, charts! They never

speaker_heading: EDITOR
dialog: Yeah, and if a frog had wings he

dialog: Whack! --
text: Without even looking in its direction, the Editor has slammed

text: The Reporter jerks his fingers away as the Editor spares the

speaker_heading: EDITOR

speaker_heading: EDITOR

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an

speaker_heading: OTHER REPORTER

speaker_heading: AMY
text: (as she picks up the

speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Say, buddy! Where'd ya get the new

text: Norville is entering the elevator in his new executive outfit.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...and say, buddy! How'd old
dialog: bucketbutt like his blue letter?
dialog: Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Did he bust a gut?
dialog: Did he die? Did he -- Well, hello,
dialog: Mr. Mussburger, sir...
text: Buzz is instant decorum as Mussburger enters the elevator.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...How're you this fine morning,
dialog: sir?
text: Norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the
text: mention of the blue letter.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid.
dialog: I never did give you that--
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: (to Buzz)
dialog: Lobby. We haven't got all day.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.
text: As he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a
text: cigar, inspects it.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Well I'm starved. I understand it'll
dialog: be quite an affair this afternoon,
dialog: and the executive roast tom turkey
text: at the Bohemian Grove redefines the
dialog: word superb.
text: He puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there
text: with a lighter.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: My pleasure, sir.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry
dialog: too --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Sure, sure...
text: The elevator doors open.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: It's been a pleasure serving you,
dialog: Mr. Mussburger.
text: Buzz turns to Norville. He is puzzled but trying to hide it:
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...and it's been a pleasure serving
dialog: you too, uh... buddy.
speaker_heading: MR. MUSSBURGER
text: is already striding through the lobby; Norville has to lope
dialog: to catch up.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't
dialog: we be a little bit concerned with
dialog: the downward spiral of our stock
dialog: these last few days? I mean, you're
dialog: the expert, but at the Muncie College
dialog: of Business Administration they told
dialog: us --
text: Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps
text: Norville on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Relax, Norville. It's only natural
dialog: in a period of transition for the
text: more nervous element to run for cover.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the
dialog: expert, but --
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK
text: Norville is still loping behind Mussburger, trying to keep
text: up with his long strides.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...You don't happen to remember the
dialog: plan I outlined to you the day I set
dialog: fire to your off -- uh, the day I
dialog: was promoted?
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: I do remember and I was impressed.
dialog: Anyway, that's all forgotten now.
dialog: Driver!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Thank you, Sid, but the reason I
dialog: mention it is, it would require such
dialog: a small capital investment -- again,
dialog: you're the expert here --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Damnit, where's my car!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: -- But there's such an enormous
dialog: potential profit-wise given the
dialog: demographics -- baby boom --
dialog: discretionary income in the burgeoning
dialog: middle class --
text: A black limousine pulls up to the curb.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Finally.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: -- So if you think it's appropriate,
dialog: I'd like to bounce the idea off a
dialog: few people at lunch --
text: Mussburger is getting into the back seat --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Sure, sure, tell whoever you want...
text: And, to Norville's surprise, slamming the door shut behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...And I'd like to hear more about
text: it at some point, too.
text: SCREEEECH -- the CAR pulls away. Norville is left talking to
text: himself on the empty sidewalk.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: But, Sid, I thought you and I were...
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Say, bud, could you keep the sidewalk
dialog: clear here?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: But I'm the president of this --
dialog: aww, forget it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP
text: A cheap coffee shop a half-flight down from the street.
text: We are LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the coffee shop counter.
text: In the middle b.g., Norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup
dialog: of coffee.
text: Behind him, THROUGH the window wells, we see the back and
text: forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk.
text: In the extreme f.g. sit two steaming mugs of coffee.
text: They belong to two VETERANS of the coffee shop, who, from
text: O.S., narrate the scene.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: I got gas, Bennie.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, tell me about it.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Ya get the special?
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Fah from it...
text: He gives a low whistle under his breath as a woman enters
text: from the street and hesitates by the door, looking around.
text: Still attractive but looking somewhat down-at-the-heels, it
dialog: is Amy Archer.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: ...Enter the dame.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: There's one in every story.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Ten bucks says she's looking for a
dialog: handout.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Twenty bucks says not here she don't
dialog: find one.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
text: She's looking for her mark.
text: The woman's eyes settle on Norville, and she heads for the
text: empty stool next to his.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
text: She finds him.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
text: She sits down.
text: The woman says something to the counter waitress, who exits.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
text: ...and awduhs a light lunch.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
text: She looks in her purse...
text: She is holding her wallet upside down.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: ...No money.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
text: The mark notices.
text: Beat. Norville, however, is not noticing: He is staring
text: intently at his coffee spoon, his hat pushed back on his
text: head, his other hand propping up a cheekbone; the woman's
text: presence does not seem to have registered yet.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: ...He's not noticing, Benny.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Maybe he's wise.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: He don't look wise.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
text: The woman starts crying.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Yellowstone.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Old Faithful.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Hello, Niagara.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
text: He notices.
text: As the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles
text: Norville and he finally does indeed notice.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
text: He's concerned.
text: The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically
text: and waves his hands at the waitress.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
text: She explains her perdicament, and...
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 &amp; #2 (O.S.)
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: ...entuh the light lunch.
text: The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman.
text: The woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: She's got other problems, of course...
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: ...Her mother needs an operation...
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: ...adenoids.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: No, Bennie: Lumbago.
text: Veteran #1's enunciation of "lumbago" falls into perfect
text: sync with the woman's moving lips.
text: Norville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices
dialog: his watch.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: (alarmed)
text: She's losing him, Bennie.
text: Norville is rising to his feet.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: Maybe he's wise.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: He don't look wise.
text: As Norville turns to leave:
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: How does she pull this out?
text: She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: (disbelieving)
dialog: She isn't!
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: She is!
text: And indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on
text: the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her.
text: Norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
dialog: She's good, Bennie.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
dialog: She's damn good, Lou.
text: A WAITRESS enters extreme f.g. to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the
text: swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville. The Waitress is
text: FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING
text: gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she
dialog: holds.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (bored, nasal voice)
dialog: Can I get you boys anything else?
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond
text: her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They
text: sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #1
dialog: Bromo.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: VETERAN #2
dialog: ...Bromo.
scene_heading: INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE
text: Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just
text: finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President.
text: The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow
text: approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he
text: is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl,
text: cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the
text: doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against
text: the door and get the knob with his other hand.
text: The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is
text: wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode.
text: He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the
text: lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see,
text: in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN
speaker_heading: tnediserP.
text: Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm sorry we had to take the stairs.
dialog: It was just that horrible little
dialog: elevator boy...
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Not at all. You're light as a feather.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (pointing languorously)
dialog: The couch, please.
text: Still wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch
text: and deposits her gently on it. He straightens up and looks
text: at her.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE'S POV
text: She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES
text: as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs.
text: We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside
text: his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as
text: if coming from a long way away.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Just a minute.
text: He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his
text: head between his knees, still fighting for breath.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't know what came over me. I
dialog: suppose it was the shock of eating
dialog: after so long without; the enzymes
dialog: kicking in after so long, or whatever.
dialog: But then you couldn't possibly know
dialog: what it is to be tired and hungry...
text: Speaking into his knees as he wheezes:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: Hungry, anyway.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't want to bore you with all
dialog: the sordid details of my life; it's
dialog: not a happy story...
text: Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless --
dialog: though not for want of trying, that
dialog: I'm friendless, with no one to --
dialog: thank you -- take care of me; and
dialog: that had you not come along at just
dialog: exactly the moment that you did --
text: She screams, staring down at the couch.
text: Norville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking.
text: On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is
text: printed, in wet ink, right side around: NORVILLE BARNES,
dialog: President.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Norville, I didn't know you were
dialog: president here!
text: Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion. When the
text: nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the
text: seat of his pants.
dialog: Distracted but still modest:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh, it's nothing really. Just
dialog: determination and hard work...
text: He unbuckles his trousers.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Of course, when I started in the
dialog: mailroom last Tuesday I thought it
dialog: might take more time --
text: Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Say, buddy, here's the whiskey you
dialog: asked f --
text: He freezes, taking in the scene: Amy reclining on the couch;
text: Norville standing in front of her with his pants around his
text: ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in
text: his own hand.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on
dialog: the desk.
dialog: Leering:
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Happy days, buddy...
text: As he turns to leave:
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: ...and I'll tell your secretary you're
dialog: not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!!
text: He snaps the elastic strap under his chin.
text: After the doors shut behind Buzz:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (shuddering)
dialog: What a horrible little person.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: At any rate I arrived in town not
dialog: ten days ago, full of dreams and
dialog: aspirations, anxious to make my way
dialog: in the world --
text: Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: A little naive perhaps but -- thank
dialog: you -- armed with determination, a
dialog: solid work ethic, and an indomitable
dialog: belief in the future --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I myself --
text: He crosses back to the desk.

dialog: Only to have that belief, that
text: unsullied optimism, dashed against
dialog: the marble and mortar of the modern
dialog: work place --
text: Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box
text: on the desk and sticks it in his mouth.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Cigarette?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No thank you. Seek and ye shall find,
dialog: work and ye shall prosper -- these
dialog: were the watch words of my education,
dialog: the ethics of my tender years --
scene_heading: OVER NORVILLE'S SHOULDER
text: He has been pushing the box towards her. The box tilts lazily
text: forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk. We
text: hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the pitter-patter of
text: cigarettes raining onto the carpet.
text: Amy's brow crinkles. Continuing:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- these were the values that were
dialog: instilled in me while I was growing
dialog: up in a little town you've probably
dialog: never heard of --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Mind if I join you?
text: He is pouring himself a drink.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Be my guest. A little town you've
dialog: probably --
text: He tosses back his drink, gags, looks at Amy with his eyes
text: bulging.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Once again her IMAGE PULSATES. There is a ROARING SOUND and
text: an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: He waves his arms and talks with a
text: thick rasp as he staggers to his
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Excuse me -- I -- executive
dialog: washroom...
text: He staggers out a side door.
text: On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his
text: desk. At the top of her voice:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Are you all right?...
text: She throws open the top desk drawer. Inside two lonely lead
text: pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer.
text: Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a
text: match off the desktop.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Is it your lunch? The chicken a
dialog: la king?
dialog: From the washroom:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE (O.S.)
dialog: No, I --
text: Amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an
text: appointment book. As she hurriedly flips through page after
text: blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness. One page only
dialog: has a notation: 11:45. Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior
dialog: Achievers Club.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Is the a la king repeating on you?
text: Amy shoves the appointment book back into the drawer.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE (O.S.)
dialog: ...I'm fine, I... You were saying?
dialog: She mutters:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Values... watchwords... uh, tender
dialog: years...
dialog: (aloud)
dialog: -- A little town you've probably
dialog: never heard of...
text: She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to
text: disperse the smoke.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Muncie, Indiana.
text: She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET BEING
text: TURNED OFF: she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch
text: just as the washroom door opens.
text: Norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: You're from Muncie?!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why yes, do you know it?
text: Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and
text: loud syncopated grunting noises. Amy gapes at him.
text: He starts singing, off-key:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: 'Fight on fight on dear old Muncie
dialog: Fight on -- Hoist the gold and blue
dialog: You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin'
dialog: Once 'The Munce' is done with you!'
text: Amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last,
text: obvious rhyme. Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly
text: follows sit, also pumping her fists.
text: As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of
text: his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Goooooooo Eagles!
text: Amy awkwardly imitates.
text: Norville excitedly sits behind his desk.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...A Muncie girl! Talk about the
dialog: cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy.
dialog: I'm gonna cancel the rest of my
dialog: appointments this afternoon and get
dialog: you a job here at the Hud.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, no, really, I --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Don't bother to thank me, it's the
dialog: easiest thing in the world. Matter
dialog: of fact, I know where a vacancy just
dialog: came up.
text: He hits the intercom.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Mail room.
dialog: To Amy:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...This'll only take a moment.
speaker_heading: INTERCOM (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville
dialog: Barnes --
speaker_heading: INTERCOM (V.O.)
dialog: Barnes! Where the hell have you been!
dialog: And where's my voucher?!
text: Norville thumps at his pockets.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Well, I'm not sure where I --
speaker_heading: INTERCOM (V.O.)
dialog: I need that voucher! I told you a
dialog: week ago it was important!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: But look, I'm president of the company
dialog: now and I --
speaker_heading: INTERCOM (V.O.)
dialog: I don't care if you're president of
dialog: the company! I need that voucher!
dialog: Now!
text: CLICK. The intercom goes dead.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do
dialog: you take shorthand? Are you familiar
dialog: with the mimeograph machine?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Of course -- I went to the Muncie,
dialog: uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
text: Norville excitedly smacks a fist into a palm.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: -- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, I just don't know how to thank
dialog: you, Mr. Barnes --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Please! Norville!
text: As he reaches to shake:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...It's my pleasure!
text: She reaches for his hand but Norville snatches it away and,
text: winking at her, hooks thumbs in front of his nose and makes
text: wings of his fingers.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Gooooooo Eagles!
speaker_heading: AMY
text: likewise hooks her thumbs in front of her nose, makes wings,
text: and, winking back:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Gooooooooo Eagles!
text: But we PULL BACK to reveal that the girl is now in a newspaper
text: office, demonstrating the fight sign to SMITTY, a reporter
text: wearing a fedora with a bent-back brim. Smitty howls with
dialog: laughter.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: (wheezing)
dialog: ...Once 'The Munce'... Holy...
text: Amy sits down behind a typewriter and, as she starts typing
dialog: at 80 words per minute:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: And is this guy from chumpsville?!
dialog: I pulled the old mother routine --
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Adenoids?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Lumbago.
text: Behind her an ancient man wearing an inksman's visor and
text: sleeve garters toils over a large checkerboarded surface
text: over which he shuffles letter blocks and black spaces.
text: Smitty gives a low whistle.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: That gag's got whiskers on it!
text: The PHONE RINGS and Smitty reaches for it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm telling you, Smitty, the board
dialog: of Hudsucker is up to something --
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ANCIENT PUZZLER
dialog: Say, Amy, what's a six-letter word
dialog: for an affliction of the hypothalmus?
text: Without a break in her typing:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- And it's a cinch -- Goiter --
dialog: it's a cinch this guy isn't in on
dialog: it. How much time to make the Late
dialog: Final?
text: Smitty holds the phone away from his ear.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Chief.
text: Still typing, Amy whistles and nods to her shoulder.
text: Smitty tucks the phone into it as she continues typing.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hiya, Chief, just the person I wanted
dialog: to apologize to...
text: Smitty is looking at his watch.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
text: About seven minutes.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (still typing)
dialog: Yeah, I was all wet about your idea
dialog: man... Well, thanks for being so
dialog: generous... It is human, and you are
dialog: divine... No, he's no faker. He's
dialog: the 100% real McCoy beware-of-
dialog: imitations genuine article: the guy
dialog: is a real moron --
dialog: To the Ancient Puzzler:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- as in a five-letter word for
dialog: imbecile --
dialog: Back into phone:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- as pure a specimen as I've ever
dialog: run across... Am I sure he's a nitwit?
dialog: Heck, if working at the Argus doesn't
dialog: make me an expert then my name isn't
dialog: Amy Archer and I've never won the
dialog: Pulitzer Prize...
text: Her eyes narrow.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...In 1957... My series on the
dialog: reunited triplets -- come on down
dialog: here, hammerhead, and I'll show it
dialog: to ya...
speaker_heading: ANCIENT PUZZLER
dialog: Amy, what's a three-letter word for
dialog: a flightless bird?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Not now, Morris, I'm busy -- That's
dialog: right, I said hammerhead, as in a
dialog: ten-letter word for a smug bullying
dialog: self-important newspaperman --
dialog: To Morris:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- Gnu --
dialog: Into phone:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- who couldn't find --

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- couldn't find the Empire State
text: Building with a compass, a road map
dialog: and a native guide.
dialog: To Morris:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- or emu.
text: She slams down the phone. To Smitty:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...And that's just the potatoes,
dialog: Smitty, here comes the gravy: The
dialog: chump really likes me. A Muncie girl!
text: Smitty bursts out laughing.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
text: Better off falling for a rattlesnake.
text: As she continues to type:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the
dialog: patsy and I'm gonna find out what
dialog: for. There's a real story, Smitty,
text: some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal,
dialog: a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: He didn't offer you money.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: A sawbuck!
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: On Norville Barnes!
text: She rips the page out of the typewriter, swivels in her chair
text: to FACE CAMERA as we TRACK IN CLOSE and she hollers:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Copy!
scene_heading: DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:
speaker_heading: PRESSES
text: rolling, churning out great quantities of newsprint.
text: Papers piling up one on top of the other, very many, very
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: DELIVERY MAN

speaker_heading: BALED PAPER
text: rolling into the f.g. A hand ENTERS FRAME to snip its wires
text: and wipe off the top paper.
speaker_heading: PAPER BOY
text: wearing an apron and a little paper boy cap, mouthing "Extra!

text: PAN UP his arm TO the newspaper and, BEYOND it, the towering
dialog: Hudsucker Building.
dialog: All of the above --
scene_heading: DISSOLVING WITH:
speaker_heading: NEWSPAPER
text: spinning TOWARDS the CAMERA and STOPPING FULL FRAME.
text: Its headline, over a picture of Norville smiling, is "IMBECILE
text: HEADS HUDSUCKER." The subheadline: "Not a Brain in his Head."
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - NEWSPAPER
text: is angrily slammed down to reveal that Norville has been
text: reading the inside.
text: His face twisting with fury, he leans forward and hits the
text: intercom.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Miss Smith, can you come in please
dialog: to take a letter...
dialog: Muttering to himself:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...of all the cockamamie...
text: Amy is bustling in holding a steno pad and a pencil.
text: As she seats herself in front of his desk, he rises to pace
text: behind it.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Did you happen to see the front
dialog: page of today's Manhattan Argus?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, I... didn't bother to read the
dialog: article. I didn't think the picture
dialog: did you justice.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: The picture was fine! It's what that
dialog: knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath!
dialog: Of all the irresponsible... Amy,
dialog: take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I
dialog: call you 'Miss' because you seem to
dialog: have 'missed' the boat completely on
dialog: this one! How on earth would you
dialog: know whether I'm an imbecile when
dialog: you don't even have the guts to come
dialog: in here and interview me man to man!
dialog: No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No,
dialog: make it 'common decency.' These wild
dialog: speculations about my intelligence --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- or lack thereof?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: -- these preposterous inventions,
dialog: would be better suited to the pages
dialog: of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the
dialog: editors of the Manhattan Argus see
dialog: fit to publish the rantings of a
dialog: disordered mind, perhaps they will
dialog: see fit to publish this letter! But
dialog: I doubt it. I most seriously doubt
dialog: it. As I doubt also that you could
dialog: find a home at Amazing Tales, a
dialog: periodical which I have enjoyed for
dialog: many years. Yours sincerely, et
dialog: cetera.
text: He drifts into thought.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least
dialog: better than that that dame does. Do
dialog: you think I'm an imbecile?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I'm sure I --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Go on, tell the truth; I trust you
dialog: and I put a lot of stock in your
dialog: opinion.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, I --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a
dialog: fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile
dialog: come up with this?
text: He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an
text: easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle
text: rendered onto it.
text: Amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly
text: beaming face.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...I designed it myself and this is
dialog: just the sweet baby that can put
text: Hudsucker right back on top.
text: Amy is bewildered. Norville explains:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...You know! For kids!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Why don't I just type this up...
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be
dialog: necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's
dialog: just doing her job, I guess.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, I don't know; maybe she does
dialog: deserve it. Maybe she should've come
dialog: in to face you man to man.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, she probably had a deadline...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sure, but -- she could still have
dialog: gotten your side for the record!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, it's done now -- what's the
dialog: use of grousing about it. Forget the
dialog: letter, Amy, I just had to blow off
dialog: some steam...
text: She gets up to leave, and is heading for the door when
dialog: Norville adds:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...She's probably just a little
dialog: confused.
text: Amy turns at the door.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Confused?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Yeah, you know, probably one of these
dialog: fast-talking career gals, thinks
dialog: she's one of the boys. Probably is
dialog: one of the boys, if you know what I
dialog: mean.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (through clenched
dialog: teeth)
dialog: I'm quite sure I don't know what you
dialog: mean.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of
dialog: these complexes they have nowadays.
dialog: Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it?
dialog: She's probably very unattractive and
dialog: bitter about it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, is that it!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in
text: men's clothing, swaps drinks with
text: the guys at the local watering hole,
text: and hobnobs with some smooth talking
text: heel in the newsroom named Biff or
dialog: Smoocher or...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Smitty.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Exactly. And I bet she's ugly.
dialog: Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't
text: they print her picture next to her
dialog: byline?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Maybe she puts her work ahead of her
dialog: personal appearance.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I bet that's exactly what she tells
dialog: herself! But you and I both know
dialog: she's just a dried-up bitter old
dialog: maid. Say, how about you and I grab
text: a little dinner and a show after
dialog: work? I was thinking maybe The King
dialog: and I --
text: Whap! Amy slaps him.
text: He stares.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...How about Oklahoma?
text: As she stalks out of the office:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Norville Barnes, you don't know a
dialog: thing about that woman! You don't
dialog: know who she really is! And only a
dialog: numbskull thinks he knows things
dialog: about things he knows nothing about!
text: He stares, rubbing his cheek.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Say, what gives?
speaker_heading: WHISTLE
text: SHRIEKING.
speaker_heading: SWISH PAN TO:
speaker_heading: CLOCK
text: Reading five o'clock.
speaker_heading: SWISH PAN TO:

text: Rising from their desks, collecting personal effects, putting
text: on their hats and coats.
speaker_heading: TIME CLOCK
text: Busy hands punch out.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY HALLWAY
text: Of the executive floor. A security man walks down the hall,
text: whistling, swinging a ring of keys. After he passes the door
text: to the ladies' room it opens, Amy peeks out, emerges, goes
text: into Norville's office.
scene_heading: INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE
text: She goes to the desk, takes out the appointment book, flips
dialog: through it.
speaker_heading: BOOK
text: Still empty except for the one date with the Wilkie Grammer
text: School Junior Achievers Club, which now has a red line drawn
text: across it with the notation CANCELED.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: looks around the office -- notices something.
speaker_heading: DOOR
text: Set into the wall to one side it is topped by a small plaque:
scene_heading: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.
text: Amy tries the knob, which turns, and enters.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM
text: It is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral
text: staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the
text: gloom above. It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs,
text: gears. There is no window, but on what would be the window
text: wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping
text: an interior circle. It is the backside of the great Hudsucker
dialog: clock.
text: Amy gazes about. She crosses to a door opposite the one she
dialog: entered from.
text: She stoops to peek through its keyhole.
speaker_heading: HER POV
text: We are LOOKING INTO Sidney J. Mussburger's office.
text: Mussburger sits at his desk barking into a Dictaphone.
scene_heading: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS on his desk

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Watchoo doin' down they, Miss Archuh?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Huh?!
text: She straightens and turns.
text: Facing her is a very old BLACK MAN in a janitor's jumpsuit
text: with HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES/The Future Is Now emblazoned across

speaker_heading: MOSES (BLACK MAN)
dialog: Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about

speaker_heading: MOSES

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone

speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: I don't tell no one nothin' lessen
dialog: they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses'
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So if you know everything about
dialog: Hudsucker, tell me why the Board
dialog: decided to make Norville Barnes
dialog: president.
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: Well, that even surprised ole Moses
dialog: at fust. I didn't think the Board
dialog: was that smart.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That smart?!
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: But then I figured it out: they did
dialog: it 'cause they figured young Norville
dialog: for an imbecile. Like some othuh
dialog: people ah know.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why on earth would they want a nitwit
dialog: to be president?
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: 'Cause they's little pigglies!
dialog: They's tryin' to inspire panic, make
dialog: that stock git cheap so's they can
dialog: snitch it all up fo' themselves! But
dialog: Norville, he's got some tricks up
dialog: his sleeve, he does...
text: He draws a circle with his finger in the air.
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: ...you know, fo' kids? Yeah, he's a
dialog: smart one, that Norville, heh-heh,
dialog: he's a caution. Wal, some folks is
dialog: square, an' some is hip --
text: To punctuate, he gives a little jerk of his hips.
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: ...But I guess you don't really know
dialog: him any better than that board does,
dialog: do ya, Miss Archuh?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, maybe I --
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: An' only some kind a knucklehead
dialog: thinks she knows things 'bout things
dialog: she, uh -- when she don't, uh --
dialog: How'd that go?
speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: It's hardly the same --
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: Why you don't even know y'own self --
dialog: you ain't exactly the genuine article
dialog: are you, Miss Archuh?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, in connection with my job,
dialog: sometimes I have to go undercover as
dialog: it were --
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: I don't mean that! Why you pretendin'
dialog: to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't
dialog: never gonna make you happy! Never
dialog: made Warin' happy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: (uncomfortably)
dialog: I'm happy enough.
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Okay, Miss Archuh.

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: I'm plenty happy!

speaker_heading: MOSES

speaker_heading: CHIEF

speaker_heading: SMITTY

dialog: Ol' satchel-butt...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know they're gonna buy that stock --
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: You don't know anything! Fact is
dialog: they haven't bought it! The stock is
dialog: cheap, Archer! What're they waiting
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Amy's hunches are usually pretty
dialog: good, Chief.
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: You don't accuse someone of stock
dialog: manipulation on a hunch, Ignatz!
dialog: The readers of the Manhattan Argus
dialog: aren't interested in sensationalism,
text: gossip and unsupported speculation.
dialog: Facts, figures -- those are the tools

speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Come on, Chief, that's a low blow.
dialog: Archer's not gonna go goey for a

dialog: Chamber Orchestra.
speaker_heading: DANCING COUPLES
text: FILL the SCREEN; we GLIDE AMONG them and FINALLY COME to
text: follow one couple: Norville and MRS. MUSSBURGER, a large
text: middle-aged woman of the Margaret Dumont-mold in an
text: elaborately flowered and old-fashioned evening gown, low-cut
text: in spite of her overly-heavy figure. She wears a large
text: flowered hat with a rolled-up veil.
scene_heading: MRS. MUSSBURGER
dialog: -- So we'd gone out to the Hamptons
dialog: and the garden was in positive ruins!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: That must have been quite a
text: disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
scene_heading: MRS. MUSSBURGER
dialog: Disappointment? J'etais destroyee! I
dialog: was in bed for a week! Positively
dialog: sick with fury! I called in the
dialog: gardener and said, 'Monsieur Gonzalez,
dialog: either those azaleas come up next
dialog: spring or you are terminee!
text: She throws her head back and roars with laughter.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THEIR FEET
text: As the large woman leans back to laugh, her feet stay planted
text: on the ground and Norville's rise to be dragged with his
text: toes scraping the floor through the continuing dance.
scene_heading: MRS. MUSSBURGER
dialog: I'm brushing up on my French with
dialog: the most charming man, Pierre of
dialog: Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I haven't had --
scene_heading: MRS. MUSSBURGER
dialog: Sidney and I are planning a trip to

speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Sure, sure. I'm going to borrow

scene_heading: MRS. MUSSBURGER
dialog: Well, frankly, I...
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: You have a charming wife, Mr.
dialog: Muss -- uh, Sid.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: So they tell me. Norville, let me

dialog: introductions here. Try not to talk
dialog: too much; some of our biggest
dialog: stockholders are, uh -- scratch that:
dialog: Say whatever you want.
speaker_heading: ENTRYWAY
text: As Amy enters in a simple yet stunning evening gown. She
text: looks around the room, then starts across the crowded floor
text: towards the punch bowl.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: As Mussburger introduces him to a tall, imposing BUSINESSMAN
text: in a tuxedo and a ten-gallon hat.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Norville Barnes, allow me to introduce
dialog: Mr. Zebulon Cardozo, one of Hudsucker
dialog: Industries largest and most loyal
dialog: stockholders.
text: Ignoring Norville's proffered hand:
speaker_heading: CARDOZO (BUSINESSMAN)
dialog: Dammit boy, what's this I hear about
dialog: you bein' an embecile? What the hell
dialog: is ailin' ya?! A week ago my stock
dialog: was worth twice what it is now! I'm
dialog: considering dumping the whole shootin'

dialog: improvement! Dammit, boy, It's a
dialog: range war! Either you pull our wagons
dialog: into a circle or I'm pullin' out of
dialog: the wagon train!
text: Norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: No need for concern, sir; it's only
dialog: natural in a period of transition
dialog: for the more timid element to run
dialog: for cover --
speaker_heading: CARDOZO
dialog: So I'm yella, am I?!!
text: He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket:
speaker_heading: CARDOZO
dialog: ...We'll see who's yella!!

speaker_heading: MRS. CARDOZO
dialog: Zebulon, you mind now and quit bein'

speaker_heading: CARDOZO
dialog: Aww, I wasn't gonna hurt the boy,
dialog: Lorelei...
scene_heading: MUSSBURGER AND NORVILLE
text: As they make their way through the room Norville is mopping
text: at his brow with a handkerchief.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I
dialog: showed him the long view we might --
text: Thump! Dabbing at his brow, Norville has walked square into
text: the back of a debonaire man holding a martini.
text: The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Norville, this is Thorstensen
text: Finlandsen, who heads a radical
text: splinter group of disgruntled
dialog: investors.
text: Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen's hand.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to
dialog: meet you -- uh, happy to walk into y --
dialog: uh, pleased to make your --
text: Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at Norville's
text: handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently having
dialog: been given it during the handshake.
text: He hands it back to Norville.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Thank you, sir...
text: He stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as
text: Findlandsen stares at him. Mussburger stands watching in the
text: executive at-ease, hands dug into his pockets.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...I understand your concern about
dialog: the down-ward, you know, but I think
dialog: you'll find under our strong new
dialog: leadership...
text: As Norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the
text: handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of the
text: pocket and follows his hand down.
text: Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look, and
text: stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky.
text: Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at
dialog: Norville, who continues, O.S.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE (O.S.)
dialog: We anticipate, in short order, an
dialog: upward...
text: In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch --
text: Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand
text: pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand
text: pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly
text: waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward
text: onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN.
scene_heading: MRS. FINDLANDSEN
dialog: Ahhh!
text: There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim:
speaker_heading: EMCEE
text: grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the
text: band and grins.
speaker_heading: EMCEE
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished
dialog: members of the Hudsucker board. I
dialog: give you the king of swing, the rajah
dialog: of romance, the incredible, the
dialog: unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta!
text: Vic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs
text: away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon. He wears a white
text: dinner jacket. His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead
text: in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and
text: bounces across his forehead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SEVERAL BOARD MEMBERS
text: Clustered in a dim corner of the room, smoking cigars.
text: In the b.g., brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his
dialog: song.
text: As Mussburger joins them:
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
dialog: How's it going, Mr. Mussburger?
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Bad.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: But not bad enough.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3
dialog: Too bad.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: It could be better, it could be worse.
scene_heading: ALL THREE EXECUTIVES
dialog: Hmmmmmm.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: The stock's got to drop another five
dialog: points if we expect to get controlling
dialog: interest. Norville tells me he's got
dialog: some hot idea. Can't be good.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1
dialog: Then it can't be bad!
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: Couldn't be better if it couldn't be
dialog: worse.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Hmmmmmm.
scene_heading: EXT. PENTHOUSE - TERRACE
text: where the PARTY NOISE is DISTANT, TENETTA'S SONG just
scene_heading: FILTERING OUT.
text: We are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing
text: the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture,
text: with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand
text: pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a

speaker_heading: REVERSE
text: Amy, having just emerged onto the terrace, squints at him.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Norville?
text: He turns and we see that it is indeed Norville, holding a
text: dripping icepack against one eye.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...What happened?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh. Nothing, really, just... the
dialog: more timid investors are no longer
text: running for cover.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Let me look.
dialog: He does.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Sid found me the icepack.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Let me hold it, or you'll have a
dialog: real shiner.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot
text: over this imbecile story.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy.
dialog: You're the one person who's been
dialog: standing by me through all this.
text: As she rolls the pack gently across his eye:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Norville... there's something I have
dialog: to tell you. You see, I'm not really
dialog: a secretary.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I know that, Amy.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...You do?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I understand that you're not very
text: skilled yet in the secretarial arts.
dialog: I'm not that skilled as president.
dialog: Oh sure, I put up a big front --
dialog: (massages his eye)
dialog: -- not that everyone's buying it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I believe in you, Norville --
dialog: At least I believe in your...
dialog: intentions --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh, I don't blame them, really. I
dialog: guess I have sort of made a mess of
dialog: things. These folks have to protect
dialog: their investment. Most of them are
dialog: very nice people --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Norville, you can't trust people
dialog: here like you did in Muncie...
text: They gaze out at the city.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Certain people are --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Didja ever go to the top of old man
text: Larson's feed tower and look out
dialog: over the town?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Huh?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: You know, on farm route 17.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh yes! In Muncie!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well
dialog: no, I -- I never really... There's a
dialog: place I go now, the cutest little
dialog: place near my apartment in Greenwich
dialog: Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's
text: a beatnik bar.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yes, you can get carrot juice or
dialog: Italian coffee, and the people there --
dialog: well, none of them quite fit in.
dialog: You'd love it -- why don't you come
dialog: there with me -- they're having a
dialog: marathon poetry reading on New Year's
dialog: Eve. I go every year.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Every year?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well -- this year -- if it's good I
dialog: plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my
dialog: it certainly is beautiful --
text: She nods out at the city to avoid Norville's quizzical look.
speaker_heading: AMY
text: ...The people look like ants.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, the Hindus say -- and the
dialog: beatniks also -- that in the next
dialog: life some of us will come back as
dialog: ants. Some will be butterflies.
dialog: Others will be elephants or creatures
dialog: of the sea.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What a beautiful thought.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: What do you think you were in your
dialog: previous life, Amy?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a
dialog: fast-talking career gal who thought
dialog: she was one of the boys --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so
dialog: but I find that very farfetched.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Norville, there really is something
dialog: I have to tell you --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: That kind of person would come back
dialog: as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I
dialog: think it more likely that you were a
text: gazelle, with long, graceful legs,
text: gamboling through the underbrush.
dialog: Perhaps we met once, a chance
dialog: encounter in a forest glade. I must
dialog: have been an antelope or an ibex.
dialog: What times we must have had --
dialog: foraging together for sustenance,
text: picking the grubs and burrs from one
dialog: another's coats. Or perhaps we simply
dialog: touched our horns briefly and went
dialog: our separate ways...
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I wish it were that simple, Norville.
dialog: I wish I was still a gazelle, and
dialog: you were an antelope or an ibex.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Well, can I at least call you deer?
dialog: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the
dialog: whole thing is what your beatnik
dialog: friends call 'karma' -- the great
text: circle of life, death and rebirth.
dialog: Morosely:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah, I think I've heard of that.
dialog: What goes around comes around.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: That's it. A great wheel that gives
dialog: us each what we deserve...
text: He slaps his fist into his palm.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Tomorrow's my big presentation to
dialog: the board. I've gotta show Sidney
dialog: and the guys that I deserve all their
dialog: confidence!
dialog: Sadly:
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh, Norville --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for
dialog: luck!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Sure, Norville, sure...

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: -- So we have economy, simplicity,
dialog: low production cost and the potential
dialog: for mass appeal, and all that spells
dialog: out great profitability...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MUSSBURGER

speaker_heading: NORVILLE (O.S.)
dialog: ...I had the boys down at R &amp; D throw
dialog: together this prototype so that our

speaker_heading: BOARD
text: Staring, mouths hanging open, in arrested motion much like
text: when Waring Hudsucker jumped out the window at the previous

speaker_heading: NORVILLE (O.S.)
dialog: ...and to give you gentlemen of the
dialog: Board a first-hand look at just how
dialog: exciting this gizmo is...
scene_heading: WIDER ON NORVILLE
text: Still gyrating. We now see that he has accelerated the hula

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...It's fun, it's healthy, it's good
dialog: exercise; kids'll just love it, and
dialog: we put a little sand inside to make
dialog: the whole experience more pleasant.
dialog: And the great part is we won't have
dialog: to charge an arm and a leg!
text: Mussburger's forgotten match has burned down to his

text: The Board is staring.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
dialog: Yeah but... What is it?
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: Does it have rules?
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #5

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #4

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #7

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #2
dialog: How do you make it stop?
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #1

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #3
dialog: Can a parent assemble it??
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #7
dialog: What if you get tired before it's

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #6
dialog: Is there a larger model for the obese?
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE #4

speaker_heading: ELDERLY EXECUTIVE
dialog: And finally... what is it?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: You know, for kids! It's... it's ...
dialog: well, it's...
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: It's brilliant.
text: The Board looks at Mussburger.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...It's genius. It's just exactly
text: what Hudsucker needs at this juncture.
dialog: Sure, sure, a blind man could tell
dialog: you that there's an enormous demand
dialog: for this, uh...
text: He smiles weakly at Norville.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Congratulations, kid, you've really
dialog: outdone yourself. Reinvented the
dialog: wheel. I'm going to recommend to the
dialog: Board that we proceed immediately
dialog: with this, uh... with the, uh...
dialog: that the dingus be mass-produced
dialog: with all deliberate speed. Of course,
dialog: as president of the company the

scene_heading: INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE
text: Norville sits anxiously awaiting the verdict of Amy who sits

text: BACK TO SHOP WINDOW
text: Crowds still scurry indifferently by. The shopkeeper stands

text: We TRACK IN ON the cardboard display. The displayed price of

scene_heading: INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE
text: Norville is nervously pacing. Amy still studies the ticker-

speaker_heading: HULA HOOP
text: It rolls across the street. CARS VIOLENTLY BRAKE to avoid

text: It rounds a corner and rolls up to a little boy, rolls in a

scene_heading: INT. NEARBY SCHOOLHOUSE

text: Norville, who has been stewing, finally barks:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Wait a minute!
text: He grabs the lemonade glass, looks at it, sneering.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Why, this is worthless.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Huh?! But, buddy --
text: Norville yanks the straw out and crumples it up.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: This is the most idiotic thing I've
dialog: ever seen in my life!
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Yeah, but, buddy --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Nobody wants a hare-brained product
dialog: like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks
dialog: the creative spark, the unalloyed
dialog: genius that made, uh...
text: He pauses to belch.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...say, the hula hoop such a success.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: But, buddy --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE

speaker_heading: BUZZ

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: -- I can't have every deadbeat on

dialog: with their idiotic brainwaves!
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: An example must be made!
text: Buzz looks over his shoulder, turns back to Norville.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Wuddya mean, buddy?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Fired! You're fired! Is that plain
dialog: enough for you, buster!
text: Buzz's jaw drops. His elastic chin strap snaps under the
dialog: pressure.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Awwww, buddy --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: And don't call me buddy! Out of here!
dialog: Out!
text: Buzz sinks to his knees, weeping. He clutches pathetically
text: at Norville's pants legs.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's
dialog: all I got!
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Get up!
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: I understand if ya don't like the

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: We don't crawl at Hudsucker

speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
text: As we TRACK IN ON Norville, laughing, there is a low,
text: unearthly RUMBLE, and his face seems to DISSOLVE INTO:
speaker_heading: FLAMES
text: We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized
text: lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar.
text: He is sitting alone in the boardroom, but its door swings
text: open and Norville enters wearing plaid knickers, a little
text: cap, and a knit shirt that shows his waist starting to bulge.
text: He has a full golf bag over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine
text: at Riverdale is really murder.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Sure, sure, it's a tough course.
dialog: Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought
dialog: the board room would be a swell place
dialog: to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're
dialog: having some security problems here
dialog: at the Hud.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Ya don't say.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you
dialog: with it, but -- this is embarrassing,
dialog: kid -- it seems to concern you
dialog: directly.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: How's that, Sid?
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: It's not important in itself --
dialog: some elevator boy you fired came to
dialog: me claiming you'd stolen the idea
dialog: for the, uh, the hoop dingus from
dialog: him --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just --
dialog: maybe I was a little rough on the
dialog: boy, ya see I --
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to
dialog: explain to me. He's a little person.
dialog: He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily
dialog: it would just be a nuisance. But it
dialog: seems -- well, there was a spy in
dialog: the company...
text: He is shoving a file towards Norville, who opens it.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Sure, sure, we tried to kill the
dialog: story. But her newspaper won't play
dialog: ball... Looks like her story's coming
dialog: out...
text: We TRACK DOWN the length of the board room table TOWARD
text: Norville, who stares horrified at the file.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...See, kid, the problem the Board'll
dialog: have... you hired this woman. Kept
text: her on, while she made a chump out
dialog: of you. Serious error of judgment...
dialog: I mean, business is war, kid -- ya
dialog: take no prisoners, ya get no second
dialog: chances. And a boner like this...
dialog: I'm afraid when the Board meets,
dialog: after New Year's, your position...
dialog: well, it looks like you're finished...
dialog: stick a fork in ya, you're done...
dialog: washed up...
text: We LOSE Mussburger FROM FRAME as we TIGHTEN FURTHER ON
dialog: Norville, Mussburger continuing off:
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
dialog: ...I'm sorry, kid. I understand this
dialog: dolly who betrayed you, she used to
dialog: be a friend of yours...
text: Norville is slowly dragging the golf cap off his head.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
dialog: ...And this elevator dope used to be
dialog: a friend, too...
text: Norville stares, perfectly still.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER (O.S.)
dialog: ...Well, they've got your throat
dialog: pretty well slit. And when you're
dialog: dead, ya stay dead. Ya don't believe
dialog: me, ask Waring Hudsucker... Yeah,
dialog: looks like curtains. Well,
dialog: condolences, kid...
scene_heading: Norville's IMAGE TURNS TO:
scene_heading: BLACK-AND-WHITE IMAGE OF NORVILLE
text: We PULL BACK to show that it is on the front page of the
dialog: Manhattan Argus.
text: The headline, in screaming nine-point type:
dialog: FAKE!
text: Next to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a

text: Next to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator-

dialog: Jockey Clarence "Buzz" Gunderson.
speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)
dialog: You can't print that!
speaker_heading: CHIEF

speaker_heading: SWISH PAN TO:
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: -- and she's dynamite!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville
dialog: showed me his design for the whatsit
dialog: the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't
dialog: have invented it -- look at the man --
dialog: he's an imbecile!
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Archer, you're a broken record. Fact
dialog: is Gunderson did design it --
dialog: apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Says who?!
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: You're not the only one with sources,
dialog: Amy --
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Smith has a source on the Hud board --
dialog: very senior, very hushhush --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are

speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: You've lost it, Aim. You've gone
dialog: soft by the looks of it -- soft on
dialog: the dummy from Dubuque --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Muncie!
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer,
dialog: but this story is hot and you're no

dialog: scoop of the century -- the other
dialog: papers won't have the Gunderson dope
dialog: 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer
dialog: Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking
dialog: on our dust come mornin' --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You're fools, both of you! It's

dialog: Norville! They're trying to destroy
dialog: him!
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Amy -- take a break. You've worked
dialog: hard on this story -- heck, you broke
dialog: it for us! But it's passed you by
dialog: and Smith here has taken up the slack.
text: She is near tears.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You want slack, I'll give you slack.
dialog: You're not putting me out to pasture,
dialog: Al, I quit! Consider this my
dialog: resignation --
text: She turns to Smitty --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: -- effective immediately!
text: -- and swings -- but he catches her before contact, holds

speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: ...Soft.
text: Amy swings her free arm to -- thwack -- blindside his other
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: In flickering black-and-white, he is lying on a couch that

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: I want a martini! It's New Year's
dialog: Eve and I want a Martini!
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Daddy, it's like I been tellin' ya --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE

speaker_heading: BARMAN

speaker_heading: AMY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: NORVILLE

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: ...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit
dialog: to buy your lunch?!
speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to

speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Hey! Where's that martini?!
speaker_heading: AMY

text: She starts pumping her arms, slowly chanting.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Fight on, fight on, dear old

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ...Fight on, hoist the gold and blue;
dialog: You'll be tattered, torn and hurtin'
dialog: Once 'The Munce' is done with you!
dialog: Goooooo Eagles!
text: She looks hopefully for some effect, but after staring at
text: her for a slack-jawed beat Norville can only bring out:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: You lied to me! I can't believe you
dialog: lied to me! a Muncie girl!
text: He lurches off his stool toward the door. Watching him,
text: despair fights with confusion on Amy's face.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But Norville... I...
text: She realizes that, though shattered, he is still the simple
dialog: innocent she loved --
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: ... Oh, Norville!

text: Two loud REVELERS reel INTO FRAME, one of them uncurling a

speaker_heading: NEWSIE (O.S.)
dialog: ...Ring out the old! Ring in the

scene_heading: CLOSE ON NORVILLE

dialog: Norville DISSOLVES away to leave us ON Sidney in the:
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM
text: Hellishly bottom-lit board members sit around the table,
text: conical New Year's hats on their heads. Mussburger, the only

speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
text: ...The barred-window boys are out
dialog: looking for him now, and we'll see

text: The board murmurs appreciatively.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: ...Let me remind you that our secret

text: Louder murmuring. One board member leers, a trace of spittle

speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Well, if that's all...

speaker_heading: NORVILLE

speaker_heading: VOICES

speaker_heading: NORVILLE

speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: ...Down here! He went down here!
text: Behind Norville, the crowd rounds the corner, led by Buzz.
text: A VAN is SCREECHING to a halt and out jump two burly unshaven

text: Norville turns down an alley. A DRUNK drooping off a lamppost

speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Ring out the old! Ring in the new!
text: The crowd is running past the mouth of the alley, missing

speaker_heading: LIMESTONE FLOOR
text: Norville, gasping, crashes down INTO FRAME, his hands breaking

dialog: posing for.
text: Norville reels over to it, stares dumbly.
speaker_heading: STATUE

speaker_heading: NORVILLE

scene_heading: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK -- the PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS swing

speaker_heading: NORVILLE

text: Norville looks at the door.
text: THROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of
text: "Mussburger" being painted into place.
text: Norville throws open the window.
scene_heading: WIND WHISTLES.
text: He climbs out.
speaker_heading: LEDGE
text: Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down.
text: We hear DISTANT CHANTING:
speaker_heading: VOICES (V.O.)
dialog: Ten... nine... eight... seven...
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: A sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far,
text: far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling
dialog: snow.
speaker_heading: VOICES (V.O.)
dialog: Six... five... four...
scene_heading: WIDER ON NORVILLE
text: We are FLOATING IN; it is the SHOT with which the movie began.
text: The sweep second hand of the Hudsucker Clock is approaching
text: the 12 of midnight, the New Year. In sync with the clock the
dialog: CHANTING continues:
speaker_heading: VOICES (V.O.)
dialog: Three... two...
text: We have COME IN CLOSE ON Norville. A lone tear runs down his
dialog: cheek.
speaker_heading: VOICES (V.O.)
dialog: ...One...
text: BONG! The toll is right at Norville's ear. Startled, he
text: reaches up to press hands against his ears. Distantly:
speaker_heading: VOICES (V.O.)
dialog: Happy New Year!
dialog: BONG!!
text: He can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges
text: his way back toward the window.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: The open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it
dialog: shut.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE
dialog: Norville waves.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: No --
dialog: BONG!!
text: His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he
text: trips -- falls -- catches the ledge --
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: -- No, please!
text: He is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. His feet
text: dangle away. Snow falls.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Looking STEEPLY UP.
speaker_heading: CLOCK
text: Its second hand is making its descent.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Falling.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
dialog: Laughing.
speaker_heading: SECOND HAND
text: Descending.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with a
text: great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, head
text: down, feet in the air.
text: It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that
text: the title of the film was supered over.
text: He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.
scene_heading: PEOPLE IN STREET
text: Frozen in attitudes of laughter, celebration. Snow sifts
text: silently down around their motionless bodies.
speaker_heading: MUSSBURGER
text: In his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his
dialog: face.
scene_heading: HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS
text: Frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the
text: apex of its arc. Outside the great arched window, snow falls.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: He alone can move, but doesn't fall. He looks awkwardly about,
text: his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down.
scene_heading: EXT. HUDSUCKER CLOCK
text: Its sweep second hand is arrested on its downward sweep.
text: WHINING NOISES emanate from within.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - GREAT GEAR
text: The broom handle has been jammed between two cogs, stopping
text: them. We PULL BACK ALONG the handle to reveal Moses, who has
text: thrust it there, and who now TURNS back over his shoulder to
speaker_heading: address the CAMERA.
speaker_heading: MOSES
dialog: Strictly speakin', I'm never spozed
dialog: to do this but... have you got a
dialog: better idea?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a DISTANT --
text: very distant -- SINGING.
speaker_heading: HIS POV
text: Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building. Someone or
text: something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down
dialog: from the stars.
text: We can make out a male voice, accompanied by STRUMMING:
speaker_heading: VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: She'll be comin' around the mountain
dialog: when she comes, She'll be comin'
text: around the mountain when she comes...
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
text: He gapes.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
text: -- For it is an Angel, arrives. He is a balding man, wearing
text: rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings
text: sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes
text: to rest, in midair. He puts aside the harp he has been
text: strumming on a nearby windowsill.
speaker_heading: ANGEL
dialog: Love that tune. How ya doin', kid?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Mr... Mr. Hudsucker?
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER (ANGEL)
dialog: Ta-daaaa!
text: Presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward
text: foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to
text: stamp. He lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Wooooo!
text: He rights himself. The halo spinning lazily over his head
text: has been jarred askew. With a flick of his forefinger he
dialog: rights it.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...How d'ya like this thing? They're
dialog: all wearin' em upstairs now.
text: He blows a dismissive raspberry.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...It's a fad.
text: He pats at his robe, produces a white cigar.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Anyway. I hear you've been having,
dialog: uh...
text: He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist, lighting it.
text: He lights the cigar off his thumb, takes a puff.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Been having some problems with
dialog: the board. The more things change,
dialog: know what Iyayayeeeeee...
text: Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his
text: flaming thumb, which he now waves frantically about.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts...
dialog: Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I
dialog: guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws
dialog: to ya, huh, Norman?
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Norville.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Mm. Well, say what you like about
dialog: the man's ethics, he's a balls-to-
dialog: the-wall businessman. Beat ya any
text: way he can. Straight for the jugular.
dialog: Very effective.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Yes sir...
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Anyway. Any particular reason you
dialog: didn't give him my Blue Letter? I
dialog: mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying
dialog: man's last words and wishes, no big
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I
dialog: apologize, there was an awful lot of
dialog: excitement and I guess I must've
dialog: mislaid --
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: It's sittin' in your apron pocket,
dialog: right where you left it. Imbecile.
text: Norville reaches in and -- pulls out the wrinkled Blue Letter.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Oh, geez.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is
dialog: grounds for dismissal.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Geez, I --
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna
dialog: add to your woes. I'm just saying.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Yessir.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Well, why don't ya read it.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Yeah, go ahead. Might learn somethin'.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: Yes sir...
text: He tears open the envelope, reads:
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: 'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker.
dialog: To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding.
dialog: My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you
dialog: read this, I will have joined the
dialog: organization upstairs -- an exciting
dialog: new beginning. I will retain fond
dialog: memories of the many years you and I --
dialog: '
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Yeah, yeah, it's the standard
dialog: resignation boilerplate -- go down
text: to the second paragraph.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: 'Many years, uh... I know that you
dialog: will be wondering why I have decided
dialog: to move on, ending my tenure at
dialog: Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You
dialog: will be thinking, Why now, when things
dialog: are going so well? Granted, from the
dialog: standpoint of our balance sheet and
dialog: financials, sure, sure, we're doing
dialog: fine. However, Sid. These things
dialog: have long since ceased to give me
dialog: pleasure. I look at myself now and
dialog: no longer see the idealistic young
dialog: man who started this company. Now I
text: see only an empty shell whom others
dialog: call a 'success.' How has this come
dialog: to pass? When and why did I trade
dialog: all of my hopes, dreams and
dialog: aspirations, for the emptiness of
dialog: power and wealth? What the heck have
dialog: I done?
text: As Norville reads Hudsucker casually examines his fingernails,
text: then pats down a yawn.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: '...Looking back now, Sid, I see
dialog: that I allowed time and age to corrupt
dialog: my dreams. Instead of fiercely
dialog: guarding what was timeless inside of
dialog: myself, I let the hubbub of earthly
dialog: commerce erode my character, and
dialog: dissolve my better self. How is it
dialog: that some manage to preserve
dialog: themselves where I have failed?
dialog: Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if
dialog: others love you, you may more securely
dialog: love yourself -- but I am alone. I
dialog: loved a woman once, Sid, as you well
dialog: know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady,
dialog: an angel who in her wisdom saw fit
dialog: to choose you instead of I...'
text: Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up.
text: Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief.
text: He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently
text: quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Skip this part...
text: He waves his hankie in get-on-with-it circles.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Last paragraph, last paragraph.
text: Norville looks down the page.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: '...And so, Sid, the future does not
dialog: belong to such as I -- nor even you.
dialog: We have made our compromises with
dialog: time. The future belongs to the young,
dialog: who may more energetically wage the
dialog: battle against corruption.
dialog: Accordingly, in the spirit of hope,
dialog: and the ringing in of the new, I
dialog: hereby bequeath my entire interest
dialog: in the company, and my seat on the
dialog: board, to whomever is Hudsucker's
dialog: most recent employee at the time of
dialog: my demise. I know this will disappoint
dialog: you -- you, Sid, who have served so
dialog: diligently and for so long. But --'
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: -- tough titty toenails!
text: He roars with laughter.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...That'll show the bastard!
text: He merrily wipes his eyes.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Yeah, go ahead.
speaker_heading: NORVILLE
dialog: '...But Sid, let me urge you to work
dialog: closely with the new president, and
dialog: to keep giving Hudsucker Industries
dialog: all your energies -- but not your
dialog: soul. For while we must strive for
dialog: success, we must not worship it.
dialog: Long live the Hud. Waring
dialog: Hudsucker...'
text: Norville gives a musingly appreciative nod.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Geez.
dialog: Pleased with himself:
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Yup. It's all there. Well, see that
text: it gets delivered in the morning.
text: Hudsucker picks up his lyre and heads back up toward the
dialog: stars.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: Sheeel beeee...
scene_heading: MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE
text: Mussburger still sits frozen in his chair. Outside the great
text: arched window Hudsucker rises, through the falling snow, on
text: his way back to the heavens.
speaker_heading: HUDSUCKER
dialog: ...Ridin' six white horses, She'll
dialog: be ridin' six white horses She'll be
dialog: ridin' six white horses When she
dialog: comes...
text: We hear a great WRENCHING SOUND from the GEAR ROOM next door.
speaker_heading: GEAR ROOM
text: Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear.
text: With a LOW MOAN the CLOCKWORKS start to shudder and turn --
speaker_heading: SWEEP SECOND HAND
dialog: Lurching forward --
scene_heading: PERPETUAL MOTION BALL
dialog: Swinging down --
scene_heading: EXT. PAVEMENT
text: As Norville falls the last few feet and lands on his face
text: with one last mighty BONG of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.
speaker_heading: BOOM DOWN
text: FROM a tavern sign that says ANN'S 440, DOWN TO the front
text: door, which Norville is entering.
scene_heading: INT. ANN'S
text: Sitting halfway down the bar is Amy, staring morosely into a
text: coffee cup. AT the CUT we are TRACKING BACK, PULLING AWAY
speaker_heading: FROM her.
text: Norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the Go Eagles
text: sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading
text: his fingers.
text: Two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little
dialog: tipsy:
speaker_heading: LOU (O.S.)
dialog: What the heck's he doin', Benny?
text: Amy looks at Norville, startled. After a moment she
text: reciprocates the sign.
speaker_heading: BENNY (O.S.)
dialog: What the heck's she doin', Lou?
speaker_heading: LOU (O.S.)
dialog: What the heck they doin'?
text: Norville and Amy embrace.
speaker_heading: BENNY (O.S.)
dialog: You know what they're doin' now,
dialog: Lou.
speaker_heading: LOU (O.S.)
dialog: This I know, Benny.
speaker_heading: BENNY (O.S.)
dialog: This you're familia' with.
text: Our PULL BACK ENDS LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the bar, TOWARDS
text: Norville and Amy, now in WIDE SHOT. Resting on the bar in
text: the extreme f.g. are two champagne glasses, half-full of
text: fizzing champagne.
text: Norville and Amy kiss.
speaker_heading: LOU (O.S.)
dialog: ...Geez.
speaker_heading: BENNY (O.S.)
dialog: ...Geez.
text: We hear LABORED, RASPY BREATHING.
speaker_heading: LOU (O.S.)
dialog: ...Y'all right, Benny?
text: In a quavering voice:
speaker_heading: BENNY (O.S.)
dialog: ...Yeah, I'm... It's just... It's
dialog: beautiful, Lou!
text: Lou also is beginning to sound choked up:
speaker_heading: LOU (O.S.)
dialog: It is beautiful, Benny.
text: Almost weeping as Norville and Amy continue their embrace:
speaker_heading: BENNY (O.S.)
dialog: ...It's the most beautiful t'ing I
dialog: ever saw.
speaker_heading: LOU (O.S.)
dialog: It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever
dialog: saw.
text: A BARTENDER ENTERS to BLOCK our VIEW of Norville and Amy.
text: He is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a
text: sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves. He looks to either side at
dialog: Benny and Lou.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You cats comin' from a party?
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Cabbies' affair.
speaker_heading: LOU
text: Hacks' New Year's gala.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Crazy. Get you anything else? Sangria?
dialog: Carrot juice? Herbal tea?
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar.
text: Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long
text: flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. On the bar next to him
text: sits a large hourglass.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Bromo.
text: Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby
text: bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly
dialog: that says "1959."
text: He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in
text: air, then blows it back out.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: ...Bromo.
speaker_heading: BLUE LETTER
text: Lying on the boardroom table. As a hand enters to lay a
text: wristwatch on the table next to it, we hear the voice of
text: Moses, the old maintenance man.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: And so began 1959. The new year...
text: The hand reenters to lay down a wallet, and then to deposit
text: a burning cigar in an ashtray.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...And the start of a new business
dialog: cycle. When he learned that Norville
dialog: owned the comp'ny, ol' Sidney was
text: upset at first.
text: We TILT UP to show that Mussburger is walking toward the
text: boardroom window. Board members silently remonstrate with
text: him as he tries to wrench it open.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...It's a good thing Doc
dialog: Bromfenbrenner was there...
text: Doctor Bromfenbrenner stands to one side watching, brow
text: furrowed, a pencil pressed to his lips.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...'cause he was able to keep Sidney
dialog: from harmin' his ol' self.
dialog: We...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BARRED DOOR
text: being slammed behind Sidney who, straight-jacketed, is puffing
text: on a cigar as he is led away.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...Now Norville, he went on an' ruled
dialog: with wisdom and compassion...
speaker_heading: BOARDROOM
text: Again. Norville is eagerly pointing at a design he has up on
text: an easel: Under the heading BRAND NEW is a large circle. The
text: side view is a flat line.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...and started dreamin' up them
dialog: excitin' new ideas again. You know,
dialog: for kids!
text: The board members look at the design, puzzled.
text: Norville takes a drop cloth off of a piece of plastic on a
text: pedestal. He has the board's complete attention.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...An' that's the story of how
dialog: Norville Barnes climbed away up to
dialog: the forty-fourth floor of the
dialog: Hudsucker Buildin'...
text: He picks up the plastic disc and as he sails it we...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: As it floats out the boardroom window.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...an' then fell all the way down,
dialog: but didn't quite squish hisself.
text: We BOOM UP, AWAY FROM the boardroom, to the great Hudsucker
dialog: Clock.
speaker_heading: MOSES (V.O.)
dialog: ...Ya know, they say there was a man
dialog: who jumped from the fortyfifth
dialog: floor... but that's another story.
dialog: Heh-heh-heh! Ya-heh-heh-heh!
text: We FADE OUT on the clock as Moses' LAUGHTER grows distant
text: and END MUSIC SWELLS.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
