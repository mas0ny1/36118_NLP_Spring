dialog: Written by

dialog: Based on a novel by

scene_heading: FADE IN: SERIES OF ESTABLISHING SHOTS - DAY
text: Exterior scenes of St. Louis, particularly the riverside
dialog: industrial district. Even more important to establish than
text: the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters
dialog: would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes
dialog: as "Burst the Roosevelt Bubble," "Save the American Way of
dialog: Life," "Vote for Landon and Knox."
scene_heading: EXT. FACTORY - DAY
text: One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket
text: line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is
text: anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct
text: conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance
dialog: open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a
text: small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this
text: that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets
text: or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction
text: pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
text: A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault
text: them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter,
text: dirty and noisy.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD
text: The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are
text: clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the
text: SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening
text: on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER
text: of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Somebody shut the goddam window. Let
dialog: a man think.
text: The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also
text: owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player.
text: Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table
text: look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies,
dialog: extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself
text: the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid
text: have almost all the money on the table between them, about a
dialog: hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more
text: than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt,
text: there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are
text: left in the hand.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Possible straight gets a --
dialog: (deals the card)
dialog: -- lovely little four.
speaker_heading: FIRST PLAYER
dialog: On the last hand even, you couldn't
dialog: give me a break.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: I put the brakes on your straight,
dialog: didn't I?
dialog: (he laughs; no one
dialog: else does; he deals
dialog: to The Kid)
dialog: There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: (deals to Danny)
dialog: And our lucky friend from Chicago
text: gets a queen with his pair of sixes.
dialog: Little lady make you happy, Buster?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Deal to yourself, clown.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Dealer gives himself a --
dialog: (deals card and groans)
dialog: I might have known.
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: Bet your sixes, Buster.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I told you not to call me that.
dialog: (then as the dealer
dialog: turns away)
dialog: Cost you --
dialog: (counts out his money)
dialog: Ninety-four bucks.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: Biggest pot of the whole game, I got
dialog: to drop.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to First Player)
dialog: Interested?
speaker_heading: FIRST PLAYER
dialog: Wouldn't call you if I had a pair
dialog: higher'n sixes. Which I ain't.
text: He turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Don't seem like he'd bet out without
dialog: something better than the sixes,
dialog: does it?
dialog: (fingers hole card as
dialog: if to fold)
dialog: Cost me every cent I've won since
dialog: yesterday afternoon.
dialog: (studies Danny's face)
dialog: But I tell you, I got this stubborn
dialog: streak. Call the ninety-four dollars.
text: He counts out the money, which is almost all he has.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: You can't have better than a pair of
dialog: kings!
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Oh, I'm not claiming anything that
dialog: fine.
dialog: (turns over an eight,
dialog: making a pair of
dialog: them)
text: Just enough to beat the pair of sixes.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You seen my hole card, you bastard!
dialog: (indicating Dealer)
dialog: He was dealing them high.
text: Attending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in
text: the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total.
text: Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely
text: in the face.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You stole that dough.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You better watch those loose lips of
dialog: yours, you want to have any teeth
dialog: left behind them -- Buster.
text: He stands up.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You wouldn't of shelled out ninety-
dialog: four bucks --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I called you on account of I didn't
dialog: think you had another pair or another
dialog: six and I know a punk like you would
dialog: get greedy and try and buy the last
dialog: hand.
text: He walks off, disappearing through a door marked "MEN."
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - THE KID AT MIRROR
text: He is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears,
text: his right hand in his coat pocket. The Kid's hand goes to
text: his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor
text: appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the
text: wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor
text: in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right
text: hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves
text: the razor blade against his neck.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Drop it.
text: As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the
text: door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough
text: momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left,
text: dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles
text: his way out through a window.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: MAIN TITLES
text: Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door
text: just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to
text: get out of the building and after The Kid.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BACK OF RESTAURANT - DAY
text: The conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on.
text: The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to
text: run toward the railroad yards. A few moments later, Danny
text: and four other poker players appear and run after him.
scene_heading: EXT. RAILROAD YARDS - DAY
text: The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits. The
text: Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and
text: they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track
text: on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the
text: station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting
text: beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst
text: of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger
text: train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the
text: train into the depot.
scene_heading: INT. UNION STATION, ST. LOUIS
text: The train slowly stops. Amid all the atmosphere of arrival
text: in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in
text: travel, LANCEY HODGES appears on a platform, takes his bag
text: from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before
text: he has descended the steps. He walks with other passengers
text: and Red Caps toward the center of the station.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
text: Shooting through the Meeting of the Rivers fountain across
text: Market Street to the Romanesque building with its campanile.
scene_heading: EXT. UNION STATION - TAXI STAND - DAY
text: Lancey getting into a taxi.
speaker_heading: THE CREDITS END
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - PROCESS - DAY
text: Lancey sits in serene repose in back, watching the sights go
text: by. The HACKIE steals a couple of looks at him in the rear
dialog: vision mirror.
speaker_heading: HACKIE
dialog: What you looking for, mister?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Do I have to be looking for something?
speaker_heading: HACKIE
dialog: I can pretty much tell.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: You can pretty much tell what?
speaker_heading: HACKIE
dialog: Some guys come to town, I can tell
dialog: if they're looking for something.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: What do you think I'm looking for?
speaker_heading: HACKIE
dialog: If you're looking for girls, I can
dialog: fix you up.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I strongly doubt if you could fix me
dialog: up. In that department.
speaker_heading: HACKIE
dialog: Well what are you looking for?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: You're looking for a clout in the
dialog: head if you don't keep your face to
dialog: the road.
scene_heading: EXT. PLUSH HOTEL - TAXI STAND - DAY
text: A doorman takes Lancey's suitcase as Lancey pays the Hackie
text: and walks into the hotel. A SECOND HACKIE whose cab is at
text: the curb reacts to seeing Lancey and steps forward.
speaker_heading: SECOND HACKIE
dialog: Hey, you know who that is?
speaker_heading: HACKIE
dialog: No. Who?
text: But the second hackie has followed Lancey into the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY OF PLUSH HOTEL
text: Lancey crosses to the desk to register as the Second Hackie
text: goes to a row of phone booths and enters one. He dials with
text: his eyes on Lancey registering.
speaker_heading: SECOND HACKIE
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Shorty? Want to hear who just checked
dialog: into the Park Sherman... Yes, you
dialog: do. Lancey Hodges.
scene_heading: INT. BOWLING ALLEY - ATTENDANT
text: He is talking on the phone while he hands out score sheets
text: and shoes to some bowlers. He is just as excited by the report
dialog: as the Hackie is.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: The Kid know?
scene_heading: INT. BAR - FEATURING THE BARTENDER
text: He is talking on the telephone behind the bar.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Somebody sure as hell ought to tell
dialog: The Kid.
dialog: (hangs up)
text: Lancey Hodges is in town.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - CLOSE SHOT - DRINKING MAN
text: He reacts to the news in a big way. CAMERA PANS to another
text: DRINKING MAN, who is equally impressed. They exchange looks.
scene_heading: FIRST DRINKING MAN
dialog: Kid's been laying for him a long
dialog: time.
scene_heading: INT. BARBER SHOP - BARBER AND CUSTOMER
speaker_heading: BARBER
dialog: You ask me, The Kid'll go after him
text: as soon as he hears.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Who's got a better right?
scene_heading: INT. HOBAN'S POOL ROOM - HOBAN AND THE SHOOTER
text: We are in the front room where the pool tables are. Through
text: an open door in b.g., we can see the unadvertised but
text: unconcealed other activity of the establishment: a poker
text: game in progress.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: You going to tell The Kid, Shooter?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Hell, I can't not tell him.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: It's where he's been headed for years.
text: The Kid enters the place through the front door, still a
text: little dishevelled from his escape.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (in greeting)
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: What you say, Kid?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Hey, Hoban.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Where you been? Boys been holding a
dialog: chair for you in back.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Business opportunity come along.
dialog: Something too good to pass up.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Turn a profit?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had
dialog: it took back.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Oh, one of those.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: You been in too many rough ones
dialog: lately, Kid. You can't go on forever,
text: coming out in one piece.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I got to build my stake, Aren't enough
dialog: chances in this town to let one go.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: You're too good, that's your trouble.
dialog: People who know you're the Cincinnati
dialog: Kid, they don't want to sit down
dialog: with you --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: For nickels and dimes... Thing is
dialog: I've about used up St. Louis.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: The streets are getting full of guys
dialog: you've hustled.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Been thinking about Miami. There's
dialog: nothing to keep me here.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: The hell there isn't
text: (as the Kid looks at
dialog: him)
dialog: Lancey Hodges' in town.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: (then)
dialog: The Man himself, here in St. Louis --
dialog: I might just stick around Shooter.
scene_heading: INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM
text: Lancey is on the phone, sitting on the bed.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mr. Schlaegel? How are you? And your
dialog: enchanting wife?... Tomorrow is quite
dialog: convenient... I generally prefer
dialog: stud but you name it... Your stakes
dialog: are my pleasure, sir... Thank you,
dialog: why don't we make it after lunch? My
dialog: diet these days is enough to spoil
dialog: anyone else's appetite... A pleasure,
dialog: sir. Please remember me to your
dialog: charming wife.
text: He hangs up and some of the strength seems to go out of him,
text: as if he had been through too long a sustained effort. His
text: eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply.
scene_heading: EXT. HAROLD STREET - DAY
text: Harold Street leads to the river and we follow The Kid and
text: The Shooter as they walk down it in the gathering dusk.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (lighting a cigar)
dialog: I been seeing it coming for a long
dialog: time, Kid. Long time.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I ain't exactly been hiding it.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: No, you ain't been hiding it.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well I got to know.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Sure, you got to know. We all got to
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Sometime or other we got to find out
dialog: how much juice we got.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: That's why I had to tell you.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You ever sit down with him?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Yes, I have.
text: They walk along, The Shooter pursing his lips thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well, what happened?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Nothing. Nothing at all.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You lost.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I didn't lose. I'm too good to lose
dialog: when I set my mind to it. I play
dialog: poker a certain way, Kid. I've had
dialog: my Lancey Hodges. Only with me it
dialog: was Whistling Sam Magee to New
dialog: Orleans.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (respectfully)
dialog: I heard about him.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Well then you know it all... about
dialog: 20 years ago it was, maybe more.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Why, I lost it. It dried me up on
text: the inside for a long, a very long
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I been where I'm going, know what I
dialog: mean?
text: The Kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends
text: into the river. Along the river bank can be seen a small
text: portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and
dialog: down the Mississippi.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER
text: They walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at
text: the river, watching the working boats. They have their
text: thoughts; The Shooter smoking his cigar.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You think I'm ready?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (after some time,
dialog: several seconds of
dialog: thoughtful puffing)
dialog: Kid, I don't think you're ready.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: But you're not going to take my word
dialog: for it, are you? Are you now?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: No, I ain't. I can't.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I know, I know. You got to find out
dialog: for yourself.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I don't figure to take him right
dialog: away. But if I can hang in there
dialog: long enough, I can outlast him. If I
dialog: can outlast him, I got a chance. You
dialog: admit that, don't you, that I got a
dialog: chance?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I already said I didn't think you
dialog: were ready.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Did you think you were ready when
dialog: you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Kid, I thought I was the best stud
dialog: poker player in the world. I'm telling
dialog: you now, I thought I was the best.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well, I don't think I'm just a cocky
text: square with a fair hand with cards.
dialog: I got something.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: No, you ain't no cocky square. And
dialog: you probably got something.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Okay. And I ain't saying that you
dialog: was either when you sat down with
text: Whistling Sam Magee.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: If you got the stuff, being a little
dialog: cocky don't hurt you none.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well, would you say if I got any
dialog: chance at all?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: This much of a chance. If Lancey is
dialog: not right. If he's got a cold, or
text: his stomach ulcer is acting up, or
dialog: something like that.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: But then everybody'd see he wasn't
dialog: right and it wouldn't prove nothing.
dialog: Listen, we got to have it understood.
dialog: If he's not right, we call it off
dialog: till he is.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: You're set on a real showdown, aren't
dialog: you? Your mind's all made up.
text: They start back off the pier.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I got to. You said yourself I got
dialog: to. I'm overdue.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Yeah, you been around a long time --
dialog: I was a lot younger than you when I
dialog: went up against Whistling Sam -- But
dialog: you'd be kinda young too, to be The
dialog: Man.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I gotta find out.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: Want me to set it up?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (gratefully)
dialog: I wish you would, Shooter Man.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Hey, what if he turns me down?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: He won't, the way I'll spread the
dialog: word. He'll have to take you on,
dialog: someone in your class. If he ducked
dialog: it, that'd make you The Man.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You think he knows I'm around?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: He can smell meat like you a mile
text: and a half up the river. He knows
dialog: you're around and he'll sit down
dialog: with you. You want to butt heads
dialog: with The Man, I'll set it up.
text: Ahead, on the levee, CHRISTIAN is seen waiting for The Kid.
text: She has not yet seen them as they approach off the pier.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: There's your woman.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I wouldn't want to wait around too
dialog: long. I want to get in and get it
text: over with.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: He must of come to St. Louis for a
dialog: big money game. I'll probably get
dialog: asked do I want to deal it for them.
dialog: And however long that takes, he'll
dialog: have to rest up for you.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar,
dialog: I can understand that. Sure.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: You got much of a stake?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Close to three grand.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Work on it. But three grand will
dialog: give you a ride and even if you don't
dialog: win, why you'll come away with a
dialog: good idea of what you're made of.
dialog: But once you go in Kid you can't
dialog: quit. You get that straight right
dialog: now. Two of you go in and only one
dialog: of you can come out.
text: Christian sees them and moves toward them.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well, school's out. I damn sure don't
dialog: want no lessons. I want everything
dialog: he's got.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: It's the only way to be, Kid.
text: Shooter turns away abruptly as Christian arrives, giving her
text: a brief nod.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: See you.
text: The Kid takes Christian's arm automatically; he watches The
text: Shooter walk way down Harold Street. He and Christian head
text: in another direction. She is humming a mountain tune.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: When we leaving town, Kid? This week?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: No, I won't be ready. Not for a while.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I thought --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Might even turn out we don't go.
text: She is surprised by this and, in her own hesitant way,
dialog: curious.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: You must feel different about it
dialog: than you did Saturday.
text: He looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of
text: weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey. But
text: it is too sharp a break with tradition.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah, I'm feeling a little different.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: INT. KID'S BEDROOM
text: It is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where
text: Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window,
text: turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue. In f.g.
text: The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes
text: closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. He
text: opens his eyes and turns to look at her. The movement catches
text: her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid
text: the noise has disturbed him.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: It's all right. You don't have to
dialog: act like a cat. You're not bothering
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: You want me to turn out the light?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: No. I'm overtired, that's why I can't
dialog: sleep.
text: (sits up and swings
dialog: his feet to the floor)
dialog: Why can't you sleep?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Undertired, I guess. If a person
dialog: rests all day, she doesn't have much
dialog: to rest up from at night.
dialog: (stands up)
dialog: Why don't you have a nice hot bath?
dialog: I could give you a rubdown and then
dialog: you could have a nice hot bath, and
dialog: then maybe you could sleep.
text: She waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a
dialog: decision.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: 'Kay. Can't hurt to try it.
text: She goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on
text: gently so the tub will take a long while to fill. Then she
text: takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns
text: to the bedroom with it. She stands in front of him waiting
text: for him to move, but The Kid is singularly listless. Not
text: till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his
text: face to the pillow. She goes right to work on his shoulder
text: muscles, and she seems to know what she is doing.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What did you do with yourself this
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Last night I went to a movie with
text: The Shooter's woman. French movie.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: In French?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: They had the words in English at the
dialog: bottom of the picture. But The
dialog: Shooter's woman knew what they were
dialog: saying without it. Pig's woman or
dialog: somebody told me she went to college.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Sure. Majored in man-eating.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I think maybe she really did go. But
dialog: I never quite dared to up and ask
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I didn't know you ran with The
dialog: Shooter's woman.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: We got to be kind of friendly when
dialog: you both were in that three-day game
dialog: down to Cairo. 'Course she's older'n
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: And been around more. A lot more.
dialog: What was the movie like?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Weird. It wasn't a straight story
dialog: where you knew whose side you were
dialog: on, the way you do in regular
dialog: pictures.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: American pictures.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Yeah. There were lots of things I
dialog: didn't understand.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What was it about?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Well, there's this town in Europe a
dialog: long time ago where they get a message
dialog: from a Spanish general he's coming
text: to spend the night with his troops.
dialog: So all the men are scared silly about
dialog: what the soldiers will do to them.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Nothing weird about that.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: But all the wives and daughters tell
dialog: the men to go hide somewhere and let
text: them bargain with the enemy.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That don't make much sense.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Wait. The way they handle it is they
dialog: go to bed with the Spaniards. And
text: the next morning the soldiers go off
text: peacefully and everybody's happy.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Including the husbands and fathers?
dialog: Don't they suspect?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: That's part of what I wasn't sure
dialog: of. I guess they know what went on
dialog: but they care more about their safety
dialog: and their money than they do about
dialog: their honor.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Then they got their heads screwed on
dialog: straight. Honor's just an idea. You
dialog: can't see or feel it and you can't
dialog: eat it and you sure as hell can't
dialog: get any mileage on it.
text: She slaps him on the rump and straightens up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I'll just turn off the bath water.
text: He doesn't move but just stays relaxed and closes his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Christian, humming softly, turns off the water, takes a large
text: towel from a rack and puts it on a stool by the tub where it
text: will be more convenient for him. She lingers to test the
dialog: water with her finger and do anything else she can think of
text: to assure maximum comfort for her man. Then she steps back
text: into the bedroom. The sight of him makes her advance
text: cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep.
scene_heading: INT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT
text: MELBA, The Shooter's woman, is sitting up in bed working on
text: her eyebrows and listening to MUSIC turned up LOUD on a radio.
text: The bedside phone RINGS, barely audible above the radio. She
dialog: answers it.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello... Yes, it is. You want him?
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Shooter! Telephone! Shooter!
text: She gets no answer, which is no wonder in view of the noise
text: from the radio. But the radio is across the room and it's
text: slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed
text: she's on, and go to the door of The Shooter's room. She opens
text: this and we see The Shooter in bed in his own small quarters,
text: reading a magazine. He turns around inquiringly.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Phone for you. I always seem to be
dialog: the one to answer it, no matter who
dialog: it's for.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: If you'd rather we put it in my room --
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Are you kidding?
text: The Shooter picks up the phone but before he speaks into it,
text: he pantomimes to her that he won't be able to hear over the
text: radio. She seems to regard the request as an imposition but
text: she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little
text: before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello?... Well, hello. What brings
dialog: you to our fair city? Little action,

speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (into phone)
text: Owns most of the Schlaegel Brewery.
dialog: Braumeister beer.
text: The Shooter sits down on the edge of Melba's bed, the movement

text: exclaims in protest and gives him a dirty look that makes
text: The Shooter stand right up again.
scene_heading: INT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: As he put it, rather bluntly, I felt,
dialog: we don't want everyone to have to
dialog: watch everyone else dealing to see
dialog: to it they don't make any little
dialog: accidental errors by mistake. I told
dialog: him a man couldn't ask for a better
dialog: guarantee of a fair-and-square game
dialog: than having The Shooter deal it. So
dialog: if you're willing, we're meeting at
dialog: two o'clock in the afternoon. Ask
dialog: for Mr. Schlaegel's suite at the
dialog: Park Sherman... Good. I'm glad you
dialog: can do it, Shooter. Be a pleasure to
dialog: see you again...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oh pretty much the same... Just have
dialog: to be a little careful about smoking
dialog: and drinking and eating -- and
dialog: breathing. See you tomorrow. Good
dialog: night.

text: the title: Prescott's CONQUEST OF PERU.
scene_heading: INT. KID'S APARTMENT
text: It is midday outside but the window shades are tightly drawn
text: to keep the daylight from disturbing The Kid, who is still
text: asleep. Christian, dressed for the street, moves from the
text: bedroom to the kitchen-living room which is the remainder of
text: the two-room apartment. Finding paper and pencil, she writes

dialog: bare midriff -- the first modest forerunner of the trend
dialog: that led eventually to the bikini.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Would you wear it in public?
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Christian and Melba looking at
text: the display.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Wouldn't be much point wearing it in

text: They start walking.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I don't know, Melba.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: (looking her over)
dialog: My guess is there isn't anything

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: You find a guy, you love him, and
dialog: that's it. It's supposed to just go
dialog: on like that for life. Right?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: According to the propaganda, right.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: But it isn't my life, it's his life,
dialog: with me tacked on. You have any idea
dialog: what it's like to be a hash slinger
dialog: in a cheap restaurant?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: No, honey, the stock crash wafted me
text: right from the daisy chain into
dialog: unmarried bliss.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: It's hell, if you'll excuse the word.
dialog: But I didn't want to quit. The Kid
dialog: made me. I felt I ought to hang on
dialog: to something that was me away from
dialog: him. You know what I mean?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Sure. Some girls solve the problem
text: by taking on an extra guy.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I'm serious. Having children might
dialog: take care of it, I don't know. Or --
dialog: this is really a terrible thing to
dialog: admit.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Your most sordid secrets are safe
dialog: with me. Confess.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: If he was rich, or famous --
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Why don't you give him both?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Why not? Well, if he was rich and
dialog: famous, maybe I wouldn't mind so
dialog: much just being -- just a woman to
dialog: him. Do you think that might make it
dialog: seem more worthwhile somehow?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Somehow! Are you sincere, sweetie?
dialog: (reacting to the
dialog: masseur's touch)
dialog: Oooo -- divine.
dialog: (to Christian)
dialog: Isn't this heaven?

scene_heading: INT. ROOM IN PLUSH HOTEL
text: Lancey, Shooter and five other men are sitting in comfortably
text: padded chairs around a well-appointed poker table. Everything

text: sandwiches, etc. Lancey's opponents are all wealthy types;
dialog: two of them could be Texas oil men. The youngest, a good-

dialog: I'd go home and see Mama.
speaker_heading: KID

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN

speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Any special reason?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Me. I'm special.

speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Sure you are. You're The Shooter's

speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Right. And maybe I'll go on being

speaker_heading: KID

speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Yeah, he's going to give you trouble.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I don't want it to be one of those

speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Like the session with The Portugee

speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Sure, sure. Longest game I ever played

speaker_heading: SHOOTER

speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Depends how you look at it. When we

dialog: Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks
dialog: and missed the gold rush.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: You been around a long time.
speaker_heading: LANCEY

speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something

speaker_heading: LANCEY

speaker_heading: FELIX
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but Mr.

speaker_heading: MELBA

speaker_heading: MELBA

speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I don't like waiting that long.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Let's not kick a gift horse in the

speaker_heading: KID

speaker_heading: MELBA

speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I've made dolls that were friends of

dialog: willing, they were doing it to their
dialog: husbands, I wasn't.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Of course. Any other attitude, you're
dialog: degrading the woman. You're not
dialog: treating her as a person with a mind
dialog: of her own, but as somebody's
dialog: property.
text: Again she presses close to him and again he savors her for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Only thing is, it's different with
dialog: The Shooter than anybody else. He's
dialog: so straight, I got the obligation to
dialog: be straighter with him than other
dialog: people. So do you. On account of we
dialog: both owe him plenty.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: I thought we just agreed that what

speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Can't be.
dialog: (decisively, pulling

dialog: Shooter's the closest thing to family

speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I've been quite busy on the telephone
dialog: since I last saw you. There's a lot
dialog: of interest all over the country in

speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Betting interest?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Jack Doyle in New York is giving
dialog: twelve to five on Lancey. Same odds
dialog: in Reno. I've taken fifty thousand
dialog: of it so far.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Fifty thousand!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'll probably go for more but I didn't
dialog: want to rock the odds.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I knew you liked The Kid's style but
dialog: why you going in so deep?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Two reasons. First, I want to see
dialog: that smug old bastard gutted worse
dialog: than he gutted me. Second, as long
dialog: as that's going to happen, I don't
dialog: see why I shouldn't make some money
text: out of it.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: But how can you be so sure? The Kid
dialog: could do it, we both know that, but --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: "Could" isn't good enough for a man
dialog: who hates to lose money as much as I
dialog: do. He's going to need help -- from
text: the best man with a pack of cards
dialog: between Omaha and New Orleans.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Not a chance, Bill. You ought to
dialog: know I never ever use what I got
dialog: with the cards for nothing but tricks
text: and dressing up a game.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sure, I know it. That's why you're
dialog: the man they choose to give them a
dialog: square deal. That's what makes it so
dialog: perfect. Nobody'll be looking for
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
text: It's out. Out.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The great thing is they'll be so
dialog: close, The Kid won't need much. Three
dialog: or four key hands.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Understand this, Bill. I'd like for
dialog: The Kid to win, and I sure as hell
dialog: don't want to see you lose all that
dialog: money --
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: If I did, I'd have to collect that
dialog: twelve grand you owe me. Not myself.
dialog: My collection agents. You knew poor
dialog: Wildwood Jones, didn't you?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: OK but I'm paying it off! It's comin'
dialog: in ain't it? Six grand already.
dialog: (then as Bill just
dialog: looks at him)
dialog: Bill, you got to listen to me --!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: No, I don't. It's quite the other

dialog: you're a free agent, but you're not.
dialog: I own you.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: For God's sake --!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Shut up. I'll cross the twelve off

text: the rustle of the first can.
text: At the same time he begins to sing a simple song in a pure,

dialog: and me'll be at this another hour or

speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I think I will. I think I'd like
dialog: that.

dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Sure. And I'll see you a little later
dialog: on.

scene_heading: EXT. CRAIGIE BARN - CRAIGIE - DAY
text: He is pitching manure from all over the cow-lot into a pile
text: banked against the side of the barn, working a long-handled
text: shovel with practised ease. He looks o.s. and sees The Kid
text: approaching but continues his work as The Kid enters the

text: except at moments of particular significance to him.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: How do you do, Mr. Craigie. I'm Eric
dialog: Stoner.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Christian's Eric.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: You seen her?
speaker_heading: KID
text: She's helping her mother can.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: You minding to marry Christian?
text: The Kid looks at him a long moment then --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You got any objections if I do, or
dialog: if I don't?
text: Craigie takes a couple of steps toward The Kid, his boots
text: sucking in the muddy ground.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Son, that's what I call a sharp
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: It was what I call a sharp question.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: We don't know much about you,
dialog: Christian's mother and me.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'm what's known as a three-river
dialog: man. Which just means I go around
dialog: playing stud poker wherever I can
dialog: find the kind of action I'm looking
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: You met Christian when she was working
dialog: to Hot Springs?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah. I was playing in this game in
dialog: the hotel and she was a waitress in
dialog: the coffee shop. We went out. I told
dialog: her I thought she could get a better
dialog: job in St. Louis.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Now how did you happen to tell her
dialog: that? Maybe you run some kind of
dialog: employment service on the side?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I said it because I wanted her in
dialog: St. Louis. Anyway, she made it there
dialog: and she called me and we been seeing
dialog: each other ever since.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Living together?
text: The Kid takes his time before deciding how to answer this
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah, living together.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: How come she come home now? She going
dialog: to have a baby?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Not that I know of.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: You two have a fight?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: She must have had a reason.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Think so? Well, you've known her
dialog: longer than me.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look, Mr. Craigie, let me and
dialog: Christian find out a few things then
dialog: maybe I won't have to answer your
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: I never run across anybody like you.
dialog: I guess I don't understand gamblers.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That's all right. I don't understand
dialog: farmers.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: You say things that sound smart
dialog: alecky. But I'm not sure if they
dialog: really are smart alecky.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well I can't take into account what
dialog: somebody's going to feel every time
dialog: I say something.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Are you a believer?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: In some things.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: I mean in God.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That's a tough one. I don't disbelieve
dialog: in Him, but I couldn't say I believed
dialog: in Him either. I guess I just never
dialog: paid Him much mind. Didn't seem
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: God not important?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I don't mean what He does isn't
dialog: important -- if He exists. I mean
dialog: it's not important to me whether He
dialog: exists or not.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Christian was raised in a Christian
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Is that so? I didn't know ---
dialog: (then)
dialog: I'm not aware of the difference.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm not asking permission to marry
dialog: Christian, you know.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: If I was, the only person I'd be
dialog: asking it from is her.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Who is this fella Christian says
dialog: you're going to play that's so
dialog: important?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: He's the king of the stud poker
dialog: players.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: And you're going to play him.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Are you any good?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'm this good. The Man has got to
dialog: play me.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: What happens if he don't?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Then I'm The Man.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: That important to you?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I been trying to figure that out
dialog: ever since I set it up.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: You playing because of money?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Christian said you never was much
dialog: worried about money -- I been worried
dialog: about money most of my life -- up
dialog: until I figured out it wasn't so
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: No, it's necessary, but it isn't so
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Well how come you want to play this
dialog: King fella?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Ambition -- maybe security, like
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Is it aspiration to be the King or
dialog: just uncertainty about the future?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I ain't looking for security if that's
dialog: what you mean.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Not trying to lock something up tight
dialog: and nail it down?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That would figure into it. But that
dialog: isn't all of it. -- It's important
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Now son which is more important to
dialog: you, this king business or Christian?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: If you got the guts to ask that
dialog: question, Mr. Craigie, I guess I got
dialog: the guts to answer it. Christian, if
dialog: you came right down to it, is not as
dialog: important as doing what I have to
dialog: do.
text: Craigie has finished piling the manure. He puts away his
dialog: shovel.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Well son, I had to know.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Know what?
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: There never was a man worth a damn,
dialog: to my mind, who let his woman stand
dialog: in the way of the thing he had to
dialog: do.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I got to go now -- see what I can do
dialog: for a sick heifer. Why don't you
dialog: take Christian, when her Mama lets

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: You must have said something to Papa
dialog: gave him the picture on us in St.

speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I told him on account of he already

scene_heading: EXT. CRAIGIE PORCH - CRAIGIE AND THE KID - NIGHT
text: The two men are sitting just outside the kitchen, where Mrs.
text: Craigie and Christian are pasting labels on the mason jars
text: they filled earlier. The paste and some of the jars are just
text: inside an open window on a shelf behind the men's heads. The
text: light comes from a kerosene lamp inside.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Let me get this straight in my head.
dialog: Cards is all a matter of luck, who
dialog: gets dealt the best ones.
text: The Kid stands up and selects six playing cards from a deck
text: in his pocket. During the next few lines he uses the paste
dialog: on the shelf to stick together three pairs of them so as to
text: form three double-thick cards. One of these has two faces,
text: another two backs, and the third a back and a face.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: So when one of you professional
text: gamblers sits down with a bunch of
dialog: your -- what do you call them --
dialog: customers, clients?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: The technical term is "suckers." Or
dialog: "marks."
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Their chance of winning is just as
dialog: good as yours, except if you got a
dialog: way to control it, who gets what
dialog: cards. Right?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Not right. That's cheating and it's
dialog: not any part of what we're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Then how do you win?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'll show you.
text: He displays his three cards.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You see one of these cards is white
text: on both sides, one is red on both
text: sides, and the other is white on one
text: side, red on the other.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: What about it?
text: The Kid lifts a straw hat off a peg on the porch wall.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: This. I put the three cards in a hat
dialog: and shake them up, and then I ask
dialog: you to draw one card out blind. Put
text: it face down on the table so neither
text: of us can see the bottom side.
text: Craigie does as instructed. The ensuing dialogue assumes the
text: card he picks is red on top; if it's white the words "red"
text: and "white" will be reversed in the dialogue.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Okay, red on top. That eliminates
dialog: the all-white card, right. So the
dialog: card you've picked is one of two --
dialog: the all-red or the red-and-white.
dialog: One out of two is an even chance, an
dialog: even-money proposition. Right -- you
dialog: follow me?
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: So if I said I'll bet you a dollar
dialog: to seventy-five cents the other side
dialog: of that card is red, you'd take the
dialog: bet wouldn't you?
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Seems like. Yeah.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: And that answer makes you a sucker.
dialog: Because the odds are two to one, the
text: other side of that card is red, and
dialog: I ought to be offering you a dollar
dialog: to fifty cents instead of seventy-
dialog: five.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: But if there are just the two
dialog: possibilities.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: There are three possibilities.
dialog: (indicating card on
dialog: table)
dialog: That can be the red side of the red-
dialog: and-white card, or it can be either
text: side of the all-red card. In two
dialog: cases out of three the other side is
dialog: red. And I'd win the bet from you
dialog: two out of every three times we made
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: (dubiously)
dialog: You would?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Sure. It's obvious when I explain
dialog: it, isn't it?
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Reckon so. Except if there's only
dialog: two things that the bottom side can
dialog: be, red or white --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Take my word for it -- the odds are
dialog: two to one. And knowing that is the
dialog: difference between your gambling man
dialog: and your sucker. Not who gets the
dialog: better cards but who knows what the
dialog: proper odds are. In a poker game
dialog: there can be a million different
dialog: situations, each with a different
text: set of odds to figure. The man who
text: ends up winners is the man who knows
dialog: when to bet and how much...
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: The sucker is still took advantage
dialog: of, isn't he? The gambler knows
dialog: something he don't know.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Sure -- like if you grow better corn
dialog: or raise a cow that gives more milk
dialog: than the other guy's. Or two business
dialog: men are in competition, or two lawyers
dialog: are up against each other in a
dialog: courtroom. Whatever your line is,
dialog: the one who wins out is the one who
dialog: knows his job better.
speaker_heading: CRAIGIE
dialog: Seems like there should be something
dialog: else to it --
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: There is -- Making the man you're
dialog: playing against think he's got the
dialog: best hand -- and making him pay to
dialog: find out.

dialog: It's an old table. Everything's pretty
dialog: old in this hotel.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: It's solid, that's what counts. And
dialog: you got the top fixed perfect.
text: Lancey comes into the SHOT behind them.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Light all right for you?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
text: Two hundred watt bulb.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Fine, excellent. Okay with you?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Sure, sure. Shooter's set us up just
dialog: great.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Sure has.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Thank you, gents. Tried to do the
dialog: best I could.
dialog: (looks from one to
dialog: the other)
dialog: Cards?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Good a time as any.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Hoban! Okay!
dialog: (to Kid and Lancey)
dialog: You both know Joe Hoban. He's a draw
text: poker man, but clean and straight as
dialog: they come.
text: Hoban comes into the SHOT with a dispatch case, which he
text: sets on the table. He unlocks it with a key and turns it
text: upside down. Thirty sealed decks of cards spill on the table.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: They come from the St. Louis Bridge
dialog: Club, but they're poker size cards.
text: They been bonded by the club steward
dialog: and I seen him take them out of the
dialog: safe. Shooter, Lady Fingers and me
dialog: pick them up and come straight here
dialog: with them.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Hoban's selling them to us at five
dialog: dollars a pack, with the usual
dialog: guarantee. If it's proved any deck
text: is spooked, he pays off the losers.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: St. Louis Bridge Club, eh? Steward
dialog: still that old yard bird Okra?
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: (disturbed)
dialog: That's him.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (not noticing; to Kid)
dialog: Old stud man, Okra.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I don't know him.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Quite a character. Quite a character.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: (anxiously)
dialog: Nobody heard from me what the cards
dialog: were for, Kid.
text: There is a quick exchange of glances all around as the other
text: three realize what the imaginary suspicion is behind Hoban's
dialog: defensive reaction.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (to Kid)
dialog: Been ten years since I seen or spoke
dialog: to Old Okra.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: 'Kay, fine. Don't worry about it,
dialog: Lancey. Who's sitting down with us,
dialog: Shooter?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Four of us. Me, Pig, Yeller and Doc
dialog: Sokal. If that's all right with you
dialog: both?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: 'Kay, fine.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Sure, sure.
dialog: (to Kid)
dialog: Shall we have a look at the decks?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - KID AND LANCEY
text: with the pile of decks and the empty dispatch case on the
text: table in front of them. They start checking the decks one by
text: one, each putting the ones he has covered in a pile for the
text: other's consideration. They examine the seals and the
text: cellophane visually, and they also sniff both ends for the
text: odor of a hot iron. By the time they are through with this
dialog: process; The Kid has found three decks he isn't satisfied
text: with, and Lancy two. The Kid passes his three rejects to
text: Lancey, who tosses them back into the dispatch case without
text: looking at them. Then Lancey tries to submit his two to The
text: Kid, but The Kid waves them away, and Lancey throws them,
dialog: too, into the case.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Well, Kid, what's your game?
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the other four players, who
text: have come up to the table, still not taking chairs until
text: Lancey and The Kid have chosen theirs. Though Lancey's
text: question is purely ritualistic, they look to The Kid for his
dialog: reply.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I don't mind stud poker if that's
dialog: okay with you.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I got no objections to stud.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Gentlemen?
text: Consulting the others is a formality, but all four of them --
text: Yeller, Shooter, Pig and Sokal -- nod or grunt or otherwise
dialog: indicate assent.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - FEATURING BILL
text: across the room, he is indicating to The Shooter that he'd
text: like a word with him before play begins.
scene_heading: MED. SHOT - FEATURING SHOOTER
text: He detaches himself from the group and sidles inconspicuously
dialog: over to Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Tell The Kid I have a suite on the
text: fifth floor. He can drop up during
text: the breaks. Bedroom all for him any
dialog: time he wants a nap.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: That's thoughtful of you, Bill.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'm a thoughtful man. I hope you
dialog: are.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The Kid gestures to Lancey to choose his seat. Lancey
text: acknowledges the courtesy, glances at the window and picks
text: himself a chair facing away from it.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Privilege of age. Can't take the
text: glare of the morning sun in my eyes.
text: The Kid, following protocol, moves to a seat directly across
text: from Lancey's. The Shooter takes his place at the table
text: halfway between The Kid and Lancey, and pulls the twenty-
text: five eligible packs of cards to him.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: You want to have the usual brandy
dialog: and coffee on hand, Kid? Anything
dialog: special for you, Lancey?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Why, yes, Shooter. Creme de menthe
text: frappe. Green.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (glances around)
dialog: You got that, Hoban?
dialog: (to the table)
dialog: Gentlemen, if there are no objections,
dialog: I'm the dealer. These rooms have
dialog: been contracted for, and there will
dialog: be an ante of ten dollars per chair,
dialog: per day. During the breaks for me,
dialog: Old Lady Fingers has agreed to deal,
dialog: but she don't care to be a player --
scene_heading: LADY FINGERS' VOICE
dialog: Do too care!
text: CAMERA PANS to reveal Lady Fingers as she steps from among
text: the spectators to a place behind Lancey.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Can't afford to play, that's the
dialog: real truth. Had a bad year and I'm
dialog: way over my edge.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Lady Fingers will get three dollars
text: an hour from the ante, plus her room
text: and food, and a five-minute break
dialog: every hour. Gents?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Fine, Shooter man.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: 'Kay with us.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: If you don't see me when you need
dialog: me, call room three-oh-eight.
dialog: (taps Lancey's shoulder)
dialog: You know who else ain't with us no
dialog: more? Miriam, widow used to run the
dialog: kitchen game to South Chi. Lost two
dialog: month's Relief at blackjack, coal
dialog: dealer cut her credit, and she froze
text: in her bed.
scene_heading: THE PLAYERS - FEATURING THE KID
text: The Kid has taken his roll from his pocket and is counting
text: it out rapidly. The other players watch, interested to see
text: how much he is putting out. After counting out one stack of
text: thirty hundreds, he distributes the rest in stacks of
text: twenties, tens and fives, folding each bill over once as
dialog: protection against picking up more than one at a time.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Gentlemen, this is a game of five-
dialog: card stud poker. There is no limit.
text: A dead man has one half hour to raise
text: his roll outside and get back in the
dialog: game.
text: The Kid has completed his count.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING LANCEY
text: He takes the money from his satchel.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Five grand? Nice, tidy sum. I'll put
dialog: out the same.
text: CAMERA PANS to Yeller.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: I swear I don't know what I'm doing
dialog: sitting down with you titans, but
dialog: maybe it's worth putting up five
dialog: thousand for the educational value.
text: CAMERA PANS to Pig as he brings out a roll and drops it
text: casually in front of him.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: I'll play with what I have in my
dialog: pocket till I have to send out for
dialog: more. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight
dialog: hundred, I don't know.
text: CAMERA PANS past The Kid to Sokal, who is counting out bills
text: from an impressive roll.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: Five G's, I'm with it. Don't mean
dialog: I'm goin' blow it all, though.
text: CAMERA PANS to The Shooter, who is counting out a smaller
dialog: stake than anyone.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Last and certainly least --
text: He puts his money out without counting it, takes a deck of
text: cards, rips the cellophane off it, takes the jokers and tosses
text: them offhandedly to one side, not seeming to take aim.
scene_heading: FEATURING THE JOKERS
text: Heads turn as the cards sail through the air in unison,
text: landing inside The Shooter's familiar hat, which is resting
text: crown down on the mantelpiece. The spectators gape at the
text: display of dexterity.
scene_heading: FEATURING THE SHOOTER
text: He begins to shuffle and all eyes are upon him, not from
text: suspicion but from pure admiration. He is in peak form,
text: shuffling six times, once for each player and then slapping
text: the cards down before Lancey, who is to the right of him,
text: with an empty chair in between.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - LANCEY
text: He waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible
dialog: nod.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The Shooter acknowledges the compliment with the same sort
text: of gesture. Then he begins to deal in his magnificently
text: precise way, pitching each card so that it comes to a stop
text: six inches in front of the player's money and in clear view
text: of everyone at the table.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - SHOOTER'S HANDS
text: With Sokal in b.g. It is notable that as The Shooter completes
text: dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card, there
text: is no visible difference in the motion of his hands. He calls
text: the cards as he deals them.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Seven, nine, trey, nine, ace, and
text: The Shooter guns up a ten. Ace bets.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Ten dollars.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
text: Dealer folds.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: Call the sawbuck.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - FROM BEHIND KID
text: He looks at his hole card: an ace.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'm in.
speaker_heading: PIG'S VOICE
dialog: Call.
speaker_heading: YELLER'S VOICE
dialog: Call.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The Shooter deals again.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: King to the seven, pair of nines,
dialog: deuce to the trey, queen-nine, ace-
dialog: eight.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Nines bet twenty bucks.
text: Each other player folds in turn. The Shooter pulls in the
text: cards, and The Kid pulls in the seventy dollars. The Shooter
text: shuffles and deals again.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Queen, ten, king, four, ace again,
dialog: and a king for The Shooter.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Ace bets ten dollars
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: King over.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - HOBAN AND BILL
text: They are perched on the back of a love seat at the far end
text: of the room, with their feet on the arms. This gives them a
text: view of the table through a pair of opera glasses they share,
text: but they are far enough from it to be able to discuss the
text: hands freely.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Shooter won't stay on a king or an
dialog: ace if there's another one showing.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's he have to have in the hole?
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Ten or better. With no other ten
dialog: showing.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The second round has been dealt. Sokal has a queen-eight,
text: The Kid a pair of tens, Pig a king- seven, Lancey an ace-
text: five. Yeller, like The Shooter, has folded on the first card.
text: The Kid makes the same bet of twenty dollars, and the other
text: three remaining players drop.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: New deck.
text: Unhesitatingly, The Shooter pulls in the cards, separates
text: them into four or five piles, and tears each pile in two. He
text: glances around, and Hoban comes up behind him. The Shooter
text: hands him the torn-up cards and unseals another pack, going
text: through the same routine of throwing the jokers into his
dialog: hat.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - AT THE POKER TABLE
text: It is around midnight, and there is a more settled look to
text: the game; some of the players have removed their coats, and
text: there is a good deal of smoke in the air. The Kid has a cup
text: of coffee by him, presumably with brandy in it; Lancey has
text: his frappe; Pig is drinking whiskey; the Shooter and Yeller
text: have bottles of bear. It is the end of a hand. With about
text: six hundred dollars in the pot, Pig, who has been called,
text: turns over his hole card triumphantly.
speaker_heading: PIG
text: Aces over eights.
dialog: (waits for a challenge,
dialog: but the others turn
dialog: their cards)
dialog: Thank you, gents.
dialog: (as he pulls in money,
dialog: to Yeller)
dialog: Be a laugh if the two champs ended
dialog: up cleaned.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LANCEY
text: He barely notices Pig's remark.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - KID
text: He barely notices Lancey's reaction to Pig's remark.
text: CAMERA MOVES among the spectators, who also have a more
text: settled look about them. There is a bar, attended by a
text: uniformed HOTEL BELLMAN, and most of the people are drinking.
text: We see in passing a couple go through the door to the bedroom
text: and close it behind them. CAMERA HOLDS on the love seat as
text: Bill rejoin Hoban on their perch.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Any action?
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: What do you expect first five or six
dialog: hours?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Still feeling each other out?
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Pig's ahead about a grand, Shooter
dialog: maybe three hundred.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CARDS BEING DEALT
text: Sokal gets a nine of clubs, The Kid a six, Pig a queen, Yeller
text: a king, Lancey a jack, and The Shooter a four.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER'S VOICE
dialog: King bets.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the players. There is less oral
text: accompaniment to the betting now.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: King says twenty.
text: Lancey calls, Shooter drops, Sokal calls, The Kid drops.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: In for twenty.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (dealing)
dialog: To the nine a ten, to the queen a
dialog: seven, to the king a jack, and to
dialog: the jack a jack.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Pair of jacks will venture a hundred
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: (who has the nine and
dialog: ten of clubs showing)
dialog: I'm in.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: (after studying the
dialog: board)
dialog: Up two hundred dollars.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: (folding)
dialog: Leave it to the rich folk.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - HOBAN AND BILL
speaker_heading: BILL
text: Lancey could be laying for him with
text: three jacks.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Pig don't think so.
speaker_heading: LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Call the two hundred.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: Lancey puts in his money and so does Sokal.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: I'm sticking.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: Shooter deals another round: an eight of clubs to Sokal, a
text: second seven to Pig, a ten to Lancey.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
text: Possible straight flush, pair of
text: sevens. Pair of jacks are still high.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Check to the sevens.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: Likewise.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: (trying to be casual)
dialog: Bet the size of the pot. Nine hundred
dialog: and eighty dollars.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: In for nine eighty.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: I'll play.
scene_heading: TWO SHOT - HOBAN AND BILL
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What's with Lancey? I thought he'd
dialog: raise with three jacks or drop with
text: two pair.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
text: He probably thinks Pig's faking the
dialog: queens. Anyhow, Doc's liable take
text: them both with a straight or a flush.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: There is a good deal of suspense hanging on each card as The
text: Shooter deals. Sokal gets a five of diamonds, and his
text: disappointment is too great to conceal.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Busted, no flush, no straight. Pair
dialog: of sevens with a queen gets a nine.
text: To the pair of jacks, a trey.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: (counting his money,
dialog: trying to be calm)
dialog: Pair of sevens will bet whatever I
dialog: got here. Twenty-four hundred bucks.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I'll call your twenty-four hundred --
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE KID
text: He watches Lancey, puzzled; this isn't what he had expected.
speaker_heading: LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: -- and raise you whatever I have
dialog: left.
text: The Kid relaxes; this is more the way he figured it.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: Lancey is completely calm. Pig is shattered, his whole world
text: suddenly blown apart.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Comes to fourteen hundred fifty
dialog: dollars, Pig. Don't imagine you'll
dialog: have any problem promoting that much
dialog: in half an hour -- plus whatever you
dialog: care to raise me.
text: All eyes are on Pig, which doesn't make it any easier for
text: him. He just sits there, his hands shaking.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Fourteen fifty to the queens. You
dialog: want to take your half hour, Pig?
text: There is another long moment before Pig flips over his up
dialog: cards.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: No, I'm out. Out of the game.
text: He looks at Lancey with malevolence. Lancey turns over his
text: up cards and tosses them in front of The Shooter. Pig suddenly
text: lunges toward the cards, wanting a look at Lancey's hole
text: card, but Lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards
text: into the pack The Shooter is assembling.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (to Pig)
dialog: You Tap City?
dialog: Pig is suffering, weighing the advantages and disadvantages
text: of making the dread admission. Finally he nods. The Shooter
text: takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake, and the other
text: four remaining players each add a ten. The Shooter pushes
dialog: the money toward Pig.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: I got a woman.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I thought you and Hilda were quits.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: We're back.
text: The other players look at The Shooter to see if he is going
text: to accept this statement at face value. He nods, that he
text: does, and each man contributes another ten. The Shooter passes
dialog: the second fifty to Pig.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: See you around, Pig.
speaker_heading: PLAYERS
dialog: (ad lib)
dialog: So long, Pig -- See you -- 'Night.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: So long.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS him to the door. The spectators make room for
text: him, no one saying anything. At the door, Pig turns back for
text: his valedictory gesture.
speaker_heading: PIG
dialog: Good luck -- Kid.
text: He goes out.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LANCEY
text: He has been rearranging his money, but Pig's words make his
text: head jerk up and toward the door.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal the other players, who react in
text: dismay to the breach of form.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: He shouldn't have said that. Not
text: after taking Tap City from the table.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: His woman's been giving him a rough
text: time. Wants him to quit and go square.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: At his age? Crazy.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: He wants to wish anybody luck, doesn't
dialog: bother me. Personally, I don't figure
dialog: The Kid needs it.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Thanks, Lancey.
text: With that, the tension is gone. But just to make sure, The
text: Shooter pushes his chair back.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I know it's early, men, but what
dialog: about taking a little break?
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - BILL, MELBA AND THE SHOOTER
text: Melba fills a beer glass from a bottle and serves it to The
dialog: Shooter.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to Melba)
dialog: It always distresses me, a man
dialog: reaching his middle years and still
dialog: having no assurance of next week's
dialog: income.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: I know what you mean. I like a man
dialog: to have plenty of assurance.
text: The Shooter's gaze wanders o.s. CAMERA MOVES to FEATURE the
text: objects of his attention, who are Lady Fingers, Lancey and
text: The Kid. The two men would like to talk to each other, but
text: Lady Finger's is monopolizing Lancey, and he doesn't want to
dialog: offend her.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Spider Man died kind of slow. First
dialog: he give them a kidney, then his gall
dialog: bladder, and then they taking his
dialog: whole damn stomach. You remember
text: Spider Man, run the dice table down
dialog: at Turk's Club to Memphis.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Who? Oh, Spider Man, sure, sure.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: He died kind of slow.
text: The Shooter comes to Lancey's rescue.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Need your help, Lady Fingers... to
dialog: make arrangements for food and
dialog: shelter.
text: He whisks her away. Lancey and The Kid, finally facing each
dialog: other alone, don't quite know how to begin.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Good crowd.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah. Nice-looking broads.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: That's a fact.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That was a pretty thing to watch
dialog: what you done to Pig with those jacks.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Thanks, Kid. From you, that's nice
dialog: to hear.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: When he bet out first, he was ready
dialog: to think you had them back to back.
dialog: Even when he bet the size of the
dialog: pot, he figured there was still a
dialog: chance you were laying for him. But
dialog: when you called him, I could see it
dialog: in his eyes he thought you had jacks
dialog: and tens, and I knew you had him
dialog: hooked.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: You knew, did you? Before I raised?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Oh, sure, I seen what you were pulling
dialog: all along.
text: Lancey is a bit taken aback by The Kid's confident assertion,
text: but he manages a smile.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: You been to Miami, Kid?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Beautiful town, lot of loose money
dialog: around. You ought to come down some
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: You mean it?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Sure, sure. Lot of room down there.
dialog: Another spot you ought to work someday
dialog: is Reno, Nevada.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I heard.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: You got to have nerves though. So
dialog: much going on. Action everywhere you
dialog: turn. You lose the feel of the cards
dialog: when you're in so much action day
dialog: in, day out.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'd like to make it out there.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: There's different levels of action
dialog: there -- you'd find yours, any kind
dialog: you could ask for.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I generally stick to stud.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Sure, sure, for eating money. But
dialog: you know how it is, I like to lay
dialog: off once in a while and try craps.
dialog: Nothing serious -- I don't even think
dialog: of it as work.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Oh, I do that. I'll take a night off
dialog: and shoot a little casino. Or even
dialog: blackjack.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Your age, you don't need a regular
dialog: vacation every year. But me, I have
dialog: to forget the grind for a couple of
dialog: weeks. I go to this place near Delray
dialog: Beach, and the whole time I don't
dialog: play anything but bridge.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That's interesting. I could go for
dialog: bridge if there was a way to do it
dialog: without partners.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I'm not keeping you from your woman,
dialog: am I?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (after a slight
dialog: hesitation)
dialog: No. We're -- she's gone away for a
dialog: while. We're not sure we're looking
dialog: for the same thing.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I'm sorry to hear that.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I was hoping Christian would run
dialog: with me and wouldn't try to make a
dialog: big deal out of it.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: But she tried?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah, and now I don't know. I don't
dialog: figure a man can change his way
dialog: because the way I see it a man's
dialog: lucky he's got something going for
text: him that he can hold on to. A man
dialog: can't change his way for a woman.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Nooo, a man can't do that.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I been wondering if it isn't maybe a
dialog: better idea not to look for a fixed
dialog: thing. Just tie in to something nice
dialog: when you're away from the action,
dialog: and enjoy it, and let it wear itself
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (after a long moment)
dialog: That's very interesting you should
dialog: say that. You're pretty young to
dialog: have figured things out already.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well she didn't understand how it
dialog: was with me and ---
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (warmly)
dialog: Between us?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: There ain't but a few people, I guess
dialog: who would understand --
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (as The Kid doesn't
dialog: finish)
dialog: Kid, you're the best stud man I've
dialog: seen in 35 years of action. You know
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Well -- thank you.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: And when it comes to broads, which
dialog: is getting to be an academic problem --
dialog: I can look back now to the two or
dialog: three I ever considered I might want
dialog: to spend the rest of my life with,
dialog: and you know what? I like it...
dialog: looking back on them, that is --
dialog: (then)
dialog: I always got a lot of companionship
dialog: out of a good book.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: It's very educational, hearing what
dialog: it's like for a man your age.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Glad to be of help. And it's good we
dialog: had this little talk so I know we
dialog: can be friends regardless what
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: That sounds good to me. I didn't
dialog: think you was coming in at me like a
dialog: grudge match.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: No room for any kind of emotion in a
dialog: fair game of stud. I learned that a
dialog: long time ago.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS' VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Ready for some action, gentlemen.
text: They look at each other and then exit.
scene_heading: ANGLE INCLUDING THE POKER TABLE
text: Lady Fingers is sitting in Shooter's place, rippling and
text: shuffling the cards. Yeller, Sokal, and The Shooter are all
text: either sitting at the table or standing near it. Lancey,
text: followed by The Kid, returns to the table.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: It's a whole New Deal. Good hands
dialog: all around. Prosperity for everybody.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: You're still good, Fingers.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Getting crippled up, Lancey. Not
dialog: many of the old gang left. You heard
dialog: Whistling Sam was gone?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: No, I didn't hear.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: I was the one got called to the morgue
dialog: to identify him. I don't suppose you
dialog: seen anybody been run over by a twelve-
text: ton bulldozer.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: No, can't say that I have.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Don't go out of your way.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - TOWARD WINDOWS
text: Morning sunlight is streaming in.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The Kid, facing the sun, wears his eyeshade. The Shooter has
text: resumed the deal and now hands out last cards to Sokal, The
dialog: Kid and himself.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Bet the pot. Four hundred and twenty
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: Fold.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: It's yours.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Thanks, gents. Makes me exactly even.
dialog: This kind of a game, that's a smart
dialog: place to quit.
dialog: (takes his money off
dialog: the table)
dialog: Just do the dealing, if that's all
dialog: right with everybody.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: It is later in the morning. Three players are left in the
text: hand on the last card: Yeller with nothing higher than a
text: jack, Lancey with a king-queen showing and Sokal with an ace-
dialog: king.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Ace-king is the high man.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: Shoot the works.
dialog: (counts it out)
dialog: Nine hundred and thirty bucks.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: I'm over.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (putting out the money)
dialog: What have you got?
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: (unhappily)
dialog: Doesn't matter. If you can call me,
dialog: you beat me. Ace-king high.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (turning an ace)
dialog: Ace-king-queen high.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: (to The Kid)
dialog: I had them both with a pair of fives.
speaker_heading: SOKAL
dialog: Winds it up for me, men. And I can't
dialog: say it's been a pleasure.
dialog: (despairingly)
dialog: That one I was sure I could steal.
speaker_heading: YELLER
text: Lancey has a built-in burglar alarm.
dialog: I'm also withdrawing from the field
dialog: of battle, gentlemen. Settle for the
dialog: seventeen hundred I've already
dialog: dropped.
text: Yeller pulls in the money in front of him. There is now about
text: $19,500 left on the table, $11,500 in front of Lancey, $8,000
text: in front of The Kid.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (to The Kid)
dialog: Well, just the two of us.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah, just the two of us. Deal them,
dialog: Shooter Man.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: There is around $1,500 in the pot. Shooter deals an unhelpful
text: card to Lancey's pair of aces, and a nine to The Kid's king-
dialog: queen-ten.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Cost you a grand.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Compulsory call, Kid.
text: The Kid turns up a jack and pulls in the money.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The last bet has been made and there is about $3000 in the
text: pot. Lancey exposes his hole card.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
text: Two pair, jacks up.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Kings up.
text: He takes in the money.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: There is $2500 in the pot. Lancey shows a pair of kings, The
text: Kid an ace and three odd cards. The Shooter deals a nine to
dialog: Lancey.
speaker_heading: THE KID
text: He is watching The Shooter intently.
scene_heading: FEATURING THE SHOOTER'S HANDS - KID'S P.O.V.
text: The dealing motion looks perfectly legitimate as The Shooter
text: gives The Kid an ace. Lancey's hand reaches into the SHOT to
text: turn over his up cards.
speaker_heading: LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
text: Studded again.
speaker_heading: THE KID
text: He takes the money in slowly, his eyes on The Shooter. Now
text: the distribution of money has been reversed. The Kid has
dialog: something under $12,000, Lancey something under $8,000.
speaker_heading: THE SHOOTER
text: He avoids meeting The Kid's gaze.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE - FROM BEHIND THE KID
text: On the fourth card Lancey shows a pair of sevens, The Kid a
text: pair of eights and a ten.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Two thousand dollars.
text: The Kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Call two thousand.
text: He turns to watch The Shooter.
scene_heading: FEATURING THE SHOOTER'S HANDS - KID'S P.O.V.
dialog: Again there is no indication of improper dealing as The
text: Shooter gives Lancey an odd card and The Kid a ten, completing
dialog: his full house.
speaker_heading: LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Two thousand more.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Take it. I can't beat three sevens.
dialog: (then as The Shooter's
text: eyes flicker with
dialog: surprise)
dialog: I'd like a break to get some food
dialog: and sleep -- I'm winners so it isn't
dialog: up to me to say it but I'm saying it
dialog: anyway.
text: He exits. After a moment The Shooter follows. Lancey watches
text: them go then rises, apparently still fresh and strong. Lady
text: Fingers joins him.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: My dear, that young man is a stud
text: poker-playing son-of-a-bitch.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Gettin' to you, Lancey?
text: Lancey looks at her a moment, then smiles.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (softly)
text: Not yet he isn't.
text: He moves through the crowd, then exits.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - BILL'S SUITE - THE KID &amp; SHOOTER
text: They are alone in the room. Shooter is uncomfortable and
text: would like to be elsewhere but The Kid is standing in front
text: of the closed door.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Now, just what the hell are you trying
dialog: to pull?
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (trying to bluff it)
dialog: Nothing -- what are you talking about?
text: The Kid grabs him and slams him against the wall.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: You, Shooter Man -- you been feeding
dialog: me cards for an hour.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (angry and ashamed)
dialog: The hell I was.
dialog: (he waits a brief
text: moment then eases
dialog: away from The Kid)
dialog: Christ, Kid, even if I was you
dialog: couldn't spot it -- I'm too good a
dialog: mechanic for anybody to spot it.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (grabbing him and
dialog: slamming him against
dialog: the wall again)
dialog: But I was looking for it, Shooter --
dialog: four times you give me the cards I
dialog: need.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (a little shrill)
dialog: You seen it before often enough. One
dialog: player draws four good ones.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Never in a game when I been told
dialog: ahead the dealer has a stake in my
text: coming out on top.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (slumping)
dialog: My woman told you.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: She told me enough to make me start
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (almost pleading)
dialog: Why should you bitch if I give you a
dialog: little help?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Why, you dumb bastard? -- You have
dialog: to ask me why.
dialog: (ready to hit him)
dialog: I could break you apart for what
dialog: you've done.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (backing off)
dialog: Kid, you got to understand. It wasn't
dialog: my idea --
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Well who the hell's was it then --
dialog: Schlaegel? --
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: He's got the squeeze on me Kid and
dialog: he's meaner than hell. He'll cut me
dialog: up if I don't come through.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You think I wanted to deal a phony
dialog: game? You think it don't mean
dialog: something to me? I never done a
dialog: crooked thing before in my life.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: My ass bleeds for you -- Now you get
dialog: straight on this. No fix. You come
dialog: along straight or I blow it wide
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: He's liable to kill me.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: He ain't goin' to do nothin' to you
dialog: except pay off because I'm goin' to
dialog: win.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: It is a hell of a chance to take.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: You got no choice.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: He ain't goin' to like it.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (almost yelling at
dialog: him)
dialog: He ain't goin' to know.
dialog: (then quietly)
dialog: Shooter, I'm goin' to win this one --
dialog: win it my way -- and you ride with
dialog: me or you're out, finished.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I ride with you.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: You better not forget it -- now beat
dialog: it. I need some sleep.
text: Shooter looks at him, then moves towards the door.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Tell Mr. Schlaegel I accept his offer
dialog: to use the room.
text: The Shooter goes out. The Kid crosses to the phone.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I want to be called at 4 p.m. on the
dialog: nose. For sure -- Thanks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. LANCEY'S ROOM
text: In the privacy of his room he shows how close he is to
text: exhaustion. Wearily, he sits on the bed and begins to remove
text: his shoes. Then, catching his reflection in the mirror,
text: straightens.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Not yet he isn't. But he damn well
dialog: might.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, BILL'S SUITE - CLOSE SHOT - MELBA
text: She is in the final stages of undressing. CAMERA MOVES with
text: her as she steps to The Kid's bedside and gets into bed with
text: him. Having accomplished this without waking him, she speaks
text: into his ear in imitation of a hotel phone operator.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Good afternoon, sir. It's exactly
text: four o'clock.
text: He awakens in considerable confusion. Melba is amused by his
dialog: difficulty in adjusting to his circumstances.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: It's really only about twenty-five
dialog: to four. You can stay right where
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I don't want you to think I'm getting
dialog: too personal, but you mind telling
dialog: me how the hell you come to be here?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: You mean you don't remember last
dialog: night? We drank all that champagne
dialog: and you said "Let's get married right
dialog: away," and we chartered a plane to --
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Can it --
dialog: (then)
dialog: Where's Shooter?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: I locked the door. It's incredible
dialog: the way you invariably worry about
dialog: The Shooter.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: It's incredible the way you invariably
dialog: don't.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Worrying takes time and we don't
dialog: have a lot.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: We're supposed to sit down again at
text: half past four.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Does it really matter so much to you
dialog: now, that sense of obligation to The
dialog: Shooter?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (thinking about Shooter)
dialog: I got no obligations to The Shooter.
dialog: (then to Melba)
dialog: Or to you.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Obligations are not what I have in
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. LANCEY'S ROOM
text: He is shaving. Apparently much stronger but his hand is
text: shaking. He looks at it. It steadies. After a moment he smiles
dialog: a little.
speaker_heading: CUT TO
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, BILL'S SUITE
text: CAMERA is on the shower door as the SOUND of running water
text: ceases. The Kid can be seen indistinctly through the door.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Reach me a towel?
text: Melba, who is dressed again and applying her lipstick, comes
text: into the SHOT, takes a towel from a rack and hands it to him
text: after he opens the shower door. He gives himself a quick
text: once-over with it, the secures it around his waist, steps
text: out of the shower stall, and begins the process of shaving.
text: Melba meanwhile finishes restoring her makeup.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: You any idea how much The Shooter
dialog: has involved in this game of yours?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: If Schlaegel bet as much on me as I
dialog: heard, I guess he'd pay a nice piece
dialog: of change to be sure I won.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: It's worse than that. Schlaegel staked
dialog: him for three years. He has his hooks
dialog: so deep in Shooter Man, he'll take
text: out his liver when he pulls them
dialog: out.
text: The Kid stops shaving and looks at her.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: You asking me to go along with the
dialog: fix?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: I'm asking you to consider whether
dialog: your ego is worth destroying another
dialog: man's whole life.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: You're still working for him. On my
dialog: time you're still working for him.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: What kind of switch is this? You
dialog: criticize me for trying to chippie
dialog: on him, then I get a little loyal
dialog: and you're at me for that.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: No -- I don't hold it against you.
dialog: You wanting to make things right for
dialog: him -- but this game I handle my way --
dialog: win, lose, or draw.
text: There is a KNOCK on the door.
speaker_heading: MELBA
text: Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed
dialog: hero.
text: CAMERA PANS to take in the view of the bedroom as she crosses
text: it to the door, talking as she goes.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Believe me Kid there is too much at
dialog: stake for us to rely on your doing
dialog: it on your own.
text: She has paused at the door to finish her sentence. Now she
text: unlocks and opens it -- to Christian. Melba is so taken aback
text: she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open.
text: The Kid, in the bathroom in f.g., is similarly frozen in his
text: tracks. After a moment Christian advances into the room.
scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE - CHRISTIAN IN F.G.
text: The scene as it looks to Christian is circumstantially
text: incriminating. CAMERA MOVES with her gaze from The Kid to
text: the one mussed bed, to Melba. The faces and the silence of
text: the two people are even more incriminating than the
dialog: circumstances.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Hello, Kid. Hello, Melba.
dialog: (a pause)
dialog: You said wait home 'til you let me
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Yeah, that's what I said. We took a
text: break in the game to catch some sleep.
dialog: Shooter sent his woman up here to
dialog: wake me up.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Yeah, I woke him up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: It don't take much.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: No, I didn't find it any trouble.
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: Well, you children don't need me,
dialog: that's for sure. See you downstairs.
dialog: (to Christian)
dialog: You, too, honey, right?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I'll be around if The Kid wants me.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: See you, Melba. Thanks.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Por nada, as they say. It was nothing.
text: She walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of
text: the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the
text: bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his
text: undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using
text: the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and
text: puts on his shorts and trousers.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: You been to the place?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: No, I've got my bag downstairs. Maybe
dialog: I'll take it over later on tonight.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: How's your Mama and Papa?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Fine. How's the game going?
text: The Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to
text: give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off
dialog: the soap.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: It's come to be just me and Lancey.
text: He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. As his
text: movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes
text: he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting
text: his shirt on.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (after the kiss)
dialog: I was wondering.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I got my mind on the cards.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: I know. And I don't want to rattle
dialog: you. We got plenty to talk about,
dialog: but it can all wait. Except I want
dialog: to say this. I came back because I
dialog: figured if it was going to work with
dialog: us, it's silly me sitting home with
dialog: Mama while you're playing your big
dialog: game. I mean if I'm any use to you
dialog: at all, this is when it's most
dialog: important.
text: To The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both
text: affection and guilt. The idea that she can be any use to him
text: against Lancey is one he can't grasp.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I'm glad you came, Christian. You
dialog: got as much right here as anybody.
dialog: (then)
dialog: More right, I should have said.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Should you?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Hell, yes. The change I come out
dialog: with when I win this one, you're
dialog: going to be the one to spend it.
text: He moves toward the door.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Eric --
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: Look, I said I'm glad you came --
dialog: and that's all until I wrap this up --
dialog: I'm a poker player, remember?
text: She looks at him. After a moment he exits. She follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: It is evening. Lady Fingers deals a first up card to the two
text: players. The Kid gets an eight, Lancey a jack.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: The eight'll try two bills.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (turning his card)
dialog: No stay.
text: Lady Fingers scoops up the cards, shuffles them into the
text: rest of the deck, submits it to Lancey for his cut, and deals
text: them another two cards apiece -- all in the space of seconds.
text: The Kid gets a queen, Lancey a nine.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Two hundred.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (turning his card)
dialog: No stay.
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE
text: CAMERA starts on Yeller, who is stretched out on the loveseat
text: with his eyes closed and PANS UP to INCLUDE Hoban, who sits
text: at the observation post with the binoculars. Yeller speaks
text: without opening his eyes.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Naaa, Kid paired kings. He wins a
dialog: hundred.
text: CAMERA MOVES on PAST a window, showing it is night outside;
text: past a group of other spectators; past Bill, Shooter and
text: Melba who watch the game grimly; and finally to the table,
text: where The Shooter is dealing again. The Kid is down to his
text: undershirt, and even Lancey has made a few concessions to
text: comfort. The players have just been dealt their third cards.
text: Christian moves up to stand behind The Kid.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
text: Queen bets another C-note.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (folding)
dialog: Take it away.
text: He looks up at Christian.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Go read a magazine, honey.
text: She hesitates. Then moves away. Lancey watches this.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - CHRISTIAN
text: It is later at night. The magazine lies open on Christian's
text: lap; she is staring absently into space.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS' VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: All right, gents. I'm declaring a
dialog: break.
text: The announcement rouses Christian from her reverie.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: Lady Fingers is in the dealer's chair. The two players look
dialog: pretty weary.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: I break.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I don't want a break.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Well, I don't either.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Deal.
text: Lady Fingers puts down the deck. Picks up a new one.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: Same deck is good enough.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I want a new deck.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Alright, alright -- A new deck then,
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Deal.
text: Lady Fingers looks at the two men for a long moment. Puts
dialog: the cards down.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: You want to deal? Then deal them
dialog: yourselves. I'm going to the john.
dialog: I'm going to get something to eat,
dialog: and I'm going to take a nap. You
dialog: barracudas can snap all you want but
dialog: at each other -- I'm taking a break
dialog: and if you don't like it you can
dialog: both go to hell.
text: She turns and stalks off. Lancey and The Kid look at each
text: other for a moment, then both grin.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I guess we been told.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Looks that way.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (rising)
dialog: See you in about 3/4 of an hour,
dialog: Lancey, right?
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Make it an hour. Old bones need a
text: little more time to loosen up.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (meaning it)
dialog: Listen, I think it is amazing you've
dialog: been able to keep going this long.
text: As he heads for the door, Lancey reacts to this. Then stands
text: and looks around the room. Groups of people stand in the
text: shadows watching silently, not hostile but certainly not
text: friendly. He is The Man but he is getting beat and nobody is
text: sorry. After a moment he turns and leaves from a side door.
text: CAMERA PANS to HOLD on Christian as she stops The Kid by the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (taking his hand)
dialog: Eric --
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (simultaneously)
dialog: Your fan on the fifth floor wants
dialog: you to have a bite with him. Alone.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: There's nothing to talk about.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: You better, Kid. You don't, you're
text: only making worse trouble.
text: Christian scans both their faces as they talk... concerned.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: If you think so.
dialog: (to Christian)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Nothing, Nothing you have to worry

text: He heads for the door. Christian looks after him.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Get something to eat.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BILL'S SUITE
text: Bill and The Kid are sitting at a room-service table. Bill
text: nibbles at some cheese and crackers while The Kid tackles a

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I thought it would be better if you
dialog: and I sat down together to see if we
dialog: couldn't work out our differences.
dialog: Felix!
text: He motions to Felix, indicating a wine bottle on the table.
text: Felix steps over and refills The Kid's glass.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: What I told The Shooter goes.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Are you saying no before we've even
dialog: discussed it? Am I to feel all my
dialog: arguments will be wasted?
text: The Kid just looks at him -- then returns to his meal.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I'll skip to the final argument.
dialog: (then)
dialog: More salad, perhaps?
text: He makes a peremptory gesture to Felix, who springs forward
text: to offer the salad bowl to The Kid.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: The Shooter will be back dealing
dialog: when you start again. He will give
dialog: you an occasional helpful card.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: That's an argument?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: That's a fact. I'm coming to the
dialog: argument.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I'll give you a fact. I won't let it
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Is that knife sharp enough? Felix.
text: Felix jumps into action again. He moves to The Kid's side,
text: reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade,
text: which he clocks open an inch or two from The Kid's neck. It
text: is an extremely ugly-looking and menacing weapon.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: See if it cuts better with that.
text: Felix hands the knife to The Kid, who tries it on his steak.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sharp?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Very. But it don't cut any ice with
dialog: me.
text: He jams the knife in the table and snaps off the blade.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (rising)
text: Not this time. He exits.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR
text: As The Kid exits Christian is waiting for him. He moves down
text: the corridor, preoccupied. She follows.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Did you eat?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: THE KID
text: (stops, looks at her
dialog: irritated)
dialog: Why not, for Chris sakes?
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: Eric --
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (moving away)
dialog: You should eat something.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (loudly, stopping)
dialog: I've got to talk to you.
text: He stops, looks at her.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Talk.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (fumbling)
dialog: It's -- about us. What's going to
dialog: happen?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: What's going to happen? What's going
dialog: to happen for Chris sake is I'm going
dialog: to win the game.
dialog: (then more softly)
dialog: You go back to the apartment, honey,
dialog: this might take two more days.
speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: (flatly)
dialog: If I go, I'm not going back to the
dialog: apartment. If I go -- I'm just going.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (after a long moment)
dialog: Well, that's up to you, Christian.
text: He looks at her a moment longer then moves up the corridor.
text: She watches him, then turns. Standing in the open door some
text: distance away are Schlaegel and Felix.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - THE SHOOTER'S HANDS
text: Shuffling the cards. CAMERA PULLS BACK enough to see his
text: face as he looks across at The Kid. CAMERA PANS to a CLOSE
text: SHOT of The Kid, and then past a couple of spectators,
text: including Christian and Melba, to Bill, whose eyes are on
text: The Kid. Finally CAMERA PANS back to The Kid.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I told you, Shooter -- I won't go
dialog: for it.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE - INCLUDING BILL
text: Both The Shooter and Bill are aware of a portentous note in
text: The Kid's tone.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: The Shooter's not well. He didn't
dialog: want to spoil the game, but he ought
dialog: to be resting... He ought to be in
dialog: the hospital.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Well, we got Lady Fingers. Or we can
dialog: deal ourselves.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: I'm okay. What The Kid's talking
dialog: about is nothing. It's just not
dialog: important.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: It is to me... You want to kill
dialog: yourself, do it on your own time.
text: Lancey looks from The Kid to The Shooter, sensing that there
text: may be something more behind this, but not knowing just what.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I got to go along with that, Shooter.
dialog: Lady Fingers! You ready?
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - LADY FINGERS
text: Rising from her chair.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Like Eddie the Dude said on his
dialog: deathbed, I'm as ready as I'll ever
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - CLOSE SHOT - THE KID AND POKER HAND
text: The four cards showing are the ace, ten and two little clubs.
text: As CAMERA PULLS BACK we also have time to note The Kid's
text: stake. He is still ahead. Lancey counts out five hundred
dialog: dollars from his stake, leaving about thirteen thousand, and
text: puts it into a pot that already contains around a thousand.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I can't persuade myself you have the
dialog: flush.
text: The Kid turns up the jack of clubs.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Now I can.
text: The Kid pulls in the money.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - THE KID - LANCEY - AND POKER HANDS
text: Both men are showing the strain. Perhaps Lancey the most as
text: he appears to be consistently losing. Showing are two nines
text: and two odd cards.
speaker_heading: LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm going to pay the price to look
dialog: at that third nine.
text: The kid turns up another nine and reaches for the money.
speaker_heading: LANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Caveat emptor. New deck, please.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE - FROM BEHIND THE KID
text: He shows a pair of eights and two odd cards against Lancey's
text: pair of queens. He takes another look at his hole card, and
dialog: we see that it is of no help to him.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Pair of eights bets an even thousand
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: HOBAN AND YELLER
text: They are both sitting on the back of the loveseat now. The
text: binoculars pass from one to the other. Both men are tense
text: over the growing excitement of the game.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: Ten bucks and my notoriously fallible
dialog: instinct tells me the boy is bluffing
dialog: this time.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Mark it.
text: CAMERA MOVES to the other four remaining spectators:
text: Christian, Melba, The Shooter and Bill. They are close enough
text: to see the cards but too close to discuss them.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The kid has almost half the money in front of him now, and
text: is playing with increasing assurance and pressure.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (turning his cards)
dialog: I'm not that curious.
speaker_heading: HOBAN AND YELLER
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: (excitement in his
dialog: voice)
text: The Kid is pushing it and making it
dialog: stick.
text: CAMERA MOVES to the other four spectators as they react to
dialog: The Kid's successful streak.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (in a low voice)
text: He's getting to him.
text: And it looks that way. Lancey appears old and unsure. The
text: Kid sharp and cold. A young barracuda moving in for the kill.
text: CAMERA MOVES in close to Christian as she tries to catch The
text: Kid's eye. Thinking she has it, she smiles her encouragement.
scene_heading: FEATURING THE KID
text: He looks right at her and doesn't seem to see her. Lady
text: Fingers has dealt the first up cards of a new hand, and Lancey
text: is high.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Two hundred.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: And up five.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Fold.
speaker_heading: CLOSE - CHRISTIAN
text: Amid the growing excitement and tension she is a complete
dialog: outsider.
speaker_heading: (TIME LAPSE)
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: The Kid shows two jacks and two odd cards; Lancey a pair of
text: aces and two odd cards. Lancey puts about eight hundred
dialog: dollars into the pot.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Betting the jack isn't there, Kid.
text: The Kid exposes his hidden jack.
scene_heading: SHOOTER, BILL AND MELBA
text: Greed and an almost vicious satisfaction marks their faces
text: as they watch Lancey falter. The Shooter whispers to Bill
text: just loud enough for the girl to hear.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: We're in -- I think he's got him.
text: Christian looks at them, then at The Kid. Hesitates a moment
text: then suddenly gets to her feet and starts for the door. Only
text: Melba notices her, and even she doesn't have time to question
text: her. CAMERA FOLLOWS Christian to the suite entrance, where
text: she picks up her bag then turns to look back at the table.
scene_heading: FEATURING THE KID
text: The place where Christian was sitting is right in his line
text: of vision but he hasn't observed her departure.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN
text: She goes on out the door.
scene_heading: INT. POKER SUITE - ANGLE INCLUDING WINDOW
text: The second dawn of the contest is near at hand. The room,
dialog: continuously lived in for so long by so many people, is a
text: shambles of dirty glasses and plates, empty bottles, full
text: wastebaskets and ash trays, and frayed people. At the poker
text: table, Lady Fingers is dealing a new hand.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
text: A jack and a ten. Jack bets.
text: CAMERA MOVES in close enough for us to see the cards. Lancey
dialog: has the jack of hearts, The Kid the ten of clubs.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Jack is willing to wager two hundred
dialog: dollars.
text: The Kid takes his first look at his hole card.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - SHOWING FACE OF HOLE CARD
dialog: It is the queen of hearts.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: And up five hundred.
text: Lancey looks at him a long moment. His face pale and shaken.
text: The Kid is beating him. Pushing -- buying -- always pressing
text: and Lancey knows he is losing one hand at a time, not badly
text: but consistently and inevitably. His age and fatigue are a
text: strong handicap for the long pull. Then his face settles as
text: if he had come to a decision. He smiles lightly summoning
text: some last reserve of strength, almost as if he knows this
dialog: will be the last hand, win or lose.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Call your five hundred and five
dialog: hundred more.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (after a brief
dialog: hesitation)
dialog: Call.
speaker_heading: HOBAN AND YELLER
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Fifty to one hundred says Lancey
text: paired his jacks.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: Mark it.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: Lady Fingers deals the ten of diamonds to The Kid, giving
text: him a pair, and the ten of hearts to Lancey.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
text: Pair of tens. Jack, ten of hearts.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Five hundred.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Your five hundred -- and up one
dialog: thousand.
text: The raise is a surprise. The Kid's eyes go up to study
text: Lancey's face, even though he knows what a futile effort
dialog: that is.
speaker_heading: HOBAN AND YELLER
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: Fifty to seventy-five he's got the
text: jacks wired.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: Mark it -- Could be a high heart.
dialog: Queen's the best, but that old man
text: can be cocky with an ace or a deuce.
dialog: 'Specially having one of The Kid's
dialog: tens.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: One thousand to the tens.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Call.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: (dealing)
dialog: A third ten, and a nine of hearts to
dialog: the ten, jack.
scene_heading: SERIES OF ANGLES
text: The Kid, Lancey, Shooter, Melba, Schlaegel, Yeller, Hoban
text: and others as they realize this could be the big hand.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: He'll run. He's beat on the board
dialog: anyway you look at it. Even if he
dialog: has the jacks it is better than eight
dialog: to one against improving.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: He won't run and I don't think he's
dialog: got the jacks. I think he's going
dialog: for the flush.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: Two thousand, five hundred dollars.
text: Lancey looks at him, then at the cards. The moment stretches.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: (finally)
dialog: Two thousand, five hundred dollars
text: to the three hearts.
text: Lancey looks at her. His face briefly showing his anger. The
text: Kid notices this and reacts.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (finally, casually)
dialog: Reasonable bet. Two thousand five
dialog: hundred.
dialog: (he counts out the
dialog: money to Lady Fingers)
dialog: Deal them.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (knowing this is it)
dialog: He's going for it and The Kid's got
text: him. He's going all the way.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: (dealing)
dialog: A queen of diamonds to the three
dialog: tens.
dialog: (a note of excitement
dialog: in her voice)
dialog: And an eight of hearts to the possible
text: flush. Possible straight flush. Three
dialog: tens bet.
text: The Kid checks the amount of money in front of him.
scene_heading: THE SHOOTER AND BILL
text: They exchange a quick look of satisfaction, and then their
text: eyes go back to the cards.
speaker_heading: HOBAN AND YELLER
text: They each take a quick turn with the binoculars.
speaker_heading: HOBAN
dialog: If The Kid bets into the flush he's
text: filled up with a queen in the hole.
speaker_heading: YELLER
dialog: If The Man has a flush or a straight,
text: he goes under.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But not with both.
text: FROM BEHIND THE KID
text: He looks at his hole card. It is still the queen of hearts.
text: He has a full house, which has to be the winning hand unless
dialog: Lancey had the audacity to bet out with a jack-seven of
text: hearts, and to raise The Kid with a jack-ten-seven.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Bet what's in front of me. Make it
dialog: fifty-four hundred bucks.
text: He counts out all his money except a few smaller bills.
speaker_heading: THE WATCHERS
text: Reacting.
scene_heading: FEATURING LANCEY
text: He takes his time before he responds.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Fifty-four hundred bucks is a nice
dialog: piece of money.
dialog: (counting it out)
dialog: I see the bet and raise sixty-seven
dialog: hundred.
text: Slowly and deliberately, revealing nothing in his face, he
text: reaches into his breast pocket and takes out a slim wallet
text: and begins to let the bills flutter out on the table. The
text: Kid looks at him frozen.
scene_heading: THE SHOOTER AND BILL
text: Bill hisses softly into The Shooter's ear.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Kid has him, doesn't he?
text: But The Shooter, like the Kid, is white-faced and frozen by
dialog: the raise.
scene_heading: THE REMAINING SPECTATORS
text: They crowd in close to the table: Hoban, Yeller, Bill, The
text: Shooter, and Melba.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: (after a long moment)
dialog: I'm taking my half hour to raise my
dialog: stake.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: I declare a thirty-minute break.
dialog: Leave your cards and money on the
text: table. The game will start again at
dialog: five forty-five.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I'll take your marker, Kid.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I can raise it.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: I know you can.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Long as you know.
dialog: (he raps the table)
dialog: -- Call.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (turns up a heart
dialog: seven)
dialog: Straight flush to the jack -- That's
dialog: $6700 you owe me, Kid.
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT - THE KID
dialog: There is nothing to be gained from a poker face now, and he
text: reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated
text: strain and fatigue is beginning to show. CAMERA MOVES among
text: the spectators: Hoban and Yeller, who are sorry for The Kid
text: and admiring of Lancey; Bill, who is all the more angry at
text: his defeat because his hopes were up; The Shooter, who is a
text: very unhappy man; and Melba, whose anger at the Kid is
text: balanced by her fear of Schlaegel and what will happen to
text: The Shooter and possibly to her.
scene_heading: THE POKER TABLE
text: Lancey pulls in the money while The Kid stares at him dumbly.
text: Lady Fingers riffles the cards.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: New deck.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Are you playing, Kid? You got a half
dialog: an hour to raise your stake.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: No -- I'm through.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: (formally)
dialog: Gentlemen, this game is over.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: You're one hell of a poker player,
dialog: Kid. That was a rough hand.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: What's the tab for the whole show?
text: As he settles up, the CAMERA FOLLOWS The Kid to his brandy
text: bottle. As he pours himself a slug, Melba and Shooter join
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: You had to do it, didn't you -- you
dialog: had to go for it your own way.
dialog: (then, as The Kid
dialog: doesn't answer)
dialog: Well, sonny, I hope you learned
dialog: something. I know we sure as hell
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Where's Christian?
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: She's gone. She's got too much sense
dialog: to stick with a two bit loser.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: (then:)
dialog: Sorry, Kid.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (then:)
dialog: I should have known he had it, Shooter
dialog: Man. I walked into it.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
text: (trying to grin as
dialog: Schlaegel and Felix
dialog: move up)
dialog: Well, Kid, it's like I said -- you
dialog: just wasn't ready.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: (to The Shooter)
dialog: Are you ready, Shooter Man? We're
dialog: having a meeting and I suggest you
dialog: join us.
text: Shooter looks at him a moment and nods, and taking Melba by
text: the arm, moves toward the door followed by Felix.
speaker_heading: MELBA
dialog: Why me -- I'm not part of this.
speaker_heading: SHOOTER
dialog: (jerking her forward)
dialog: Oh, yes you are -- you and your big
dialog: mouth -- you're part of it all right.
speaker_heading: SCHLAEGEL
dialog: He's right, my dear. Now run along
dialog: with Felix. We're going to have a
dialog: long talk about that big mouth of
dialog: yours.
text: Melba starts to protest, but Felix jerks her out the door.
text: Shooter hesitates, then follows.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Schlaegel turns to The Kid.
speaker_heading: SCHLAEGEL
dialog: I was wrong. I figured you for brains.
dialog: But you're a loser, Kid. You had a
dialog: chance to play with grownups and you
dialog: ran.
dialog: (then, as Lancey and
dialog: Lady Fingers approach)
dialog: They weren't playing your game. They
dialog: were playing mine. Think about that
dialog: while you find a place to hide. But
dialog: hide good, Kid -- because I got a
dialog: message for you and I'm going to see
dialog: it delivered.
text: The Kid looks at him, looks at Lancey and Lady Fingers,
text: wondering about what Schlaegel has said, angry about it.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Any time.
text: Schlaegel nods, moves to the door.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE
text: Lancey and Lady Fingers join The Kid.
speaker_heading: LADY FINGERS
dialog: Never thought I'd see the day. You
text: raising tens on a lousy three-flush.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Gets down to what it's all about,
dialog: doesn't it? Making the wrong play at
dialog: the right time.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: That's what it's all about?
text: (then, as Lancey looks
text: at him and doesn't
dialog: answer)
dialog: You were crazy -- odds are three
dialog: hundred to one against.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: (after a moment)
dialog: I don't play a percentage game. I
dialog: play stud poker my way. And I got
dialog: the money and you got the questions.
dialog: Figure that out.
dialog: (then, not unkindly)
dialog: You're good. But as long as I'm
dialog: around, you're second best, Kid...
dialog: and you might as well learn to live
dialog: with it.
text: The Kid looks at him and doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: LANCEY
dialog: Look me up if you're in Miami after
dialog: Christmas. Stillson Hotel.
text: He smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door.
speaker_heading: SCENE
text: Lancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their

scene_heading: EXT. DESERTED STREET NEAR THE KID'S APARTMENT
text: He turns a corner and there is a man blocking his path.
text: Suddenly three men move in behind him. He turns, trapped.
speaker_heading: CLOSER ANGLE
text: The men are four of the original seven players he hustled in
text: the opening scene.
dialog: NOTE: During the progression of the game first one, then

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: So it ain't Eric Stone, from the

dialog: King of the stud poker players.
speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: No -- not the King -- not much of
dialog: anything right now.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (moving towards him)

speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: I'm fine.

dialog: Yeah, I guess you did.

speaker_heading: CHRISTIAN
dialog: No -- it doesn't really matter.

speaker_heading: THE KID
dialog: Yeah, I know.
speaker_heading: TAXI DRIVER
dialog: (calling)

text: cab and it leaves. The Kid just stands there.
speaker_heading: DIFFERENT ANGLE
text: Danny and the others move up around him. The Kid ignores
text: them. After a moment Danny swings from behind and knocks him
