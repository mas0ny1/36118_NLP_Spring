scene_heading: INT/EXT LIONEL CAR - HARLEM ST - DAY 1
text: Cc.U. A LOOSE THREAD...hanging off the sleeve of a sweater.
text: An arm and a wrist resting on a seated knee. The knee
text: starts to jiggle and then...FINGERS pluck at the thread,
text: try to snap it off then smooth it down. Pulling it out
text: further, more thread unravelling. A disaster...
speaker_heading: VOICE [CONEY] (0.S.)
dialog: Quit pullin at it. You’re gonna
dialog: make a fuckin’ mess outta things.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I got threads in my heads! I got
dialog: threads in my HEADS! I GOT THREADS
dialog: IN MY HEADS, MAN!
text: TWO GUYS in the front: LIONEL ESSROG and GILBERT CONEY.
text: CONEY is a big lug in a porkpie hat. LIONEL medium build,
text: wiry. Both late 30's. They don’t look like P.I.’s but
dialog: that’s what they are.
text: Lionel sits shotgun. He’s a hypnotizing array of Tourettic
text: twitches and tics. Coney stuffs little White Castles in his
text: mouth and watches him, deadpan. Lionel’s pulled a foot of
text: thread off his cuff before Coney reaches for his
dialog: pocketknife...
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: Like I said, a fucking mess.
dialog: (cuts it off)
dialog: Jesus, freakshow. Ruin another
dialog: sweater.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sit on it, Bailey! IF!
dialog: This is LIONEL. Words are the fuel for the boiling pressure-
text: cooker of his obsessive-compulsive brain.
text: CONEY ignores the outburst, used to it. Looks at his watch
dialog: and we CUT:
text: WIDER: the CAR is parked on a side street. Kids playing
text: football in the cold down the block. WE’RE IN
dialog: HARLEM...(It’s 1957)
text: BACK on LIONEL: Eyes down the street, watchful and sharp.
text: He opens his wallet and flash checks it. (Bills all in
text: sequence and facing the same direction.) Pulls out a stick
text: of gum, refolds the wrapper and puts in back in the pack,
text: folds the gum perfectly like origami...all while watching
dialog: for:
dialog: Pink Revisions 2.
text: LIONEL’s POV: way off down the block a figure approaching.
text: Lionel: sharpens up. A flicker of a grin. Quickly stacks
text: his gum pieces in a neat row on the dash.
text: TAP TAP TAP... at the window. A trim black trenchcoat. A
text: smiling face under a cool hat , upturned collar against the
dialog: cold. Now that’s what a P.I. looks like and this one is:
text: FRANK MINNA. Lionel rolls the window down.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Boys.
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: Boss.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
scene_heading: Heya, Frank. FRANKLY FRANKADY
speaker_heading: FRANKO!
text: Lionel reaches out and taps Minna twice on the shoulder. An
text: affectionate compulsion. Frank doesn’t even notice it
text: anymore. He lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Okay listen...here’s the shot...
dialog: I'll be third floor. Lionel go to
text: the payphone on the corner in 20
dialog: minutes. When they come.. probably
dialog: three or four of em...when they
dialog: come, you call me here...
dialog: (hands him a number)
dialog: I’1l buzz em in. Coney waits on
dialog: the door, I buzz him in and he
dialog: stays right inside. Lionel’s
text: listening sharp on the line. If
dialog: you hear me say “Then we have a
text: problem” hustle over, Coney lets
dialog: you in, two of you come upstairs
dialog: and back me up quick, okay?
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: What's going down here, Frank?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I gotta keep this one under my
dialog: hat, boys.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Fat cats in HATS!
dialog: Pink Revisions 3.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Them’s the ones, pal. Let’s catch
dialog: a big score and get outta this
dialog: game, get fat ourselves.
text: He winks at Lionel. Lionel notices a little sweat on
text: Minna’s brow despite the cold.
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: Boss, we're not carrying.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: A piece. I don’t have a piece.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: A piece? Say ‘gun’, Gilbert.
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: I got no gun.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: That’s what I count on. That’s how
dialog: I sleep at night, you with no gun.
dialog: I’ve got a gun. You just show up.
dialog: I wouldn’t want you chuckleheads
dialog: coming up a stairway for me with a
text: hairpin. With a harmonica.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Hairy chin. Harmony harp. Don't
dialog: wind me up.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: (smiling at Lionel)
text: With an unlit cigar. With a
dialog: fucking chicken wing. Right,
dialog: Brooklyn?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Chicky wing ding!
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Seriously, don’t throw me off.
dialog: Give us the rest of it.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Right. Now, if I say “Lemme use
dialog: the can.” it means we’re coming
dialog: out. Get Gil, get in the car and
dialog: get ready to follow. And stay
dialog: tight, I might need to give
dialog: someone the slip, got it?
dialog: Pink Revisions 4.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: ‘Problem’- up the stairs, ‘use the
dialog: can’- start the car. Got it. Get,
dialog: gotten, got, GOTCHA!
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Lionel’s got it. Just follow his
dialog: lead.
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: You gotta be kidding me...
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Coney what did I say when I came
dialog: into the office last Tuesday?
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Lionel?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (like a machine)
dialog: Took your coat off, put your hat
dialog: on the 3rd hook. “I just stood
text: next to a girl on the ferry and
dialog: the smile she gave me will get me
dialog: through this winter” Threw Danny
dialog: your notebook. “How’s a guy
dialog: supposed to keep a marriage
dialog: together when 22 is on the menu?”
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: (nods) Like I said, Lionel’s on
dialog: point.
text: And he heads across the street
scene_heading: INT/EXT SAME CAR - 20 MINUTES LATER 2
text: Coney is reading the paper, Lionel is locked on the street
text: and the door. Lionel is carefully folding a stick of gum
text: exactly in half before putting it in his mouth.
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: (grumbling)
dialog: Another Minna Classic. Freezin’
dialog: our asses off, don’t even know the
dialog: score.
dialog: Pink Revisions 5.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What you got big plans this
dialog: weekend, Coney? Coney Island! Coney
dialog: Island hot dogs! Get your Coney
dialog: Island hot dogs right here! !
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: Alright, Freakshow, just a little
dialog: quieter please...
text: Lionel looks at his watch. Second hand hits the 12 and he
text: hits Coney in the arm.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (cont'd)
dialog: We're on. Get ready.
text: Lionel hops out of the car and heads for a payphone.
scene_heading: INT. HARLEM APT/EXT HARLEM ST/PAYPHONE (INTERCUT) - DAY 3
text: C.U.: A PHONE, ringing on top of a dresser...
text: MINNA'S HAND reaches in and picks it up and off the screen.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Hey, boss.
dialog: (muted)
dialog: Boss, bosses, bossed, bossy...
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: You keeping it together, Brooklyn?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Yeah...it’s under control. I got
dialog: my gum. I got ya covered.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I know it. Okay, like we said,
dialog: stay tuned in, pal. I’m might
dialog: need that head of yours later.
scene_heading: LIONEL SEES: TWO BIG BLACK CARS PULL UP DOWN THE STREET
text: Two men get out of each and converge on the sidewalk in
text: front of the building. One of them is A GIANT MAN IN A DARK
text: COAT...easily 7'0”.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Hey. They’re on the way, Frank
dialog: Pink Revisions 6.
text: In the apartment A DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: (reacting to the GIANT)
dialog: Jesus...Everything cool, Boss?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Cool as can be. Just a little
dialog: chat.
text: CLOSE ON: THE DRESSER as Minna opens the top drawer and
text: puts the phone down inside with the receiver still off the
text: cradle. LEAVES THE DRAWER OPEN A CRACK so Lionel can
dialog: listen in...
text: ON LIONEL: Looking over to...THE DOOR. The four guys get
dialog: buzzed in.
text: LIONEL leans out and waves to CONEY who hustles out of the
text: car and to the door, buzzes, enters, gives thumbs up.
text: Lionel folds up a handkerchief and rubber bands it to the
text: phone mouthpiece. He closes his eyes to focus and listen.
text: (We see the meeting in the apartment AS IMAGINED BY LIONEL,
text: and the action on the street around him and over all this
text: there’s NO SOUND but what Lionel hears through that phone
dialog: receiver in the dresser.)
text: Muffled and broken, HE HEARS: FOOTSTEPS and a DOOR OPEN
speaker_heading: MINNA (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: Gentlemen...thanks for coming.
text: CU -- Ice dropping in a glass just above the phone.
speaker_heading: MINNA (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: Drink?
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: When I want a drink I'll finda
text: bar and a blonde, now explain this
dialog: crap.
text: SOUND -- a FILE SLAPPING DOWN ON A TABLE
text: LIONEL’S POV: Kids playing on the street.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Well, which part didn’t you
dialog: understand?
dialog: Pink Revisions 7.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: How about the part where you got
dialog: the idea to go poke around after
text: some colored broad for starters.
text: CU: Lionel mouths ‘colored broad’ silently to himself then--
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (into his sleeve)
dialog: Cold wig on a rod }!
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: She works for the committee.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: She’s a fucking secretary. We told
dialog: you to dig on Horowitz...find
dialog: something we can shut them down
dialog: with.
text: CU: Lionel mouths “Horowitz”
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: There’s nothing there. Unless
dialog: you’re dumb enough to try to wave
dialog: that old Red flag of yours one
dialog: more time.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Yeah, right. So, if you want to
dialog: know what’s going in that report,
dialog: that ‘colored broad’ is doing most
dialog: of the legwork on Hamilton for
dialog: ‘em. And what she’s sniffing
dialog: around I’m sure is of concern to
dialog: you gentlemen, so I put some time
dialog: into that too.
text: CU: Lionel mouths ‘Hamilton report’
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: You looked in some funny places.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: What can I tell ya? I’m a snoop,
dialog: that’s what I do. It’s called
dialog: being thorough, Lou.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: It’s called wasting our time. This
dialog: is fucking Chinese.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: If you need a road map to wipe
dialog: your ass I can’t help you, Lou.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Pink Revisions 8.
speaker_heading: MINNA (CONT'D)
dialog: These gentlemen understand it or
dialog: they wouldn’t be here.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: (quiet - the leader)
dialog: Walk us through it, Mr. Minna,
dialog: just to be sure we’re very clear.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: (picks up something)
dialog: It’s right here in ink, Mo---
text: A COP CAR POPS ITS SIREN TO CLEAR THE KIDS AND THEN SIRENS
text: OUT ONTO THE AVENUE.
text: LIONEL, clutches the phone to his chest, desperate to
text: muffle the sound.
text: An agonizing 10 seconds lost.
text: Exasperated, LIONEL finally gets back on...
speaker_heading: MINNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-anybody like to offer a
dialog: different interpretation?
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: None of this can be proved.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: That signature is the real deal.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: If you knew the man, you’d know
dialog: why that seems highly implausible
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I checked it against others. It’s
dialog: his John Hancock. And the paper
dialog: trail backs it up. Lay that on top
dialog: of the rest of what I’ve included
dialog: here and I think we can all agree
dialog: you’re sitting on a powder keg.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: And you think Horowitz knows all
dialog: of this?
text: A pause.
dialog: Pink Revisions 9.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Nope. Or you'd already be eating
dialog: shit. It’ve been in the paper the
dialog: next day.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: The girl: she married, got family?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: It’s all in my file...her mother’s
dialog: dead. No brother or sisters.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: What about her father?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Lou you’re Mr Straight Talk. Why
dialog: don’t you go ask him and see what
dialog: he says.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: You think this is funny?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: No, Lou, just ironic. There’s a
dialog: difference. Look it up. Father’s
text: a busted up vet. He runs a club up
dialog: here...a jook joint. Drinks too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: Mr Minna, I'll assume you're aware
dialog: of what occurs a week from
dialog: Thursday?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: So then you understand our firm
dialog: determination to keep such
dialog: information out of the hands of
dialog: our detractors?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Sure. Nature of the game.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: These are all photos. May I hope
dialog: you’re in possession of the
dialog: originals?
dialog: Pink Revisions 10.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: Excellent. We’ll need to get those
dialog: from you.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I figured as much. I thought we
dialog: might talk about terms.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: Terms?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I think it’s fair to say that the
dialog: initiative involved in securing
dialog: these...assets...goes a good bit
dialog: beyond the original scope of work
dialog: in our arrangement.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: ...the fuck are you talkin’?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I’m thinking a bonus...for taking
text: a wild card off the table before
dialog: it got in the game.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: I see. And what do you have in
dialog: mind?
text: A small sound -- a piece of paper being unfolded?
text: Lionel can’t hear...he’s nervous.
text: LIONEL’S POV: Cop car way down the street; a BLACK GUY
text: (BILLY ROSE) walking by lights a smoke, looks across the
text: street and moves on; Coney in the door
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Have you lost your mind?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Let’s not kid each other fellas.
dialog: You got the biggest gravy train
dialog: this century pulling out. I’m
text: asking for a seat in the rear
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: That’s quite impossible.
dialog: Pink Revisions 11.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: I'd double this at any paper in
dialog: town.
text: There is a sudden deadly silence. Lionel senses it.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: I’m gonna pretend you didn’t say
dialog: what you just said and we’re gonna-
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Just an observation. I’m here in
dialog: good faith. Just assessing the
dialog: value...
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: You can forget it--
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Jeez Lou, what’s your beef with a
dialog: guy getting paid for good work? I
dialog: mean you get paid for doing
dialog: nothing as far as I can--- UHHNH!
scene_heading: A THUD. LIONEL FREEZES.
speaker_heading: DEEP VOICE (GIANT)
dialog: Watch it.
speaker_heading: LOU
dialog: Are you fuckin’ packin’!?
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: (winded)
dialog: Jesus, take it easy...Had it since
dialog: the war. Remember that thing some
dialog: of us fought in?
speaker_heading: A SCUFFLE
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: Enough! Lou...a word...
text: It goes quiet...whispered conference that Lionel strains to
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: Oh come on fellas, don’t get ina
dialog: twist, it’s just busi...
dialog: Pink Revisions 12.
speaker_heading: LIEBERMAN
dialog: (evenly)
dialog: Mr. Minna, we do appreciate the
dialog: service you’ve rendered. These
dialog: gentlemen will take you to get the
dialog: originals and if all is in order
dialog: we'll arrange an appropriate
dialog: resolution for you.
speaker_heading: MINNA
dialog: (accommodating)
dialog: Sure, of course...like I said,
dialog: good faith. Just lemme use the can
dialog: first...
text: LIONEL hears the signal and goes into high gear. He hangs
text: up the phone and turns to exit, then turns back and hangs
text: it up again, then dashes out...
scene_heading: EXT HARLEM STREET / INT LIONEL CAR - DAY 4
text: ...and runs across street, signaling at CONEY in the door,
text: who sees him coming, gets the message and hustles out and
dialog: over to...
text: THE CAR... They both tumble in.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
scene_heading: PURPLE HITTER!
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: They hit him! It sounded like they
dialog: hit him!
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: For chrissake, freakshow! What are
dialog: we doing here?
text: He starts to get out but Lionel stops him.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: No. He said “lemme use the can”
dialog: We're supposed to follow him. CAN
speaker_heading: THE MAN!
text: They look across to...THE DOORWAY
text: MINNA and the FOUR MEN come out. THE GIANT and MINNA move
text: a step or two off while a SMALLER MAN (LOU) confers briefly
text: with the other two, whose faces are obscured.
dialog: Pink Revisions 13.
text: LOU nods and they all split. The TWO MEN, still not
text: clearly seen, turn and hurry off the opposite direction
text: into a waiting car.
text: The GIANT and LOU move Minna toward the front car. Minna
dialog: looks okay...is he holding his side a little? He’s
text: definitely being escorted to the car. He moves as if to
text: turn toward them but THE GIANT takes him by the elbow and
text: herds him forward. MINNA shakes off the guy’s hand.
scene_heading: ON LIONEL AND CONEY
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: I don’t like it...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Me neither, let’s go.
text: They pile out of the car, Gil has to wait as the SECOND
text: BLACK CAR goes by, losing a step on...
text: LIONEL, moving up the sidewalk fast, now directly across
text: the street as Frank gets pushed into the back seat of the
speaker_heading: FIRST BLACK CAR
text: Cc.U. - LIONEL staring across at...FRANK, who sees him and
text: stares back. Is he nodding? Does he want help? What is
dialog: that look on his face? Hard to tell...he could be shaking
text: his head to back off...And then the other guy gets in,
text: blocking him, the car pulls out and he’s gone...
text: LIONEL AND CONEY scramble into the car, Gil at the wheel.
text: He revs it, clips the fender of the car parked in front of
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: This fucking guy!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
scene_heading: EAT ME MISTER DICKEY-WEED!
text: That gets even Coney to look over for a second as they

scene_heading: EXT HARLEM SIDE STREET / INT LIONEL CAR - CONTINUOUS - DAY5

text: Inside the car: with Lionel and Coney as they race, trying

text: CONEY snaps forward and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, THROWING
text: LIONEL INTO THE DASH as the other car whips ahead and ...

text: a cab stopped at a light. MINNA’S CAR is forced to a stop
text: too at the red light, cars crossing in front

scene_heading: EXT HARLEM AVENUE - STOPLIGHT 7
text: Lionel runs past the car in front of them and cuts across
text: in front of it, RIGHT INTO THE PATH OF AN ONCOMING CAR THAT
text: SLAMS ON ITS BRAKES, ALMOST BOUNCING HIM OFF ITS HOOD, but
text: he never stops, cutting up the lane toward...THE BLACK CAR.
text: But just as LIONEL gets within a few strides of it...
text: THE LIGHT GOES GREEN AND THE BLACK CAR SURGES FORWARD

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: We lost him!
text: Hidden beyond a TRUCK in the right lane up ahead, THE BLACK

text: UNDER the structure of a massive bridge... CONEY almost
text: blasts past, but rips the turn from the middle lane,
text: forcing another car to brake, horn blaring. And now they
text: can see the car up ahead, whipping under the bridge toward
text: a dark turn ahead...
speaker_heading: CONEY
dialog: Where’s he going?
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Son of a bitch!

text: half and pops it in his mouth and then enters into...
scene_heading: INT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 52
text: An open space with desks pushed up against one another. Low
text: budget informality. A few private offices with doors at the
text: far end and right in front by the door...
text: Lionel enters and goes to close the door but has to re-open
text: it and close it twice more to make it sound right. He’s
dialog: good at stakeouts, not at this part. HIS EYES flick

text: People busy at work on phones, typing, filling out forms,

dialog: Josephine or Laura?
text: She points at each as she says their names and Lionel makes

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: No I’m sure it was Mildred. She

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST (BETTY)
dialog: Betty. What sort of application.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: My vendor’s license.

speaker_heading: LIONEL (cont'd) (CONT'D)

text: Gabby and LAURA look at each other. Who the hell was that?
scene_heading: INT. LIONEL’S CAR/EXT. HOUSING COMMITTEE OFFICE - DAY 53

text: THROUGH THE CAMERA we see... LAURA emerge, STRIKINGLY
scene_heading: PRETTY with LIGHT BROWN SKIN; CLICK. CLICK.

text: IN LIONEL’s CAMERA: She rings and waits but no response.
text: She steps back and looks up at...
text: A LIGHTED WINDOW all the way up on the 5th floor.
text: She rings again then pulls out a flyer like the one Lionel
text: saw, writes a note on it and stuffs it in a box, then
text: quickly gets back in the cab and takes off.
text: LIONEL gets out and goes over to look at the name on the

speaker_heading: TONY

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Laura Rose. Rose is a rose is a

scene_heading: EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - MORNING 61

scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - MORNING 63
text: Laura boards the train and moves toward an empty seat only

text: with no expression and he back at her, daring her. She
text: turns her back to him leans against a pole, facing directly
text: at LIONEL, which makes him feel a tic coming that he
text: comically struggles to suppress. She takes a book from her
text: bag, some sort of textbook and begins to read, studying and
text: with this he turns away to release a tic and shout. A WOMAN
text: WITH A SMALL GIRL reacts to this and moves the child away
dialog: from him.
text: This makes Laura look up over her book for a moment, just
text: as he turns back around and they meet each others gaze for
text: just a second. She is composed and lovely.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR - TIMECUT - A FEW STOPS LATER 64
text: PEOPLE GETTING OFF AND ON...More of them white now. Laura

scene_heading: EXT. FORT GREENE ROWHOUSE STREET - DAY 65
text: Laura walks down a block with Lionel tailing behind.
text: The neighborhood is edgy, run down, with many boarded up
text: row houses, uncollected trash and abandoned furnishings.
text: LAURA goes up a stoop and rings a bell. A BLACK LADY
text: answers, wary. Laura talks for a moment and removes some
text: papers from her bag, handing them to the woman. The woman
text: glances at them, nods and closes the door.
text: ANOTHER DOOR. She buzzes.
text: A FACE IN THE SECOND FLOOR WINDOW... a wave.
text: ANOTHER BLACK LADY smiles and hands Laura a sheaf of the
text: same forms and they talk. Lionel can see that the woman is
text: indignant and that Laura is TAKING NOTES.
text: ANOTHER DOOR...this building so bombed out it looks
text: abandoned but AN OLD BLACK MAN WRAPPED IN A BLANKET OPENS
text: and this time Laura goes inside.
text: Lionel glimpses her in the window of the first floor. He
text: pulls some small BINOCULARS out of his pocket, checks
text: around then looks through them...
text: BINOCULAR POV: through the window, LAURA talks with the
text: OLD MAN. It’s obviously freezing in there. She takes out
text: papers and sits with him, asking questions and writing his
text: answers into the forms.
text: LIONEL turns around for a closer look at a rowhouse behind
text: him, its front door and second story windows boarded up. He
text: looks up AT THE FRONT DOOR
scene_heading: A SIGN: CONDEMNED: PROPERTY OF: BELMONT DEVELOPERS...
text: A SOUND SURPRISES HIM and he jumps. To his surprise a

text: He watches as she heads for a nondescript
text: storefront/office: Inwood Residential Services. She goes to
text: the door and tries it but it’s locked. She turns and faces
text: the street, clearly exasperated as a CAR pulls up and GABBY
text: gets out of the driver side. She and Laura confer and
text: Laura moves to get in the car.
text: LIONEL spots a cab and hails it but hustles over to the
text: storefront for a quick look at the sign on the door:
scene_heading: “INWOOD: Your Happy Home is Our Business!”. HOURS: 9-5

speaker_heading: REPORTER(JACOB GLEASON)

dialog: On housing not highways...
text: Lionel focuses on him... his VOICE familiar...
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: You’re making the same promises to

dialog: Tremont, where your so-called
dialog: ‘relocation services’ vanished
dialog: into thin air and left families

dialog: People have a right to know what

dialog: (a few laughs)
dialog: Mrs Horowitz, thank you for work
dialog: and your passion. Surely we can
dialog: all agree that even in a City as
dialog: great as ours we have slums. And
dialog: that a slum is not something to
dialog: romanticize or preserve. You tear
dialog: it down and improve quality of--
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: A neighborhood is not a slum
dialog: because poor people and minorities
dialog: live there, Mr. Mayor. East
dialog: Tremont wasn’t a slum, Third
dialog: Avenue wasn’t a slum and Fort
dialog: Greene is not a slum either, these
dialog: are working class communities.
dialog: (to Randolph)
dialog: Your developers are making it a

text: This brings Randolph lunging forward.
speaker_heading: RANDOLPH
dialog: That is unsubstantiated,
dialog: unmitigated bunk!

speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: We have it on paper, we have

dialog: in American history Mrs. Horowitz
dialog: and you are gumming it up with

speaker_heading: MAN (PAUL)
dialog: Name and place of residence, like

text: A smattering of applause. The energy is winding Lionel up,

text: RANDOLPH stares out seeking the source of the voice, eyes
text: narrowing, glaring. He crosses his arms defiantly. He looks
dialog: at the Mayor: “Handle it.”
text: The MAYOR rises.
speaker_heading: MAYOR
dialog: Now see here, we all know

speaker_heading: LIONEL

text: THE MAN is neatly dressed but his clothes are visibly worn
text: and shabby. Gaunt and graying, he could be taken for a bum
text: but his eyes are fierce and sharp, hawkish. We will come to
dialog: know him as Paul.
text: He regards Lionel with curiosity...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: ‘Hammy Ham House Head’, huh?
dialog: That’s good. I’1l have to remember

dialog: Yeah, that’s the rub in life
dialog: alright... ‘if’... ‘if only’...

text: He shakes his head and starts to walk away muttering to

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Hey, hold on... tell me something.
dialog: That guy Lieberman, he’s in charge
dialog: of this Hamilton deal?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: In charge? No, he’s not in

dialog: guy calling himself Mayor but...
dialog: (laughs, turns away)
dialog: They all work formosa...

speaker_heading: PAUL (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You said “Formosa”...what’s that?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What? Let me go! You nuts?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You said “They’re all working

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What’s ‘formosa’? Let go of me.
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: “For Moses.” Jesus. I said they’re

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Mo Randolph? That guy who came in?

text: Paul talks like a firehose...disgorging so much

text: with the thread. Huge pent up frustration venting in urgent

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: The Mayor?! That clown is so green
dialog: he doesn’t even know what he
dialog: doesn’t know yet. He’ll be out the

dialog: every person he turns to for
text: advice is on Randolph’s payroll.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I thought he was Commissioner of
dialog: Parks?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He is.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: But they called him Construction
dialog: Commissioner.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: He’s that too now. They never even
dialog: had that position until the Feds
dialog: decided to get in the housing
dialog: game. It had no defined powers so
dialog: he defined ‘em and the Feds
dialog: approved and now how much control
dialog: of that money has the City got?
dialog: Zero. He's got it all. You know
dialog: what ‘eminent domain' means? If
dialog: he says it's a slum, it goes. He
dialog: used to have to fight to put his
dialog: highways and parks where he
dialog: wanted, now he can go anywhere,
dialog: tear anything down.

speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: He can condemn a whole section of

dialog: And he'll go at it with an axe.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: SMACKS AXE. He'll piss too many

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, they love him! That’s what
dialog: makes me so... He flies above it.
text: They revere him.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Because he built the parks! As
dialog: long as you're the guy who brings
dialog: people parks, you walk with the
dialog: angels, you can't lose. The day
dialog: Rockaway Beach opened, Moses
dialog: Randolph became a folk hero in
dialog: this town. But people don't
dialog: realize how much he hates them.
dialog: “The Hero of the Public Who Hates
dialog: People”. There's your headline.
dialog: And you know who he hates
dialog: especially? (mouths ‘Negroes’ )
dialog: He's going to seize every
dialog: neighborhood in this city that's
dialog: not white and turn it over to his
dialog: hand-picked private Developers.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: So he’s getting rich. Paid off.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nah, he doesn't want money...he
dialog: wants control and he brokers money
dialog: to get it and guard it. Some men
dialog: aren't satisfied unless they have

text: RANDOLPH spots Paul though. They LOCK EYES for just a

text: Paul holds THE FOLDER out. RANDOLPH stares at him then says

text: Darker inside...gloomy. He can hear voices upstairs.
text: Daylight cutting through in hard shafts. We can see that

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: This is me.
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: My father owns this place. I grew

speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Pretty hopping on a Monday night.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Yeah, hottest band in the world,

speaker_heading: LAURA (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: You can’t exactly disturb the

dialog: band.
text: She indicates ‘C’mon’. He gives in and they get out into..
scene_heading: INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT 90
dialog: This place is for real. No mid-town mainstream joint. A lot
text: of energy...buzz of anticipation over who’s playing...a few
dialog: white Beat kids from Columbia trying to blend in...
text: Almost immediately it starts to infect Lionel. His head
text: jerks and he pops gum right away...Laura points him at a
text: table against the wall and boots two young cats out of it
text: with one look. She heads for the end of the bar and the
text: cash register, bringing the BARTENDER to her with a look.
dialog: She clearly has the run of the place...
text: As Lionel sits he takes it all in...sees eyes on him. Cocks

dialog: is right...
text: LIONEL’S POV: Laura drilling the BARTENDER over something
text: to do with the register count. He’s giving her back talk
text: and she’s not having it. She SLAPS THE BAR HARD TWICE,
text: shutting him up and dresses him down. The TRUMPET PLAYER
text: laughs at this and wags his finger at the bartender then
text: takes the stage.
text: Lionel gets up and moves to the end of the bar to get a
text: drink, watching her and meeting her eye...she starts
text: walking toward him and SMILES and it makes things slow down
text: for a second...and then right as she takes the stool next
text: to him...the MUSIC kicks in...
text: A HARD FAST SNARE RIFF: and then it’s ON.
text: It hits Lionel like a shot and he WHOOPS loud...but so does
text: half the joint...and for once he doesn’t seem so weird.
text: Laura laughs and we JUMP CUT INTO:

text: BILLY whispering back to the guy and indicating...
text: Suddenly the guy is at Laura’s elbow pulling on her and
text: whispering. Lionel is too into the music to notice...he’s
text: on his feet and jerking spasmodically...but LAURA is having
text: none of it. She knows this guy and is telling him to beat
dialog: it.
text: SONG ENDS to clapping and shouts. LIONEL hooting and

text: BILLY, his eyes fierce on Lionel and jaw tight.
text: LAURA GRABS a clueless LIONEL and pulls him on the floor to

speaker_heading: TRUMPET (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: One for my Laura Rose....
text: He slides into the SLOW SAD THEME WE HEARD OVER THE
text: TITLES...and Laura steps up to Lionel, other couples
text: standing with them. LIONEL is still jerking hard, wound
text: up...BILLY is frowning, furious and worried...
text: LAURA puts her hand on LIONEL’s shoulder and pulls in
text: close, looking at his face as if willing him to calm
text: down...AND HE DOES. Slowly her touch settles him, he
text: breathes easier and dances with her, holding still...
text: BILLY whispers urgently, angry to two more YOUNG CATS who
dialog: nod.
text: They dance slow until the song ends...it can’t last
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: TRUMPET (cont'd) (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s for Laura...
text: The crowd claps as Lionel stares at her not wanting to let

scene_heading: INT. KING ROOSTER JAZZ CLUB 92
text: LIONEL SPINS and gets SWEPT INTO THE MUSIC AGAIN
text: JUMP CUT: LIONEL HAS LOST HIS JACKET, HIS TIE IS LOOSE AND
text: HE’S IN A FRENZY. SCATTING AND BOPPING WITH THE BAND,

dialog: Pink Revisions 94,
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Really. I thought being the press

speaker_heading: GABBY

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Seemed like a bit of a quack.

dialog: Quack-quack-quackeroni.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Now that’s unkind. And incorrect.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: He’s sure got a bug up his ass

text: a look at him, shocked by this statement.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: I have no idea how you came by
dialog: that information but I’1l venture
dialog: it wasn’t from Paul. It’s a
dialog: knowledge I’ve never even shared
dialog: with my own staff.
dialog: (beat, deciding...)
dialog: Paul Randolph understands the way
dialog: a city works like very few
dialog: do...the living machinery of it.
dialog: He’s as brilliant and visionary as
dialog: his brother. But still a true
dialog: idealist.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: So what...he’s an organizer?
dialog: Against his own brother?
dialog: Pink Revisions 96.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Lord no...No. He’s one of the most

dialog: generation. But he’s had a very
dialog: rough road for a while
dialog: now...hanging around the fringes
dialog: for years picking up scraps on
dialog: jobs he should have led. Such a
dialog: waste. But he has proposed a
dialog: master plan for the redesign of
dialog: the State’s electrical grid that
dialog: is a work of genius and everybody
dialog: knows it. They have to approve it
dialog: and they’1l have to give him the
dialog: appointment to lead it... it’ll
dialog: make every agency that touches it
dialog: look good and so even his brother
dialog: won't be able to deny him.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why would he deny him?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Because it was Moses Randolph who
dialog: destroyed him.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What makes a person destroy their
dialog: own brother?
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: They came from a very well-to-do
dialog: family...raised for civic duty,
dialog: literally. They were like the twin
dialog: princes of the reform movement.
dialog: But they broke horribly. Who knows
dialog: why. I’ve always assumed it was
dialog: because Moses went inside and
dialog: started working for the Governor.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Not exactly an epic betrayal.
speaker_heading: GABBY
dialog: Oh, the political is personal in
dialog: that family. Paul is very
dialog: opinionated as you saw and if you
dialog: disagree with Moses Randolph you
dialog: become an enemy of the state. He
dialog: takes more sadistic joy in hurting
dialog: people than any man I’ve ever

dialog: Expressway, Title 1 and everything

dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: People have no idea what’s about
dialog: to happen here. If he puts this
dialog: through, the fate of the City’s
dialog: written. Millions of people ground
dialog: under or caught in this hell
dialog: forever...or at least until cars
dialog: can fly. All because one man is
dialog: blind to the ways the world has
dialog: changed and contemptuous of any
dialog: vision but his own. He thinks
dialog: this is the final stroke of his
