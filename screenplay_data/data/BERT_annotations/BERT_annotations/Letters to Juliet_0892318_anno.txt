scene_heading: INT. SOPHIA AND VICTOR'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: A well-decorated one-bedroom in the Meat Packing District.
text: OPEN ON: Long strands of freshly made pasta hung to dry in
text: the living room. Hundreds of pieces. Draped off lamps, across
text: tables, over chairs, everywhere. It's an extraordinary sight.
text: Amongst this adornment of noodles, we find a beautiful young
text: woman on the couch working on a laptop, trying to
text: concentrate. She seems a bit distracted by the pasta that
text: surrounds her. She is SOPHIA MARCUS.
text: Sophia sighs as she looks up from her computer at the sounds
text: of cooking that can be heard coming from the...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. WHERE:
text: A man toils over a pot of simmering tomato sauce. He is a
text: handsome Italian-American with big brown eyes. He is VICTOR.
text: Victor tastes the sauce he's cooking the way a sommelier
text: tastes wine. Slow and deliberate. He's pleased but subdued.
text: Victor carefully plates some of that fresh pasta with his
text: sauce and takes it into the living room.
text: Sophia looks stressed out. She keeps glancing at what looks
text: like a draft of a magazine article, certain parts have been
text: highlighted. She's in the middle of typing something when
text: Victor approaches with the plate of food.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Here, taste.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: OK, gimme a second.
text: Victor waits impatiently as Sophia finishes typing. She sets
text: aside the article and dutifully takes a forkful and eats it.
text: Victor watches her closely as she chews, tastes, swallows.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Delicious. Your best yet. Really.
text: Sophia reaches for the article just as a piece of pasta slips
text: off a lamp and falls onto the page. She picks it off.
text: Sophia's affirmation hasn't convinced Victor, he tastes just
text: the sauce as if trying to pinpoint a flaw.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: There's not too much garlic?
text: Sophia looks up from her laptop - a little annoyed.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Just enough garlic.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Too spicy?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Good spice.
text: She tries to go back to work. He's still standing there.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Maybe it needs more basil?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Victor I'm saying it's delicious.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You're saying it's delicious but
dialog: you're not telling me it's
dialog: delicious.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Sweetie, please, I have to finish
dialog: this, Bobby needs this tonight, I
dialog: still have to pack, could you think
dialog: out loud in the kitchen? You're not
dialog: doing much for my concentration.
text: Realization flashes in Victor's eyes. He tastes again.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: That's it. It's too concentrated.
text: Victor plants a big kiss on a startled Sophia.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Thanks babe.
text: Sophia shakes her head and goes back to work as Victor heads
text: into the kitchen muttering to himself.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, NEW YORK -- MORNING
text: The doors of the building open. Sophia and Victor emerge. She
text: is carrying a suitcase as he follows her reading a Gourmet
text: Magazine. They walk down the steps to a waiting cab.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Passports?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Tickets?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Apartment reservation?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Euros?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Suitcase?
text: They reach the cab. She turns to him. Smirks.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I have mine.
text: He looks down at his empty hands.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Shit.
text: He runs back into the building as she puts her case in the
text: trunk and gets in the cab.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- LATER
text: Sophia waits. The trunk is slammed and Victor gets in.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
speaker_heading: JFK please.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Actually, sweetie, I just have to
dialog: make one stop.
text: She knows where. She just looks at him.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S RESTAURANT -- DAY
dialog: The restaurant is basically a building site. It's a fantastic
dialog: space but right now it'd take an experienced eye to fully
dialog: appreciate it's potential.
text: Victor is looking at an assortment of light fittings with
text: MARK, his bartender.
text: Sophia walks through the mess with a slightly detached air of
text: curiosity. BUILDERS are at work all around her.
text: Her cell rings. She checks the ID. Takes a breath. Answers:
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hey Bobby.
scene_heading: INT. MAGAZINE EDITOR'S OFFICE. WHERE:
text: BOBBY BROOKS, editor-in-chief, a rotund, bald, but benevolent
text: looking man is talking on a wireless earpiece in a cluttered
text: office. He's looking at an 8x10 photograph of Donald Trump.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why can't we say Trump's comb over
dialog: wraps around clockwise? I'm looking
dialog: at the picture we're running with
text: the piece. It's wrapping clockwise.
text: INTERCUT: Sophia has made her way outside the restaurant.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You can say it. You just can't
dialog: state it as a fact.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It works better as a fact. It's a
dialog: fun little detail. People love fun
dialog: little details.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I looked at every picture I could
dialog: find of him in the last ten years.
dialog: I talked to his stylist. The hair
dialog: changes. It's a fact if you qualify
dialog: with "usually" or "typically"
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: People hate qualifiers.
text: Sophia shrugs as if to say "What do you want me to say?"
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Those are the facts.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah well your facts are getting in
dialog: the way of my fun.
text: Bobby sets the picture aside. A beat.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hey. While I have you. I wanted to
dialog: talk you about something...
text: Sophia is pacing now. She's visibly nervous - like she's
text: debating whether or not to just get off the phone.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Talk.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well. I was thinking. Since I'm
dialog: going to Italy already. Maybe I
dialog: could try doing a travel piece or
dialog: something as a feature or--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I have writers that do travel
dialog: features. You don't do travel
dialog: features. You do fact checking.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah. I know. I just. I was
dialog: thinking I could try something new.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why do you want to try something
dialog: new? You're good at fact checking.
dialog: Too good.
text: Bobby's Assistant hurries out to answer a ringing phone.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I feel like I can contribute more--
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You contribute plenty. My writers
dialog: count on you. They can't do what
dialog: they do unless you do what you do.
dialog: You're good at something, be happy
dialog: for that, be grateful for it, a lot
dialog: of people are good at nothing.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah. I guess. It's just--
text: His Assistant signals that Bobby needs to take the call.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Keep swinging in your wheelhouse.
dialog: You'll get more hits.
text: She sighs - deflated. Bobby suddenly remembers something.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh and I need a table at Babbo this
dialog: Friday. Can you take care of it?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Seriously Bobby. You do know that
dialog: you have a new assistant?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I do. But she doesn't know the
dialog: Maitre d'. You do. You got it?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You're one in a million kid.
text: He rolls to that waiting call.
scene_heading: INT. CAB -- LATER
text: Sophia sits staring out the window, lost in her thoughts.
text: Victor gets in, breathless and excited.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Verona here we come.
text: He notices Sophia not sharing his enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What's wrong?
text: Sophia just kind of shakes her head as if to say "nothing".
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What'd Bobby want?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: To argue about which direction
text: Trump's comb over wraps.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Counter clockwise?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He still treats me like I'm his
dialog: assistant. He'll always treat me
dialog: like I'm his assistant.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It's not that bad. He values you.
dialog: Hey, you've got job security right?
text: She just looks at him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Right.
text: Content he's made her feel better Victor dives back into his
text: Gourmet Magazine. They ride in silence. Until.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I took the job because I thought
dialog: it'd be a stepping stone... to
dialog: features, or covers, or something.
dialog: But there are no steps, there are
dialog: no stones, there's just Donald
text: Trump's hair.
text: She sighs - a sigh that's looking for reassurance.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You know you could always come work
dialog: with me at the restaurant.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I know. And I appreciate it.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You'd be great in fine dining.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So I've been told... by you.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You would be. You're beautiful,
dialog: smart, funny. You could run the
dialog: place if you wanted.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You just said I was beautiful. You
dialog: never tell me I'm beautiful.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You know you're beautiful.
text: He puts an arm around her and pulls her towards him.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Come on. Cheer up. Just forget it.
dialog: That's why we're going to Italy
dialog: right? To forget everything... the
dialog: magazine, the restaurant.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: We're going to Verona to meet the
dialog: suppliers for your restaurant. How
dialog: are we supposed to forget about it?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It's not just gonna be about the
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It's fine.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It's not just gonna be about the
dialog: restaurant. We're gonna relax, see
dialog: the sights, shop the stores, it
dialog: won't just be about the restaurant,
dialog: I promise. It's gonna be great...
text: Sophia wants to believe him but still looks skeptical.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: We're going to the home of Romeo
dialog: and Juliet. How romantic is that?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Didn't exactly work out for them
dialog: though did it?
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW STREET, VERONA -- DAY
text: A street that embodies true Verona, hidden away from the well-
text: worn tourist routes. A small restaurant runs down one side of
text: the street with tables filled with LOCALS eating lunch.
text: Sophia sits on the balcony of a rented apartment just above
text: this restaurant. She's reading a guide book to Verona while
text: occasionally looking down on life in the street below.
scene_heading: INT. RENTED APARTMENT -- BEDROOM -- LATER
text: Sophia walks in from the balcony looking at her guide book
text: just as Victor comes out of the bathroom drying his hair.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So I think we should start with the
text: Verona Arena then head over to the
dialog: Museo Castelvecchio...
text: Victor takes the guide book from her, tosses it on the bed.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: No, no, no, no, what are you doing?
dialog: That stuff's for tourists. To
dialog: discover the true heart and soul of
dialog: any country, first you have to
dialog: indulge in it's smells and tastes.
text: She just looks at him. Sometimes he's so full of it.
scene_heading: EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY
text: A small Fiat Cinquecento races down a road that cuts through
text: the heart of the countryside.
scene_heading: INT. WINERY -- DAY
text: Victor tastes a variety of wines with a dashing VITICOLTORE.
text: Sophia is trying to talk with one of the FIELD HANDS who just
text: brought in a bushel of grapes when she sees Victor by the
text: wine barrels waving her over with his camera. She sighs.
scene_heading: INT. IN FRONT OF THOSE WINE BARRELS:
text: Victor and the Viticoltore pose with their glasses raised in
text: toast for Sophia who prepares to take their picture.
text: As her camera flashes we cut to the STILL PHOTO itself.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF FOREST OUTSIDE VERONA -- DAY
text: The middle of nowhere. The kind of place where the mob buries
text: bodies. Sophia seems acutely aware of this.
text: Sophia and Victor are with a furtive looking MAN dressed in
text: army camo fatigues. There's a SMALL DOG at his side. The man
text: is holding a cloth covered basket. He removes the cloth with
text: a theatrical flourish to reveal a basket full of truffles.
text: Victor takes one out and smells it. He's awestruck.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Wow.
dialog: 10.
text: Sophia checks her watch. Shakes her head.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
text: Victor, The Man and Dog posing with the basket of truffles.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE, ITALY -- DAY
text: A rustic farmhouse set in the middle of acres of olives.
scene_heading: INT. OLIVE PRESS -- LATER
text: It's dank and dark. No electricity. No indoor plumbing.
text: Victor sits at the end of long table tasting olive oils with
text: a gnarled, walnut colored OLD MAN. There are dozens of
text: bottles of emerald green olive oil in-front of them.
text: Sophia has wandered to the other side of the room where she
text: watches WORKERS operating an ancient olive press. Something
text: drips on her from the ceiling.
text: Victor dips a piece of bread in a saucer of oil and tastes
text: it. He's in seventh heaven. He picks up a bottle.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: This is the one.
text: Sophia is talking with one of the Workers when she sees
text: Victor waving to her from across the room with that camera.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
text: Victor and his chosen bottle of olive oil posing in front of
text: the ancient olive press with The Old Man.
scene_heading: INT. CURING ROOM -- LATER
text: Victor and Sophia are in a huge ham curing room. It's
text: basically a giant, poorly-lit shack full of ham.
text: There's a row of cured pig heads hanging from hooks. Sophia
text: stares at one of them. It stares back. This unsettles her.
text: A BUTCHER slices thin pieces of prosciutto for them to taste.
text: Sophia turns down her taste - still staring at the pig head.
text: Victor tastes his, chews, then closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: That's incredible. Can you imagine
dialog: when people in The City taste this?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (cont'd)
dialog: I see lines. Wait. Maybe we should
text: have a deli next to the restaurant.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That's actually not a bad idea.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I know, I know, I'm on fire.
text: She has a thought. Then takes out her cell and steps outside.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN. WHERE:
text: Bobby is hustling down a congested street. He's walking fast
text: like he's late for something. His cell rings. He answers.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Bobby Brooks.
text: INTERCUT: Sophia just outside the shack of ham on her cell.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What if I did a piece on the food?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: An expose on how good Italian food
dialog: is. Bold, kid. I smell a Pulitzer.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You know the Mediterranean diet is
dialog: one of the healthiest in the world?
dialog: They have the lowest incidences of
dialog: coronary disease in Europe because
dialog: of all the pulses they eat...
text: Bobby shakes his head - she just doesn't get it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Jesus, Sophia. I gave you a
dialog: vacation. Go vacate. Get drunk, go
dialog: to a museum, get drunk then go to a
dialog: museum.
text: Sophia looks at Victor through the window getting ready to
text: taste a piece of one of the pig heads. She looks nauseous.
speaker_heading: BOBBY O/S
dialog: I gotta go. Stop abusing my cell.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Wait. What if I...
text: Bobby is about to walk into a high rise.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Ciao Bella.
text: He hangs up. She looks at her cell - disappointed, deflated.
text: Then she sees Victor waving her over with his camera through
text: the window. She rolls her eyes and dutifully walks back in.
scene_heading: FLASH CUT TO:
text: Victor and The Butcher posing with a huge ham between them.
scene_heading: EXT. CURING ROOM -- LATER
text: Sophia and Victor walk back to their car.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I gotta meet my Durum wheat guy -
dialog: best Durum wheat in North Italy...
text: She looks at him blankly.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You know, for pasta.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: If we leave now we should be able
text: to get up there before he closes.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I think I'll pass.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Hon? The best Durum wheat in all of
dialog: Italy. Aren't you curious?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah. Sure. I just... I needa
dialog: break. Do you mind?
text: He looks at her. A disappointed beat.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Alright. I'll drop you in town.
text: She smiles affectionately at his pouting.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You're missing out though.
text: She kisses him.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I know.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR CAFE, VERONA -- DAY
text: Sophia sits at table on the patio by herself sipping coffee.
text: The town bustles around her. She's got her laptop open. And a
text: blank note book open beside that.
text: She stares disdainfully at the blinking cursor on a blank
text: word document as if willing it to inspire her.
text: She finishes her coffee and looks around at the LOCALS and
text: TOURISTS chatting, laughing, shopping.
text: She looks about ready to give up when something catches her
dialog: eye through the crowds...
text: A YOUNG GIRL about fourteen years old is sitting on a curb at
text: the entrance to a courtyard across the street from Sophia.
text: The girl is reading a letter through a flood of tears. The
text: constant stream of PEOPLE passing by on their way in and out
text: of the courtyard hardly seem to notice her. But Sophia has.
text: The Girl looks up from her letter and sees Sophia watching
text: her. She looks back through those tears and the crowds. They
text: look at each other long and hard. Sophia smiles. The Girl
text: looks away.
text: The Girl's shoulders heave with a great silent sob as she
text: takes a last look at the letter, signs it, puts it an
text: envelope then disappears through the courtyard entrance.
text: Sophia watches her go. A beat of consideration. Then she
text: packs up her laptop, puts money on the table and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD CASA DI GIULIETTA -- VIA CAPELLO VERONA -- DAY
dialog: 
text: Sophia enters a strange, eerily quiet scene. This is the
text: supposed courtyard of Juliet Capulet's house. It's become a
text: shrine to TEENAGE GIRLS, their conversation is subdued.
text: There's an atmosphere of almost religious reverence.
text: Sophia walks past a group of girls looking up at The Balcony.
text: Another group gazes upon the Statue of Juliet - her left
text: breast polished from years of superstitious touching.
text: Sophia finally comes upon the girl from the street, so
text: desperate yet so full of hope. She's standing before a wall
text: that's covered in envelopes and letters.
dialog: 14.
text: Some are wedged between bricks, others are held in place by
text: chewing gum, but all are addressed to the same name: "Juliet"
text: Sophia watches as the girl finds a place for her letter. She
text: leaves it and turns to go. The girl is wiping away tears as
text: she passes Sophia on her way out of the courtyard. Their eyes
dialog: meet.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you OK?
text: The girl either doesn't understand her or has no interest in
text: discussing her problems with a stranger. She leaves without a
text: word. Sophia watches her go.
speaker_heading: BELLA 0/S
text: Her heart is broken.
text: Sophia turns to find a pretty Italian woman in her twenties
dialog: who just watched that whole exchange. She is BELLA.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Do you know her?
text: Bella shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: How do you know her heart's broken?
text: Nods to her letter on the wall.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: She wrote to Juliet.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: When your leg is broken, you go to
dialog: the doctor. When your heart is
dialog: broken, you come to Juliet.
text: Bella approaches the wall. Sophia follows her. She looks over
text: the dozens of proclamations of love and longing.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: There are so many of them.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: It's like this every day.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why do they do it?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: They want answers.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That they'll never get.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Says who?
text: And with that she starts collecting the letters, beginning
text: with the girl's from the street.
text: Sophia is startled at this intrusion, it doesn't seem right.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hey. Whoa. Wait. What are you
dialog: doing? You can't do that.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Why can't I?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Because it's like taking pennies
dialog: out of a wishing well or something,
dialog: these are people's wishes, you
dialog: can't just take people's wishes.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: But then how are we supposed to
dialog: give them answers?
text: This throws Sophia. She gives Bella an inquiring look.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Who's we?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Come. I'll show you.
text: They walk out of the courtyard and across an alley to a
text: restaurant. Sophia looks up and sees that it's called:
dialog: "Lettere a Giulietta".
scene_heading: INT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER
text: Bella walks through the restaurant into the kitchen. Sophia
text: follows. The kitchen is very busy. In the middle of it all is
text: the head chef, ANGELINA, a round woman in her sixties with a
text: no nonsense air about her. She's barking orders at her staff
dialog: when Bella and Sophia approach. (Italian in Italics)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Mama, this is Sophia, I'm just
dialog: gonna show her upstairs.
text: Angelina smiles at Sophia. Sophia smiles back. Angelina looks
text: at the basket of letters Bella is carrying.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: Looks like you'll be having a busy
dialog: night.
text: Bella nods then turns to Sophia.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: This way.
text: They walk through the kitchen and up some stairs into...
scene_heading: INT. THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARIES OF JULIET -- LATER
text: It's a small modern-looking office just above the restaurant.
text: Big arching windows overlook a courtyard, Posters on the wall
text: show scenes from "Romeo and Juliet" movies of the past.
text: There are desks and filing cabinets and computers. Three
text: friendly-looking WOMEN look up as Sophia and Bella walk in.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Ladies, this is Sophia.
text: Sophia kind of half waves at the smiling women.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: These are The Secretaries of
dialog: Juliet. We respond to the letters
dialog: she receives from around the world.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You mean you actually write back?
dialog: To everyone?
text: Bella smiles.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: We give answers.
scene_heading: INT. THE SECRETARIES' OFFICE -- LATER
text: Bella leads Sophia on a tour of the office.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So? How do you decide which of you
dialog: answers which letter?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: We all have our areas of expertise.
text: They pass a kindly looking woman in her seventies, MARIA.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Maria has been happily married for
dialog: fifty-one years so she tends to
dialog: handle mostly marital issues...
text: At the next desk is a bookish woman in her late fifties who
text: has the air of someone who has seen it all, FRANCESCA.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Francesca made her living as a
dialog: nurse so she usually does illness
dialog: and caring for the sick...
text: Lastly they approach an diminutive elderly woman reading a
text: letter and slowly shaking her head, DONATELLA.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Donatella has twelve children,
dialog: twenty-seven grandchildren, and six
dialog: great grandchildren...
dialog: (obviously)
dialog: She handles family matters.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And what about you?
text: Bella hesitates to answer. The other Women all look up from
text: their work with big smiles at this question.
speaker_heading: DONATELLA
dialog: Anything to do with love...
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Bella is our romantic...
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Our hopeless romantic...
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: At least I'm some kind of romantic.
text: Sophia is still trying to get her head around all of it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So? Who pays for all this?
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: We're all volunteers. We pitch in
dialog: what we can when we need to.
text: Bella nods. Sophia is blown away.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Wow.
text: Maria walks over with the basket of letters Bella collected.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: We're gonna start reading.
text: Bella notices Sophia looking curiously at the letters.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Would you like to help?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh. No. I shouldn't. I couldn't.
dialog: I'm not much of an expert on love
dialog: or romance or...
text: Bella gently places a letter written in English in her hand.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: You just have to read.
text: Sophia takes the letter.
text: CLOSE ON: Envelopes being opened with postage marks from all
dialog: over the world.
text: A volunteer TRANSLATOR works to transcribe some of the
text: letters written in foreign dialects.
text: Sophia and The Secretaries sit reading and sorting the day's
text: letters. As they read, we watch their reactions as we hear
dialog: certain portions of those letters read to us by the authors.
text: The VOICES are young and old, different accents, different
text: tones, but all are drenched in the same sense of longing.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN GIRL V/O
dialog: "Dear Juliet, how do you know when
dialog: you're in love? Can you know?..."
speaker_heading: AUSTRALIAN WOMAN V/O
dialog: ",..duliet, I don't think I want to
dialog: marry him but I so want to get
dialog: married. What should I do?..."
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: AMERICAN TEEN V/O
dialog: "...Is it weird to think sex is
dialog: gross? I mean cause it kinda is,
dialog: right? I'm not like weird for
dialog: thinking that am I?..."
text: Sophia places the teen's letter in one of several piles.

text: The letters have been read and sorted. The Secretaries are
text: busy composing their responses - all by hand.
text: Sophia sits watching Bella write.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Do you ever worry about being
dialog: wrong?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You're giving answers but how do
dialog: you know they're the right answers?
text: Bella considers the question for a beat.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: We don't tell anyone what to do, we
dialog: just share our experiences, we let
dialog: them know they're not alone. There
dialog: are no wrong right or wrong answers
dialog: when you write from your heart.
text: Sophia smiles at that sentiment.
scene_heading: INT. JUST OUTSIDE A BOARD ROOM IN NEW YORK. WHERE:
text: Bobby has excused himself from an editor's meeting to take a
text: call. The look on his face tell us he regrets doing so.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So people all over the world are
dialog: crazy enough to write love letters
dialog: and ask the advice of a fictional
dialog: teenage suicide... and these women
dialog: are all crazy enough to write back
dialog: under the alias of the very same
dialog: fictional teenage suicide... is
dialog: that pretty much the gist of it?
dialog: 20.
text: INTERCUT: Sophia is on her phone in The Secretaries' office.
text: She stutters and stammers - trying to spin it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well. Yeah. No. I'd probably focus
dialog: more on their moving, self-less
dialog: attempts to... spread hope, and
text: answer love's unanswered questions.
text: Bobby considers for a beat - a beat more than usual. Before:
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's not a feature. There's no
dialog: hook. Get me a hook then maybe,
dialog: just maybe, I'll let you go
dialog: fishing... And Sophia?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (hopeful)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Next time you call it better be to
dialog: find out what kind of wine I like.
scene_heading: EXT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- PATIO -- THE NEXT DAY
dialog: 
text: Sophia sits at a table with her laptop open. She's glaring at
text: that cursor blinking on that blank document.
text: Bella approaches with a huge bowl of pasta topped with
text: steaming meatballs in a tomato sauce.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I didn't order...
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: My mother's meatballs, they're
dialog: legendary. Just a little thank you
dialog: for your help last night.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: "Little"?
text: Victor approaches carrying the Verona guide book, smiling.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Supplier meetings are officially
dialog: done. I am all yours as promised.
dialog: (he kisses her)
dialog: You want to check out that Museo...
dialog: whatever it's called?
dialog: 21.
text: Sophia turns to Bella.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Victor, this is Bella, she's one of
dialog: The Secretaries I told you about.
text: Bella smiles at Victor but he's not looking at her just now.
text: He's caught a scent.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What's that smell?
text: He looks at the plate in front of her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Victor?
text: He picks up her plate and sticks his nose very close to it
text: and inhales deeply. He's staggered by the aroma.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: My God.
text: He grabs her fork and tastes. He groans with pleasure.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: You like?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: D'you know what's in this?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Oregano, garlic, parsley, bread...
text: He shakes his head "no" then pauses for effect.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: History. Years and years,
dialog: generations and generations, of
dialog: history. Who made this?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Her mother.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I have to meet her.
text: Victor goes without waiting for Bella who looks at Sophia
text: curiously then follows him. Sophia is alone at the table.
text: She looks at the meatballs suspiciously then tastes one.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That's a good meatball.
dialog: 22.
scene_heading: EXT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- PATIO -- EVENING
text: Sophia's plate is long since empty. She looks at it and then
text: at her watch. She gets up and heads back towards the...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. WHERE:
text: She finds Victor in chef's whites cooking with Angelina. He
text: looks up at Sophia as she walks in.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Have you met Angelina?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: She's a genius.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: She is.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: He's such a charmer.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Isn't he just?
dialog: (holds up the guide book)
dialog: So? You about ready to go?
text: He hesitates. Victor treads lightly around the following:
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yeah, sure, here's the thing
dialog: though, Angelina's offered to let
dialog: me work a dinner service with her
dialog: tonight. She's gonna teach me to
dialog: make that marinara. Can you imagine
dialog: that marinara in Manhattan?
text: Sophia is clearly annoyed.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And what am I supposed to do?
text: Bella steps forward.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: You could always help us.
text: Victor jumps all over this suggestion.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Great idea. That is a great idea.
dialog: You write. I'll cook. Win-win.
text: Sophia just looks at him, thinks about arguing, then doesn't.
scene_heading: EXT. COURTYARD CASA DI GIULIETTA -- LATER
text: Sophia and Bella gather up the day's letters in silence.
text: Sophia is clearly still miffed about Victor bailing on her.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Your Victor is very... passionate.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: About food. My Victor is very
dialog: passionate about food.
text: This revelation unsettles Bella she looks like she wants to
text: say something more but stops herself.
text: They finish collecting and are headed out when Sophia notices
text: a letter they missed stuck on a remote corner of the wall.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Forgot one.
text: Sophia jogs back to get it when she pulls it from the ancient
text: wall, a large piece of mortar falls at her feet. She looks
text: back at Bella as if to "sorry." Bella shrugs it off.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: It happens.
text: Sophia picks up the piece of mortar and tries to slide it
text: back in place when something catches her eye hidden deep
text: within the newly made crack in the wall. It looks like paper.
text: Sophia slides her fingers into the crack. She manages to grab
text: the paper and pull it out. She stares in amazement.
text: CLOSE ON: An envelope. It's old and stained. The writing is
text: quaintly old fashioned in that spidery kind of way.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA O/S - PRELAP
dialog: Look at the date...
scene_heading: INT. SECRETARIES OF JULIET OFFICE -- LATER
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: 1951! My God.
dialog: 24.
text: The Secretaries are gathered around Sophia who is holding an
text: old handwritten letter.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: What does it say?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: "I didn't go to him, Juliet. I
dialog: didn't go to Alfonso. I was on
dialog: holiday with my parents; he was a
dialog: local boy, he picked grapes at a
dialog: vineyard. It was his eyes. I still
dialog: remember the first time those eyes
dialog: found me. My parents would never
dialog: approve so we made plans to run
dialog: away. We were supposed to meet at
dialog: that vineyard but when the time
dialog: came, I couldn't bring myself to
dialog: go. My parents and I returned to
dialog: London the next morning. I'm so
dialog: afraid. I fear the only thing
dialog: worse than not being with him would
dialog: be knowing he doesn't want to be
dialog: with me. Please, tell me what to
dialog: do. With love, Claire Smith."
text: Silence. Sophia just stares at the letter, affected.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: I think she came back. She flew in
text: the face of her parents and her
dialog: friends to find her one true love.
dialog: And she made sweet love to her
dialog: Alfonso for the rest of her life.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: I think she found him. They had ten
dialog: children. Then he got old and bald
dialog: and fat and she wonders every day
dialog: what happened to that gorgeous
dialog: Romeo she left her family for.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: I think she stayed in England where
dialog: she married a Duke and lived
dialog: happily ever after in his castle...
speaker_heading: DONATELLA
dialog: And I'll bet when she's making love
dialog: to that Duke she's imagining her
dialog: first love. I do that all the time.
text: Everyone laughs except Sophia who's still holding the letter.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'd like to write back.
text: The women all stop laughing and look at her.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Why? She's probably moved.
speaker_heading: DONATELLA
dialog: Or died.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Probably moved and died.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Probably. But she wanted an answer.
text: Bella smiles at this she gives Sophia a pen and paper.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: So give her one.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SHOTS OF: The Secretaries quietly going about reading and
text: replying to that day's batch of letters efficiently.
text: They write dozens of different letters throughout the night.
dialog: But Sophia works only on that one letter to Claire Smith. She
text: chooses each word carefully.
scene_heading: INT. SECRETARIES OF JULIET OFFICE -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The Secretaries have left for the evening. Only Bella and
text: Sophia remain. Bella looks over her shoulder at Sophia's
dialog: letter - it's rather long at this point.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Let's hope if she gets it she has
text: some time on her hands.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Too long?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: No...
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: -..-not for a novella.
text: Bella puts on her coat and heads out the door.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Lock the door and turn off the
dialog: lights when you're done, OK.
scene_heading: INT. SECRETARIES OF JULIET OFFICE -- EVEN LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Sophia has finally finished the letter. She's addresses the
text: envelope and puts on a stamp. She stretches, yawns. There's a
text: knock at the door. Sophia turns to find Victor coming in with
text: a plate of anti pasti. She smiles. He smiles back.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hey you.
text: He sets down the plate of food and kisses her.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You have fun playing secretary?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I did actually. I forgot what it
dialog: was like to just write. It was
dialog: nice.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm glad.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: How'd it go with Angelina?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It was unreal. I thought I was good
dialog: but she's outta my league. She
dialog: cooks from feel. No measurements,
dialog: no timers, no prep, everything's
dialog: fresh, she's incredible. I could
dialog: learn a lot from her in a week...
text: Silence as he lets that last sentence just hang there. Sophia
text: realizes what he's asking, why he brought her the anti pasti.
text: She stops eating it and just looks at him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You promised this trip wouldn't
dialog: just be about the restaurant?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I know. I know I did. But this is a
dialog: chance to learn sixty years of
dialog: culinary knowledge in a week. It's
dialog: a once-in-a-life time opportunity
dialog: for me - for us...
dialog: 27.
text: Sophia sighs.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: But I haven't said yes yet. And I
dialog: did promise you. So? If you say
dialog: don't do it, I won't do it.
text: Sophia knows she can't tell him not to.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Is that OK like it's really not OK?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It's just OK.
text: That's good enough. He kisses her. She tries to smile.
text: He puts his arm around her as they walk to the door. Sophia
text: turns the light off and drops her letter in the out box.
scene_heading: I/E. VERONA. VARIOUS OF:
text: Sophia exploring the streets of Verona.
text: She walks across the Roman Ponte Pietro to look at the river.
text: She shops in a street market in the centre of the city.
text: She tours the Verona Arena and the Museo Castelvecchio.
text: She eats dinner with Victor and Angelina. Victor is chatting
text: up Angelina about the food. Sophia sits quietly sipping wine.
text: She walks down the chic Via Mazzini casually window-browsing
text: all the boutiques. She has a few carrier bags in her hands.
scene_heading: INT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- KITCHEN -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Victor enjoys himself in the kitchen amongst all the noise
text: and chaos. He's chopping, stirring, tasting, the guy sweats
text: enthusiasm. He tastes a bowl of meatballs and marinara, nods
text: his satisfaction, then refuses to let the WAITER take them
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: No, no. I'll do it.
text: Victor picks up the bowl, makes the sign of the cross, then
text: should barges his way out into the restaurant where...
dialog: 28.
text: The Secretaries of Juliet are sitting at a long table with
text: Angelina, drinking wine and laughing loudly.
text: Victor proudly places the bowl of meatballs in the middle of
text: the table and then declares in his best flawed Italian:
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Ladies, I give you my balls.
text: There is a pause before the women burst out laughing.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Please, help yourselves.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: If were thirty years younger I
dialog: would.
text: The women laugh again and start serving them out.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
text: Attempting Angelina's meatballs...
dialog: either very brave or very stupid.
text: They all taste them, adjudicating as they chew. For Victor
text: this is sheer agony. All eyes are on Angelina. It seems like
text: an eternity before she starts to slowly nod her head
text: approvingly. The others follow suit and start clapping.
text: Victor is so overcome that he sweeps Angelina into his arms
text: and kisses the old woman passionately on the lips. Everyone
text: cheers. Angelina is quite flustered and flushed by the kiss.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I remember when he used to have
dialog: that effect on me.
text: Bella laughs and stands up tapping her wine glass.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: To our new friends. Who leave us
dialog: tomorrow as they continue onto
dialog: Palermo but will remain in our
dialog: hearts. To Victor and Sophia.
text: Everyone raises their glass.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: To Victor and Sophia!
text: They clink and drink. Victor takes in the moment. He smiles
text: at Sophia like someone trying to keep a secret who can't.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sophia?
text: She turns to see him smiling big at her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I want you to be my front of house.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Your what?
text: Victor theatrically drops to one knee - playing to the crowd.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: (takes her hand)
dialog: Will you be my front of house?
text: A beat of confusion.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Is that like code or a metaphor or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I want you to run the restaurant.
text: She just stares at him - flabbergasted. He stands up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What about my job?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You hate your job.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But I love writing. I still want to
dialog: write. You know that.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You always talk about taking a step
dialog: forward, making a change, this is a
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I was thinking more like a change
dialog: to The New Yorker not Zagats.
text: Silence. This isn't going how Victor has envisioned.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I want us to do this together. It
dialog: won't be the same without you.
text: Sophia doesn't know what to say or where to look. She just
text: stares at him speechless. Before she can answer a subtly
text: handsome Englishman enters the restaurant. He is CHARLIE.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt,
dialog: but are you the Secretaries of
dialog: Juliet?
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: You found them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Great. So which one of you wrote
dialog: this letter to my grandmother,
dialog: Claire Smith?
text: Sophia can't believe it. How fantastic! She steps forward.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I wrote it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It was a very thoughtful letter.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Now if you wouldn't mind telling me
dialog: what the hell you were thinking?
text: A deathly silence. This is not what she was expecting.
scene_heading: INT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER
text: Sophia and Charlie sit at table removed from the others.
text: Victor is visible in the background serving The Secretaries.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: She deserved an answer.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fifty seven years ago maybe. Not
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because she was a fifteen-year-old
dialog: girl then. She's a seventy-two-year-—
dialog: old woman now.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I can do math. Math is not a reason
dialog: not to write a letter.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It was a teenage infatuation, a
dialog: holiday romance, can you imagine
dialog: what could've happened if she
dialog: hadn't seen sense?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well you wouldn't be here, I mean
dialog: at all. Which I'd have to say would
dialog: be an upside.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What good did you think could
dialog: possibly come from writing her that
dialog: letter?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What harm could come from it?
text: Pause as they eye each other up.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So that's it? You came all the way
dialog: from England to give me a lecture,
dialog: I'm impressed. Or did you just
dialog: happen to be in town?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, I came because I couldn't let
dialog: my grandmother come on her own.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Claire's here? Why?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I think even you might be able to
dialog: work that one out.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh my God, she's come to find her
dialog: Alfonso, that's awesome, I want to
dialog: meet her.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I want to play for Manchester
dialog: United but I'm shit at football.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You honestly don't think she'd want
dialog: to meet me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I honestly think she has no
dialog: interest in meeting a woman who can
dialog: Manage to jam "oh my God" and
dialog: "awesome" into the same sentence.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Did you ask her?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It just wouldn't occur to her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Where are you staying?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: D'you really think I'm that stupid?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I haven't decided yet.
text: A beat. Charlie gets up from the table.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why did you come here tonight?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I was just curious to see what kind
dialog: of imbecile would think writing
dialog: that letter was such a great idea.
dialog: I should've known it'd be an
dialog: American. Good night.
text: He strides out of the restaurant. Sophia is appalled at his
text: rudeness and is stuck to her chair for a moment.
text: She looks across the room at Victor serving The Secretaries
text: their entrees. They applaud his efforts. He's beaming.
text: Sophia thinks for a beat. Then grabs her coat and leaves.
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: EXT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER
text: Sophia emerges from the restaurant and looks around to see
text: which way Charlie has gone. She spots him and starts to
text: follow him at a discreet distance.
text: At one point he gets the feeling he's being followed and
text: stops. He quickly turns around just as Sophia ducks into a
dialog: shop doorway.
text: Finally he arrives at his hotel and heads inside. Sophia
text: waits for a moment before heading in herself.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL VERONA -- RECEPTION -- LATER
text: Sophia waits as the RECEPTIONIST looks something up on a
text: computer screen.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Claire Smith - room 32.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL VERONA -- CORRIDOR -- LATER
text: Sophia walks down the hallway to room 32. She's nervous as
text: she takes a deep breath and knocks on the door. She adjusts
text: her hair and straightens her dress. The door opens. And her
text: face drops as she is confronted by Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: What the bloody hell are you doing
dialog: here?
text: He moves out pulling the door semi-closed behind him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I think maybe even you can work
dialog: that one out.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I told you she doesn't want to meet
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You told me it wouldn't occur to
dialog: her to want to meet me.
text: A voice comes from inside the room.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE 0/S
dialog: Who is it Charlie?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (shouts)
dialog: My name is Sophia. I wrote the
dialog: letter.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE 0/S
dialog: Well for goodness sake come in.
text: Charlie looks daggers at her then reluctantly opens the door.
scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sophia walks into the room and there she is, CLAIRE SMITH, a
text: regal beauty at the age of seventy two. She gets up and for a
text: fleeting moment, bathed in a Veronese backlight, she almost
dialog: looks like the fifteen year old who sent that letter all
dialog: those years ago.
text: They take each other’s hand and don’t let go. They take a
text: long look at each other - so many questions on either side
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You look like I thought you'd look.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Since you wrote to a fifteen-year-
dialog: old I'll take that as a compliment.
text: Sophia smiles. Claire smiles. Charlie isn't smiling.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How did you find us?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Charlie found me, actually.
text: Claire turns to Charlie who shrugs as if to say "surprise".
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He told me you were here and said
dialog: you might like to meet me.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How uncharacteristically thoughtful
dialog: of you dear.
text: Slight pause. He looks at Sophia who smiles innocently.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, in the circumstances, it
dialog: seemed a little churlish not to
dialog: meet the person responsible for
dialog: this voyage of lunacy.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Charlie doesn’t approve. Which
dialog: makes it all the more fun. Would
dialog: you like some tea? Oh no, of
dialog: course, you’re American. We'll
dialog: order coffee. Charlie?
text: He obediently goes to the phone.
scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM -- LATER
text: They all sit having coffee while Claire talks.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I waited for a reply to that letter
dialog: for two years. Once I even plucked
dialog: up the courage to run away and find
dialog: him. But it only lasted as far as
dialog: Waterloo Station, I’m afraid.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So why is it you never mentioned
dialog: him to me till last week then?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It was such a long time ago, dear.
dialog: And I met your grandfather and over
dialog: the years I did my best to forget
dialog: that summer in Tuscany and the
text: bronzed Adonis of a boy who kissed
dialog: me for the first time. He was the
dialog: first person to ever tell me I was
dialog: beautiful. And boy did it sound
dialog: more romantic in Italian.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'll bet.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: “Clara, siete cosi bella.”
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But you and Gramps were happy
dialog: enough, weren’t you?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's exactly right - happy
dialog: enough. We were a “good couple”
dialog: with much to be grateful for.
dialog: Except for you Charlie, you’ve been
dialog: the bane of my existence.
text: Sophia smiles, intrigued by these two.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Then when Jack died - there’s a lot
dialog: of Jack in Charlie, funnily enough -
dialog: I grieved profoundly for years. But
dialog: as time went by his memory became a
text: distant, warm glow, instead of a
text: searing pain in my side. Then,
dialog: unexpectedly, at odd hours of the
dialog: day, in my dreams at night, I found
dialog: myself thinking about Alfonso...
dialog: which made it all the more
dialog: extraordinary when, out of the
dialog: blue, your letter arrived. I’m so
dialog: grateful you wrote it. There were
dialog: so many reasons not to.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'll say.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So what happens now?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well the thing is, I think we've
dialog: found him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Really? Where?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Just outside Verona. Quite close to
dialog: where he used to live, actually.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: No! That's incredible.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Charlie thinks it's a dreadful
dialog: mistake.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It'll be fine, really it will.
text: Sophia looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I’m so sorry. I have to go. I'm
dialog: flying down to Palermo with my
dialog: boyfriend for a few days before we
dialog: go home. He’s found some kind of
dialog: weird cheese down there.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (slightly disappointed)
dialog: Of course you are. Thank you so
dialog: much for the letter.
dialog: 37.
text: They hug. Sophia turns to Charlie who extends his hand
text: stiffly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's been a pleasure.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I guess your idea of pleasure and
dialog: mine are two very different things.
text: For a moment he seems charmed by her directness and honesty.
text: He smiles. Claire gives her a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: My phone number back in London.
dialog: Will you call me?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I will. I have to know how it ends.

speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I so hope it works out for her...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I mean imagine if they found each
dialog: other after fifty years...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: That'd be something.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Because I found a letter in a wall,
dialog: it's crazy, it's like no story
dialog: that's ever been told...
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Right.
text: Sophia pauses on this thought. Then the penny drops.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I have to write it.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You can start on the plane.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I have to stay.
text: Victor's listening now.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Wait. What?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I have to know out how it ends.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What about Palermo? The cheese?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You don't need me for cheese. You
dialog: can pick me up on your way back.
dialog: I'll write. You taste. Win win.
text: Sophia starts unpacking her suitcase. Victor stammers.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Can't we at least discuss this?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I started it. I have to finish it.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: But? Who are these people? You're
dialog: just gonna go off with them? They
dialog: could be serial killers...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Killers who oh-so-cleverly planted
dialog: a half century old love letter ina
dialog: wall for me to find. How devious.
dialog: 39.
text: She smiles, keeps unpacking. Victor just stands there racking
text: his brain for a reason she has to come with him.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: But? Who's gonna take the pictures?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL VERONA -- LOBBY -- LATER
text: Sophia is walking through Claire's hotel on her cell phone.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I already have the title: "Does
dialog: True Love Have a Shelf Life?"
text: INTERCUT: Bobby in his office on the phone with Sophia. He's
text: eating Chinese food as he scrolls through and answers e-mail.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You can't actually think she'll
dialog: find this guy? A hundred bucks says
dialog: he's dead, married or gay.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But what if he's not? What if she
dialog: does? What if that spark is still
dialog: there after fifty years?
text: He can't. He nods to himself. Takes a bite of an egg roll.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Could be something there.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So I should write it?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You can write it. Doesn't mean I'll
dialog: print it.
text: Sophia smiles - good enough for her.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL VERONA -- CORRIDOR -- LATER
text: Sophia is standing at Claire's door. Charlie opens it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh God.
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF VERONA -- DAY
text: Sophia, Claire and Charlie walk through the streets towards
text: Juliet’s house. Charlie casts a disbelieving glance at Sophia
dialog: - What is she doing here?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Alfonso had such a way with plants.
dialog: Working those fields was spiritual
dialog: for him. He'd always talk about the
dialog: land in Tuscany, the way it
dialog: smelled, the moisture in the soil,
dialog: perfect for the grapes he’d grow
dialog: there one day. He used to say all
dialog: he needed to be happy were days in
dialog: those fields and nights with me.
text: Sophia smiles at this.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: When he was working I’d pray for
dialog: the sun to come out because then
dialog: he'd have to take off his shirt.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nana!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He was so solid and brown. The
text: sweat would glisten off his back
dialog: like little jewels. The thought of
dialog: it still sends shivers down my
dialog: spine.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Alright, I think we get the
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: What, you don't approve of your old
dialog: Gran having carnal thoughts?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh for heaven's sake.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're such a prude. And you're
dialog: ageist.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I am not! I love old people.
dialog: 4l.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So long as they're not thinking
dialog: dirty thoughts.
text: Charlie bristles. Before he can think of a deft reply...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Here we are.
text: They walk into Juliet’s courtyard.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Gosh, I remember this so well. We
dialog: were on our way home. I was so sad.
dialog: Then I looked up at her an thought -
dialog: she'd know what to do. I'll ask
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Sorry it took her so long to get
dialog: back to you.
text: Claire smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No matter. I'm here now.
text: A familiar voice comes from behind them.
speaker_heading: BELLA 0/S
dialog: Is this her?
text: Sophia turns and finds Bella holding a basket of the day's
text: letters. Bella is looking at Claire.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Claire. This is Bella. She's one of
dialog: The Secretaries.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ah yes, another interfering
dialog: busybody. Perfect.
text: Neither Bella nor Claire pay him any mind. They smile.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: It's such a pleasure to meet you.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And such an honor to meet you.
text: Claire goes to shake her hand but Bella grabs her and hugs
text: her and kisses her on both cheeks.
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER
text: Claire is the guest of honor at the head of a table with
text: Charlie, Sophia and the rest of The Secretaries. They're
text: eating dinner. The Secretaries are all smiling at Claire.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Are you nervous?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: A bit I suppose. What if I’ve
dialog: turned him into something he isn’t?
dialog: He’s always existed in my mind’s
dialog: eye as a model of perfection. Like
dialog: a ‘57 Bentley Continental. What if
dialog: he’s actually a clapped out old
text: Alfa Romeo with bundles of nose
dialog: hair? What if he doesn’t remember
dialog: me at all - if I was simply not to
dialog: him what he was to me?
text: Slight pause as they all think about this. Charlie wades in.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. Let’s go home then before it
text: all ends in tears.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What is it with you? It's like you
dialog: really don't want this to work out.
text: Charlie is aghast at such a suggestion - a little too aghast.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm a realist not a fantasist,
dialog: that's the point.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: No it's not. The point is you're
dialog: English.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No romance.
speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Lots of cynicism.
speaker_heading: DONATELLA
dialog: Cold as fish.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don't have to be a cold fish to
dialog: think the idea of true love lasting
dialog: forever is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: Actually, come to that, the very
dialog: idea of true love at all leaves one
dialog: struggling.
speaker_heading: BELLA
dialog: Well in that case we take it all
dialog: back.
text: Everyone laughs except Charlie. Claire smiles softly at him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Charlie why don’t you get yourself
text: out of the line of fire and settle
dialog: the bill?
text: He motions for the waiter to bring the bill. As soon as she
text: sees this Angelina comes striding across the restaurant.
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: No charge.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm sorry we couldn't possibly...
speaker_heading: ANGELINA
dialog: I'm sorry, you can possibly.
text: He looks at her - realizes this isn’t someone you mess with.
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF VERONA -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The Secretaries are walking with Claire, laughing and
text: chatting. Charlie and Sophia follow at a short distance.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know, I’m not the buttoned up,
dialog: buttock clenching, killjoy you lot
dialog: are trying to make me out to be.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Right. We made you argue that true
dialog: love is ridiculous. Thanks for
dialog: clearing that up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's just that I am genuinely
text: worried for her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: She'll be fine.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Physically yes. But what if he
dialog: breaks her heart? What if he laughs
dialog: in her face? What if he doesn’t
dialog: remember her? Is it so unreasonable
dialog: for me to worry about that?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: My gut says that'll never happen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Then you really do have greater
dialog: faith in mankind than I do.
text: They walk on watching the women walking ahead. Sophia smiles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You really think it's possible two
dialog: people can be apart for so long and
dialog: pick up right where they left off?
text: Sophia reflects on the question.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I don't know. I hope it is.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: To find out, I guess.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Plus I think I've got a bit of a
dialog: crush on your grandmother.
text: He looks at her slightly disturbed.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL VERONA -- SOPHIA'S ROOM -- NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sophia sits at a desk with her laptop open. She starts to
text: type. Stops for a moment. She closes the laptop. Something
dialog: doesn't feel right.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL VERONA -- NEXT MORNING
text: Sophia, Claire and Charlie are loading up the rental car.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Before we go anywhere I need to be
dialog: straight with you both. My being
dialog: here is not entirely selfless. It
dialog: started as that.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (cont'd)
dialog: And I do want to help. But I’d also
dialog: like to write an article about what
dialog: happens. I want to tell your story,
dialog: Claire.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A bloody journalist! I should've
dialog: known.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hardly. I'm a fact checker. I've
dialog: never had a word published.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And you think Gran's story is your
dialog: ticket to being published. Yeah?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I think her story is a story worth
dialog: telling.
text: Claire smiles her approval.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Well I think that’s simply
dialog: marvellous. We both get something
dialog: out of it. It’s a what d’you call
dialog: it? A win win.
text: Sophia smiles appreciatively.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m so pleased for you both but
dialog: where, exactly, do I fit in?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Don’t worry, dear. Every story
dialog: needs a comedy character.
text: She gets into the car. Sophia smiles at Charlie.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: This is going to write itself.
text: Something starts buzzing in her bag. She fishes around in it
text: and brings out her cell phone. She grimaces.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I missed Victor. I had it on silent
text: all night. He's probably frantic.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I would be. I’d have probably
dialog: killed myself by now - in a most
text: violent manner leaving a poignant
dialog: note which would haunt you forever.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE 0/S
dialog: (from inside the car)
dialog: Charlie!
text: Sophia can't help but smile at Charlie as she dials Victor.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I hope he's not too worried.
scene_heading: INT. AN ORGANIC DAIRY FARM IN PALERMO. WHERE:
dialog: 
text: Victor's looking anything but worried as he's enthralled with
text: an assortment of samples of a stocky CHEESE MAKER'S finest
text: Italian cheeses. He's a kid in a candy store. He tastes some
text: fresh made pecorino romano. It leaves him speechless.
text: His Black berry - set on silent - is flashing on his belt
text: buckle. CLOSE ON: The Display. The ID reads: "Sophia"
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: Sophia putting her phone away and getting in the car with
dialog: Charlie and Claire.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Was he frantic?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I couldn't get him. He's probably
text: out in the country out of range.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Or he's working on that note.
text: Claire smacks Charlie on the top of his head. Sophia laughs.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: How about you? Is there some lucky
dialog: girl who makes you frantic?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: There is one - was one - until
dialog: recently, Patricia. But the less
dialog: said about her the better... so
dialog: currently, no, I am without
dialog: “frantic” in my life and the sense
text: of relief is palpable.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: For everyone I'm sure.
speaker_heading: I/E. CAR (DRIVING) -- LATER
text: They travel towards Arezzo, Charlie driving, Claire beside
text: him and Sophia in the back leaning forward between the seats.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Victor used to work at this little
dialog: Italian place in The City. I'd go
dialog: there to work every week. I'd get a
dialog: double espresso and a water - no
dialog: ice. And he'd come by my table,
dialog: tell jokes, make small talk. Then
dialog: one week he bought my espresso, a
dialog: week later he bought me lunch, then
dialog: dinner, a week after that he cooked
dialog: me dinner at his place, and three
dialog: months later I moved in with him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How romantic.
dialog: With a longing that tells us this was as romantic as it got:
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah... it was...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So you live with a waiter then.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Charlie you're such a snob.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I am not. He might have been a bus
dialog: boy.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He's a chef actually. A talented
dialog: one. He's opening his own place...
dialog: (slight pause)
dialog: It's gonna be great, I know it. He
dialog: won't let it be anything else.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sounds like quite a catch. Your
dialog: mother must be pleased.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'm sure she would be.
dialog: 48.
text: Claire looks worried she's made a dreadful assumption.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh dear. Has she passed on then?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Moved on is more accurate. She left
dialog: when I was little.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (shrugging it off)
dialog: Don't be. I'm not.
text: Charlie looks at her in the rear view mirror as she stares
text: out of the window and sees that nothing could be further from
text: the truth as she displays a rare moment of vulnerability.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE, OUTSIDE VERONA -- LATER
text: The car stops at a narrow country road in front of an old
text: farmhouse surrounded by meadows and olive groves.
text: Claire, Sophia, and Charlie look at the old house through the
text: car window. Claire doesn’t move. Sophia takes her hand and
text: gives it a squeeze. Claire smiles then gets out of the car.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR -- LATER
text: The trio approaches the door. Charlie glances at Claire. She
text: nods yes. Charlie reluctantly knocks on the door. They wait a
text: moment. Nothing. He shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No one in. Come on. Let's go.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Charlie?!
text: He takes Claire’s hand and starts for the car. Then the door
text: opens. They stop and turn as ALFONSO appears at the door...
text: he’s 73, dark and ruggedly handsome. Sophia and Charlie gape.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (in fluent Italian)
dialog: Are you Alfonso De Annunzio?
text: The man nods. Charlie and Sophia exchange a glance - we've
dialog: found him! - but alas Claire knows immediately that:
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That's not him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's not him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But he looks...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's the eyes.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Do you remember what you were doing
dialog: in the summer of 1951?
speaker_heading: ALFONSO
dialog: (smiles wistfully)
dialog: Ah, the summer of 1951, I'll never
dialog: forget it, I met the most beautiful
text: girl with long, brown hair...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nana!
text: But Claire has already turned away, disappointed, and is
text: walking towards the car.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: They're not his eyes. It's not him.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO
dialog: We married that year ... and she
dialog: gave me nothing but trouble from
dialog: that day on! I curse that woman!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right...
text: He and Sophia follow Claire to the car as Alfonso continues
text: raving from his doorstep.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO
dialog: I curse her eyes! I curse her
dialog: teeth! I curse her mustache!
text: They get into the car. A beat of silence.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right, well that's that. We gave it
dialog: a fair shot. Can't say we didn't
dialog: try. Sorry Nana. Truly.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you for real?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If I actually knew what that
dialog: question meant, I might attempt to
dialog: answer it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He can’t be the only Alfonso De
dialog: Annunzio in Tuscany.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He's the only one around here. Are
dialog: you suggesting we knock on the
dialog: doors of every Alfonso we can find?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you suggesting we don't?
text: Charlie looks at Claire. It's obvious she wants to keep
text: looking. Charlie sighs as if to say "Fine".
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is madness. Total madness.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: How many can there be?
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL SWIMMING POOL -- THE NEXT DAY
text: Claire is lying on a sun bed in the shade. Charlie swims
text: relentlessly up and down the pool - quite clearly for
text: exercise rather than pleasure. Sophia sits at a nearby table
text: working away at her laptop. She finishes typing.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Thirty six.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That many?
text: Claire sighs. Sophia has an idea.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I might be able to find some
dialog: pictures online. Give me a minute.
dialog: 51.
text: At this point Charlie hauls himself out of the pool. He has a
text: surprisingly well toned body. This guy obviously works out.
text: Sophia can’t help but notice.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (quietly to herself)
dialog: Whoa.
text: She sees Claire smiling at her. She blushes.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Did I just say that out loud?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I believe “ripped” is the
dialog: appropriate modern term isn’t it?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Ok, here we go, I've found photos
dialog: of two of them.
text: Claire takes a look and sighs.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. Sorry.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So that leaves us with thirty four.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: Thirty four what?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
text: Contestants for Italian Idol.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Fantastic!
text: He walks away drying himself off.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Is he really unhappy about this or
dialog: just pretending?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: A bit of both I think.
text: Claire watches Sophia working on her laptop as if weighing up
text: whether she’s going to ask her what’s on her mind.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Tell me about your mother.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Nothing to tell.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Indulge a nosy old lady.
text: Slight beat. Sophia looks at this woman with such kind eyes
text: and sees someone who genuinely wants to know.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: There’s nothing much to say really.
dialog: I was young. I don't remember much.
dialog: Then one day she just upped and
dialog: left. Just like that. No warning,
dialog: no note, no forwarding address, not
dialog: even a goodbye or good luck.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How old were you?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I was ten.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And you haven't seen her since?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Don't expect I ever will.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: That must've been very hard.
text: Sophia shrugs as if to say "not really".
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I started packing my own lunches,
dialog: probably ironed a few more of my
dialog: dad's shirts than I would have.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You don't ever think about trying
dialog: to find her?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I used to. Until I realized that
dialog: she didn’t feel like she could
dialog: waste her time on me so why should
dialog: I waste a minute of mine on her?
text: Sophia looks down in an attempt to control her feelings.
text: Claire takes her hand and gives it a squeeze.
dialog: 53.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT -- NIGHT
text: The three of them are having dinner.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Charlie have you told Sophia about
dialog: the Green Alliance?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Can't imagine she'd care.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Try me.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Charlie’s going to stand for
dialog: parliament on the environment
dialog: ticket.
text: Sophia looks genuinely surprised.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You know the kind of thing -
dialog: planting trees, air fare taxes,
dialog: bicycle lanes, eliminating cars
dialog: from Central London - great idea,
dialog: pity it doesn’t stand a chance,
dialog: really.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That's amazing.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You look surprised.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I guess I am. I didn't have you
dialog: pinned as a "Save the planet" type.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And what type did you have me
dialog: pinned down for, exactly?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I don't know. I was leaning towards
dialog: the "elitist Oxford prig" type but
dialog: now that you mention it "self-
dialog: satisfied do gooder" fits too.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well thank you very much.
text: Sophia laughs. So does Charlie. Claire smiles at this.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh don’t be fooled by all the
dialog: posturing he’s just a little teddy
dialog: bear really.
text: She ruffles up his hair.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Get off!
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He’s still trying to work out our
dialog: carbon print for this little jaunt.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Anther good reason not to have
dialog: come.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He’ll have me planting trees for
dialog: months.
dialog: (she yawns)
dialog: Well I'm off to my bed. You two be
dialog: nice to each other now.
text: She kisses them both on the head and leaves.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: She's incredible.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah she's alright.
text: But with her gone it seems they have nothing to talk about.
text: So they just sit there in silence. A pantomime of
text: embarrassment. An exchange of awkward smiles. Then finally.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. Well. Time to hit the sack.
text: Sophia smiles she knows he's just trying to get out of this.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
text: It must be at least nine thirty.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Long day tomorrow. Need my rest and
dialog: all that.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh of course.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. Alright. Good night then.
dialog: 55.
text: He gets up and strides off leaving her at the table. Then he
text: stops in the entrance. His back is turned to her for a moment
text: then he swivels round and marches straight back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Forgive me. Where are my manners?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I have absolutely no idea.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t know what it is, but you
dialog: seem to bring out the very worst in
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I figured it’d be my fault somehow.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Please, may I buy you a night cap?
text: A beat. She smiles politely.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: No thanks. I'm tired.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. Of course. Apologies.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Accepted.
text: He stands there for a minute, unsure what to do.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well. Good night then. Again.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Good night Charlie.
scene_heading: INT. CAR (DRIVING) -- THE NEXT MORNING
text: A beautiful day in the Tuscan countryside. They drive along
text: with Puccini’s “La Boheme” blaring from the stereo. Charlie
text: is driving. He looks at Sophia curiously in the rear view
text: mirror. Claire notices this and smiles to herself.
text: La Boheme continues over the next few scenes.
dialog: 56.
scene_heading: EXT. ITALIAN VILLAGE -- LATER
text: Sophia and Charlie are talking to an OLD MAN wearing a flat
text: cap a baggy black suit, which has seen better days, and a
text: threadbare white shirt. He's sitting outside at a cafe with
text: another MAN playing chess. Claire is standing at a distance
dialog: watching.
text: Sophia turns round to look at her and Claire shakes her head.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE -- WATER SKI AND WIND SURFING SCHOOL -- LATER
text: A speedboat hurtles, arcing, towards the shore. The WATER
text: SKIER behind it lets go and after a few feet sinks into the
text: water near the jetty.
text: Claire, Sophia and Charlie walk towards the jetty as the
text: speedboat approaches. THE INSTRUCTOR jumps out, he is a
text: bronzed seventy-three-year-old man with an enormous pot
text: belly, covered in gold jewelry and masses of white body hair.
text: Beneath his stomach he is wearing the tiniest, most obscene,
dialog: inappropriate thong you’ve ever seen. When he turns to
text: someone and flashes his weary, pitted, buttocks their way.
text: Claire utters a little shriek. Sophia tries to suppress a
text: grin but Charlie is beside himself with laughter.
text: Sophia hits him playfully. The man waves as they approach but
text: from Claire’s horrified look it obviously isn’t him.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- LATER
text: They are with a sweet looking PRIEST, dressed in cassock and
text: hat, outside his church. He is holding both of Claire’s hands
text: as he shakes his head gently. He is not her Alfonso. Then he
text: makes the sign of the cross over Claire as a blessing.
scene_heading: EXT. PALAZZO -- LATER
text: They drive a tree-lined street to a gorgeous stately Palazzo.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You sure we've got the right
dialog: address?
text: Sophia double checks.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: This is the place.
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: EXT. PALAZZO -- FORMAL GARDENS -- LATER
text: They are talking to a very handsome, beautifully dressed and
text: groomed Italian man. This guy is probably a COUNT. He shakes
text: his head. Claire smiles.
speaker_heading: COUNT
dialog: Alas it wasn’t me. If it had been
dialog: I'd’ve never let you go.
text: And with that he kisses her hand.
scene_heading: EXT. PALAZZO -- DRIVEWAY -- LATER
text: They walk towards the car. Claire is still slightly flushed.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What is it with you and Italian
dialog: men? They just fall at your feet.
text: Charlie takes one last look at the Palazzo. He sighs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Such a shame. I think I could’ve
dialog: been happy here.
text: Sophia and Claire exchange looks.
scene_heading: INT. OLD FOLKS HOME, SIENA -- LATER
text: Sophia, Claire, and Charlie wait patiently and quietly in a
text: waiting room. Sophia is trying to stay upbeat but the sight
dialog: of so many ill and lonely OLD PEOPLE has definitely lowered
dialog: the mood of all three.
text: A NURSE comes to them holding the arm of yet another ALFONSO,
text: a sweet man, bald, wearing sunglasses, with a bright smile.
text: He walks right up to Claire.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO
dialog: Your face... it is so familiar...
text: Sophia and Charlie exchange a hopeful glance.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Alfonso, this is Claire, do you
dialog: remember Claire?
speaker_heading: ALFONSO
dialog: Claire! Of course. Of course.
dialog: 58.
text: Alfonso takes off his sunglasses to get a better look at her.
text: Sophia and Charlie instantly look at Claire. It’s not him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Shit...
text: He's confused her for someone else. Claire plays along so as
text: not to hurt the sweet old man's feelings. She hugs him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It was good to see you, Alfonso.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO
dialog: You too, my angel. Thanks for
dialog: visiting! Come back soon!
text: He waves to them as they go - they made his day.
scene_heading: EXT. OLD FOLKS HOME -- PARKING LOT -- LATER
text: They walk to the car in silence.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That’s it for today I think.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: One more?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: She’s exhausted.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I am.
text: Sophia sighs.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM NEAR SIENA -- NIGHT
text: Sophia is on her cell in her room. Her notebook is open on
text: the desk next to her laptop. She’s clearly been working on
text: the story. The remains of her dinner are on a plate nearby.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I hope we’re doing the right thing.
dialog: She’s so full of hope one minute
text: then deflated the next. The ups and
dialog: downs are killing me, I can't
dialog: imagine what's it like for her...
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL RESTAURANT IN PALERMO. WHERE:
text: Victor has a Bluetooth ear piece in. He's paying close
text: attention to every detail about how the restaurant is running
text: and not paying any attention to what Sophia is saying. Thus:
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm glad you're having a good time.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Did you listen to a word I just
dialog: said?
speaker_heading: VICTOR 0O/S
dialog: I miss you beautiful.
text: Sophia rolls her eyes - he's so transparent.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Miss you too.
text: A WAITRESS brings Victor a plate of food. He smiles his
text: thanks and wafts the steam coming towards his nose.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: If you could see the plate of food
dialog: I’ve just had put in front of me...
text: Victor eagerly lays a napkin in his lap.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Hey. Can I call you back? I feel
dialog: like I should have all my senses
dialog: for this.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah. Sure. Enjoy.
text: Sophia hangs up. She sighs a sigh that says "Did my boyfriend
dialog: really just get off the phone to pay attention to a meal?"
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIA'S HOTEL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Sophia sits at the desk with her laptop open. She's looking
text: at that cursor blinking at the end of a full page of writing.
text: She smiles - pleased at this.
text: There's a knock at her door. She answers. It's Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: She's gone to bed - shattered, poor
dialog: thing.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Think she'll be OK?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, yeah, yeah she’1l be fine.
dialog: Tough as old boots that one. Don’t
text: be fooled by the frail old lady act
text: - she’s Churchill in a dress.
text: Sophia laughs. Charlie smiles. He clears his throat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You fancy a spot of dinner?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I already ate. I needed to get
dialog: started.
text: He sees the notebook and laptop.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How's it coming?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Slowly.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Am I in it?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Can I read some then?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh go on. Please.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: When it's finished. Maybe.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But how am I to be sure that I'm
dialog: being properly portrayed?
text: Sophia smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You're just going to have to trust
dialog: me.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Just a peek. A sentence or two.
text: He tries to look over her shoulder. She blocks his view.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You don't trust me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: You're an American.
text: Sophia can't help but laugh.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You're sure you won't let me read
dialog: just a bit to ease my mind?
text: Sophia shuts the door. From the other side of the door:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE 0/S
dialog: Is this one of those situations
dialog: where you're really saying the
dialog: opposite of what you actually mean?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It's not.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE 0/S
dialog: Right. Good night then.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Good night.
text: They each remain where they are on either side of the closed
text: door smiling and waiting for the other to move. Finally he
text: moves away and she leans back against the door, more than a
dialog: little charmed.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL NEAR SIENA -- LOBBY -- THE NEXT MORNING
text: Sophia is waiting in the lobby writing in her notebook.
text: Charlie comes down the stairs and over to her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Gran's not feeling well.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What is it? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Should we call a doctor?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Best just let her rest.
text: Sophia suddenly looks and feels very guilty.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I shouldn't have pushed her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It’s not your fault. Truth is she
dialog: made her decision the moment that
dialog: letter arrived. And neither I nor
dialog: the entire regiment of the
dialog: Household Guard would’ve been able
dialog: to stop her from coming.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But if I hadn't come back from the
dialog: airport...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you hadn’t come back from the
dialog: airport I would've been denied the
dialog: pleasure of spending a day in your
dialog: glorious company showing you the
text: sights of San Gimignano and Siena.
text: Sophia smiles - she feels better already.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You can actually be quite charming
dialog: when you put your mind to it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh, don't let it fool you.
scene_heading: INT. CAR (DRIVING) -- LATER
text: They drive together through the Chianti countryside.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So what's your story, Charlie?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Not worth telling really. Certainly
dialog: not worth writing about.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Can't I just be curious?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can be whatever you want.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Okay. So how does a guy your age
dialog: come to live with his grandmother?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She lives with me actually.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well that makes all the difference.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It does rather.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: How does the rest of the family fit
dialog: in? Mom, Dad, brothers and sisters?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm an only child.
text: Sophia laughs - of course he is.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why doesn't that surprise me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ...And my parents were killed ina
dialog: car crash when I was fourteen.
text: Sophia’s mouth is still open from laughing but she now seems
text: incapable of either shutting it or speaking. She just stares.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Hit head on by a tourist driving on
text: the wrong side of the road. An
dialog: American tourist.
text: He reaches over and gently pushes her jaw closed with the
text: tips of his fingers. A beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I've had ambiguous feelings towards
dialog: anything American every since.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Understandable.
text: Charlie smirks - trying to ease a maudlin moment:
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Could have something to do with my
dialog: cynicism and pessimism and general
dialog: lack of faith in true love lasting
dialog: forever. Not a great believer in
dialog: happy endings I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Oh God, Charlie... Jesus...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes, well, they weren’t much help
dialog: either. But Gran stepped in and
dialog: took this angry, bereft and
text: shockingly unpleasant young man
dialog: under her wing and made me, well,
dialog: into the superb specimen of screwed-
dialog: up manhood you see before you now.
text: He laughs. She doesn't. She puts her hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'm so sorry.
text: He looks at her hand on his arm and raises his eyebrows,
text: gently mocking her. She quickly takes her hand away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I owe everything to that woman. She
dialog: looked after me when no one else
dialog: would... when no one else could...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And now it's your turn.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. She...
text: Charlie's voice cracks with emotion. He smiles at her.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sorry. Momentary slip. Won't happen
dialog: again.
text: Sophia smiles at his English stiff upper lip then looks away
text: out of her window to spare him any embarrassment.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN GIMIGNANO -- DAY
dialog: WIDE SHOT: Of this beautiful town on a hill top with it’s
text: thirteen medieval towers standing proudly against the deep
text: blue Chianti sky.
dialog: 65.
text: Charlie and Sophia walk through the narrow lanes of the town.
scene_heading: EXT. SAN GIMIGNANO SQUARE -- DAY
text: They walk through the ancient square.
scene_heading: EXT. CHIANTI COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY
text: They drive through the countryside with the roof of the car
text: down. Sophia’s hair blows around her face so she can’t see.
text: She laughs as she tries to tie it up. Charlie smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. CATEDRALE DI SANTA MARIA THE “DUOMO”, SIENNA -- DAY
text: They stand outside the wonderful facade of the cathedral.
text: Charlie takes her picture. Then poses with her and holds the
text: camera out in front of him and takes another of them both.
scene_heading: INT. CATEDRALE DI SANTA MARIA THE “DUOMO” -- LATER
text: They walk through the interior.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MANGIA TOWER -- DAY
text: They walk to the three hundred foot tall Mangia Bell Tower.
scene_heading: INT. THE MANGIA TOWER COLLECTION -- LATER
text: They walk up four hundred steps to the top. It’s hard work
text: for Sophia who stops for breath. Charlie shouts encouragement
text: from the top. She laughs, exhausted, and follows.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MANGIA TOWER VIEWING PLATFORM -- LATER
text: They take in the extraordinary view high over ancient Sienna.
scene_heading: INT. PINACOTEA NAZIONALE - PALAZZO BUONSIGNOR -- DAY
text: They walk around the National Art Collection.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZO DEL CAMPO, SIENNA -- DAY
text: They walk across the world famous square past the Fonte Gala
text: (Fountain of Joy). Sophia looks like she’s really enjoyed
dialog: herself. It’s been the kind of day she never had with Victor.
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZO DEL CAMPO, SIENNA -- LATER
text: Sophia sits outside a cafe. Charlie appears from inside with
dialog: two of the largest ice cream cones you’ve ever seen.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Little indulgent don't you think?
text: He gives her a cone.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Ah but the thing is, they're
dialog: calorie free. Clever buggers the
dialog: Italians.
text: She looks at her cone suspiciously as he starts to eat his.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes way. Thousands of calories free
text: with every mouthful.
text: Sophia laughs - not at joke but at him for making the joke.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That was bad.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I thought it was funny. You've no
dialog: sense of humor.
text: She pushes his ice cream into his face. He takes it away to
text: reveal his nose and mouth covered. His stone faced
text: seriousness and slight look of hurt make her laugh.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That was funny.
text: He wipes his face with a napkin.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's just as well I’m a gentleman
dialog: otherwise I might be tempted into
text: some sort of juvenile revenge.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'm grateful believe me.
text: They sit eating their cones for a beat. She looks at him.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I had a great time today. It was
dialog: nice actually doing the tourist
dialog: thing with someone. Thanks.
text: He smiles. She studies him for a moment.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What's the real reason you're so
dialog: against Claire being here?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (smirks )
dialog: Every good story needs an
dialog: antagonist right?
dialog: She's not letting him off that easy.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: There's something else going on in
dialog: that head of yours. You jealous?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Of an old man I've never met. No.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So? What is it? Are you worried
dialog: you'll lose her?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Something like that.
text: They sit quietly eating for a beat. Charlie shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Okay...truthfully? It's just that I
dialog: feel, if we find Alfonso and Gran
text: discovers that leaving him all
dialog: those years ago was, indeed, the
dialog: biggest mistake of her life... then
dialog: what does it say about me and my
dialog: family? It makes it all a bit of a
dialog: sham doesn’t it? If they're meant
dialog: to be then were we not? It's like
dialog: we're second best.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But you know that's not true.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Maybe. But it feels true.
text: She looks at him as she tries to work this through. He leans
text: forward, noticing something on her face.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You've got something on your...
text: With that he pushes her ice cream into her nose. She screams.
text: There’s ice cream all over her face. He gets a napkin and
text: gently wipes it off. When he finishes he doesn’t move away.
text: Suddenly both their cell phones ring. They look at them.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE SOPHIA
dialog: Patricia. Victor.
text: Neither of them answer. Charlie looks at her - surprised.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You didn't answer. Very naughty.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Neither did you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: But I have a good excuse. She's a
text: tiresome, self-centered neurotic.
text: She's mad. Madder than a mad cow.
dialog: Your Victor on the other hand is a
text: dashingly handsome chef about to
dialog: become a New York culinary
dialog: sensation, sounds like everything
dialog: any girl could ever want.
text: Sophia smiles as she knows what Charlie's saying is true.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He is, I suppose...
text: Her smiles fades. She looks at him sincerely.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (almost to herself)
dialog: What if I'm not just any girl?
text: Charlie smile diplomatically - he's not gonna go there.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL NEAR SIENA -- DUSK
text: Charlie’s car pulls up. He and Sophia get out of the car.
text: They walk towards the hotel in silence. Until.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia...
text: She stops and turns. He suddenly looks a little nervous.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I just wanted to say... about
dialog: today... uh... what I mean is...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Me too.
text: She smiles then turns and walks away.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL NEAR SIENA -- LOBBY -- LATER
text: Charlie and Sophia walk back into the hotel past the bar and
text: then both stop. They walk back a few steps and look into it.
text: There sitting at the bar, large cocktail in hand, sits Claire
text: looking perfectly fit and well as she laughs with the BARMAN.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Right as rain dear. Thank you.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Good...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: So? How was your day? Did you two
dialog: get along alright without me?
text: She smiles sweetly as both of them realize in the same moment
text: what she’s been up to. They share a look and a smile.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY NEAR FLORENCE -- NEXT DAY
text: Claire, Sophia, and Charlie are escorted through a cemetery
text: by an old GRAVE DIGGER. They stop. The Grave Digger points at
text: a new tombstone and goes off silently. They stand together.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (silently; to herself)
dialog: God, no. Please, no.
text: They look at the grave from a distance. Claire slowly
text: approaches it as Charlie and Sophia hang back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This was what I feared most...
text: Charlie trails off and watches as Claire approaches the grave
text: - her back to us. She stops and kneels.
dialog: 70.
text: Sophia and Charlie stand there saying nothing. Claire stands
text: up and walks back to them. She Long pause.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Is it...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's not him. My Alfonso's middle
dialog: name was Paolo. It's not him.
text: Relief washes over Sophia. But not Charlie who still stands
text: there with concern etched all over his face.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: OK. So? We keep looking.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No.
text: They turn to him. And wait for him to say more but he just
text: stands there silently staring as if trying not make a scene.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Charlie, it's not over.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yes it is. It's over. I'm done.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (snaps )
dialog: Don’t you see what we're doing?
dialog: What we’re putting her through?
dialog: What if it had been him? What if
dialog: there’s another grave around here
dialog: with her Alfonso in it? I’m sorry,
dialog: Gran, I am. But this is the end of
dialog: the line for me. I can't do this.
text: Claire looks at her beloved grandson and can see the sincere
text: concern and pain on his face. She takes his hand. Sighs.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You're giving up? Just like that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: He's right dear. It's too much.
text: Sophia stares at Charlie. She's stone faced.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: This is what you wanted all along.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. What I wanted was for you to
dialog: never have written that letter.
dialog: What I wanted was to never come on
dialog: this ridiculous goose chase.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why are you so desperate for this
dialog: to fail?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm trying to protect her. Because
dialog: unlike you I can't just stand idly
text: by and watch her get hurt.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It means you're not here for her.
dialog: And you're not here 'cause you're
dialog: some romantic who wants to believe
dialog: in love lasting forever. You're
dialog: here for the story. Here to see how
dialog: it all ends. Doesn't matter to you
dialog: if it's a happy ending or a sad
dialog: ending as long as it's compelling
dialog: right? As long as there's drama.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Charlie. Please.
text: Sophia just stands there stunned, hurt.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You think that's true?
text: Charlie shrugs as if to say “isn't it?".
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm just looking out for her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You're not. You're not walking away
dialog: for her, you're walking for you.
text: They look at each other. Both fuming. Both pretty sure
dialog: they've crossed a line.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She’s dealt with enough grief in
dialog: her life. She's lost her husband,
text: her daughter, her son-in-law. Now
dialog: you come along and set her up to
dialog: lose someone she already lost fifty
dialog: years ago. But why should I expect
dialog: you to understand. You don't know
dialog: anything about real loss.
text: This cuts her. She just looks at him for a moment then walks
text: over to the car and gets in the back seat.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: You're wrong, Charlie. She lost her
dialog: mother. That was very wrong.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's different.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It is. Her mother chose to leave
dialog: her. You always knew your parents
dialog: loved you.
text: She walks back to the car leaving him to think for a moment.
scene_heading: INT. CAR (DRIVING) -- LATER
text: They ride in silence as the sun sets. A very unsmiley car.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL NEAR FLORENCE -- EVENING
text: Sophia sits at the dressing table brushing her hair. There's
text: a knock at the door. She thinks for a moment whether to
text: answer it. Another knock. She gets up and opens the door.
text: Claire is standing there.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Just wanted to make sure you were
dialog: alright.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Of course I am. Totally fine. Hey
dialog: we gave it our best shot didn’t we?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We did.
text: She sees the hairbrush in Sophia’s hand.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: May I?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (a little taken aback)
dialog: Sure...
text: She goes back to the dressing table and sits. Claire stands
text: behind her and starts to brush her hair.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: One of the great unsung luxuries in
dialog: this world - having someone brush
dialog: your hair.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Yeah I guess it is.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: My mother used to do it for me.
text: They continue in silence, then slowly tears begin to fall
text: down Sophia’s face. It’s clearly the first time anyone has
dialog: done this since for Sophia since she was a little girl.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT FIESOLE -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Claire, Sophia and Charlie look at their menus in silence.
text: Charlie steals glances at Sophia who just studies her menu.
text: He looks at Claire who raises her eyebrows interrogatively as
text: if to say “ball’s in your court.” He clears his throat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I should apologize. I was wrong.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You should or you are?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Didn't I just?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'm not sure that you did.
text: Claire intercedes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: An apology, dear, is when you look
text: at someone straight in the eye with
dialog: contrition and sincerity and
dialog: actually say the words “I’m sorry.”
dialog: 74.
text: He does his best under the scrutiny of his grandmother.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia, I'm sorry... enough
dialog: contrition and sincerity for you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Six out of ten.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What'd you want me to do, get on my
dialog: knees and beg?
text: Charlie starts to do just that. Sophia smiles. She stops him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Please don't. I'm sorry too.
text: Claire smiles as the tension eases. Charlie picks up a wine
dialog: list.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Excellent. Now that hostilities are
dialog: over. Let's get drunk.
text: Sophia laughs as the waiter comes over to Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A bottle of your best local Chianti
dialog: please.
text: The waiter goes off to fetch the wine.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: So, Sophia, what for you now?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Back to Verona, see Bella and the
dialog: girls, then fly home I guess.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: With the dashingly handsome Victor.
text: She seems slightly perplexed by his saying this and he looks
text: embarrassed like he just thought out loud. She smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
text: With the dashingly handsome Victor.
text: Somehow, though, the prospect doesn’t seem so alluring.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Despite what my emotionally stunted
dialog: pig of a grandson thinks, you did a
dialog: wonderful thing for an old lady...
dialog: I'll never forget it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Even though it led nowhere?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It’s been an adventure. There
dialog: aren’t many adventures left at my
dialog: age. And It didn't lead nowhere. I
dialog: got to meet you didn't I?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I guess. Though a new friend isn't
text: much consolation for an old love.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
text: Depends on the friend.
text: Sophia smiles.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Unfortunately you had to meet
dialog: Charlie, but then we can’t have
dialog: everything can we?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It wouldn’t have been quite the
dialog: same without him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Thank you?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: My pleasure.
text: He looks at her - not all sure what that means.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You have a knack of saying things
dialog: which could be taken as gorgeous
text: compliments or sarcastic digs.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It's taken years of practice.
text: The waiter arrives with the wine. He pours them a glass each.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: To Alfonso, wherever he may be.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE/SOPHIA
dialog: Alfonso...
text: They raise their glasses and drink.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Damn that’s good wine.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (looking at the bottle)
dialog: Isn’t it?
text: She smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: But then so it should be.
text: She turns the bottle round to them.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Look at the label.
text: Charlie picks it up and reads it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: “D’Annunzio”, How do I know that
dialog: name?
text: Sophia and Claire share a smile and a shake of the head.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I sometimes find it hard to believe
dialog: I’m actually related to you.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You don’t think...
text: As the penny drops, Charlie beckons the SOMMELIER.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Excuse me. The makers of this wine.
dialog: Are you familiar with them?
speaker_heading: SOMMELIER
dialog: I am. Yes.
dialog: Claire hardly dare ask.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: And is there an Alfonso Paolo
dialog: D’‘Annunzio?
speaker_heading: SOMMELIER
dialog: Signora, there are three.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIA'S HOTEL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Sophia is at her laptop typing. She looks out of the window
text: for a moment and sees Charlie wandering out of the hotel into
text: the garden. He looks up at the sky and then lies down on the
text: lawn, his arms spread-eagled. She smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL GARDEN -- LATER
text: Sophia comes out of the hotel and wanders over to him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You OK?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Just looking at the stars.
text: She lies down beside him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can see the Milky Way.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It's beautiful.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's awesome.
text: She laughs and hits him. Charlie is no longer looking at the
text: night sky.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You have a wonderful laugh.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You have a wonderful frown.
text: Slight pause. They both look away.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So what do you think will happen
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: If it’s him?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Oh it’s him alright.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: How d’you know?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because we've come too far, it'd
dialog: just be too unfair if it wasn’t.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Charlie? Am I hearing right? Is
dialog: that optimism I detect?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm capable of it on occasion.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Well whatever happens, something
dialog: tells me they’1l be great friends.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I hope so. She deserves it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And what about you? What’s in the
dialog: stars for you and Victor?
dialog: We can tell Sophia has been thinking about this.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Wish I knew.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Successful business? Marriage? Lots
dialog: of dashing children?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Successful business, marriage, lots
dialog: of kids, Victor becomes a celebrity
dialog: chef, travels the world cooking for
dialog: royalty while I stay at home
text: microwaving leftovers for the kids.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: And you think I'm cynical.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: When it comes to cynicism and love
dialog: we're not even in the same league.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sounds like we'd make quite a pair.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Shame I'm spoken for.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You don't strike me as the kind of
dialog: girl who'd let anyone speak for
dialog: her?
text: She smiles. He sits up. He's confused.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So what about all that romantic
dialog: true love codswallop you peddled
dialog: about Gran and Alfonso then?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I want them to prove me wrong.
dialog: That's all. I want to believe two
dialog: people can reconnect and it can all
dialog: be OK. I’m clinging to the wreckage
dialog: of “there’s always hope.”
text: Charlie looks at her. It suddenly makes sense to him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Because of your mom. Yeah?
text: She looks at him. Shrugs as if to say "probably".
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It's what a shrink would tell me.
text: They lie there in the grass in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You know all the things your
dialog: parents are supposed to give you -
dialog: safety, food, a roof over your head
dialog: - the one thing everyone takes for
dialog: granted is the most important...
dialog: unconditional love.
text: She smiles at him bravely. A tear falls down her cheek. He
text: leans over and wipes it away. She manages another smile.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Sorry. Momentary slip. Won’t happen
dialog: again.
text: He smiles at her humor. She looks at him. He looks at her.
text: There's a moment. Then suddenly he kisses her. And she kisses
text: back, hungrily, passionately. For a few seconds they're
text: unaware of anything but each other.
text: Then Sophia's head catches up to her heart. She pulls back.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Okay. Time out. Not good. I mean
dialog: too good. So really not good.
text: She gets up and heads back into the hotel. He stands up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia... wait... I...
text: She starts running and she’s gone. He pauses a moment then
text: walks into the hotel. As he does so we see Claire standing in
text: her bedroom window, smiling gently, having observed it all.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- THE NEXT MORNING
text: Claire is sitting in reception. She looks a little anxious.
text: Charlie comes down the stairs.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: She’s not in her room.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Have you checked the dining room?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: This is my fault.
text: He goes over to the desk.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Has Miss Marcus checked out?
text: He looks at the register.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Have you seen her at all this
dialog: morning?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I’m afraid not sir.
text: At this point Charlie sees her coming into the hotel. He is
text: hugely relieved.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (a little too brightly)
dialog: Morning!
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Everything alright? I thought...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Thought what?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Nothing. You OK?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?
text: Claire smiles - registering their awkwardness. Sophia turns
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you excited? I’m so excited.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD IN FIESOLE -- LATER
text: Bright and early. The car speeds along a dusty country road
text: along the perimeter of a vast vineyard.
text: They pass a sign that says “D’Annunzio Vineyards. 1961”.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY -- D'ANNUNZIO VILLA -- LATER
text: The car stops at a large farm house nestled in the midst of
text: the vineyard. The vines are bursting with young blue grapes.
text: As Claire steps out of the car, she looks around and sees
text: something in the distance that nearly stops her breathing.
text: A handsome YOUNG MAN, around 16, shirtless, solid and brown
text: from the sun, he works repairing an irrigation line. He
text: looks up and sees the three strangers in his driveway and
text: smiles a shy welcome.
text: Claire can’t believe her eyes.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: My God. That’s him. That’s Alfonso.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That can’t actually be him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: If it is then I'm writing a
dialog: completely different article.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are you Alfonso D'Annunzio?
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO III
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
text: At that moment, a middle-aged man comes round the corner. He
text: is ALFONSO D’ANNUNZIO, JR., Alfonso III’s father.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO III’S FATHER
dialog: Did someone call me?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Are you Alfonso D'Annunzio too?
text: Before he can answer a voice comes from inside the house.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO’S VOICE
dialog: I know that voice.
text: Suddenly a sweet old man, tanned from the sun, comes stepping
text: out of the house. He is DON ALFONSO PAOLO D’ANNUNZIO.
text: He looks at the three strangers - then focuses on Claire.
text: Without saying a word, Claire smiles, she knows this is him.
dialog: The young man from all those years ago. It’s the eyes.
text: As she walks toward him, he stares at her, disbelieving, as
text: years and years flicker through his memories.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: Claire?
text: She nods. The tears are already starting to form. And she's
text: not the only one as Sophia hastily wipes a tear away.
text: Claire and Alfonso stop opposite each other. They stare into
text: each other’s eyes, older certainly, yet indelibly etched in
text: each other's hearts. There's a long silence. Neither sure
text: what to say or do. Claire manages a coy little smile.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sorry I'm late.
text: Alfonso smiles. He opens his arms. She walks into them.
text: Claire and Don Alfonso embrace. Everyone watching, smiling.
text: Something prompts Sophia to look down. It’s Charlie’s hand
text: reaching out for hers. She takes it and looks up at Charlie.
text: He turns to her, his eyes looking suspiciously tearful. He’s
text: about to say something but can’t. She smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You’re welcome.
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: EXT. D'ANNUNZIO VILLA -- OPEN FIELD -- SUNSET
text: A space behind the D’Annunzio house filled with tables and
text: trees. The vineyard's all around. Don Alfonso’s big family is
text: out en masse to celebrate the reunion of their patriarch with
dialog: his childhood sweetheart.
scene_heading: Four generations: CHILDREN, GRANDCHILDREN, AND GREAT-
text: GRANDCHILDREN. Tables laden with food.
text: Claire and Don Alfonso sit together drinking and catching up
dialog: after the years of separation.
text: Sophia is surrounded by sprightly D’Annunzio grandchildren
text: who play a game with her. She stops and looks around as she
text: realizes someone is missing.
text: She goes off in search of Charlie.
text: She finds him alone by some trees staring at the horizon.
text: He's deep in thought. She takes a moment to just watch him.
text: She smiles then walks up slowly.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: He's a widower, just lost his wife
dialog: two years ago. And now Claire.
text: Here. On his doorstep after fifty
dialog: years... how does that happen?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You made it happen.
text: Sophia smiles. Charlie goes back to staring at the horizon.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Happy or sad? I can’t tell.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Bit of both actually. Happy for
text: them. A little sad it’s over.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Mission accomplished.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: If you like.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You have to admit it was kinda fun.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It was.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: About last night.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Don’t worry about it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Mistakes happen.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: A mistake. Yeah.
text: They look at each other, both not telling the truth, both
text: knowing it, neither has the courage to take the first step.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (ever so slightly fishing)
dialog: I mean there’s no need to apologize
dialog: if that’s what you're trying to do?
text: A beat as he decides which way to go.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. 'Cause that's what I was
dialog: trying to do. I was trying to
dialog: apologize.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But there’s no need.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Course not. Good.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sorted.
text: Another awkward silence. Sophia tries to fill the silence.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (overly flippant)
dialog: Bottle of chianti, an Italian night
dialog: sky, and some childhood trauma, I
dialog: could be anyone's.
text: That's not what he wanted to hear. He looks hurt.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Guess you'll do anything to get
dialog: your story.
dialog: That came out colder than he meant it. She look's hurt.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What does that mean?
text: He shrugs. They look at each other long and hard, trying to
text: read each other. And then Claire suddenly approaches.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I shouldn't have come here.
text: They both just stare at her for a beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What is it Claire? What happened?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Too much has happened, dear. It's
dialog: been fifty years. I'm behaving like
dialog: a school girl. You were right,
dialog: Charlie. This was selfish and
dialog: impulsive and I'm sorry.
text: Don Alfonso appears at Claire’s side.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: Claire...
text: She smiles softly at him.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I should go. It was good to see you
dialog: again. Really.
text: Sophia looks at Charlie as if say "Do something." He takes
text: Claire's hand.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You can’t just pitch up here out of
text: the blue and then bugger off. It’s
dialog: just not fair on the poor bloke.
text: Claire turns to Don Alfonso.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It was foolish. Barging back into
dialog: your life like this.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (cont'd)
dialog: How could we possibly pick up where
dialog: we left off a life time ago?
text: He smiles warmly at her - he understands what she's feeling.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: Claire, my angel, slow down. It
dialog: won't happen in a day. Nothing
dialog: worth doing is done in a day.
text: Claire sighs. Calming a bit.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: We'll talk... Be friends... have
dialog: dinner... take it slow... we’1l
dialog: write letters... you can tell me
dialog: about Jack... and I‘’11 tell you
dialog: about my bladder operations.
text: This unexpected image makes Claire smile despite herself. As
text: long as he’s bravely confessing things:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I have varicose veins.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: So do I. And my hearing.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: My eyes are going.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: We're a little old, like Da Vinci's
text: Last Supper, falling apart a
dialog: little. But what a masterpiece, no?
text: He takes her hand. Looks in her eyes.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: What are you afraid of?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Maybe I’m afraid to be happy again.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: There are so many worse things to
dialog: be afraid of at our age.
text: He takes her hand and smiles sweetly. She smiles back
text: comforted by his words. They hug each other reassuringly.
text: He turns to Charlie and holds out his hand. Charlie takes it.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: Come. I’1l show you some vines that
dialog: are even older than me.
text: Charlie turns to Sophia.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You coming?
text: Sophia looks at him - still a bit hurt. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You go. I should get back.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Need to get to work on that story.
dialog: That's what I'm here for, right?
text: A silent beat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right.
text: They look at each other. Both looking like they want to say
text: more. Neither does. Then they turn around and walk away.
scene_heading: EXT. SOPHIA'S HOTEL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Sophia's lying on the bed writing on her laptop when her cell
text: phone rings. She answers.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hey. How's Palermo? Still need me
dialog: to pick you up tomorrow morning?
text: INTERCUT: Victor getting of a small single-engine plane.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: It was great. I'm back. Caught an
dialog: early flight. Can you come get me?
text: Sophia is startled, taken aback.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Sure. OK. Uh. On my way.
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL HOTEL NEAR FLORENCE -- PARKING LOT
text: Sophia heads down to the Fiat Cinquecento. She gets in and
text: drives off. Just as soon as she's out of sight...
text: Charlie’s car arrives at the hotel. He gets out and walks in.
text: Claire follows him.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK -- LATER
text: Charlie is at the front desk with Claire.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: She left a few minutes ago.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: She did?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: For the airport.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The airport? Did she leave a
dialog: message?
text: The receptionist looks.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: No sir. No message.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I can't believe she'd run off.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: It's simple. She’s frightened. Go
dialog: after her Charlie.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No. She's not...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Oh don’t be so proud.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I’m not. Really. It’s for the best.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Don’t make the same mistake I did.
text: Pause. He looks at her. She smiles warmly and strokes the
text: side of his face. He suddenly sprints out of the hotel.
dialog: 89.
text: Claire turns back to the Receptionist.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We'd like to check out please.
dialog: We’re gonna be staying with friends
dialog: for the rest of our trip.
text: The Receptionist starts processing the paper work.
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA AIRPORT -- NIGHT
text: Charlie runs into the Terminal.
scene_heading: INT. TERMINAL -- LATER
text: He rushes up to the departure monitor. The only New York
text: flight on the monitor has closed. He’s too late.
text: He looks at it carefully then leaves, disconsolate.
scene_heading: EXT. VERONA AIRPORT -- NIGHT
text: Charlie walks out of the terminal back to the car park
text: structure. As he does so, Sophia can be seen further down the
text: concourse with Victor loading his luggage into the Fiat.
text: Charlie waits in line for the paying machine.
dialog: If only they’d turn round. But they don’t.
text: Charlie doesn’t see her and she doesn’t see him.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL HOTEL NEAR FLORENCE -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Sophia and Victor walk into the lobby.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why don’t you take your luggage
dialog: upstairs, I'll be up in a minute.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sure.
text: He goes to kiss her. She moves imperceptibly so that the kiss
text: lands on her cheek instead of her lips.
scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK -- LATER
text: Sophia walks. There is now a FEMALE RECEPTIONIST on the desk.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Have you seen Mister Smith or his
dialog: grandmother this evening?
speaker_heading: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
text: They checked out about an hour ago.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Checked out? Are you sure?
speaker_heading: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Did they leave a message?
speaker_heading: FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (checks )
dialog: No miss.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh. OK.
text: She thinks for a moment. Then Victor appears.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I was thinking we could head over
dialog: for one last meal with Angelina.
text: He notices her lost in her head.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Everything alright?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah... Yeah... everything’s fine.
text: He puts an arm around her and leads her out of the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. LETTERE A GIULIETTA RESTAURANT -- LATER
text: Victor and Sophia sit together. Victor has polished off a
text: plate of Angelina's meatballs. Sophia hardly touched hers.
text: Bella comes to clear their plates. She smiles at Sophia.
text: Sophia can only manage a meek smile back. A beat.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: --.-I did a lot of thinking while I
dialog: was in Palermo. About the
dialog: restaurant, about it's future,
dialog: about our future.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: VICTOR (cont'd)
dialog: And I realized I can't do it
dialog: without you. I want you with me.
text: Sophia shakes her head.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Victor, I...
text: Victor theatrically drops down on one knee. Sophia has look
text: on her face that says "Oh God, here we go again".
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Sophia? Will you be...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Victor, I don't want to run your...
text: Before she can finish the sentence, Victor pulls out and
text: opens a jewelry box. There's a diamond ring in it. She gapes.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: My wife?
text: Sophia just stares at the ring. She's speechless. She just
text: stares. Victor slides the ring on her finger before she
text: answers. Now she's staring at it on her finger.
scene_heading: EXT. SOPHIA'S HOTEL ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT: Of the diamond sparkling on her finger.
text: Sophia stands at the window, ready for bed, looking at the
text: garden below, where she and Charlie lay looking at the stars
text: the night before. Then she looks at the ring. She sighs.
text: Victor comes up behind her and wraps his arms around her.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: We should get some sleep. Early
dialog: flight tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah.
text: She takes a last look at the garden and follows him in.
scene_heading: EXT. D'ANNUNZIO VILLA -- CHARLIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Charlie stands in his bedroom window looking out at the
text: Italian night sky. He looks sad.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 92.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S RESTAURANT -- EVENING
dialog: It's not big but beautifully put together in a provincial
text: Italian style. All along the walls are huge blown up photos
text: of Victor and his Italian suppliers - the truffle hunter, the
dialog: butcher, etc. - which Sophia took in Italy.
text: The place is packed. Not a table empty in the house.
text: WAITERS and WAITRESSES scurry about. LINE COOKS fire entrees.
text: And at the center of it all, in his element, is Victor
text: barking orders, he's intense but enjoying every second.
text: We pick up Mark - Victor's bartender - taking an entree off
text: the line. He carries it through the restaurant to the front
text: of the house where we find Sophia sitting by herself at the
text: bar. He sets the entree in front of her with a smile.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S RESTAURANT -- BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Things have calmed down some. The place is still crowded but
text: the dinner rush has subsided.
text: Victor is out visiting tables of HIGH SOCIETY TYPES. They
text: bathe him in praise. He plays the role of humble well. Sophia
text: watches him from the mostly empty bar where she sits sipping
text: a glass of wine. Mark is polishing wine glasses behind the
text: bar. He sees her watching him.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Can you believe how quickly it's
dialog: all happening? He deserves it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I can. And he does.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: You must be proud of him.
text: She smirks - maybe a little tipsy from the wine.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I must be.
text: The Bar Tender gestures to the ring on her finger.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Have you set the date yet?
text: She looks at her diamond.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: We're still... "waiting for things
dialog: to settle down."
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S KITCHEN -- LATER
text: Victor and his STAFF are finishing up for the night. Prepping
text: for tomorrow. Sophia walks in with her coat on.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You about ready?
text: Victor doesn't even glance up from what he's doing.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You know what. Just go ahead. I'll
dialog: catch up. See you at home.
text: Sophia sighs in a way that tells us this has become routine.
scene_heading: INT. SOPHIA AND VICTOR'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK -- NIGHT
text: Sophia at home alone on her couch with her laptop.
text: We find her as we first found her up late working on a
text: column. Only without the drying pasta hung everywhere.
dialog: And without Victor.
text: She's not working so much as staring at the screen. It's too
text: quiet. She glances at the clock: It's three a.m.
scene_heading: INT. BAR -- HAPPY HOUR
text: Sophia is out with friends having drinks. She's with a GROUP
text: OF COUPLES. Victor is conspicuously absent.
scene_heading: EXT. SOPHIA AND VICTOR'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: It's the middle of the night. Victor snores in the bedroom.
text: Sophia sits alone on the couch watching TV looking bored. She
text: has a thought. She searches through her desk drawer and pulls
text: out the little slip of paper that Claire wrote her number on.
text: She checks the clock. It's 3:30 in New York. 9:30 in London.
dialog: Not too early to call.
text: She dials the number. There's an English ring tone. After a
text: minute an answering machine picks up:
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (V.O.)
dialog: Hi. You've reached Claire and
dialog: Charlie. There's no one here at the
dialog: moment. But if you'd like to...
text: At this point the phone is picked up at the other end.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE 0/S
dialog: Hello?
text: Sophia freezes. She can’t speak.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE 0/S
dialog: Hello?
text: In the background Claire can be heard.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE 0/S
dialog: Who is it dear?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE 0/S
dialog: Don’t know. Hello?
text: She quickly puts the receiver down - heart pounding.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, NEW YORK -- EVENING
text: Sophia approaches Victor’s Restaurant from across the street.
text: She stops and watches through the front window.
text: Victor is visible in the open-air kitchen at the back,
text: cooking, ordering, examining plates on the service pass.
text: It's fully booked again.
text: PEOPLE who haven’t booked are being turned away. At the front
text: of house desk - where Sophia could've been - stands a
text: beautifully elegant HOSTESS.
text: Sophia so clearly doesn’t feel a part of this. How quickly
text: things move on. She sighs and crosses the street.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE -- LATE NIGHT
text: A closet-sized office in the back of the restaurant. Sophia
text: and Victor eat together in silence. This is the time they
dialog: spend together now.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Bono was here last Friday.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Nice.
text: They go back to eating in silence.
scene_heading: INT. VICTOR'S RESTAURANT -- LATER
text: Sophia is on her way out when she passes a chubby man eating
text: alone. It's Bobby. He's got a tomato-stained napkin tucked in
text: his shirt just below his chin. Sophia approaches. He smiles.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Your boy can cook.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So I've heard.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Thanks for getting me the table.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: It's what I do.
text: He smiles. Pulls out a chair for her.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Sit down. Have a drink with me.
text: She does. He signals the waiter to bring another wine glass.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: So... I finally got around to
dialog: reading those pages you sent me...
text: Sophia's not exactly sure what he's talking about.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: "Does True Love Have a Shelf Life?"
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Oh. Right. What'd you think?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Not bad. I liked it. I think people
dialog: would like it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Who are the "people" you're always
dialog: referring to?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Advertisers mostly.
dialog: 96.
text: She smiles. Bobby pours her a glass of wine.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Why didn't you finish it?
text: Sophia isn't quite sure what he means.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You didn't like the ending?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
text: There is no ending.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Of course there's an ending. She
text: found him. They reconnected.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You never answer your own question.
dialog: You never followed up.
text: Sophia's not sure where he's going with this. He smiles like
text: he knows something she doesn't.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: It's the grandson isn't it?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I read what you wrote remember.
text: It's all there on the page.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I hardly wrote anything about Char--
dialog: I mean the grandson.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Exactly.
text: Sophia shakes her head. Takes a gulp of wine.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Well like I said it showed
dialog: potential. Maybe it's time we talk
dialog: about the next step. Maybe there is
dialog: more you can contribute.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Like contribute creatively? Or...
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Slow down. You got potential. But
dialog: you got work to do. You got a voice
dialog: but you don't always use it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But you want me to try something
dialog: new?
text: Bobby smiles. He shrugs playing coy.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Come into my office on Monday.
dialog: We'll talk.
text: Sophia suddenly can't stop smiling.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Sophia is changing for bed when she hears Victor come in.
text: She's still smiling. Victor walks into the room yawning.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Guess what?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Too tired to guess. Just tell me.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Bobby liked my story.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: What story?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Claire's story. He says I've got a
dialog: voice. He wants to talk about maybe
dialog: taking the next step. Isn't that
dialog: great?
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Yeah... Yeah... Very gr...
dialog: (he yawns so "great"
dialog: sounds like "gruh")
dialog: Victor's too tired to show any enthusiasm. And we get the
text: feeling even if he weren't he wouldn't. He yawns again.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That's all you got is "very gruh"?
text: He flops down on the bed. Kicks off his shoes.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I'm happy for you. I've also been
dialog: on my feet for nineteen hours.
dialog: G'night.
text: He closes his eyes. Sophia just stands there watching him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Victor this isn't working.
text: He opens his eyes but doesn't look at her.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: And whose fault is that?
text: She looks at him. He sits up with a frustrated sigh.
text: He yawns.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You see? This is why. This is why I
dialog: wanted you with me. I asked you to
dialog: be my front of house precisely to
dialog: avoid this situation.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You asked me to be your wife. And I
dialog: never see you. That's the
dialog: situation. There's no avoiding it.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: Do we have to do this now? You're
dialog: being unreasonable.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: There isn't anything reasonable
dialog: about love, Victor.
text: Victor can see where this is headed. He gets defensive.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You knew what the restaurant was
dialog: gonna require... You knew I'd be
dialog: working long hours... You knew what
dialog: it would mean... You knew there'd
dialog: be sacrifice... You knew that...
text: Silence. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: You knew this was who I was.
dialog: 99,
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And what I'm trying to tell you is
dialog: I'm not who I was.
text: He's silent at this - what can he say.
speaker_heading: VICTOR
dialog: I didn't do anything wrong.
text: She walks up to him.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You're not wrong. I'm not wrong.
dialog: We're just wrong for each other.
text: And there it is. She takes off her engagement ring and places
text: it in his hand.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- WEEKS LATER
text: The leaves are starting to turn in central park.
scene_heading: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY
text: Sophia is in her weekly staff meeting with Bobby and all the
text: rest of his WRITERS. Bobby is at the head of the table.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: ...And finally I need a follow up
dialog: on last summer's piece on the
dialog: mayor. I know a week in city hall
dialog: isn't anyone's idea of a vacation.
text: Bobby looks right at Sophia.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You got it?
text: She nods.
scene_heading: INT. A SMALL STUDIO IN THE CITY. WHERE:
text: Sophia has moved. The place is furnished but still coming
dialog: together.
text: She's working on her laptop. She seems to be immersed fully
text: in what she's writing. She's focused not stressed.
dialog: 100.
text: There's a knock at her door. She answers and finds a MAILMAN
text: who hands her a thick bundle of forwarded mail - presumably
text: from Victor's. She sorts through it.
text: Then she stops at an envelope. It has an Italian stamp and
text: post mark. She opens it quickly. It’s an invitation.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE’S VOICE
dialog: Mrs. Claire Smith and Don Alfonso
dialog: D’Annunzio invite you to the
dialog: wedding of Mrs. Claire Smith to Don
dialog: Alfonso D’Annunzio.
text: Then scribbled across the bottom in large letters.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE’S VOICE
dialog: Please come darling. You must.
text: Sophia beams.
scene_heading: INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE -- DAY
text: Sophia stands in front of Bobby. He looks at the invitation.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: You going to finish that story?
text: He hands her back the invitation. She looks at it.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I don't know. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Really?
text: A beat as he takes this in. She kind of shrugs.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I'll give you the week.
text: She smiles.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL CHURCH IN TUSCANY -- DAY
dialog: 
text: PEOPLE are starting to arrive at a beautiful Medieval Italian
text: village church. A taxi pulls up and Sophia gets out.
text: She looks stunning in a simple pale suit. She looks nervous
text: as she surveys the picturesque scene.
text: She walks towards the church.
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL CHURCH IN TUSCANY -- LATER
text: As she enters the church and makes her way through the crowd
text: of GUESTS, young and old, we can tell that she's looking for:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE 0/S
dialog: Sophia...
text: And there he is. She turns to find him smiling at her.
text: Dressed in a traditional English morning suit, tails,
text: waistcoat, the works. One might even say he looks dashing.
text: He approaches. She suddenly seems very nervous.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: (forgets she already said)
dialog: Hi...
text: They do an awkward hug/kiss on the cheek thing.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You look great.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm glad you came. You look pretty
dialog: good yourself.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: How could I not? Come, I mean, not
dialog: look...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I got it.
text: A beat of awkward silence. They smile at each other - smiles
dialog: that say "Why is this so uncomfortable?" Finally.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You came alone?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Yeah. I did. Sorry I didn't RSVP. I
dialog: just moved.
text: A beat as Charlie registers this.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's fine. Whole thing's been a bit
dialog: of a shotgun affair really...
dialog: (he smiles at her)
dialog: I'm glad you came.
text: She smiles hoping it's for the reason she thinks it is.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO 0/S
dialog: There she is. There's our angel.
text: Sophia turns to find Don Alfonso beaming at her. She's
text: visibly taken aback at his appearance. He's so much thinner,
text: and what little hair he had left has turned a shade greyer,
text: he walks with a cane now and has a pronounced limp but still
text: he looks like royalty in a fine Italian tuxedo. His grandson,
text: Alfonso III, escorts him on his way.
text: Don Alfonso stops and kisses Sophia on both cheeks.
speaker_heading: DON ALFONSO
dialog: Thank you for coming.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Wouldn't miss it for the world.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Papa, they need you at the altar.
text: He smiles and kisses Sophia's hand before continuing on into
text: the church. Sophia watches him limping on that cane. She
text: turns and looks at Charlie. She doesn't even have to ask.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: He fell. About two months ago. He
dialog: and Gran were walking in his
text: fields. Tripped on vine. Shattered
dialog: his hip. Had to have it replaced.
text: Sophia watches Don Alfonso smiling and welcoming guests as he
text: slowly makes his way down the aisle.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: That's terrible.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Saved his life actually.
text: Sophia turns back to Charlie who takes a breath before:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: He only fell a few feet but the hip
text: shattered like a vase.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (cont'd)
dialog: (beat)
text: A tumor had hollowed it out.
text: Sophia just stares - speechless.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Is he OK... Is he...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: They think a year, maybe two, maybe
dialog: more, maybe less. Different doctors
dialog: give different answers, none of
dialog: them straight, you know how it
dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: My god... How awful...
text: Charlie looks with a smile at Don Alfonso who has finally
text: made it to his place at the altar. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Actually they've been
dialog: extraordinary. Really. It's
dialog: humbling. They're living proof that
dialog: if you find love for even the
dialog: shortest moment, you have to grab
dialog: it with both hands...
text: Charlie catches himself being sincere. He tries to play it
text: off with a wry shrug and smile.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Tis better to have loved... and all
dialog: that.
text: She manages a smile back.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And all that.
text: They look at each other for a long moment. Sophia looks as if
text: she's about to say something when...
speaker_heading: PATRICIA 0O/S
dialog: There you are.
text: At that moment a strikingly beautiful English woman in a gown
text: that matches Charlie's suit approaches. She is PATRICIA.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: You need to get outside. She'll be
dialog: here any second.
dialog: 104.
text: Sophia just stares at her. Momentarily speechless.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Patricia. This is Sophia.
dialog: Doing her best to hide her disappointment:
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hi.
text: Realization flashes in Patricia's flawless eyes.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: The Sophia.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The Sophia.
text: Sophia shrugs and smiles.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Oh it's so nice to finally meet
dialog: you. You're kind of a legend around
dialog: here you know.
text: A silent beat. Patricia turns to Charlie.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: I'll see you up there. Don't trip.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: As if I'm not nervous enough.
text: She kisses his cheek, smiles at Sophia, and heads off down
dialog: the aisle.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: She's beautiful...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. Scrubs up well I suppose.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: And is she...
text: Before she can ask the question an old Italian limousine
text: rolls to a stop at the front steps as Alfonso III walks up.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: And there she is. Places everyone.
dialog: (to Alfonso III)
dialog: Can you show Sophia to a seat?
dialog: 105.
text: Alfonso III hold out his arm. Sophia takes it. She looks at
text: Charlie. He looks at her and smiles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Show time.
text: Charlie heads out to the white limo as Alfonso III ushers
text: Sophia down the aisle. The church is idyllic, festooned with
text: white flowers everywhere. The floral arrangements at the end
text: of the pews contain bunches of dark purple grapes.
text: The Secretaries of Juliet are together in a pew. They wave to
text: Sophia as she passes. Bella, ever the romantic, is already
text: crying, handkerchief in hand.
text: When Sophia gets to a seat she looks to the altar where Don
text: Alfonso stands waiting for his bride. He turns to look at
text: Sophia. He smiles sweetly then closes his eyes for a few
text: seconds in a silent expression of gratitude. She smiles.
text: Then the organ begins and a hush falls over the congregation.
text: Charlie escorts Claire down the aisle. She looks beautiful.
text: All the excitement and radiance of a teenage bride.
text: As they pass she sees Sophia and her whole face just lights
text: up. She gives her a discreet wave. Sophia smiles and waves
text: back but it's all too much and the tears begin to come.
text: Charlie walks Claire to Don Alfonso. He gives her away.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL VILLAGE IN TUSCANY -- LATER
dialog: 
text: THE WEDDING PARTY is led through the narrow streets of the
text: village towards the vineyard by a loud brass band.
text: VILLAGERS outside bars stand and applaud. Others lean out of
text: upstairs windows throwing confetti, whistling and cheering.
text: Alfonso walks arm-in-arm with Claire at the center of it all.
text: Beside them. Patricia and Charlie and Alfonso's son and
dialog: grandson.
text: And lastly the gathering of GUESTS. Sophia is among the first
text: cluster just behind the wedding party. Everyone's eyes are on
text: The Bride and Groom except Sophia who's watching Charlie.
text: The parade continues. It's a colorful, joyous carnival of an
text: occasion. A day not soon forgotten in this little village.
dialog: 106.
scene_heading: EXT. D'ANNUNZIO VILLA -- OPEN FIELD -- SUNSET
text: Tables have been laid for the wedding feast. The BAND plays,
text: CHILDREN run around. FRIENDS and FAMILY chat and laugh.
text: At the head table sit the bride and groom. Charlie and
text: Patricia are seated on either side of them.
text: Sophia is at another table with the Secretaries of Juliet.
text: She steals glances at Charlie over her glass of wine.
text: Charlie stands and taps his glass. Everyone turns to him.
text: The band stops and silence falls. Charlie clears his throat.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: It's been a sincere honor giving
dialog: away my Gran today. Though she's
dialog: left me in the market for a room
dialog: mate if anyone knows anyone... some
dialog: light cooking and laundry required.
text: This gets a chuckle. Charlie smiles at Claire as he says:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I'm not allowed to make a speech...
dialog: Someone shouts “Shame!”
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: So I'll just get right to it
dialog: then... Ladies and Gentlemen, may I
dialog: present for the first time Mr. and
dialog: Mrs. Alfonso D'Annunzio...
text: Everyone stands and cheers. Claire and Alfonso kiss.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Now I believe Mrs. D'Annunzio would
dialog: like to say a few words... Gran?
text: Everyone claps. Claire kisses Charlie and stands. He sits.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I won’t keep you long as I'm sure
dialog: most of you have heard the story of
dialog: how my husband...
text: Everyone cheers and whistles at the first mention of the
text: word. She smiles. It gets quiet again.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Fifty-seven-years ago I wrote a
dialog: letter that asked a question.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (cont'd)
dialog: Fifty-seven years later I got an
dialog: answer.
dialog: (she looks right at)
dialog: Sophia? Dear? Would you stand up?
text: Sophia hesitates then stands reluctantly. She turns red with
text: embarrassment. Charlie smiles at this.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Sophia gave me my answer.
text: Everyone starts clapping and cheering her as Claire unfolds a
text: piece of paper. Sophia recognizes it - turns redder.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: She wrote me a letter. This letter.
dialog: Without it, none of this would've
dialog: been possible, none of us would be
dialog: here today, and so it seems only
dialog: fitting to share some of it...
dialog: (she starts reading)
dialog: "'What' and ‘if’ two words as non-
dialog: threatening as words come. But put
text: them together side-by-side and they
dialog: have the power to haunt you for the
dialog: rest of your life: ‘What if?'..."
text: She looks at Sophia now and basically reads the letter to her
text: as if no one else were there.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: "I don't know how your story ended.
dialog: But I know that if what you felt
dialog: then was love - true love - then
dialog: it's never too late. If it was true
dialog: then it why wouldn't it be true
dialog: now? You need only the courage to
dialog: follow your heart..."
text: Sophia is looking at Charlie who looks straight back at her.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: "I don't know what a love like that
dialog: feels like... a love to leave loved
dialog: ones for, a love to cross oceans
dialog: for... but I'd like to believe if I
dialog: ever felt it. I'd have the courage
dialog: to seize it. I hope you had the
dialog: courage to seize it, Claire. And if
dialog: you didn't, I hope one day that you
dialog: will."
text: She folds the letter and looks at Sophia - we can see the
text: glaze of tears forming as everyone starts clapping.
dialog: 108.
text: Charlie sees those tears forming too.
text: Sophia looks at him sitting there beside Patricia and then
text: abruptly turns and walks off away from the gathering.
text: The tears have started to fall. She wipes them away.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I'm sorry, I have to go.
text: Charlie watches Sophia go. He catches Claire looking at him
text: as if to say "What are you waiting for?" A beat.
text: Then he gets up and goes after her.
scene_heading: EXT. D'ANNUNZIO VILLA -- LATER
text: Charlie walks around to the front of the house.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia?
text: He walks to the front door and calls inside.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia?
text: He walks round the corner towards the vineyards and looks
text: down the rows of fruit laden vines.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia?
text: He goes back towards the house and then spots her in a first
text: floor window redoing her make up in front of a mirror. A vine
text: grows up this side of the house up to and beyond the window.
text: He walks up to the house and shouts from below.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sophia?
text: She looks out of the window - it should, of course, be
text: reminiscent of Shakespeare's balcony scene.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I’m leaving.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Why?
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I shouldn't have come here.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Did you listen to what Gran just
dialog: said? To what you wrote?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I’m happy for you. She’s gorgeous.
dialog: Not at all how I imagined.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Patricia.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Patricia? She’s my cousin.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Your cousin? Good God. Is that
dialog: legal in England?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Different girl. Same name. She’s
dialog: like a sister to me. And a daughter
dialog: to Gran. We practically grew up
dialog: together after, you know...
text: This gives Sophia pause. She looks down at him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Don’t go.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Why? Why should I stay, Charlie?
text: He starts to climb the vine towards her with some difficulty.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: The thing is I’ve watched Gran and
dialog: Alfonso over the last few months...
dialog: and I've realized... that I can’t
dialog: wait fifty years to say...
text: He’s level with her now but has to pause to get his breath.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: ---I love you, Sophia.
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That kiss wasn't a mistake. Poorly
dialog: timed yeah. But not a mistake.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: You love me?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So why are you looking at me like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
text: Terrified.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I remembered about half way up the
dialog: vine I’m a bit scared of heights.
text: She looks at him. Smiles.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I love you too.
text: Slight pause. She leans into kiss him. But he doesn't move.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: So are you gonna kiss me? Or...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I would. Yeah. It’s just that I
dialog: appear to have lost my foot--
text: And with that he disappears from the window - screaming all
text: the way down until he hits with a thud.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Charlie!
text: She looks down to see him lying prostrate in a bush.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN HOUSE -- LATER
text: She rushes through the villa, down the stairs, and out
text: through the hall to the front yard.
dialog: 111.
text: She runs up to him. He's moaning in pain.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Are you OK?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (groans)
dialog: Please tell me no one saw that.
text: Sophia looks up and sees the entire wedding party looking at
text: Charlie lying there.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: No one saw it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Can you move?
text: He stays completely still as he smiles.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Only my lips.
text: She leans over and kisses him as Claire and Alfonso watch
text: approvingly from a distance. As we...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: “LA FINE"
dialog:
