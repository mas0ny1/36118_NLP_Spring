scene_heading: INT. COLLEGE REGISTRATION -- DAY 1
text: At the edge of the registration hall three well-dressed young
text: women -- stylish, black ROSE; cute, insipid HEATHER and
text: pretty VIOLET -- spot a lonely-looking new student.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Look.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes. I think so.
text: Violet approaches the lithe, pretty but sad-looking LILY.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello. Are you a new student?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Good -- we thought so. We’d like
dialog: to help you.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Help me? What do you mean?
scene_heading: EXT. QUADRANGLE -- DAY 2
text: The four walk across the green, leafy quadrangle formed by
text: the university’s handsome old brick buildings.
scene_heading: INSERT TITLE: “The Quadrangle, Seven Oaks University”
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: As a freshman, it can be very
dialog: tough. You finally get to college,
dialog: it’s supposed to be so great but,
dialog: generally -- it’s not. University
dialog: life can be pretty bad.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: There are a lot of suicides.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Well, attempted ones.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’m not actually a freshman. I'ma
dialog: transfer student.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh... An “entering Sophomore?”
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: So you were unhappy at your old
dialog: school and are looking to recover
dialog: here? Well, I think you will!
text: Violet encourages her with a huge smile.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Would you welcome that? Would our
dialog: help and guidance be something
dialog: you’d appreciate, or would you
dialog: rather sink or swim on your own?
dialog: Either way’s fine, we’d still be
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yes, whichever you'd prefer.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes. Sure.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Great! Well, let’s start
dialog: immediately.
text: She gives Lily a very quick looking over.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: Clothes can be critical for
dialog: confidence -- and an overall sense
dialog: of well-being.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You don’t like my clothes?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It’s not about liking or not
dialog: liking...
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What's it about?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: How you look when you put them on.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: The right clothes don’t have to be
dialog: expensive.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No, all you need are friends of
text: about the same size.
text: A grungy pack of male students approaches, inconsiderately
text: hogging the path, obliging the girls to step aside. Suddenly
text: Rose looks like she’s smelled something foul; Violet gags.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Phew!
text: Rose bends over, hyperventilating -- it’s a bit scary.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You didn’t notice that?!
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No, what?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Those guys! That smell! That
text: awful acrid odor.
text: Rose’s hyperventilating gets a little less. [Film full
dialog: speech in both locations: ]
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: Rose has a very sensitive nose....
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS’ ROOM -- DAY 3
text: Rose lies in her bunk, a handkerchief to her nose.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: ..--Have you heard of “nasal shock
dialog: syndrome?” Any harsh, acrid, or
text: just “disgusting” odor sends Rose
dialog: into nasal shock--
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (very nasally)
dialog: This wasn’t true nasal shock. Had
dialog: it been, I’d’ve lost consciousness
dialog: entirely.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Just from some b.o.?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: “Just some b.o.?!” Omigod, Lily,
dialog: you must have a very high threshold
dialog: for pain! That’1ll serve you well
dialog: here at Seven Oaks!
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Seven Oaks is notorious for it’s
dialog: b.o. It was the last of the “Select
text: Seven” to go co-ed.
dialog: (looks around, combative)
text: An atmosphere of male barbarism
dialog: predominates -- but we’re going to
dialog: change all that!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yes!
text: Lily heads toward the door.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Where’re you going?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’ve got to get to the housing
dialog: department -- it seems they lost my
dialog: rooming assignment.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That's terrible. You've no place
dialog: to stay?
text: Lily shakes her head, her eyes watering a little.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: They lost your housing assignment?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: How could they lose it?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Was it just mislaid?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No, there were more acceptances
dialog: than they anticipated and not
dialog: enough rooms to go around.
text: Violet exchanges quick looks with Rose and Heather.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why don’t you stay with us?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Really?
scene_heading: INT. DORM BATHROOM-- NIGHT 4
text: Considerable movement in front of the mirrors as the girls
dialog: prepare for a night out.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You mustn’t think of this in the
dialog: old fashioned sense of going to a
dialog: party to “find someone” or “not
dialog: find someone.” That’s not the
dialog: dynamic we’re talking about.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What dynamic are you talking about?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m glad you asked that. Our going
dialog: to a party of this kind is more a
dialog: form of... “youth outreach”--
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: “Youth outreach.” It’s not just
dialog: some moronic frat house social
dialog: function--
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Though it will be that.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes, of course, but what we’ve got
dialog: to keep in mind is -- these guys
dialog: are very young, they’re “young
dialog: people”--
text: Violet opens the door and goes halfway out, with one parting
dialog: comment.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: They're essentially immature,
text: crying out for help and guidance.
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Though they don’t know that.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No. They don’t, but we do.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: But aren’t they the same age as we
dialog: are?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Only numerically.
text: Violet returns, carrying a beautiful dress.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m a lot fatter than you are but I
dialog: think we could pin it.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Omigosh it’s beautiful.
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: Stunning.
text: Lily puts the dress up to see how it looks in the mirror.
speaker_heading: TITLE CARD
dialog: Saturday Evening “Youth Outreach”
scene_heading: EXT. UNIVERSITY WALK -- NIGHT 5
text: Possible POV shot of a wooden frat clubhouse from which party
text: music and crowd spills. Girls could walk into POV, or we
dialog: just see them heading that way.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Take Frank, my friend -- he’s not
dialog: some cool, handsome, “studly” macho-
dialog: type. No, not at all -- I can’t
dialog: stand guys like that! He’s more of
dialog: a sad-sack really, wouldn’t you
dialog: say?
text: Rose and Heather nod.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What’s a “sad-sack?”
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (forcefully)
dialog: A loo-ser!
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (to Violet)
dialog: You like losers?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Very much so. Do you know what’s
dialog: the major problem in contemporary
dialog: social life?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The tendency, very widespread, to
dialog: always seek someone “cooler” than
dialog: yourself -- it’s always a stretch,
dialog: often a big stretch. Why not find
dialog: someone who’s frankly inferior?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Someone like Frank.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes. It’s more rewarding and in
dialog: fact quite reassuring.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You mean, someone you can really
dialog: help? Not just thinking of
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes! That’s it. Precisely! But
dialog: without the goody-goody
dialog: implications -- our aspirations are
dialog: pretty basic: Take a guy who hasn’t
dialog: realized his full potential, or
dialog: doesn’t even have much and then
dialog: help him realize it -- or find
dialog: more. There’s enough material here
dialog: for a lifetime of social work.
text: Looking ahead, they see the front verandah of the D U where a
text: drunken frat member walks toward its balustrade and
text: dramatically falls, front-flipping, over it and disappears
text: from view. He then stands and walks calmly back into the
dialog: club.
text: ON the girls: Lily’s shocked expression, the others’
dialog: equanimity:
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s really worrisome is that
dialog: that--
dialog: (she makes a face)
dialog: -- was intentional.
text: The girls pass through the frame toward the clubhouse.
scene_heading: INT. D.U. CLUBHOUSE -- NIGHT 6
text: Entering it’s instantly clear the girls greatly outclass the
text: D.U. guys, a “meatloaf crowd” that includes Violet’s FRANK.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Frank, this is Lily, she’s just
dialog: come to Seven Oaks as a transfer
dialog: student. Isn’t she great?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Lily failed or was unhappy at her
dialog: last school but we're sure is going
dialog: to adapt beautifully here. In fact
dialog: she already has!!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh. Good.
text: A good, quite recent (circa-2002/6) dance hit starts to play.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Omigod -- a “golden oldie.” I love
dialog: these!
text: Violet starts the dancing; they all join in.
scene_heading: INT. D.U. CLUBHOUSE PARTY SPACE -- NIGHT 7
text: The four pair off and dance enthusiastically with klutzy DU
text: partners -- Violet with Frank, etc. Later women arrivals look
text: on jealously. Violet tries out new, cool dance steps -- the
text: others follow suit. The dancing gets better. Even the DU
dialog: guys -- most sad-sacks but one, THOR, dumb and handsome --
dialog: rise to the occasion.
scene_heading: INT. D.U. CLUBHOUSE REFRESHMENT AREA -- NIGHT 8
text: Breaking from the dancing Violet leads them into the
text: refreshment area.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Omigosh! Wasn’t that great?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: That was really fun.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I know that people can have useful
dialog: careers in many areas: Government.
dialog: Law. Finance. --
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: --Education--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes, even education! But I’d like
dialog: to do something especially
dialog: significant in my lifetime, the
dialog: sort of thing that could change the
dialog: course of human history -- such as
text: starting a new dance craze.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes. Something that could improve
dialog: the lives of every person -- and
dialog: every couple.
text: Frank looks at Violet with pride, which Violet rewards with a
text: quick kiss before sampling the punch.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: My gosh that’s good! What’s in it?
text: The young bartender gets flustered with an “uh...” “duh...”
dialog: reaction -- he doesn’t know.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: No, don’t tell. It’s better a
dialog: mystery!
scene_heading: INT. DINING HALL -- DAY 9
text: At breakfast the four are in pretty good shape considering
dialog: the night before.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m so proud of what you
dialog: accomplished last night. You
dialog: showed those guys a really good
dialog: time without anything really bad
dialog: happening. You could see their
dialog: confidence and enjoyment increase
text: by the minute, while not letting
dialog: them turn into animals. That's
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Still, I hate it when they puke.
text: Violet thinks about this.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That’s okay. It’s part of growing
dialog: up -- “they're learning their
dialog: limits.”
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: But are they learning? It’s like a
dialog: puking festival.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Well, their aim’s improving!
dialog: They're getting more directional!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yuck. I hate when it gets on your
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Dar-fur.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Dar-fur. There are horrible
dialog: injustices in the world and we
dialog: shouldn’t obsess over the
text: adolescent misdemeanors of friends.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: The guys you know, are they all
dialog: Greeks?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Are all the guys you know Greeks?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Excuse me? I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: (more slowly)
dialog: Are. All. The. Guys. You. Know.
dialog: Greeks?
text: Violet looks to the others.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I don’t think we know any Greeks.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Professor Papadapoulos?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: “Greeks” -- frat boys.
text: Blank looks all around.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh! Oh Yes! Fraternities! You mean
dialog: members of Greek-letter
dialog: 10
dialog: 11.
dialog: fraternities -- American college
dialog: slang: “Greeks.”
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Like last night.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Actually last night we were at the
dialog: “D” “U" house: “D", “U,” Roman
dialog: letters, not Greek. Seven Oaks
dialog: doesn’t have a Greek letter
dialog: fraternity system -- it’s always
dialog: been a Roman letter system here.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It's very different.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Well, I think you'll see.
scene_heading: EXT. BRICK BUILDING -- DAY 10
text: They approach another Georgian brick building. Rose and
text: Heather carry a large box of donuts and “jug 0’ joe.”
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What house is this?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, this isn’t a fraternity -- at
dialog: least not one anyone should want to
dialog: join!
text: The sign reads: “Suicide Center.”
text: Violet picks up the “Prevention” from the Center’s sign from
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: (to Lily)
dialog: You probably think we’re frivolous,
text: empty-headed, perfume-obsessed
dialog: college coeds. You’re probably
dialog: right. I often feel empty headed--
text: Violet puts the “Prevention” sign back up.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: But we’re also trying to make a
dialog: difference in people’s lives. And
dialog: one way to do that is to stop them
dialog: from killing themselves.
dialog: 11
dialog: 12.
text: Violet and Lily climb the Center steps.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: Have you ever heard the expression,
dialog: “Prevention is nine-tenths the
dialog: cure?” Well, in the case of
dialog: suicide, it’s actually ten-tenths
dialog: the cure.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Those are cliches, aren’t they?
scene_heading: INT. SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY 11
text: While Heather and Rose set up the coffee and donuts for the
text: center, including the sign explaining their restricted use.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: {Yes, they are.] It’s interesting
dialog: that you say that. I love cliches
text: and hackneyed expressions of every
dialog: kind. Do you know why?
text: Lily shakes her head “no.”
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: Because they’re largely true: The
dialog: hundreds, perhaps thousands of such
text: cliches and hackneyed expressions
dialog: our language has bequeathed to us
dialog: are, in fact, a treasure-trove of
dialog: human insight and understanding.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes. Oh, come sit with us. During
dialog: these formative college years we
dialog: should try to learn as many
text: hackneyed thoughts and expressions
dialog: as possible -- furthermore, I think
dialog: we will!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (to Lily)
dialog: Speaking of suicide prevention, do
dialog: you have a boyfriend, Lily?
text: Lily is a bit amazed.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Are you dating anyone?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I don’t see the connection.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You don’t?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Boyfriends are a primary suicide
dialog: risk.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You don’t have any particular
dialog: friend? No one at all?
text: Lily is put on the spot.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No... Well, there’s this grad
dialog: student whom I met over the summer -
dialog: - Xavier [pronounce Zav-ee-yay]. We
dialog: became pretty good pals.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: “Good pals?” What’s that?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well, he has a girlfriend whom I
dialog: met -- she’s very nice.
text: Violet looks around to the others.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What’s the point of that?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Of what?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Xavier with the girlfriend.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: “Zavier" with a “Z?"
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No, I think it’s with an “xX.”
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No, I’m certain it’s a “Z."
dialog: “Zavier" Like “Zorro.” It’s the
dialog: same sound.
dialog: (does a Zorro move)
text: Zorro marked his name with a “Z."
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It’s an “xX.”
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But Zorro’s with a “Z." It’s the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Okay, let’s see if we can figure
dialog: this out. Used at the beginning of
dialog: a name, “Z" and “X"” have the same
dialog: pronunciation.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But it’s Zorro- with a “Z.”
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Actually there were two “Zorros.”
text: One spelt his name with a “Z" and
dialog: made a “Z" mark for Zorro, the
dialog: other one spelled him name with an
dialog: “X" and with his sword he’d make an
dialog: “X" mark. What was really unfair
dialog: was that, because he marked his
dialog: name with an “X”, everybody assumed
dialog: he was illiterate, when actually he
dialog: was spelling correctly.
text: A frantic seeming young male student bursts into the Center --
text: they all stop what they’re doing.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Can we help you?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Of course we can! No case is too
dialog: hard or challenging -- would you
dialog: like a donut?
text: Heather springs into action.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Please sit down.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Here, have some coffee.
text: Violet sits at the desk and takes out a form.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What’s your name?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: Jim. Bose. But my friends call me
dialog: Jimbo.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why do your friends call you
dialog: “Jimbo?”
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: I suppose it’s a contraction of
dialog: “Jim” and the first part of my last
dialog: name, “Bose.”
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yah. I got that. But, why bother.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why bother: “Jim” is already a
dialog: lovely name -- short, simple,
dialog: evocative -- shouldn’t a nickname
dialog: simplify the name that it’s
dialog: replacing? Jimbo’ doesn’t simplify
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Well, maybe you should ask your
dialog: friends what they had in mind.
dialog: (reading from form)
dialog: Where do you live or reside?
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: Doar Dorm.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Ouf.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Omigod. Yuck.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The smell. It’s notorious.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: What smell?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You're right, it’s more like a
dialog: “stink.” Unclean clothing, I'd say,
dialog: mostly.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Vomit.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Stale beer.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Pot, cheap deodorant -- there might
dialog: be a vermin infestation.
text: Heather and Lily place the coffee and donut next to him.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No wonder you’re depressed, living
dialog: there. Did you know that a good
dialog: smelling environment is crucial to
dialog: our well-being? Have you thought of
dialog: moving and finding a place that
dialog: smells better?--
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: (getting frantic)
dialog: Wait, wait, wait-- It’s not me --
dialog: I’m not depressed!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Are you sure? Because you kind of
text: seem on edge.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: No -- I’m fine.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: That's a terrible expression --
dialog: “fine.”
dialog: (a funny voice)
dialog: “I'm fine.”
dialog: (normal voice)
dialog: Anyone who says they’re fine
dialog: definitely isn’t. It’s kind of
dialog: conceited. Something smug about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why do you say you're “fine?”
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: I mean I’m not depressed! I’m not
dialog: suicidal!
dialog: 12
dialog: 17.
text: Violet snatches the donut from his mouth.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Why are you here then? Are you a
dialog: con man, a confidence trickster?
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: No, there’s a girl on my floor! Her
dialog: boyfriend dumped her! She’s been
text: crying for days but now’s silent--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Omigod! Why didn’t you say so!
text: Violet jumps up.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to go!
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Call the cops -- a suicide might be
dialog: in progress!
text: Violet heads off.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: The campus cops?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yes of course the campus cops.
scene_heading: EXT. WALK TO DOAR DORM -- DAY 12
text: They head quickly along the walk. Violet still holds the
text: partially eaten donut carefully and sanitarily with a thin
dialog: tissue.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Take this. I’m sorry--
text: Violet gives Jimbo his donut back.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s just that we get a lot of
text: students coming to the center
dialog: pretending to be depressed to get
text: the donuts.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Confidence tricksters!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes, it’s really bad, really
dialog: cynical. And we made a pledge the
dialog: donut company that we would only
dialog: give the donuts to students who
dialog: were depressed, suicidal or
dialog: 13
dialog: 18.
dialog: otherwise nutty. We’re a non-profit
dialog: -- so the rules are pretty strict.
text: Jimbo nods as he jogs, his mouth full.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: This man could still be a
dialog: trickster.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We'll soon find out... I’m
dialog: surprised we haven’t had more cases
dialog: from Doar Dorm -- living in such
dialog: squalor must be terribly
text: destabilizing psychologically.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: It’s not so bad.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You poor guy!... Tell me about
dialog: this girl.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: Her name's “Priss.” She’s very
dialog: pretty--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh, yeah--
dialog: (to the other girls)
dialog: --it’s very hard for beautiful
dialog: women to experience rejection.
scene_heading: INT. DOAR DORM CORRIDOR -- DAY 13
text: They are outside the girl’s room. Violet tests the door
text: handle. It’s locked. She shakes it.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Priss? Priss? Are you okay?
text: They listen but can hear nothing.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: Priss! Say something!
text: Meanwhile each reacts to the Doar Dorm odor: most gasping but
text: Rose spraying perfume on her pashmina and trying to breath
dialog: through that.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: Priss! Open up -- please! Priss!
text: She listens but there’s no sound from within. Rose
text: approaches Violet, looking unwell.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (in terrible shape)
dialog: Could I wait outside?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes! It’s best to get as far away
dialog: as possible!
text: Rose, who looks shaken, nods.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: Take care of yourself, Rose.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yes, take care of yourself.
text: Rose leaves, protecting her face with the pashmina.

text: The campus cops burst into the room -- followed by Violet and
text: the others. PRISS bolts up from her dorm cot, where she’d
text: been lying teary-eyed, head under a pillow, headphones in her
text: ears. She’s delicate-looking and very pretty.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Priss?! Are you okay?!
text: Priss takes the headphones out of her ears.
speaker_heading: PRISS

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: What?

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Had you resolved to kill yourself?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: No... Not really.
text: She stops, looks down and freezes. Silently, tears start

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Could you excuse us?
text: Jimbo nods and goes. Violet turns back to Priss.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you want to talk about it? What
dialog: was his name?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: J-josh.
text: Priss’s voice breaks; another wave of tears rolls down her
dialog: cheeks.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: If you'd rather not talk about it,
dialog: we don’t have to --
text: Priss nods, but the tears don’t stop.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: No it’s Okay, I just... I keep
dialog: thinking how... he used to gaze at
dialog: me with such love in his eyes --
dialog: you know what I mean?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I’ve never actually seen that.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Yes, just days ago he’d gaze at me -
text: - with his eyes so blue.
text: She stops; the tears roll some more.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He had blue eyes?
text: Priss nods.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: So does Frank -- Frank’s the guy
dialog: that I go out with. Otherwise he’s
dialog: not conventionally good-looking --
dialog: which I actually prefer. Would you
dialog: describe “Josh” as handsome?
dialog: 21.
text: Priss nods, too overwhelmed to talk further.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s a problem.
text: Lily comes by with a cup of tea.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Could I join you guys?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes, please. Priss and I were just
dialog: talking -- in my view, handsome men
dialog: are to be avoided. I don’t even
dialog: consider good looks to be
dialog: flattering in a man. Do you know
dialog: what I mean?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Uh, no.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Cookie-cutter “good-looking guys”
text: with their “chiseled features,”
text: running around, full of themselves,
dialog: getting everything they want, never
dialog: suffering or experiencing any--
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Have we suffered?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We're not under discussion-- That's
text: irrelevant, beside the point.
dialog: (to Priss)

text: Priss has stopped crying.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Yes. I think so.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Good! I hoped it would.

dialog: Okay, it’s nearly four and the
dialog: Daily Complainer’s orientation

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Why do you think he’s such a jerk?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Environment? Genetics?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I mean what’s he done that’s so
dialog: jerky?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh. You’ll see. He’s one of those
dialog: I was talking about -- tall,
dialog: probably considering himself very
dialog: smart and handsome -- and a
dialog: “journalist” -- so you can just
dialog: imagine the mind-boggling arrogance
dialog: and conceit.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: But, Violet, don’t you think...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well, don’t you think that the way
dialog: you talk be considered arrogant
dialog: too?
text: They walk in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: LILY (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, a little...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes, of course, but what’s your
dialog: point?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well...wouldn’t that be
text: hypocritical, criticizing Rick
dialog: DeWolfe for something you could be
dialog: criticized for yourself?
text: Violet considers this with complete equanimity.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I don’t see why... We’re all
dialog: flawed. Must that render us mute
dialog: to the flaws of others? Must we
dialog: tether ourselves from comment
dialog: because our natures are human too?
dialog: (very happy)
dialog: We've got a rebel amongst us!
dialog: That's good, I think. It’s good to
dialog: be challenged and criticized.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’m sorry, I know your intentions
dialog: are good--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You’ve put your finger on something
dialog: important. That’s it, precisely:
dialog: Our intentions are good. We’re
dialog: seeking to help people rescue their
dialog: lives from terrible sadness and
dialog: failure -- which is a worthy goal,
dialog: don’t you think?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes, but not exactly a humble one.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I agree with you there, you're
dialog: right absolutely. I’d like to
dialog: thank you for this chastisement.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I think you did and I think
dialog: it’s good. It’s good to have a
dialog: friend to put one in one’s place
dialog: when that’s what one needs and now
dialog: I see that I have that kind of

dialog: Hello, people. Listen up...
dialog: People! Quiet... Quiet, people...
dialog: Shut up!... Okay, that's better!
dialog: Ha, ha. I'm Rick DeWolfe, editor

dialog: you’1l learn to hate most in the
dialog: world. At least, I hope so!
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You’re going hate me because I’m

text: Nervous laughter from the crowd.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh brother!
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What?
text: Violet just shakes her head but Rick looks and sees Violet’s
text: contemptuous stare. A Ceausescu moment. Then he recovers.
speaker_heading: RICK DE WOLFE
dialog: Any questions?... No?
text: Stupid titters. Violet rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: MALE STUDENT
dialog: Uh, yes -- how did the “Daily
dialog: Complainer” get its name?
speaker_heading: RICK DE WOLFE
dialog: Isn't that pretty obvious?
text: The student, embarrassed, shakes his head; nervous titters
text: from the crowd.
speaker_heading: RICK DE WOLFE (CONT’D)
dialog: It comes out every day and it’s the
dialog: university daily-- So, the Daily.
dialog: Complainer. Daily--
dialog: Stupid laughter, from Rick and others.
speaker_heading: MALE STUDENT
dialog: No, I meant--
speaker_heading: RICK DE WOLFE
dialog: You mean why the “Complainer?” The
dialog: name dates from Seven Oak’s
dialog: earliest days as a divinity school.
dialog: The reference is to the Book of Job
dialog: -- Job’s “complaint” with the
dialog: world. The Complainer started as a
dialog: theological journal but evolved
dialog: into the university weekly, finally
dialog: going daily after World War Two. I
dialog: like the name -- before justice can
dialog: be achieved, a complaint must be
dialog: made. That’s what we do and people
dialog: don't like it a bit. Right now that
dialog: means extirpating Seven Oak’s
dialog: elitist roman-letter clubs that are
dialog: like a cancer on the university
dialog: community-—
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh what nonsense!
speaker_heading: RICK DE WOLFE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: They're not “elitist” in the least.
text: Dead silence in the room.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Of course they are.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Have you met any of their members?
dialog: The guys from the DU, for example?
dialog: They're morons, barely competent
dialog: for the tasks of everyday life.
dialog: They have to drink something like a
dialog: quart of beer just to talk toa
dialog: woman-—
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: Two quarts.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yet you salivate at the idea of
dialog: taking the roof off these poor

text: brutally into the street where who
dialog: knows what harm might come to them.
dialog: And you consider yourself a
dialog: Christian?
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No, I don’t.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What unkindness and cruelty -- and
dialog: yet you’re proud of that. This is
dialog: the darkness in human nature, in
dialog: the very Heart of Man -- which the
dialog: British novelist Joseph Conrad
dialog: wrote about most eloquently.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: He was actually Polish.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Omigod! Pedantic too! Unkind,
dialog: self-righteous and pedantic -- in

text: Rick looks around and appeals to the crowd.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You should know something about

dialog: preferred therapy for seriously
dialog: depressed and suicidal people is
dialog: +..tap dancing. I kid you not.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Tap is a highly effective therapy
text: as well as a dazzlingly expressive
dialog: dance form that has been sadly
dialog: neglected for too many years.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It’s moronic and barbaric. You
dialog: seriously expect tap dancing to
dialog: solve these people’s problems?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, we don’t -- we're using the
dialog: whole range of musical dance
dialog: numbers which over many years have

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I thought you handled it well.
speaker_heading: VIOLET

dialog: this aggression and hostility that
dialog: gets me down -- not just his, but
dialog: also my own. It leaves you feeling
dialog: unclean.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Have you thought of taking a shower
dialog: maybe you’d fee better.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You’re probably right but there's
dialog: something else... What Lily was
dialog: saying about me being conceited and
dialog: arrogant-——
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’m sorry--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I think you’re right. It’s
dialog: bad. I feel terrible.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You’re joking--

dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I’m serious. It’s terrible how
dialog: I’ve acted. I’m embarrassed....
dialog: We’re all Christians -- Or, I
dialog: should say “Judeo-Christians:”
dialog: humility should be our watchword,

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What could you do? Oh, I know: you
dialog: think I’m suicidal -- that I’m
dialog: going to kill myself and make you
dialog: look bad.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I’m worried you’1l kill
dialog: yourself and make yourself look

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

dialog: might brush it aside by saying “No”
dialog: or “Not now...”
dialog: (Increasingly angry)
dialog: ...-But, after a while, you begin to
dialog: wonder -- why is everyone asking me
dialog: this? Is it because they want me to

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No. Not medically... I like them.
dialog: They're in that sympathetic range
dialog: of being not good-looking, and yet
dialog: not smart. There’s something
dialog: likeable about that. Spending time

dialog: a real boost.
speaker_heading: PRISS

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Mean?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes, he wants to close Seven Oaks’

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: That's good isn’t it? I thought

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Come on. There’s no possible

dialog: They're exclusive and elitist.
speaker_heading: LILY

dialog: morons.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Yeah -- elitist morons.
text: Confounded for a second, Lily regroups.
speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: XAVIER

speaker_heading: XAVIER

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Sending drinks to two gorgeous
dialog: girls? His intention was to seduce
dialog: -- and he assumed he could.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Both?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Isn't that a bit harsh? He was
dialog: probably just yearning for some
dialog: intelligent discourse.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I doubt that was the course he was
dialog: seeking.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Was he alone?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You see -- he was alone and
text: probably lonely. He could see that
dialog: Alice and Lily are college
dialog: students. College students are
dialog: well known for their intelligent
dialog: conversation. After all they can
dialog: always talk about their courses.
dialog: That was probably what attracted
dialog: him--
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Nonsense.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Perhaps his view was even loftier --
dialog: to court Lily, with a view to
dialog: Matrimony. We’re in the North but
dialog: occasionally a Southern gentleman
dialog: can wander into these parts.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Rubbish.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why not? Seeing Lily across a
text: crowded bar, filled with the usual
dialog: undergraduate slobs, why wouldn’t a
dialog: thoughtful young man seek her out?
dialog: She’s lovely. Isn’t it incumbent
dialog: on men and women to find ways to

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’‘ll grant you it’s a tactic, or
text: perhaps even a ruse. But without
dialog: some of that, would our species

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Omigosh--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, this is how the world works --

text: Violet imagines this.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: And if you do marry and have

scene_heading: 25 INT. BAR LOUNGE, D.U. CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT 25

speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Your eyes are so striking, so blue.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Really? They're blue?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Yes. The most piercing blue.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Huhn.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: You must know that your eyes are
dialog: blue?
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: You must know what color your eyes
dialog: are.
text: Frank remains silent and impassive.
speaker_heading: PRISS (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, your eyes are very blue,
dialog: you know that.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m not going to go around
dialog: “checking” what color my eyes
dialog: are!...
text: At the bar Thor cocks his head, listening.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Yes, but-- When you look in a
dialog: mirror, you must see your eyes are
dialog: blue.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh come on!
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m not homo-phobic, but I’m not
dialog: going to go looking in mirrors,
dialog: checking to see what color my eyes
dialog: are!... I don’t think my eyes have
dialog: a color. If they were so blue,
dialog: looking out, wouldn't everything be
dialog: kind of blue? Like, have a blue
dialog: tinge or something?
dialog: (looks around)
dialog: Doesn't. Just looks normal.
text: Thor, handing them drinks, takes a look at Frank’s eyes.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: That’s blue? That color?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Yes. Of course.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Then, what color is that?
text: He points to a leather chair that’s clearly green.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Green.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You’re saying that chair’s green,
dialog: but Frank’s eyes are blue?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: And was color are the walls?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: Also, green.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Huhn.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: You don’t know that?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: How is that possible?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You really think knowing the colors
dialog: is so, so important?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: You’re in college and you don’t
dialog: know colors?... Doesn’t that
dialog: embarrass you?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: No. Why should it? That’s why the
dialog: ‘rents are paying big bucks to send
dialog: me here -- you know, to learn

speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know about you but I don’t
dialog: think anyone should feel
dialog: embarrassed about not knowing
dialog: stuff. What’s embarrassing is
dialog: pretending to know what you don’t --
dialog: or putting other people down just
dialog: because you think they don’t know
dialog: as much as you. I’m happy to admit
dialog: I’m completely ignorant. That’s why
dialog: I’m here and plan to really hit the
dialog: books. So, the next time you see
dialog: me, I’1l1 know more than I do now.
dialog: I’1l be older, but also wiser -- or
dialog: at least know more stuff. For me,
dialog: that’s education.
text: Thor salutes them with his drink.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT’D)
dialog: Cheers.
text: Thor takes a long draught before leaving. Priss and Frank
dialog: watch Thor go.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thor’s great. He’s very clear about

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Come on, Violet, Frank’s a moron.
dialog: You're well rid of him.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Don’t say that.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What, Frank’s not a moron?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You know, Lily, you’re a bit harsh.
dialog: This obsession with “intelligence” —
dialog: - do you think it has some magical
dialog: quality, transforming everything?
dialog: The intelligence line is not an...
dialog: immutable barrier; love can cross
dialog: it. You can love someone whose
dialog: 42.
dialog: mental capacity is not large... I
dialog: know; I have.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well, there’s a mutable barrier
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Frank's stupid, we knew. That he
dialog: was a rat jerk playboy op-er-a-tor
dialog: I hadn’t realized.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I don’t want to turn bitter. I
dialog: worry for Frank -- I care about
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well, I’d stop.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No. I love Frank -- I always will.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: If that’s the case, why not fight
dialog: for him?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Get him back.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No! He’s worthless!
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Against Priss? I’d never win.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sure you would.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Priss, who’s so pretty and sweet?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Priss is a rat. A bitch. A rat-
dialog: bitch.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Don’t blame Priss. She was crushed
text: when her blue-eyed Josh left her.
dialog: (smiles a little crazily)
dialog: I should have known. Of course
dialog: she'd fall for Frank. Josh and
text: Frank are both blue-eyed
text: heartbreakers.
text: Lily looks at Violet as if she were completely delusional.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I wonder if people with blue eyes
dialog: are in fact less kind than other
dialog: people. Blue eyes could represent
text: an icy nature.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Your eyes are blue.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I know, and I’m often shocked at

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well, it’s a title, but the book’s

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Love’s “algebra?” I always thought

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Okay, the title’s not good, but the

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What’s it say?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Well, that while we’re all...
dialog: perverse in our romantic

speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: (to Violet)
dialog: Would you say that you’re

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Omigod! A “tail spin!” She can’t
dialog: even say she’s “depressed” like
dialog: everyone else -- she’s got to say
dialog: something “special.” Priss was
dialog: honest, she was really depressed
dialog: and she had a right to be in the
dialog: show. Now every silly tail-spinner
dialog: is trying to get in!
speaker_heading: FREAK
dialog: The show’s for everyone.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No, it isn’t, Freak! To be
dialog: included in the Center’s programs
dialog: you have to be “clinically
dialog: depressed.” That means that you’ve
dialog: been to a clinic -- and they've
dialog: said that you’re depressed. Have
dialog: you been to a clinic?

speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: For example on that trip she had

dialog: If she didn’t execute this exact

speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Another was to slide her hand
text: across her forehead, trying not to
text: touch her hair or her eyebrows on
dialog: either side --
dialog: (Rose demonstrates)
dialog: -- also repeating it ten times. Any
text: niggling thought she touched a hair
text: on either side, she’d start over.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: My God that’s insane!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Why would she do that?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Well, it was a compulsion.

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What compelled her?
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Was she Catholic?
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes. It does. But I’m not as
dialog: crazy as I was up to yesterday.
dialog: Partly that’s due to the salutary
dialog: effect of scent on the human
dialog: psyche. It’s importance is, I
text: believe, almost incalculable. At

dialog: to use this bar of soap--
text: Violet shows the soap in a see-through plastic zip-lock bag.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: It was provided me as a courtesy as

dialog: economical motel would provide such
dialog: good soap is quite unusual. The
dialog: scent is very precise.
speaker_heading: SHARISE
dialog: Really?
text: Sharise leans forward. Violet cradles the soap in the palm

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No, is it new?

speaker_heading: XAVIER

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: A note Frank left.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Really? Recently?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No -- when we were together. Now

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It's not very important but -- it’s

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What's a “gif”?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It’s one of those little motor

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m sure he meant to write “jiff,”
text: with a “j” -- “back in a jiff.”
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: But he wrote “gif.”
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Could Frank be dyslexic?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No. Dyslexics are intelligent.

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: How thoughtful.
speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Gosh, Violet, you’ve really got to
dialog: stop thinking about Frank.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Why? I don’t want to stop thinking

dialog: thought that cheered me up a lot:
dialog: ...-Life is like a long flowing

dialog: some debris you never expect to see
dialog: again is almost certain to
text: reappear, floating to the

dialog: well be together again one day.
dialog: Maybe it’1ll take many years but

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: I don’t think we’ve spoken about
dialog: this--
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: It's nothing bad. Have you ever
dialog: been to the South of France -- for
dialog: 64.
dialog: example, to the walled city of
dialog: Carcassonne.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’ve never been anywhere.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: But you’ve seen pictures of it?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Uh... No, I don’t think so.
text: He shows her a postcard of Carcassonne.
speaker_heading: LILY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's fascinating, I'd like to visit
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: So you never studied the Cathars?
text: Lily shakes her head.
speaker_heading: XAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: They were a religious movement,
text: very idealistic, located mostly in
dialog: the south of France, that the
dialog: Catholic Church and the royal
text: authorities cruelly repressed. The
dialog: “crusades” were not directed solely
dialog: against the Moslems, there was also
dialog: one against the Cathars.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Really? Why?
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Cathar beliefs and way of life
dialog: threatened the Catholic Church and
dialog: the political authorities of that
dialog: time. Catharism was branded a
text: heresy and brutally repressed.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Omigod, the Catholic Church is,
dialog: like, always bad.
text: Xavier nods.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Ideas can’t be killed as easily as
dialog: people -- especially such
dialog: enlightened ones as the Cathars
dialog: held. In recent years more and more
dialog: people have returned to their
dialog: beliefs.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: So, you’re a Cathar?
dialog: 59
dialog: 60
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Yes. I aspire to be. I’m trying to
dialog: follow the path the Cathars marked
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: That's so impressive. I can tell
dialog: you -- we didn’t have any Cathars
dialog: back home.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: I think you’d be surprised.

speaker_heading: XAVIER
text: Cathars dissent radically from

dialog: procreative sex--
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I should hope so!
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: In the Cathar view the highest form
dialog: of love-making avoids procreation
dialog: entirely.
text: Lily laughs, a little embarrassed:
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Sure -- condoms, right?
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Well, according to Cathar ideas,
dialog: sex with condoms is just a parody
dialog: of the procreative act.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 61
dialog: 62
dialog: 63
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: The standard, cliche, form of
dialog: sexual intercourse is for the man
dialog: to... approach the woman... from
text: “the front.” In Cathar love-making
dialog: -- which, I think you'll find very
dialog: fulfilling -- it’s from the other
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: From the other side?
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Yes.
text: Xavier kisses her tenderly and continues in a near whisper.
speaker_heading: XAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘ll be very careful, we’ll go
dialog: slowly. It’ll be a new experience
dialog: for you but one which I think
dialog: you'll find brings an inexpressible
dialog: closeness...

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Eighth year, impressive. But your
dialog: whole life was a lie -- dressing up
dialog: in suits, buying people drinks?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, the suits -- were real. The
dialog: drinks -- real. And I wasn’t just
dialog: buying drinks for “people” -- they
dialog: were for cute girls: there was a
dialog: perfectly rational, logical, easily-
dialog: explainable agenda.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: So it was a playboy or oper-a-tor

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Of course. Transparently so.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I admire that -- drinks are

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I was just saying that to be

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You can say that about a lot of

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I don’t think he’s crazy.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Making up an entirely fictitious

speaker_heading: HEATHER

dialog: don’t think she’s crazy.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, I am.

speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: This is different. It’s

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’m sure I’ve heard of “Strategic

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: FRED

text: He makes the sound: “Whchht.”
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Before, homosexuality was something

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: FRED

speaker_heading: VIOLET

speaker_heading: XAVIER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: XAVIER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JIMBO

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’m really worried about Thor...
dialog: It’s hard for us to imagine how
dialog: upsetting it is not knowing what
dialog: the colors are.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: In fact it’s impossible for me to
dialog: imagine.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: When Thor sees a rainbow -- it’s
text: only so much gibberish to him.
dialog: There was one this afternoon:
dialog: omigosh he took it hard. Recently
dialog: there was a parade in the city
dialog: where the marchers carried rainbow-
dialog: colored flags and banners --- Thor
dialog: was so upset: he said he’d no idea
dialog: what it meant --
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What kind of retard is he?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: See, that’s the conclusion people
text: immediately jump to.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Well, it’s somewhat understandable.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Not if you knew the full story.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: What’s the full story?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You know how parents love bragging
dialog: about how precocious their children
dialog: are? Thor’s parents had become
dialog: precocity-addicts: constantly
dialog: needing an ever-greater precocity
dialog: “fix.” When he should have entered
dialog: kindergarten, they instead pushed
dialog: him into First Grade. “Oh, Thor
dialog: skipped a grade,” they could tell
dialog: their friends, most of whom were
dialog: terrible precocity-addicts too.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (suddenly alarmed)
dialog: What’s this all about?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What Thor’s parents failed to
dialog: consider was the enormously
dialog: important academic work done in
dialog: nursery school -- key being the
dialog: study of colors, which in Thor’s
dialog: case were -- a complete blank. Can
dialog: you imagine?... I don’t want to be
dialog: too critical of Thor’s parents. I
dialog: suppose they just assumed that
dialog: colors are the sort of knowledge
dialog: people pick up along the way --
dialog: like, for example not stepping on
text: sidewalk cracks.
text: There’s an odd sound.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: I think Rose’s sleeping.
text: A silence, except for the sound of Rose’s breathing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Am I boring?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, not at all. When you’ve
dialog: problems yourself, it’s great to

text: A shocked pause.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: When you said that about depressed

dialog: joking.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m sorry -- you're right. Please
dialog: go on.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m sorry. You know how I am.
dialog: Please continue.
text: On Heather’s face as she struggles with her resentment.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Thor decided he absolutely had to
dialog: learn all the colors, both primary
dialog: and mixed. He’s been hitting the
dialog: books really hard and thought he
dialog: had finally mastered them. Then in
dialog: town today he said “that traffic
dialog: light’s blue.” I had to say, no,
text: it’s green. He was really upset.
dialog: He'd been so sure it was blue.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: The traffic lights in town are sort
dialog: of blue.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: This was a green light --“cross at
dialog: the green, not in-between.”
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yah, we call them “green” but
text: they’re actually more bluish.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: “Bluish” but still green.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, they can be blue. I know it
dialog: sounds strange but--
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Huhn. I don’t know about that.
dialog: Frankly, it’s hard to believe.
dialog: Anyway, we continued walking and a
dialog: naval officer passed us. Thor
text: blurted out, a bit aggressively,
dialog: “his uniform’s black.” I had to
text: correct him. Navy uniforms are
dialog: blue, “navy blue” -- that’s why
dialog: they're called that way. Omigosh,
dialog: he was upset! It was as if he were
text: going to cry.
text: Rose awakes, a little alarmed.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You know, actually, that’s true:
text: navy uniforms are black.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: They're navy blue. That’s the
dialog: color’s name.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, by mistake the Navy received a
dialog: huge shipment of fabric that was
dialog: black, not blue. So as not to
dialog: waste it they decided to sew gold
dialog: braid on and use it -- and found
dialog: that everyone assumed it was blue,
dialog: navy blue, when it was in fact
dialog: black.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Still? Navy uniforms are still
dialog: black?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes -- I believe so.
text: In the dark Heather gets out of bed and starts looking around
dialog: for her clothes and dressing.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’ve got to tell Thor! There’s no

dialog: The D.U. guys think.
speaker_heading: DU GUY
dialog: Uh, beer?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No -- beer’s a downer. Cocktails --
dialog: hard liquor, “spirits” -- is what
dialog: really gives you a lift.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It's interesting what you say. My
dialog: Cousin Jay’s a medical officer in
dialog: 99,
dialog: Philadelphia: he says alcoholism --
dialog: by which I mean chronic, excessive
dialog: consumption of alcohol -- is the
dialog: primary self-administered treatment
dialog: for depression.
speaker_heading: DU GUY
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No. Ultimately it leaves you much

speaker_heading: DU GUY
dialog: Oh no, not me. I just boot, and

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: By “boot,” do you mean “vomit?”
speaker_heading: DU GUY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, none of the effective anti-

dialog: D.U. guy thinks.
speaker_heading: DU GUY
dialog: Hunh.... a treatment for depression
dialog: that doesn’t involve vomiting...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Uh -- hygiene?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Exactly. It’s very important.
dialog: That's why we have such hope in the
dialog: wonder bar. Do you know its scent?
text: They shake their heads. Violet cups in the palms of her

speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, we’ll do the routine... Rose!

dialog: unreliable?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PRISS
dialog: What I’m saying is, I know now I
dialog: should never have gotten involved

dialog: Aren’t you much better off being

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PRISS

speaker_heading: LILY

speaker_heading: VIOLET

dialog: gravity’s laws.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I can just see those guys getting

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I doubt that, to be perfectly,

dialog: No. I love dance crazes.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Gosh, you’re strange...
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Aren’t we already late?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No, it’s later on, like 10 I
dialog: think... I have to confess I’ve
dialog: started losing patience with
dialog: Violet. Depression calls for
dialog: serious treatment -- medication,
dialog: psycho-pharmaceuticals, talk
dialog: therapy--
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: But are those approaches really so
dialog: effective? Despite all the
dialog: medication and therapy, Ed School
text: students are still throwing
dialog: themselves off Robertson Hall.
dialog: Violet’s ideas might seem a little
dialog: off-beat--
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: A little off-beat! Omigod. I
dialog: don’t know how much you know about
dialog: Violet but there’s some pretty
dialog: weird stuff. “Violet,” “Violet
text: Wister” is not even her real name.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It isn’t?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: No. It’s “Emily Tweeter.”
dialog: Apparently when she was eleven
dialog: years old she went completely crazy
dialog: and has had several relapses since,
dialog: so it’s a little worrisome to have
dialog: her counsel nearly suicidal
dialog: individuals-
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: “Emily Tweeter” -- in First Grade I
dialog: had an enormous crush on a girl
dialog: with that name.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You remember that?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Yeah. It was pretty huge, Dr.
dialog: Zhivago stuff. Any idea or even
dialog: mention of her filled me with
dialog: emotion. Admittedly I had a very
dialog: strange perspective on the world
dialog: then; I don’t think my brain was
dialog: fully formed or functioning
dialog: properly -- everything was a bit of
text: a dream. Then a bizarre thing
dialog: happened. I was torn about whether
dialog: to shout my passion from the roof
dialog: tops or keep it secret. Ina sort
dialog: of compromise I wrote Emily’s name,
text: in crayon, on a scrap of paper,
dialog: then carefully hid it in my
dialog: 111.
dialog: bookcase where no one else could
dialog: possibly find it. So, my secret
dialog: was expressed but, ostensibly, safe
dialog: -- I'd no idea of the weird and
dialog: inexplicable events that would
dialog: follow.
text: Lily looks a little worried.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Two years afterwards I was walking
text: up the street a couple of blocks
dialog: from my house when I spotted a slip
text: of paper lying, face up, on the
dialog: sidewalk near someone’s trash --
dialog: the name “Emily Tweeter” written on
text: it in crayon in my own child-like
dialog: handwriting.
text: He stares into Lily’s eyes with an expression of total
text: bafflement and candor.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT’D)
dialog: It was completely, utterly weird.
dialog: How could my secret, so well
dialog: hidden, come to land on the
dialog: sidewalk of Henderson Drive?
text: Lily tries to help him.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Could, uh--
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No. I’ve thought long and hard
dialog: about it -- there’s no rational
dialog: explanation. This was my first
dialog: encounter with the bizarre and
dialog: inexplicable. When I later learned
dialog: about the Bermuda Triangle and
dialog: other such mysterious phenomena, I
dialog: knew it was probably all true as
dialog: I'd had this early brush with the
text: uncanny. From a very young age it
dialog: became clear to me that rationalism
dialog: cannot explain life’s deepest
dialog: mysteries.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: And you think this girl was Violet?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I have to say I didn’t recognize
dialog: her. She was very young then. Do
dialog: you have any idea if Violet might
dialog: 111
dialog: 112.
dialog: have attended Willamette
dialog: Montessori?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: In Portland?
text: Fred nods. The barman arrives with a tray of cocktails --
dialog: much to their surprise.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We didn’t order these.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
text: Compliments of the guy at the bar.
text: Lily and Fred look toward the bar -- Xavier, wearing a suit,
text: nods to them.
scene_heading: INT. THE CORNER BAR -- NIGHT 111
text: Shortly after, Xavier is with them in the booth.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: +..It was so brutal how it ended
dialog: between us. I know I was too angry
dialog: and a bit, crazy but I thought what
dialog: we had was stronger than that. That
dialog: you would not just walk away after
dialog: one disagreement. With all we had
dialog: been through, couldn’t you have
dialog: just forgiven me...
text: Lily says nothing for a few moments.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: It wasn’t just that...
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Oh, you mean, my Cathar beliefs?
text: Lily nods. Xavier is a little emotional.
speaker_heading: XAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I am no longer a Cathar.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: How’s that possible?
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: It's been very difficult.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: You’ve entirely dropped your
dialog: adherence to the Cathar faith?
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Yes. I have.
dialog: 112
dialog: 113
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Good. Normally I'd be reluctant to
dialog: comment on anyone’s religion...
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I’m sorry, I guess I’m a bit of a
dialog: bigot -- I could never take
dialog: seriously a religion that worships
dialog: on Tuesdays. All the major
dialog: religions require worship on the
dialog: weekend -- Friday, Saturday or
dialog: Sunday. I find it really laudatory
dialog: that people should sacrifice their
dialog: weekend time to Worship God...
text: He checks his watch.
speaker_heading: XAVIER
dialog: Having sabbath on Tuesday always
dialog: seemed very bizarre to me. It is
dialog: not right.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We'd better get to the Lone Star--
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Why are you so concerned about
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: It’s not as if international dance
dialog: crazes start every day.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWN STREET -- NIGH 112
text: Fred, Lily and Xavier hurry down the sidewalk -- semi-
dialog: Jogging.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: We better hurry.
text: They pick up the pace. Lily seems a little less keen on
dialog: getting to their destination --
scene_heading: EXT. LONE STAR -- NIGHT 113
text: The three approach the Lone Star, just as Rose, Heather,
text: Violet and Jimbo come out looking downcast.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: What’s wrong?
dialog: 114
dialog: 115
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Another fiasco.
scene_heading: INT. GIRLS ROOM -- NIGHT 114
text: All four are in bed in the dark.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Sometimes our struggle reminds me
dialog: of the Myth of Sisyphus.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: The myth about the guy who pushes
text: an enormous rock up a hill, only to
dialog: have it keep rolling back down
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh yeah. What a knucklehead. The
dialog: important thing to remember is that
dialog: he was mythical -- he never really
dialog: existed.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Violet, did you spend any part of
dialog: your education at a school called
dialog: Willamette Montessori?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: In Oregon? Why?
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE COTTAGE -- DAY 115
text: Thor, Jimbo, and the girls huddled inside on a drab day; they
text: glance at Fred who speaks on his phone on the Coffee
text: Cottage’s porch -- a drizzle falls outside.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Would you say that today is “very
dialog: gray?”
text: Jimbo looks around.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: I'd say so. Maybe “blue-gray.”
text: Thor looks around, trying to factor this in. Fred finishes
text: the call and comes in.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: I’m sorry, her name wasn’t “Emily
dialog: Tweeter” but “Lucy Wurlitzer.” I
dialog: 115.
dialog: know they're not very similar: I’m
dialog: beginning to realize that the human
dialog: memory is not the foolproof
dialog: instrument we sometimes imagine.
dialog: What’s worse it seems everyone knew
dialog: all about my obsession, including
dialog: my parents and siblings --
dialog: precisely those from whom I most
dialog: wanted it kept.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: So from your earliest years you
dialog: were already a playboy or oper-a-
dialog: tor type.
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Yes. I suppose that’s why secrecy
dialog: seemed so desirable.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Violet, can I talk to you?
text: Lily, having silently followed all this, stands and nods to
text: Violet, who gets up too. As they walk to the coffee counter,
text: Lily whispers to her confidentially.
speaker_heading: LILY (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s the plural of doufus?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Doufi.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Not doufuses?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You can say either: “doufi”
dialog: respects the Latin root and so is
dialog: preferred. “Doufuses” is also
dialog: correct, although a bit inelegant.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: You’ve thought a lot about this.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes. I’ve had to.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Hmmm.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: What? What is it?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I like Fred -- he’s a nice guy and
dialog: I can see why you like him... Any
dialog: mass of people, such as you might
dialog: find in a large university or high
dialog: school, divides into many different
dialog: 116
dialog: 117
dialog: 118
dialog: 119
dialog: 116.
dialog: groups. Normally there’s a “cool
dialog: crowd,” and then variously less
dialog: cool crowds. When I first met you
dialog: and Rose, I thought you were the
dialog: “cool crowd” -- and, in many ways,
dialog: you are. I find your perfume and
dialog: fashion sense excellent.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Thank you!
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: But...there’s a reason, I think,
dialog: why you are so strongly attracted
dialog: to doufi. And it’s not an
dialog: accident. How different groups
dialog: divide up...
text: While Lily speaks Violet notices something.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (0.S.)
dialog: Thor! No!
scene_heading: EXT. COFFEE COTTAGE -- DAY 116
text: They turn in time to see Thor run into the street followed by
text: Heather. The sun is out and its rays, bouncing off the dark
text: clouds still hanging in the sky, create an exquisite lighting
text: effect. Everyone follows them into the street. In the
dialog: distance a rainbow has formed -- this is what panicked
text: Heather. Thor runs hell for leather toward the beautiful
text: arc, Heather after him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Thor! No! Stop! Please, stop!
text: TIGHT ON: Thor’s face as he runs, torn with emotion.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: He’s headed for Robertson Hall!
scene_heading: EXT. ROBERTSON HALL -- DAY 117
text: Thor disappears inside.
scene_heading: INT. ROBERTSON HALL -- DAY 118
text: Thor runs up the stairs, Heather behind.
scene_heading: EXT. ROBERTSON ROOF -- DAY 119
text: Thor runs toward the balustrade, Heather comes up from the
text: stairs, almost too winded to call:
speaker_heading: 119A
dialog: 117.
text: At the balustrade Thor stops for a moment and gazes at the
text: rainbow in its terrifying splendor. He points first to the
text: topmost band of color, then each succeeding one:
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Red!... Orange! Yellow!... Green!
dialog: Blue! Indigo! Violet!...
dialog: Hallelujah, Lord God, thank you!
text: Heather reaches him and they embrace, gazing at the rainbow
text: together, Thor’s face wet with tears of joy.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT’D)
dialog: Education! We can learn the
dialog: subjects we set out to master, no
dialog: matter how hard or impossible they
dialog: may seem. Thank you! Thank you --
dialog: I wasn't sure I was going to make
dialog: it!
text: Together they look to the rainbow horizon. Thor studies and
text: nods his head again toward it, proud of his new competence.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Magenta... Pink... Mauve...
scene_heading: EXT. SEVEN OAKS -- DAY 119A
text: Rose and Violet, thoughtful, study together on benches.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I miss my nice American friend.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: No, you're mistaken.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Oh come on, you go to London for
dialog: four weeks--
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It’s very dangerous, parents
dialog: letting their children travel.
text: They see them off at the airport
dialog: and don’t know what they’1ll be
dialog: getting back.
text: Rose reflects on this.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I don’t know what you’re referring
dialog: to.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You’re not from London.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I’m from London. I was there, and
dialog: now I’m here. I’m “from” London.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I just miss my nice American
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Nice.
dialog: (caricatures a nasal
dialog: American accent)
dialog: “Nice. Nice. Fine. ‘Fine.’”
dialog: (reverts to type)
dialog: Those are not adjectives I like to
dialog: use. God gave us abilities -- he
dialog: requires that we use them: “Good.
dialog: Better. Best.” “Excelsior!
dialog: Higher!” Only excellence can
dialog: glorify the Lord. Vulgarity is, in
dialog: essence, blasphemous.

dialog: In the Matter of the Doufi
scene_heading: 120 EXT. QUADRANGLE -- DAY 120
text: Lily and Violet come down a path, both in frilly “Damsels”
dialog: costumes.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I’m sorry what I was saying before -
dialog: - of course you’re not
dialog: irretrievably linked to the doufi
dialog: or even that such distinctions are
dialog: valid--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, don’t apologize -- I probably
dialog: do have a “doufi” orientation. But
text: behind “coolness” isn’t there a
text: certain repressing, squashing down
dialog: or at lack of cultivation of one’s
dialog: humanity?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Oh, so you think cool people have
dialog: less humanity?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: No, of course not, I don’t think
dialog: cool people are entirely inhuman --
dialog: just enough to be cool.
dialog: 121
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: In our society there’s all this
dialog: propaganda in favor of uniqueness,
dialog: eccentricity, etc, but does the
dialog: world really want or need more of
dialog: such traits? Aren’t such people
dialog: usually terrible pains in the neck?
dialog: What the world needs to work
text: properly is a large mass of normal
dialog: people -- I'd like to be one of
dialog: those -- sorry.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But you will still do the part?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yeah. Of course.

dialog: Dress Rehearsal
scene_heading: INT. SUICIDE CENTER -- DAY 121
text: In the long dance mirror first Lily then Violet appear, in
text: their extravagant costumes for the musical.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Omigod we look ridiculous.
text: Violet looks at their reflection, serene.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Yes. I think that’s good.
text: They disappear from frame. Cut to Freak cueing the music on
text: the Suicide Center stereo system. The first notes of the
text: “Damsels” overture begin.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT’D)
dialog: So do you know every number from
dialog: every Fred Astaire movie?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: No, there were two in our school
dialog: musical. I know those.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But did performing those two
dialog: numbers help you overcome
dialog: adolescent feelings of
dialog: discouragement and despair?
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: Absolutely.
dialog: 122
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (calls)
dialog: Freak!
text: Freak responds to her signal, pressing “play” on the stereo
text: boombox. The song starts -- Fred begins the quiet lyric:
speaker_heading: FRED
dialog: If I should suddenly start to sing,
dialog: Or stand on my head or anything,
dialog: Don't think that I've lost my
dialog: senses,
dialog: It's just that my happiness finally

text: Fred takes Violet’s hand and leads her out of the building.
speaker_heading: FRED (CONT’D)
text: The long, long ages of dull despair

dialog: Become the happiest guy alive--
scene_heading: EXT. QUADRANGLE -- DAY 122
text: Fred and Violet emerge from the drab building into the more
dialog: glorious world of a Seven Oaks version movie musical --
text: Violet joins him in song.
speaker_heading: VIOLET & FRED
dialog: Things are looking up
dialog: I've been looking the landscape
dialog: over
text: And it's covered with 4 leaf clover
dialog: Oh things are looking up
dialog: Since love looked up at me!
dialog: Bitter was my cup
dialog: But no more will I be the mourner
dialog: For I've certainly turned the
dialog: corner
dialog: Oh things are looking up Since love
dialog: looked up at me
text: Others from the cast move in behind them, with some pairing
text: off -- Lily with Xavier, Thor with Heather, Frank and Freak
dialog: with Rose, Jimbo with Priss:
speaker_heading: ENSEMBLE
dialog: See the sunbeams
dialog: Every one beams
dialog: Just because of you
dialog: Love's in session
dialog: And my depression

speaker_heading: DOAR DORM CHORUS
dialog: Things are looking up
dialog: It's a great little world we live

dialog: Oh we're happy as pups
dialog: Since love looked up at us.
text: The song continues, then as the music fades an “iris” fade
text: out of the image -- then partially re-opens:
text: CLOSE UP of a smiling Violet -- lighting, location and
text: costume are dark and atmospheric. The music to a future hit
dialog: dance song starts:
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: (a big smile)
dialog: Hey, everybody! Let’s--
scene_heading: INT. THE LONE STAR/DANCE LOCALE -- NIGHT 123
text: The music goes full blast, the iris opens fully: Violet is in
text: a dance locale, perhaps the Lone Star with better lighting:
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: do the -- “Sam-bo-la!”
text: To the dance hit’s irresistible beat, Violet does the
text: “Sambola” -- soon joined by the others, except Rose -- the
text: camera moves among the dancers a la “American Bandstand.”
text: Rose sits, watching critically. Jimbo goes to her.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: You’re not dancing?
text: Rose shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Looks to me like just another...
dialog: Devil Dance. I’m waiting for a
dialog: dance of truth, and beauty, and
dialog: righteousness. A dance that
dialog: glorifies, not the body, but the
dialog: Lord.
speaker_heading: JIMBO
dialog: Wow. You might have a long wait...
text: Credits roll: Subsequently Freak’s partner tires -- he
text: invites Rose to dance; she drops her resistance and joins in
dialog: with great skill.
