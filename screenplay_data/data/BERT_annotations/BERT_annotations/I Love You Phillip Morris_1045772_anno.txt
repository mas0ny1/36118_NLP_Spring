dialog: WHY YOU ABANDONED ME AND KEPT YOUR OTHER
text: TWO CHILDREN! I WAS THE MIDDLE CHILD!

dialog: of things...

speaker_heading: PRODUCE MANAGER

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well... it's not Christian.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Not Christian? Why's that?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: This is not what the Lord wants.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So you're saying you know what the Lord
dialog: wants?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No. I would never say that. Why? Do you
dialog: think this is what he wants?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It's the leap of faith Deb. It's the not

dialog: was no way I was going there. I had a
dialog: plan.
text: He continues to CRY uncontrollably as he raises a

speaker_heading: KEMPLE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Did you know Steven was wanted?
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: Not until just now.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: He likes to keep little secrets
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: Like the fact that he was a big queer?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Yeah, like that.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: But suicide, my god.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well he does tend to overreact.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: I feel like I don't even know him.
dialog: "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 25.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not

dialog: searching, at least that's how I figure
dialog: it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is
dialog: he's looking for.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: (to cop)
dialog: Can you tell me exactly what he did?
text: As they CONTINUE TO TALK, they fail to notice Steven

speaker_heading: COP
text: He has several warrants out in Texas.
dialog: Fraud, forgery, embezzlement...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: I should have known... I should have said
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the
dialog: same thing. There were always signs. I
dialog: should have known he was gay when he
text: started shaving his chest.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: That would be a warning sign...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And all that Peter Allen music on his
dialog: Walkman.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel
dialog: so bad now.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I just never thought. But now stealing?
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: He's probably been doing it for years. I
dialog: say to myself he did it just to buy me
dialog: things but I don't think that's true.
dialog: "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 26.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It's bigger than that. I'm sure.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: But why then?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And why suicide? I mean- just like that?
text: After that, he dresses and walks out the door behind
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: I know- he seemed so happy and--

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

scene_heading: 39 EXT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL PARKING STRUCTURE - 1992 - DAY 39

speaker_heading: KEMPLE
dialog: Steven!!! Stop!

speaker_heading: KEMPLE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (upbeat)
dialog: You're gonna catch a beating any day now,

text: watch, then approaches her.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in

scene_heading: 86 INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM, 1995 - DAY 86
text: STEVEN'S POV: A beautifully ornate courthouse LIGHT
text: FIXTURE hangs from a courthouse ceiling.
text: ON STEVEN, staring up at it with admiration.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (O.S.)
dialog: Mister Russell?
text: Steven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting JUDGE.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It's a beautiful fixture.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: I know. It's your turn.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Oh...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage
dialog: service in good faith and was given an
dialog: inferior product. She is entitled to deem
dialog: that work to be unacceptable according to
dialog: the contract that Mr. Evans signed.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: The terms of that contract were ambiguous
dialog: at best. The truth is, defendant engaged
dialog: my client for three years without full
dialog: payment.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Your honor I have, in my briefcase,
dialog: fourteen other contracts, all on public
dialog: record, in which Mr. Evans entered into
dialog: litigation with past clients of his!
text: Eudora glances into Steven's opened BRIEFCASE. It
text: contains only a SANDWICH and a PHOTO OF PHILLIP.
dialog: "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 54.
text: The shocked LAWYER turns to his client (EVANS).
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Is this true?
speaker_heading: EVANS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: You're making me look like an idiot.
text: He regroups and addresses the judge.
speaker_heading: LAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: Your honor, I don't have to tell you that
dialog: none of this is admissable or applicable
text: to the case at hand. Mr. Russell's
dialog: histrionics do not erase the fact that
text: his client is in breech of contract.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have
dialog: to say?
text: Steven is stonewalled. He looks to Eudora as if to say,
text: "What do I do now?" and it terrifies her.
text: Desperate, Steven bangs his fist on the table and looks
text: resolutely to the judge.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I demand to be seen in chambers!!
text: The judge and lawyer seem mystified by this response.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Okaaaaaaaay...
scene_heading: 87 INT. HOUSTON JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, 1995 - DAY 87
text: The Lawyer sits impatiently while Steven peruses a wall
text: of plaques, photos and diplomas. He focuses on a law

text: PHOTO of the judge as a YOUNG MAN on a farm. He's from
dialog: humble roots.
text: A moment later, the Judge enters.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Okay gentlemen, let's get this over with,

text: at five o'clock.
dialog: "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 55.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: This seems to be cut and dried here, sir.
dialog: I don't even know why we're back here.
dialog: Mister Russell is treating this like an
text: episode of Matlock.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken
dialog: man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't
dialog: go to Yale. My education was modest. I
dialog: went to a small school. I grew up on a
dialog: small farm. But I passed the same bar
dialog: exam as my colleague here and I am not
dialog: going to let him push around this humble
dialog: woman.
text: This scores with the judge.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Point taken Mister Russell...
text: He glares at the other lawyer with scorn.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...but where are you going with this?
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I think it's obvious where I'm going with
dialog: this sir.
text: A long SILENCE. The Judge waits and waits until something
text: occurs to him.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?
text: Steven doesn't know what this means... But the other
text: lawyer does. And he's not happy.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Shit...
text: Seeing this, Steven puffs with confidence.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Your honor, that's exactly what I'm

speaker_heading: STEVEN (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah?

speaker_heading: PHILLIP (O.S.)
dialog: That birthday cake you got me in the pen?

speaker_heading: STEVEN (O.S.)

speaker_heading: PHILLIP (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, I know. But how?

speaker_heading: STEVEN (O.S.)

speaker_heading: PHILLIP (O.S.)

speaker_heading: STEVEN (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah, that's him.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP (O.S.)
dialog: Oh he was such an asshole.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (O.S.)
dialog: Actually- I was in the yard once. Another
dialog: guard asked him to pay him back five. He
dialog: opened his wallet and I saw this picture
text: of a little girl about Steffie's age. So
dialog: I brought it up to him once, just to get
dialog: him talking. That's the thing about
dialog: having kids, you know? Gets people
dialog: talking. Shared experience. Builds
dialog: bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he
dialog: tells me he's worried about her- mamma
dialog: was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I
dialog: just listened. That's all. I brought up
dialog: the candles just one time but mostly just
dialog: listened... And the next day, bedtime,

speaker_heading: PHILLIP

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.O.)
dialog: With Phillip I felt strong. I felt

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Were you a spaceman?
speaker_heading: LINDHOLM
dialog: Yep. Never got out there though. NASA's

speaker_heading: LINDHOLM
text: Ass gasket.
dialog: (draws on his coffee)

speaker_heading: LINDHOLM (CONT'D)
dialog: With the popularity of HMO's in today's
dialog: health care system, doctors need help
dialog: managing their billing-- so they can
dialog: focus on their patients. That's where
text: USA Medical Management comes in. Hundreds
dialog: of millions of dollars pass through our
text: system from the HMO's to the doctors.
dialog: It's a critical business. A powerful
dialog: business...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So when I read your resume, I wasn't sure
dialog: what to think. Your level of education
dialog: and your past experience would factor
dialog: heavily into this decision and frankly...
text: Steven deflates in expectation.
speaker_heading: LINDHOLM (CONT'D)

scene_heading: 99 INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY 99
text: An uptight assistant (RHEBA) leads Steven into his fancy

speaker_heading: RHEBA

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: That's fine... sure.

speaker_heading: RHEBA
dialog: I pulled all the claims for the last two

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Crossover from traditional markets shows

speaker_heading: BIRKHEIM
dialog: Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've

speaker_heading: BIRKHEIM

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well I did a lot of work here and uh... I

dialog: to you but uh... it might be better to
dialog: just uh...
text: The group looks at him quizzically. Just as it seems
dialog: Steven has been up to nothing--
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I'll just show you. Todd?
text: TODD, an incredibly hot assistant unveils an easel full
text: of detailed tables. Steven walks the board through an
dialog: incredibly well prepared presentation.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: If you look here at Mark's projections
dialog: again for Q3, you'll see- well you'll see
dialog: they're just that- projections.
dialog: Projections based on a model set by my
dialog: predecessor. I decided to reject that
dialog: model and do things a little differently.
dialog: I want to show you my results. This is
dialog: what we actually made in Q3--
text: Todd flips to the next card. The graphs GROW
text: exponentially. The group is intrigued.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now let me tell you how I did it...
text: Todd unveils another card, the men are impressed by the

text: He opens ANOTHER. He chews and reads- "Commit random acts

text: Again he's touched and puts it on the refrigerator.
text: He opens ANOTHER and pops the candy in his mouth. He
dialog: reads- "A smile is a flower on your face"

speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe it was because it's just my nature,
dialog: or maybe it was because of my past... or
dialog: maybe it was because they were the most

speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But in the time between receiving the

scene_heading: 116 INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY 116
text: At his desk, Steven leafs through the company finances.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.O.)
dialog: It occurred to me to set up an investment
dialog: account where the held money would earn
dialog: interest for the short time that the
dialog: company had it. We're talking twenty two
dialog: million at any given time here, so even
dialog: short term the interest adds up pretty
dialog: quickly. I'd be making the company
text: millions virtually overnight.
text: He leans back to think to himself.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.O.)
dialog: ...and I of course would take a

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: So I ask, "Don't you think that's a

dialog: "Yes it is, now what's your final

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Because if there is, stop now.
speaker_heading: STEVEN
text: There isn't. There's nothing.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP

speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay... mmm hmm...

scene_heading: 162 INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY 162

speaker_heading: HOUSTON JUDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine. You can have your hearing tomorrow.

speaker_heading: STEVEN

speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I'm sorry about that- they weren't

dialog: "I Love You Phillip Morris" Green Pages 5-23-08 99.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: From the moment we met, you've done
dialog: nothing but lie. Our whole

dialog: asshole. You took advantage of me- just
dialog: like all the rest of them. You were
dialog: supposed to protect me- but you've done
dialog: nothing but make a fool of me. And you
dialog: expect me to love you? How can I love
dialog: you? I don't even know who you are. And

speaker_heading: STEVEN (V.O.)
dialog: But the hardest part by far is getting

dialog: It's standard procedure for late stage

dialog: have to take me back, I just want to say
dialog: one thing.
text: Phillip is listening.
speaker_heading: STEVEN (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you thought we were nothing but a

dialog: was always something that was real. I
dialog: thought about what you said to me. You
dialog: said you don't know who I am. But I have
dialog: to tell you- I know now. I know who I
dialog: am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a
dialog: CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an
