text: A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an

text: They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they

text: THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past
text: the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows,
text: weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.
text: THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF
text: where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY,
text: PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler,
text: gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH
text: over the edge.
text: AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE

scene_heading: C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK --
text: The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY
text: HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour.
text: In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a
text: MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet
text: and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage.
text: One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward
text: seven o'clock.
text: IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a
text: MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and
dialog: down.
text: Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop
text: where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine.
text: The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL
text: LURCH appears and begins sweeping.
text: Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the

dialog: of the clock.

dialog: Think of it, Thing. He's been gone

dialog: five years we've attempted to
dialog: contact Fester in the great
dialog: beyond...
text: The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine
text: to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the
dialog: doorway.
text: The room has remained untouched since Fester's
text: disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust
text: and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth
text: - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports
text: trophies, a high school photo with all the other students
text: keeping as much distance from Fester as possible.
text: As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room:
speaker_heading: GOMEZ
dialog: ... And for twenty-five years,
text: nothing. Not a whisper, not a
dialog: clue. I'm beginning to think my
dialog: my brother truly is lost.

text: are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is
text: offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair

text: This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has
dialog: every chance of growing up to be the public monster his
dialog: parents would be proud of.

speaker_heading: MORTICIA
dialog: Darling, take care!

speaker_heading: GOMEZ
dialog: Dirty pool, old man. Never again!
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: This is for keeps, Gomez! Not
dialog: just doubloons!
text: Tully feints, then slashes - shredding the front of Gomez's
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: GOMEZ
dialog: One for you, Tully, and...
text: Gomez ATTACKS - HIS BLADE FLASHING LIKE LIGHTNING. In a
text: blur of action, Tully's sword is knocked from his hand and
text: he's sent tumbling backwards, finally landing on his knees.
speaker_heading: GOMEZ
dialog: ... one for me!
text: Tully looks up at Gomez with cowardly, pleading eyes.
speaker_heading: TULLY

speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: (to Gomez)
dialog: That's right! Now get moving -
text: Addams, take him to the vault.
dialog: And if you're not back in one
dialog: hour...
dialog: (the pistol aimed
dialog: at Morticia, and
dialog: using her accent)
dialog: I displace her.
text: Gomez is near enough now to take Morticia's hand, on the

speaker_heading: GOMEZ
dialog: Tish - seeing you like this. My
text: blood boils.
speaker_heading: MORTICIA
dialog: As does mine.

speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your
dialog: feet! You disgust me - you're nothing
dialog: but a useless, snivelling baby! A
dialog: stone around my neck! What was I
dialog: thinking - I should've left you where
dialog: I found you!
text: At Abigail's final words, Fester suddenly LEAPS FORWARD.
speaker_heading: FESTER
dialog: No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong
dialog: book!
speaker_heading: CLOSE UP
text: Gomez's hand is on the right book, "Greed," but Fester
text: stops him from pulling it.
speaker_heading: FESTER
dialog: Allow me...
text: Gomez looks into Fester's eyes -- realizing what he's
text: about to do.
speaker_heading: GOMEZ
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: Good show, old man...
text: Fester reaches for a DIFFERENT BOOK -- "Hurricane Irene:

speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I'm your friend, Gordon - think

speaker_heading: FESTER

speaker_heading: MORTICIA
dialog: Quickly, my darling!

speaker_heading: MORTICIA

speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Keep the book closed, Gordon -
dialog: listen to mother!
speaker_heading: FESTER
dialog: I'll never listen to you - not
dialog: ever again!
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: I had to be strict with you -

speaker_heading: FESTER

text: Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window.
text: Then he blasts Abigail out as well.
text: ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed",

dialog: force winds.
speaker_heading: GOMEZ
dialog: (calling out to Fester)
dialog: Old man! This way!
text: ANGLE ON THING, across the room, struggling across the

text: etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle
text: and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and

speaker_heading: CHILDREN

text: The family is busily decorating the house for their annual

text: yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the
text: chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o-
text: lanterns. Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from
text: the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are
text: clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with
text: cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters
text: and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe
text: paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each
text: holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and
text: the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans
text: against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat.
text: A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the

text: Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony. Morticia hands
dialog: him a decoration.

speaker_heading: GRANNY
