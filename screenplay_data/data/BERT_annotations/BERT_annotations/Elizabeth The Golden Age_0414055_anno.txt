speaker_heading: S/I CAPTION:

dialog: God.)
dialog: May 1 Blue Draft--p.2
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/SALON, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY
dialog: 3 3
text: Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out
text: into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the
text: chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On
text: his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his
text: mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as
text: he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS
text: fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest
text: salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered;
text: among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he
text: enters, all kneel.
text: His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling,
text: heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the
text: plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the
text: face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all.
speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: (God has made his will known to
dialog: me. The time for our great
dialog: enterprise has come.)
text: The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but
text: disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: At last.
text: Cathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard
text: through the open windows.
text: The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony.

dialog: 4 4
text: Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the
text: great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and
text: the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The
text: Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him.
text: Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns
text: of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's
dialog: power.
text: Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the
text: crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's
text: eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his
text: people's adoration.
scene_heading: EXT. THAMES - DAY
dialog: 5 5
text: A ripple of light on the water. A blur of approaching
dialog: colour.
dialog: May 1 Blue Draft--p.3
text: The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape:
text: its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful
text: fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting
text: bright shards of shining water in the sunlight.
speaker_heading: P
text: eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling,
text: cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out.
text: Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than
text: any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something
text: chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the
dialog: Queen.
text: They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE.
text: Over this an insistent voice:
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.)
dialog: Why do you go among the people,
dialog: majesty? I tell you plainly, you
dialog: will be murdered! Every Catholic
dialog: in England is a potential
dialog: assassin!

dialog: try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation:
text: SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, 30s, an ambitious courtier; LORD
text: HOWARD, 50s, a weathered old campaigner; and standing back
text: from the rest, watching from the side lines, SIR FRANCIS
text: WALSINGHAM, the Queen's veteran friend and adviser.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HATTON
dialog: Be warned by the atrocities in
dialog: France! God-fearing Christians
text: murdered by Papist cut-throats
dialog: inflamed by hatred of the truth!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: We know the Catholics take their
dialog: orders from Spain. The Spanish
dialog: speak openly of Mary Stuart as
dialog: 
dialog: Queen of England in waiting.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (sharply)
text: Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out
dialog: by her own ungrateful nation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HATTON
dialog: With respect, majesty - a
dialog: 
dialog: Catholic Queen. Your loyal
dialog: Protestant supporters don't
dialog: understand why Mary Stuart lives
dialog: 
dialog: under our protection, at our
dialog: expense - very considerable
dialog: expense -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mary Stuart is my cousin. She is
dialog: our guest. And she is under our
dialog: control.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: But while she lives, majesty, she
dialog: is a beacon that draws our
text: enemies' eyes and hopes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: While she lives?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HATTON
text: She is the poison at the heart of
dialog: England. The poison must be cut
dialog: out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 4A
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You'd have me make a martyr of
dialog: her. What is her crime?

text: The Londoners on the river bank cheer and wave as the royal

speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (V.O.)
dialog: How many Catholics are there in
dialog: England, sir?
speaker_heading: HOWARD (V.O.)
dialog: Immense numbers, majesty!

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What would you have me do? `Cut
dialog: out' half the people of England?
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: We must act, majesty. Our
dialog: inaction is taken to be weakness.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: If any of my people break the
dialog: 
dialog: law, they will be punished. Until
dialog: that day, I wish them to be let
dialog: them alone.
speaker_heading: HATTON
dialog: Until the day they rise in
dialog: rebellion! Majesty, we have
dialog: proven reason to fear every
dialog: Catholic in the land -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Fear creates fear, sir. I will
dialog: not punish my people for their
dialog: beliefs. Only for their deeds.
dialog: am assured that the people of
dialog: England love their Queen. My
dialog: constant endeavour is to earn
dialog: that love.

speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What people?
speaker_heading: 5A
speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM
dialog: Your bishops are preaching that
text: God is showing his displeasure-
dialog: the Queen being still unmarried -
dialog: some are saying infertile -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What nonsense!
speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM
dialog: Dangerous nonsense. Mary Stuart
dialog: has a son -
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why does everyone torment me with
dialog: 
dialog: Mary Stuart?
dialog: Pink Revision May 18- p.6
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH(cont'd)
dialog: It's not her fault that she's

dialog: (to Bess)
dialog: Don't hide your face.
text: She leans over to brush a stray lock of hair from Bess's
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM
dialog: So long as you have no issue.
text: Elizabeth looks back at Wsalsingham.
speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM
dialog: Produce an heir and there'll be
dialog: no more talk of Mary Stuart.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Isn't it customary to obtain a
dialog: 
dialog: husband before producing an heir?
dialog: (to Bess)
dialog: We shall have to look out a
dialog: husband for you soon, Bess.
speaker_heading: BESS
dialog: Not too soon, my lady.
speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM
dialog: There are husbands to be had.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (to Bess)
dialog: 
dialog: Don't you want to be married?
speaker_heading: BESS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM
dialog: Austria. France. Sweden.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why stop there? Turkey has a
dialog: Sultan. China has an Emperor.
dialog: (to Bess)
dialog: What sort of man do you want?
speaker_heading: WALSINGHAM
dialog: I confine myself to the possible.
speaker_heading: BESS
text: An honest man. With friendly
text: eyes.
dialog: May 1 Blue Draft7
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (to Walsingham)
dialog: That's where you and I differ,
dialog: Walsingham. I find the impossible
dialog: far more interesting.
dialog: (to Bess)
dialog: And good legs. You'll want good
dialog: legs.
speaker_heading: BESS
text: And sweet breath.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: So that you can kiss him without

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: And they know very well that if I
text: fall, they all come tumbling down
dialog: after me.
text: She goes on to the steps at the foot of the altar, and

text: accompanied by a mounted entourage.
text: IN THE CARRIAGE - The king, Philip II, the Infanta and
dialog: Father Robert Reston.
speaker_heading: PHILIP

speaker_heading: P
text: hilip surveys the scene through the carriage window with a

speaker_heading: PHILIP
dialog: Every tree that falls hurts me. I

speaker_heading: RESTON

text: WIDE NOW - We see the carriage and the royal party crest a

speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: My Queen.

dialog: That's enough, Annette.
dialog: (But she loves it.)
dialog: Slit her throat? Please.
speaker_heading: ANNETTE
dialog: And when the bastard usurper is
dialog: dead, my lady will be queen.
text: The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning.
text: The Warden of Chartley Hall, SIR AMYAS PAULET, enters the

text: him at once with a teasing smile.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Here's my noble jailer, come to
dialog: smack my hand.
text: She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds

speaker_heading: PAULET
dialog: No, no, my lady. Unless beauty is

speaker_heading: ARMOURER (O.O.V.)
dialog: So what's it for, my young

dialog: I'm guessing.
speaker_heading: SAVAGE

dialog: Tell our master one of the circle
dialog: has already gained access to the

speaker_heading: RALEIGH
