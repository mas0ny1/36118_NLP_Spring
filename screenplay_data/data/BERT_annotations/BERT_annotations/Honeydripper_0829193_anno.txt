text: We hear a strange, single, BENT NOTE.
scene_heading: 1 EXT. SHARECROPPER SHACK - ECU FINGERS - LATE AFTERNOON 1
text: We follow a small boy's FINGERS on a strange contraption-
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: SCRATCH, 10 years old, has a `DIDDLEY BOW', a piece of baling
text: wire nailed to the side of the unpainted shack so it is
text: stretched taut. He moves an old corn cob under it as a fret
text: and makes TWANGY, pitch-shifting NOTES as he plucks the wire.
text: His friend LONNIE stands moving his fingers over a BOARD he
text: has laid on the side of the porch floor. A few scrawny
text: CHICKENS run around in the yard behind them-
speaker_heading: LONNIE
dialog: Leave off with that, Scratch.
speaker_heading: SCRATCH
dialog: Aint bothering you.
speaker_heading: LONNIE
dialog: Yes it is. That aint no kind of
dialog: music.
text: We see that the board has PIANO KEYS drawn across it and that
text: Lonnie is pretending to play a song on it-
speaker_heading: SCRATCH
dialog: Least I make a sound.
speaker_heading: LONNIE
dialog: Yeah and it's a nasty one.
text: Lonnie looks at the sky-
speaker_heading: SCRATCH
dialog: You want to try again tonight?
text: Lonnie sits on the edge of the porch, gauging the time from
dialog: the setting sun-
speaker_heading: LONNIE
dialog: Might as well.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. 1ST COTTON FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON 2
text: SLIDE GUITAR plays. A tuft of RAW COTTON bobs on the stem
text: and we begin to scroll OPENING CREDITS-
dialog: 2.
text: We TILT and RACK to look over a FIELD OF COTTON, the bolls
text: plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze.
text: A HARVEST HAND steps into the shot, looks toward the setting
text: sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the
text: row in front of him. We PULL BACK to see other PICKERS, men
text: and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard
text: work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing
text: LONG WHITE SACKS between their legs and behind them.
text: The boys walk down between them in the opposite direction-
scene_heading: 3 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PINEY WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON 3
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. We see the boys walking on a PATH through
speaker_heading: the PINES-
scene_heading: 4 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, RAILROAD TRACKS - AERIAL SHOT - LATE 4
speaker_heading: AFTERNOON
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. We float over RAILROAD TRACKS cutting
text: through flat, piney woods, catching up the boys, who walk on
dialog: the ties-
scene_heading: 5 EXT. ARMY BARRACKS - EARLY EVENING 5
text: MUSIC CONTINUES. The boys stroll past white buildings of an
text: ARMY BARRACKS. SOLDIERS, black and white, DRILL on the
dialog: grounds-
scene_heading: 6 EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE, RIVER - EARLY EVENING 6
text: The river rolls past us in the FG as the boys cross a
scene_heading: RAILROAD BRIDGE. We SUPERIMPOSE-
speaker_heading: ALABAMA - 1950
scene_heading: OPENING CREDITS END
scene_heading: 7 EXT. HONEYDRIPPER LOUNGE - NIGHT 7
text: We hear PIANO MUSIC as we CRANE DOWN toward the HONEYDRIPPER
text: LOUNGE, a ramshackle wooden roadhouse at a rural crossroads.
dialog: 3.
text: BLUE-colored light bulbs (a few broken) FLICK ON and OFF
text: erratically around the HONEYDRIPPER SIGN as we TRACK toward
text: and then THROUGH it on the way to the entrance, catching up
text: with Lonnie and Scratch.
text: The boys step under the door-light, frantic with insects, and
text: go up on their toes to peek in through a window-
scene_heading: 8 INT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT 8
text: An OVERHEAD ANGLE of long fingers on piano keys-
speaker_heading: SINGER
text: A woman in her late 50's, early 60's, BERTHA MAE SPIVEY,
text: leans into a MICROPHONE from where she sits on a stool on a
text: little makeshift stage, a glass of whiskey in hand, and SINGS-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: I know a gal name of Betty Sue
dialog: Shook it so much
dialog: She got the German flu
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: She done it just the same
text: As she sings we PAN and TRACK, moving through the large, near-
scene_heading: empty COUNTRY ROADHOUSE-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: You women don't worry
dialog: About your life
dialog: She made Jack the Ripper
dialog: Throw away his knife-
text: Only a few die-hard REGULARS are scattered at the tables and
text: bar stools. A pretty young woman in her late teens, CHINA
text: DOLL, is behind the bar, head held in her hands, listening
text: aimlessly.
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: She done it just the same
text: Lonnie and Scratch step in, cautiously looking around, hoping
text: that nobody will notice and tell them to leave.
dialog: 4.
text: They plant themselves next to the piano, Lonnie intently
text: watching the long fingers work the keys- we TILT to see
text: TYRONE `Pinetop' Purvis, proprietor and piano player, in his
text: 50's. He acts as if the boys aren't there, concentrating on
text: the music. We SHIFT to include Bertha Mae as she wraps up
dialog: the song-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: A copper brought her in
dialog: She didn't need no bail
dialog: She shook it for the judge
text: He threw the cop in jail
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: No matter how she done it
dialog: She done it just the same
text: SLICK, a pretty, sharply-dressed man in his late 40's at the
text: bar, and MACEO, who sits at a table near the bandstand
text: smiling throughout, APPLAUD. The sound makes the room seem
text: more empty.
text: Ty stands, nods to METALMOUTH SIMS, a slight, worried-looking
text: harmonica player who sits behind Bertha Mae-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: You take it for a while.
text: As Ty crosses to the bar we hear RECORDED MUSIC booming from
dialog: outside-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: They makin all that racket again at
dialog: Toussaint's.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Yeah. And all them people over
dialog: there buying drinks and throwing
dialog: their money after them dice and
dialog: whatnot. Lucky we got none a that
dialog: here.
text: Metalmouth launches into a HARMONICA INTRO. Ty pauses at the
text: counter next to Slick, who is attentively watching Bertha Mae-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: You can drink your liquor
dialog: You can drink your cold can beer-
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: She sounding good, huh?
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Sounds fine. Always has.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: You can drink your good whiskey
dialog: You can drink your cold can beer-
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: Not much of a crowd.
speaker_heading: TY
text: Not a crowd at all. Just some
dialog: stiffs who want to drink theirself
dialog: to sleep without the music wakin em
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: You ought to advertise. Got an
dialog: attraction like Bertha Mae-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: You can lay up with your sweet gal
dialog: But Poppa don't you leave me here
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Singin is one thing, Slick.
dialog: Whether people want to look at you
dialog: while you do it is another.
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: (defensive) You saying something
dialog: about-
text: Maceo arrives to join them, interrupting-
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Got quite a number over to
dialog: Toussaint's place tonight.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Sounds like it.
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Lots of young folks. Come to
dialog: listen to that box of his.
text: China Doll brings Ty a glass of whiskey. He gives her a sad
dialog: smile-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Thanks, China Doll.
text: We FOLLOW as Ty crosses to the door-
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: MACEO (O.S.)
dialog: Don't see why we don't just turn
dialog: our box on and let folks feed it
dialog: nickels like they do.
speaker_heading: SLICK (O.S.)
text: The lady is singing.
speaker_heading: MACEO (O.S.)
dialog: But didn't nobody come to listen to
dialog: her, Slick.
text: Ty looks out the door at-
scene_heading: POV - EXT. ACE OF SPADES CLUB
text: -the RED-lit ACE OF SPADES CLUB across the road, PEOPLE
text: hanging out in front, LAUGHTER heard from within-
speaker_heading: HONEYDRIPPER
text: Ty reacts. Behind him, Maceo indicates the near-empty room-
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Like the man say, you can't argue
dialog: with failure.
text: STOKELY, a bitter drunk who holds on to the end of the bar,
dialog: calls out to them-
speaker_heading: STOKELY
dialog: You know why Slick here is like a
dialog: preacher?
dialog: Slick tenses, used to this-
speaker_heading: STOKELY
dialog: Cause he does all his best work on
text: his knees.
text: Stokely almost chokes with laughter-
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Never mind him, he just a drunk-
speaker_heading: STOKELY
dialog: I hear she put a ring through it
text: and use it to yank him around the
dialog: house.
text: Slick starts to rise but Maceo puts a hand on his arm-
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: You know Tyrone don't allow no
dialog: scufflin here, Slick.
speaker_heading: STOKELY
dialog: I oughta get me a old woman too,
dialog: take care of the groceries. Just

dialog: her a good poke now and then-
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: You gonna drink, Stokely, or you

dialog: that busted head you about to get?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Gentlemen-
text: They all turn to see DELILAH, Ty's wife, coming out from the
text: back of the club. She is dressed for church-
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: (doffs his hat) Miss Delilah-
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Let's behave ourselves. (sees)
dialog: What are you boys doing in here?
dialog: Out!
text: Lonnie and Scratch, busted, hurry out. Delilah turns her
dialog: attention to China Doll-
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: And what are you doing behind that
dialog: bar?
speaker_heading: CHINA DOLL
text: It's just for a minute.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's sixty seconds too long.
dialog: Maceo, you get back there and take
dialog: that child's place.
text: China Doll mopes as she steps out from behind-
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: You bring people their food. Don't
dialog: you be messing with their liquor.
speaker_heading: CHINA DOLL
text: Nobody's eating.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: That's cause nobody's here but
dialog: these couple lost souls, haven't
dialog: had an appetite since they give
text: over to the devil.
text: Maceo gets behind the counter as Delilah heads for Ty at the
dialog: door-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
text: At Pinetop's Honeydripper
dialog: That's where I get my cold can beer
text: At Pinetop's Honeydripper
dialog: That's where I get my cold can beer-
text: Maceo reluctantly moves down to take the order of NADINE, a
text: large, handsome woman with a prominent gold tooth who has
dialog: just stepped in-
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Evenin, Maceo. You lookin good
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Likewise, Miss Nadine. What can I
dialog: do for you?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (flirting) You know what you can
dialog: do for me, sweet man.
text: Maceo tries to slip the hook and be polite at the same time-
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: What would you like to drink?
speaker_heading: DOORWAY
text: Ty watches the CROWD in front of the Ace of Spades. Delilah
text: comes up to join him, indicates his drink-
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: How many is that tonight?
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Don't dog me about that, baby. Not
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I don't want China Doll behind that
dialog: bar.
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: She got to help out.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: Not there she doesn't. You know
dialog: she's not sposed to get excited-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Not much chance of that in here.
dialog: (wistful) Harvest hands all been
text: crowdin into Toussaint's place.
dialog: The young ones.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: You'll get some of them.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: They stick their noses in here, get
text: one little sniff of the music, and
dialog: they gone.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (joking) Maybe that's the wages of
dialog: sin.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: (bitter) Aint no sin happenin here

dialog: Viola Underwood found the Lord.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: I thought she found Him last year

speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (smiles) Well, she must have lost
dialog: Him again between then and now,
dialog: cause she come down that aisle
text: tonight hollering in tongues.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: The Spirit didn't move you, though?
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: (thoughtful) Not yet. Might be
dialog: too late for me.
text: Delilah surveys the room-
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: I can't believe you're serving
dialog: Alton Stokely.
speaker_heading: STOKELY
text: Stokely has to use two hands to keeps his glass steady as he
dialog: drinks-
speaker_heading: DELILAH (O.S.)
dialog: That poor man-
speaker_heading: TY (O.S.)
text: Toussaint cut his credit off.
dialog: Either he gets it here-
speaker_heading: TY AND DELILAH
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: -or he drinks that paint-peeler
text: Willie Pettigrew cooks up back in
dialog: the swamp.
speaker_heading: DELILAH
dialog: He's gonna drink himself to death
dialog: in here.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Least he won't go blind first.

speaker_heading: DELILAH

text: helps her off the stage-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE

text: Sent a chill down my spine to hear
dialog: you.
text: Bertha Mae looks to Ty as he steps back in-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: I might be a little late Saturday,
dialog: Tyrone.
speaker_heading: TY

speaker_heading: TY
dialog: I've made other arrangements.
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: Other arrangements-
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Try something new in here.
speaker_heading: SLICK
dialog: You can't do that!
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE

dialog: whatever he want.
text: Bertha Mae nods to Ty, holding onto her dignity for all it's
dialog: worth-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
dialog: You know where to find me if you
dialog: need me.
text: Bertha Mae pulls Slick out the door. China Doll watches
text: after them, troubled, while Ty pours himself another drink-
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: (softly) I put the box on now, Ty?
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Yeah. Put the box on.
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Imonna crank it up some, see if we
dialog: can draw a little life in here-
text: Maceo crosses and plugs an ancient-looking tabletop JUKEBOX
dialog: in.
text: The jukebox sputters to life, LIGHTS FLASHING ON and MUSIC
text: BLARING for a moment, then the LIGHTS FLICKER and all the
dialog: POWER in the club goes OFF!
scene_heading: 9 EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - NIGHT 9

speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Must be a short circuit in the juke

text: He yanks the plug out of the wall as Ty steps up to reassure
dialog: the few patrons-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Don't worry folks, bar's still
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: It's nice like this. Kind of

dialog: some things around.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Don't be wigglin nothin round less
dialog: I'm there to see it.
text: Maceo rolls his eyes as he passes Ty on the way out with a
text: FLASHLIGHT. He freezes in his tracks as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM
text: hits a FIGURE standing in the doorway-
text: It is SHERIFF HIRAM PUGH, large and in charge. Pugh strolls
text: into the club as if he owns it.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: Evenin, folks.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Evenin, Sheriff.
text: Sheriff Pugh looks around the near-empty club-
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: Your lights gone out.
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Looks like it.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: Don't know but that be a vilation
dialog: of somethin or other.
text: Ty has played this game before, trying to hold his ground
text: without pissing off the white man with the badge-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: We just about to close up here.
text: Pugh sniffs the air-
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: Your wife been cookin?

dialog: Not tonight. Went to the revival
dialog: tent.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: (grins) I stood by there a while.
dialog: Them nigras was singin up a storm.
text: Ty doesn't respond. Sheriff Pugh stops right next to
text: Stokely, giving him a dead-pan stare as he speaks. Stokely
dialog: won't meet his eyes-
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: I just come out here to look in on
dialog: Toussaint- had that shooting two
dialog: nights ago.

text: He turns his attention to Tyrone-
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: You got quite the reputation round
dialog: here, Tyrone. Say you put some
text: poor black boy in the grave.
text: It gets very quiet, the HISS of the KEROSENE LANTERN growing
text: tense and insistent.
text: China Doll looks from Sheriff Pugh to Ty's face, searching
text: for a flicker of evidence. Ty stays deadpan-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Just people talkin.
text: The Sheriff steps to put his face very close to Ty's, an edge
text: of menace in his voice when he speaks softly-
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: You remember that this is my
dialog: county, Tyrone. What goes on goes
dialog: on cause I let it. Don't want to
dialog: get too big for your britches out
dialog: here.
text: Ty holds Pugh's eyes for an agonizingly long moment, then the
text: sheriff turns and heads for the door-
speaker_heading: SHERIFF PUGH
dialog: You folks have a pleasant evening,
dialog: now.
text: They all wait for him to clear the door before they exhale.
speaker_heading: STOKELY
dialog: A nigger aint shit in this world.
text: Maceo snatches the whiskey bottle from Stokely-
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Speakin for yourself.
speaker_heading: STOKELY
dialog: You didn't have this club, Tyrone,
dialog: what you think you be?
text: We TIGHTEN on Ty's face. He has been thinking about this
dialog: very thing-
speaker_heading: STOKELY (O.S.)
dialog: Wouldn't be nothin. And if that
dialog: aint true then grits aint
dialog: groceries.

scene_heading: 11 EXT. BERTHA MAE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 11
text: Bertha Mae pauses as she climbs the FRONT PORCH of her two-
text: story wooden HOUSE, the nicest in the neighborhood, listening
text: to the TRAIN WHISTLE with a troubled look on her face. Slick
text: waits for her with the door open-
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
text: That is a terrible noise.
speaker_heading: SLICK
text: Just the northbound from Talledega.
dialog: Sounds like it always does.
speaker_heading: BERTHA MAE
text: Like a soul bein carried away from

scene_heading: ANOTHER WHISTLE-
speaker_heading: SLICK

scene_heading: 12 EXT. RAILROAD STATION - NIGHT 12
text: We hear the TRAIN WHISTLE again as the WHEELS ROLL and the
text: TRAIN strobes past us, picking up speed as it pulls out from
dialog: the yard-
text: When it clears we see a LONE FIGURE standing across the
text: tracks. He steps forward and catches a bit of light--
dialog: 17.
text: SONNY BLAKE, 20's, rumpled from hard travelling. He carries
text: a GUITAR CASE and something bulky in a SACK-
text: SHACK THOMAS, an older man in a PULLMAN PORTER'S UNIFORM

text: PLATFORM, watching Sonny-

speaker_heading: MACEO (O.S.)
dialog: It's just a weekday night-
speaker_heading: WIDER
text: Still operating by LANTERN LIGHT, Ty and Maceo look at the

speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Least you don't owe the electric

speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: (worried) You thinkin bout closing

text: He spreads it out on the counter top. It reads-
speaker_heading: SPECIAL ATTRACTION

text: suddenly from right behind him-
dialog: He turns-
text: POSSUM, blind, with his chair tilted back against the not-yet-

speaker_heading: POSSUM
dialog: Somebody slept in the railroad

speaker_heading: TY

speaker_heading: TY

speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Pull it around to the back- we'll

speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Oh Lord-
text: Ty runs up to his microphone, shoots a look to the bar-
text: Maceo is pouring a scotch with one hand, the other wrapped
text: around the wires coming out of the wall. He nods to Ty-
text: Sonny starts to hook his guitar up with a thick COIL OF WIRE,
text: then into the dented AMP sitting on a wooden chair beside him
text: and pointed out at the crowd. Metalmouth Sims looks on
text: uncomfortably. Ty puts on his biggest grin, easing behind

speaker_heading: TY (O.S.)
dialog: -direct from New Orleans, Louisiana-
speaker_heading: STAGE
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: -Guitar Sam!!!!

dialog: Sheriff Pugh cover his ears-
text: The girls from the store cover their ears, making pained
dialog: faces-
text: Sonny pulls his guitar away from the amp and the SQUAWK
text: settles to a FUZZY BUZZ. Sonny frowns at the amp-
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Sorry, folks- must of got kicked on

speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: What's this fool playin at?

dialog: stage, panicked-
text: -as Sonny brings his fingers to the strings and the amp
text: BLASTS the room with a long, trip-hammering, spine-shivering,
scene_heading: ELECTRIC GUITAR INTRO!
text: Ty stands at the piano with his mouth hanging open-
text: Sonny WHOOPS and leans into his microphone-
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Gonna hold may baby as tight as I

dialog: Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty
dialog: man!
dialog: Have you heard the news?
dialog: There's good rockin tonight!
text: Sonny looks over to Ty, who catches himself and begins to
text: play along. Young Henry is impassive as he plays a fast
dialog: shuffle on the skins-
text: Ty looks over to Maceo, half-climbing the wall as he tries to
text: pull the wires out. Maceo sees Ty, who waves him off-
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Have you heard the news?
dialog: There's good rockin tonight!
text: Delilah smiles and presses her hands together, shooting a
dialog: look upward-
speaker_heading: DELILAH

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Meet me at midnight behind the barn
dialog: Don't you worry I'll do you no harm

dialog: 106.
text: Time Trenier screws the mouthpiece on, puts his horn to his

text: walking through the parting crowd to the bandstand!
text: Junebug grabs Opal's hand and they begin to DANCE a modified
text: jitterbug, people spreading to give them room-
text: Sheriff Pugh, hands still over his ears, sits in a corner
text: paying special attention to Opal's hip action-
text: As Time continues to blow, stepping up onto the stage, Sonny
text: keeps urging Metalmouth Sims to come closer to his microphone
text: with the harmonica. Sims is hesitant but Sonny keeps waving-
dialog: closer, closer-
text: Metalmouth shoots a nervous look to Ty, who nods from the
text: piano, so he butts his harp smack against the microphone,
text: takes a deep breath and HONKS his soul out, grabbing the
dialog: break from Time!
text: The audience goes wild, a half-dozen couples dancing now,
text: others clapping and finger-popping and jumping to the beat
text: where they stand. Sonny shakes out the long CORD attached to
dialog: his guitar-
text: China Doll is trying to keep collecting from the new
text: CUSTOMERS pressing in the door and dance at the same time,
text: thrilled by the music. Lonnie and Scratch sneak in behind
text: her as she turns toward the bandstand-
text: Metalmouth wraps up his break and Sonny takes over with the
text: guitar again, making it WAIL as he hops off the stage, steps
text: up on a chair, then onto the bar counter!
text: He walks the length of the bar, playing his ass off, hops
text: down at the far end, grins at China Doll and heads out
text: through the door, dragging extension cord behind! Lonnie and

speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: What the hell is that?
text: Sonny steps out into the middle of the crossroads and plays,
text: a CAR stopping short of running him over.
dialog: 107.
text: He hops up on the hood and keeps playing, a TRUCK from the
text: other direction stopping to blast him with its HEADLIGHTS.
text: Sonny indicates with his guitar neck to the CROWD emptying
text: out of Toussaint's that he wants them to follow, then hops
text: down onto a big picker's back and is carried back in to the
dialog: Honeydripper, still playing-
speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: We got to check that out!
text: A couple dozen patrons move away with him. We HOLD on the

dialog: You can't find a woman, just grab
dialog: hold of yourselves- we gonna play

text: As they join in the chorus, Ty sees-
text: Cool Breeze, strolling in, checking out the action with a
dialog: proprietary air.
text: Ty looks to Maceo, getting back behind the bar. Maceo sees
dialog: as well, tightening up-
text: Cool Breeze nods to Ty.
text: A slow, sexy SAX BREAK comes up and Ty leaves the piano to
text: cross to the bar. When he gets there Maceo is already
text: counting out a huge pile of BILLS-
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Hundred forty-two, forty-three,
dialog: forty-four, five, six, seven,

speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Lucky Hardaway don't mind some
dialog: change, does he?
text: Cool Breeze doesn't even glance at the money, hard-eying Ty
dialog: instead-
speaker_heading: COOL BREEZE
dialog: What if Mr. Hardaway was to say let

dialog: wants the club back one way or the
dialog: other?
text: Maceo looks to Ty, who remains impassive, mind working-
speaker_heading: COOL BREEZE
dialog: How'd that be?
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Well- he'd have to take it up with
dialog: my bidness partner.
text: Ty shifts and we RACK FOCUS to see across the room to Sheriff
text: Pugh, receiving his sack of chicken and white bread from

text: Cool Breeze reconsiders his terms-
speaker_heading: COOL BREEZE
dialog: That sheriff your partner?
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: (sighs) Yeah, and he's twice as

text: Cool Breeze grins, scoops up the bills on the counter-
speaker_heading: COOL BREEZE
dialog: You must want this club awful bad,
dialog: brother.
text: Cool Breeze hefts the sack of change, shoots a look to the
text: stage and leans over to speak into Ty's ear-
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: COOL BREEZE
dialog: You maybe know this already, but
dialog: that aint no Guitar Sam.
text: He steps away just as the song ends to APPLAUSE, Ty taking a
text: deep sigh of relief. Sonny steps up to the microphone to
dialog: introduce the next song-
speaker_heading: TOUSSAINT (O.S.)
dialog: You is a lie!
text: A shocked silence.
text: The audience makes way for Old Man Toussaint to come
text: tottering up to the foot of the stage. He points a bony
dialog: finger at Sonny-
speaker_heading: TOUSSAINT
dialog: You is a lie, boy! I known Sammy
dialog: since he's drinkin mama's milk,
dialog: hell, I known his Mama herself when
dialog: she live up to Plaquemine- and you

text: The audience looks to Sonny for his defense-

text: behind the bar.
dialog: Sonny just smiles-
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: That's Creole Guitar Sam you talkin
dialog: bout, Pops. I'm Delta Guitar Sam.
text: Toussaint ponders this a moment, then huffs-
speaker_heading: TOUSSAINT

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Imonna play you one I come up with

text: He starts into a bouncy INTRO that Metalmouth joins in with,

text: The last person he passes turns toward Ty-
dialog: Possum?
text: But then DANCERS cross in front and he is gone.
speaker_heading: TY
text: Ty frowns, troubled. Under the sax now we hear a dissonant
text: SLIDE GUITAR, the haunting notes Possum was playing at the

speaker_heading: POV
text: The SLIDE GUITAR continues underneath as we PAN across the
dialog: crowd dancing-

text: Ty is there, clamping onto them with a grip of iron.
dialog: 113.
text: A lighter, bouncier ELECTRIC GUITAR RIFF has replaced the sax
text: now. Ty looks deep into the eyes of the two surprised
dialog: pickers-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Yall in my house, here, gentlemen.
dialog: Don't have no fightin, don't have

speaker_heading: HAM

speaker_heading: TY

speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: Got a problem here?
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: These young men seem to brought
dialog: something in for our collection.
speaker_heading: MACEO
dialog: (to Dex) Yours first.
text: Ty gently takes the pistol from Dex, regards it grimly before
text: laying it in the box. He turns his attention to Ham-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Now yours.
text: He takes the knife from Ham, tosses it in the box-
speaker_heading: TY
dialog: Yall still need to mess with each
dialog: other, you go outside and do it.

scene_heading: 77 EXT. HONEYDRIPPER - MORNING 77
text: The SUN RISES next to the Honeydripper sign. We hear the
text: CROW of a distant ROOSTER. The parking lot is empty but for
dialog: Ty's old Ford-
text: Ty, exhausted but happy, steps out front. He pastes a SNIPE
text: that says HELD OVER! across the Guitar Sam poster-
speaker_heading: POSSUM (O.S.)
dialog: That boy can play some.
text: Ty turns. Possum is on the road, guitar strung over his
text: shoulder, feeling his way with a red-tipped CANE.
speaker_heading: TY

dialog: 116.
text: Instead of a Diddley bow, Scratch is pretending to tune the
text: two strings on a `guitar' made of a plank of wood and baling
text: wire. He carefully takes a length of clothesline rope
text: leading from the guitar, tacks the end of it to the wall of
text: the shack, plugging himself in. He looks to Lonnie, who
dialog: nods, and then-
