scene_heading: INT. - RING ~ SLOW MOTION (LAS VEGAS) ~ BLACK AND WHITE
text: The scene arises on a STARK GRACEFUL VISUAL of TWO BOXERS
text: engaged in combat...the dominant fighter, known as MASON
text: ‘THE LINE’ DIXON moves in for the kill. His body language
text: is fluid, and boxing skills are pure precision savagery.
text: In EXTREME SLOW motion Dixon feints and throws A
text: THUNDEROUS BLOW that crashes with devastating results
text: against his opponent’s chin. A surrendering towel is
text: tossed into the air as the challenger begins an
text: UNCONSCIOUS DESCENT TO THE CANVAS, Dixon strides to his
text: corner, ONE VICTORIOUS FIST held high. The haunting scene
text: begins to melt away as an ascending chorus of boos fills
dialog: the arena.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (V.0.)
dialog: ++-This crowd is not holding back its
text: anger over this latest debacle.

dialog: ++-In what has become an all too regular
dialog: occurrence ~ Another inferior opponent

text: A LARGE CUP OF ICE is heaved from several rows back
text: SPRAYING Mason and his entourage. Another CUP OF ICE
text: descends into the ring nearly hitting a member of Dixon’s
text: corner who stands behind the champion brazenly holding
text: the CHAMPIONSHIP BELT high over his head. The camera work
text: grows increasingly aggressive, matching the flustered
dialog: crowd's attitude,
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2 (CONT ‘D)
text: Objects are being thrown into the ring!
text: Cubes of ice hit DIXON!
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: ---Another disappointing title defense -—
dialog: Something hit Dixon!
text: An EMPTY BEER BOTTLE descends from high up in the
text: bleachers and crashes with lethal impact on the canvas.
text: The twenty or so people in the ring panic, shielding
text: their heads while frantically scanning the crowd. The
text: booing increases.
text: Dixon climbs through the ropes. Then he pauses. He glares
text: defiantly at the crowd.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT’D)
dialog: The champ Mason Dixon is leaving - This
dialog: is a horrible scene. Dixon wants no more!
text: The crowd is growing more aggressive at
dialog: this lackluster event. It was just a
dialog: matter of time before all Hell broke
dialog: loose!
text: As the CREDITS ROLL we follow DIXON and his entourage out

speaker_heading: COMMISSIONER #1 (V.0.)
dialog: The tests administered were much more

dialog: passed the mandatory state exam. But
dialog: frankly, your age is still a big concern -
dialog: And weighing in all the different factors
