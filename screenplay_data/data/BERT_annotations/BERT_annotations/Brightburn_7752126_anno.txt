scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
text: A lonely, rundown Victorian farmhouse surrounded by six-foot-
text: high cornfields. A neglected barn in the distance. No
text: neighbors in sight.
text: Everything dark but for a flickering blue TV light from an
text: upstairs window.
scene_heading: INT. TORI AND KYLE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: PAN ACROSS an array of framed photographs on a hallway wall,
dialog: stretching back generations -
text: A recent color photo of a young man and woman on their wedding
text: day. Sepia portraits of a homesteader family on the plains of
text: Kansas, everyone sturdy, solemn. Black & white portraits from
dialog: the '20's and '30s, lots of kids.
text: IN THE BATHROOM
text: The woman in the color photo - TORI BREYER, early 30's, ina
text: sleeveless nightgown - studies herself in the mirror.
text: She doesn't like what she sees. Too plain. Too Midwestern. Too
text: wholesome. So she tucks a lock of hair behind her ear.
text: Unbuttons a couple buttons on her nightgown.
text: She makes her way -
text: INTO THE BEDROOM
text: Her husband KYLE - 30's, thatchy beard, sturdy build - lies in
text: bed scrolling around on his laptop. A TV plays a sitcom on
text: Nick at Nite.
text: Tori goes to Kyle. She gets on the bed, folds up his laptop,
text: sets them on a stack of books on the nightstand: Taking Charge
dialog: of Your Fertility; The Everything Getting Pregnant Book;
dialog: Miscarriage: Women Sharing From the Heart.
text: Tori climbs on top of Kyle. Starts to kiss him. He's
dialog: pleasantly surprised -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What's going on? Are you ovulating?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (between kisses)
dialog: No. But for once let's not have it
dialog: be work. Just fun.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hell, it's always fun for me.
text: He gets into it. They start messing around. Close. Intimate. A
text: tangle of hands and limbs.
text: A bedside lamp flickers. The cable TV feed pixillates and
text: stutters - jagged bursts of creepy sitcom laughter.
text: Tori stops short.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Um... Ow.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (hyper-concerned)
dialog: What, what?
text: Her hair has become caught in his watchband. They both giggle.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, I'm sorry...
text: He delicately maneuvers his wrist, unclips his watch,
text: disentangles her hair. He throws his watch on the bed.
text: She sits up, straddling his waist, her fingers interlaced with
text: his. He smiles. She smiles back at him.
dialog: Then -
text: A chain on the bedside lamp quivers, tinkling against the
text: light fixture.
text: Tori climbs off the bed. She's curious. Alert. As if the air
text: is suddenly charged. She ventures toward the hallway.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Babe? You okay?
text: She looks down the dark hallway. Peering into the stillness.
text: She turns to Kyle.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I'm fine. For a second I thought -
text: A DEAFENING BOOM!
text: LIKE A 747 ROARING INCHES ABOVE THE HOUSE. BOOKS, PERFUME
text: BOTTLES, AND PICTURE FRAMES FLY AGAINST THE CEILING, AS IF
text: MAGNETIZED BY SOMETHING PASSING OVERHEARD.
text: TORI AND KYLE ARE THROWN TO THE FLOOR. THE HOUSE RATTLES TO
scene_heading: THE FOUNDATION.
text: FOR A BRIEF MOMENT THE OBJECTS IN THE ROOM HOVER IN ZERO
speaker_heading: GRAVITY -
scene_heading: THEN PLUMMET.
text: The TV crashes to the floor. Kyle's watch lands beside him.
text: Tori and Kyle try to collect themselves.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You all right?
text: She nods, shaken.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don't know, an earthquake?
text: She gives him a withering glance. THAT was not an earthquake.
text: She notices something outside. She drifts toward the bedroom
text: window and looks out, disturbed. Kyle joins her.
text: They see, far off, a FLICKERING LIGHT in the woods. A thin
text: wisp of smoke rising into the night sky.
scene_heading: INT. PICKUP TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
text: Headlights cut through a dirt road - deeper and deeper into
text: woods thick with trees.
text: Kyle at the wheel, Tori looking out the window. She wears a
text: red wool cardigan over her nightgown. Eerie old-time music
text: plays on a tinny dashboard radio.
text: As they drive, the headlights cast ominous shadows. The
text: surroundings become more atmospheric and foreboding.
text: Kyle senses Tori's anxiety.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You know, we don't have to do this.
text: Tori shrugs him off. She doesn't want to do this, but she
dialog: has to.
text: A SCREECH OF BIRDS flee from the forest.
text: Kyle and Tori look up as an endless FLOCK OF CROWS surges
text: overhead.
text: Kyle watches them pass: why are they all leaving?
text: The song on the radio starts to garble and short out. Kyle
text: fiddles with the radio knobs, the dashboard lights flickering -
speaker_heading: SPACK!
text: A CROW HITS THE WINDSHIELD HEAD ON - TWISTED AND SPLATTERED,
text: THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED.
text: Kyle LOSES CONTROL OF THE TRUCK. He wrestles with the wheel as
text: the vehicle SKIDS OFF THE DIRT ROAD -
text: AND NOSEDIVES INTO A SHALLOW DITCH, jolting Kyle and Tori.
text: The truck whinnies to a stop.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamnit.
text: Kyle and Tori climb out of the car. As he examines the damage -
text: buckled hood, broken windshield - Tori stands cold and
dialog: frightened.
text: She can hear, faintly, far off - RASPY BREATHING - labored,
text: like a handsaw's back-and-forth.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Do you hear that?
text: As he grabs a flashlight from the bed of the truck -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Hear what?
text: He shines a flashlight on the jacked-up front hood. He's not
dialog: happy.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, that's beautiful. My truck just
dialog: got wrecked by a fucking crow.
text: There's no response. He looks around and notices Tori
text: wandering deeper into the woods - as if called.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tori?
text: She disappears into the brush.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: He heads after her, raking his flashlight across the woods.
text: He notices trees snapped, shorn off, the edges of their
text: branches ON FIRE. Tiny embers wafting through the air. The
text: BREATHING getting louder.
text: Kyle - disoriented - spots a glimpse of Tori's nightgown
text: fluttering past some trees. He scrambles to catch up.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tori...
text: He sees her, briefly, just before she goes through some
text: bushes, deeper into the woods.
text: Kyle hurries to reach her.
text: He shines the flashlight onto the ground and realizes he's in
text: a SMOLDERING TRENCH.
text: A SHADOWY FIGURE APPROACHES behind him. He turns - shines his
dialog: flashlight -
dialog: IT's TORI!
text: Kyle is rattled. Tori is overcome with emotion. Almost
text: beaming.
text: She takes Kyle's hand, pulling at him, beckoning him deeper
text: into the forest. The RASPY BREATHING grows louder. A looming
text: sense of dread.
text: She leads him to a JUMBLE OF WRECKAGE SURROUNDED BY FLAMES - A
scene_heading: CRACKED POD MADE OF SOME KIND OF BLACK MINERAL, ITS SHELL
scene_heading: RUPTURED OPEN.
text: She reaches into the pod and takes out -
dialog: A NAKED BABY!
scene_heading: A NEWBORN - MOUTH AGAPE - STRUGGLING TO BREATHE.
text: Kyle staggers back -
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus! What the fuck!
text: Tori cradles the wheezing baby. He's no more than three
text: pounds. Fragile in her hands. Helpless.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: TORI
text: It's a child. A boy.
dialog: 6.
text: Kyle frets as Tori holds the baby to her. The baby stares up
text: at Tori, needing her. Tori removes her cardigan and wraps it
text: around the child for warmth.
text: Kyle stands back as Tori cradles the baby to her. The baby
text: stares up at Tori, needing her. Tori removes her cardigan and
text: wraps it around the child for warmth.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Where'd it come from?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Does it matter?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: We gotta call someone. The sheriff,
dialog: child services, I don't know.
text: Tori is lost in the newborn child. She strokes his scalp. His
text: breathing slows, steadies.
text: Kyle steps toward Tori and the baby, mystified.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: What should we do with him?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Take care of him.
text: Kyle squirms, uncertain -—
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Tori...
text: Tori - welling with emotion - looks up at her husband.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: We've been trying for a baby for so
dialog: many years. All that pain, all that
text: agony and heartache.
text: The memory stabs at Kyle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I know, I know...
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: All those nights we stayed up
dialog: holding each other, wishing -
dialog: praying - that God or the Universe
dialog: or someone would help us. And now
dialog: it's happened. He's here. A gift.
dialog: Meant for us.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 7.
text: Kyle is awed, caught up in something larger than himself. He
text: holds out his pinkie. The baby grasps it.
text: Tori smiles. She kisses the baby's forehead.
text: The family is together, complete, flames and smoldering smoke
text: behind them. Tori and Kyle look down at the peaceful baby in
text: her arms.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: BENJAMIN BREYER
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
text: 12 YEARS LATER.
text: A crisp autumn morning. Tori walks through sprawling farmland.
dialog: She calls out -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin! Time for school!
dialog: No reply.
text: She lets out a two-tone SING-SONG WHISTLE.
text: From some other part of the property she hears the same SING-
text: SONG WHISTLE in reply. She smiles to herself.
text: She walks across an expanse of patchy grass and heads toward
text: an ABANDONED BARN. She playfully whistles again.
text: From inside the barn, someone whistles back.
text: Tori opens a dilapidated door. Barn swallows SCREECH -
text: STARTLING HER - flying past her face. She watches the birds
text: soar through sunlight filtering through old rotting windows
text: and roof beams.
text: She climbs up a ladder to an upper loft area, scanning the
text: nooks and crevices - a game of hide and seek.
text: She lets out a whistle. Elsewhere, closer now - the whistle
dialog: replies.
text: She thinks she hears a creak from one of the floor boards.
text: She smiles, climbs down into a grain pit area -
text: BENJAMIN leaps from some higher level and tackles Tori onto a
text: moldering mess of hay.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 8.
text: Tori winces, laughing -
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: You're getting too big for this
dialog: game!
text: Tori stares into Benjamin's eyes. He's gangly, 11 going on 12,
text: hair uncombed, his eyes alert.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: But you'll always be my baby boy.
text: Benjamin smiles. He rises and lifts Tori to her feet -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Took you long enough to find me.
text: Kyle - wearing jeans, work gloves in his hand, fresh from the
text: fields - enters the barn. He's got a noticeable limp.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What are you guys doing in here?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I was just hiding and stuff.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: C'mon, you know the barn is off
dialog: limits.
text: Kyle double-checks the padlock on a hinged trap door built
text: into the floor of the grain pit area.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: All these loose boards and nails
dialog: and shit, I just don't want you to
dialog: break your neck.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: He knows that. We were about to
dialog: leave.
text: Kyle puts his arm around his son -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Sorry if I gotta be the big bad Dad
dialog: now and again...
text: Benjamin rolls his eyes. The family heads out of the barn into
text: the vast farmland and the morning light.
text: PUSH IN on the trap door in the barn, giving off a FAINT,
scene_heading: THROBBING HUM. INSISTENT. FOREBODING.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 9.
scene_heading: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY
text: A SCIENCE TEACHER stands next to a video projection - images
text: of bees and wasp dance off of her in the darkened room.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
text: Wasps and bees. Both members of the
dialog: same insect family, both with two
text: pairs of wings, both with stingers.
text: As the teacher lectures, a pretty girl with frizzy hair -
text: CAITLYN - peers over at Benjamin making childlike doodles in
text: his notebook - variations on his name and initials.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Can anyone tell me any differences
dialog: between them? Mr. Breyer?
text: Benjamin looks up at her.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Well, um... bees are pollinators,
dialog: wasps are predators.
speaker_heading: SCIENCE TEACHER
dialog: Good, good.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Wasps are more aggressive. More
dialog: dangerous. One species, Polistes
dialog: sulcifer, is what's called a brood
dialog: parasite.
text: A blue-eyed boy, ROYCE, exchanges glances with a kid with a
text: FAUXHAWK, the two of them stifling a snicker.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
dialog: These wasps have lost the ability
dialog: to build their own nests, so they
dialog: use brute force to get other wasp
dialog: species to raise their young. They
dialog: make them feed their babies beetle
text: larvae and maggots.
text: An awkward silence from the class. Royce pipes up -
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: Yo man, how'd they taste?
text: The classroom ERUPTS in laughter. Benjamin is bruised.
text: As the teacher tries to quiet the class, Caitlyn leans over to
dialog: Benjamin and whispers -
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: Don't worry about that idiot. Some
dialog: day he'll be working for you.
text: Benjamin takes this in. Caitlyn returns to her notebook. He
text: smiles to himself.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Tori washes dishes in the sink, steam rising. The kitchen is
dialog: off dining and living rooms that haven't changed in generations
text: - peeling wallpaper, heavy dark furniture, old porcelain dolls.
text: A LOUD THUMP from upstairs.
text: Tori turns off the sink. Listens.
dialog: She calls upstairs -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Ben?
text: A grandfather clock TICK-TOCKS.
text: Then, from somewhere in the house, she hears -
scene_heading: A LOW MURMURING NOISE. GHASTLY. SINISTER.
text: Tori is creeped.
text: She makes her way toward a back STUDY off the living room.
text: Kyle is slumped on an old couch, sleeping, the TV playing some
text: old movie with the sound off.
dialog: Tori whispers -
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Kyle, do you hear that?
text: He mumbles incoherently.
text: She returns to the living room.
text: She hears a SMALL CLATTER outside - trash cans maybe.
text: Then a PAINED GUTTURAL MOAN.
text: She opens the back screen door and goes -
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 11.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE
text: A jagged breeze. Wind chimes trill. Tori stands on a
text: wraparound porch.
text: She scans the backyard area. Bare light bulb behind her. The
text: fields a blanket of darkness.
text: She zeroes in on a rusty swing CREAKING BACK AND FORTH.
dialog: Is that what she heard?
text: Then, across the yard, SOMEONE WALKS THROUGH HER PERIPHERAL
speaker_heading: VISION.
text: Tori jolts as she watches BENJAMIN BEE-LINE INTO THE BACKYARD,
text: OBLIVIOUS TO TORI, OBLIVIOUS TO EVERYTHING, in a kind of
text: zombie trance. It's chilling. Unsettling.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin?
text: He keeps walking through fluttering sheets on the clothesline.
text: Through the backyard. Past the coop - chickens SQUAWKING
speaker_heading: WILDLY.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Benjamin!
text: Tori follows Benjamin as he staggers toward the barn - a tiny
text: figure in his pajamas receding into the vast darkness.
text: Tori can make out an eerie RINGING NOISE - keening, pulsating -
text: emanating from inside the barn. Faintly at first, then
dialog: growing.
text: Tori heads toward the source of the noise.
dialog: She enters -
speaker_heading: THE BARN
text: Almost pitch black. Scary as hell. Tori trying to find
text: Benjamin in the shadows. The ringing noise beckoning him.
text: She FINDS HIM IN THE GRAIN PIT AREA, THE TRAP DOOR IN THE
scene_heading: FLOOR OPEN, PEERING INSIDE.
text: Down in the pit is the BLACK POD HE ARRIVED IN AS A BABY. The
text: shell is putrefying. Crawling with carrion beetles.
text: It THROBS, KEENING.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 12.
text: Benjamin stands over it - MURMURING IN SOME HUSHED ALIEN
speaker_heading: GIBBERISH -—
text: He reaches out to the pod. He MAKES CONTACT WITH IT, the
text: keening growing LOUDER.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin.
text: Benjamin turns - startled - his hand grazing the metallic edge
dialog: of the pod.
text: The keening noise STOPS.
text: Benjamin clutches his hand in pain. He's disoriented. Weak.
dialog: Lost.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: What happened?
text: Tori supports Benjamin. She examines his injured hand. A
text: TRICKLE OF BLOOD runs from his finger.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: It cut me.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I know. I'm sorry, baby.
text: Tori uses her shirt to squeeze Benjamin's fingers, stanching
text: the bleeding, her shirt now blotted with blood.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: (in a daze)
dialog: I heard... I don't know what it
dialog: was. Voices or something.
text: Tori looks into his eyes, searching, trying to figure out how
dialog: much to tell him.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You were dreaming.
text: She soothes Benjamin's hair.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's forget this happened, okay?
text: Tori holds Benjamin, comforting him, trying to be strong, but
text: deep down she's frightened, a sense of something new and
text: terrifying welling up inside of her.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 13.
scene_heading: INT. BENJAMIN'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The room is dark and shadowy, cluttered with the detritus of
text: different eras: a radiator from the 1910's, cowboy wallpaper
text: from the '40s. Tori lovingly tucks Benjamin into bed.
text: She makes sure he's asleep. Kisses his forehead.
text: She heads out of his room, closing the CREAKING DOOR slowly,
text: careful not to make too much noise. She turns, and -—
text: KYLE IS BEHIND HER!
text: She jumps, startled.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Everything okay?
text: She fidgets.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I don't know. He was... sleepwalking
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Where?
text: Tori catches herself, decides to protect Kyle -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Downstairs. He's fine. C'mon, you
dialog: got an early morning.
scene_heading: INT. CHAIN RESTAURANT - EVENING
scene_heading: GROWLING ENGINES.
text: First-person video POV of stock cars racing around a track,
text: crashing into each other.
text: Benjamin and Tori sit side-by-side at the wheels of a NASCAR
text: Racing arcade game. Tori is having a blast.
scene_heading: INT. CHAIN RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Three members of a wait staff CLAP IN TIME WHILE CHANTING A
text: BIRTHDAY TUNE. We're in a casual dining place. The waiters set
text: down a sundae with a lit candle in front of Benjamin -
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: WAIT STAFF
dialog: Happy happy birthday!
dialog: We whipped up something cold!
text: Benjamin is moody, distant. He's surrounded by Kyle, Tori, his
text: AUNT MERILEE - 30's, sunny - and his UNCLE NOAH - late 30's,
text: pudgy, affable.
text: Benjamin contorts his face, turned off by the cheery song.
speaker_heading: WAIT STAFF (CONT’D)
dialog: Happy happy birthday!
dialog: For someone getting old!
text: Tori snaps a photo with her phone as Benjamin blows out the
text: candle. The staff whoops it up, wishes him happy birthday,
text: then heads off.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Wow. I think they use that to break
text: prisoners at Guantanamo.
text: Benjamin half-smiles.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Sorry, I did not know they were
dialog: gonna do that.
text: Noah puts his arm around Benjamin.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Was it punishment for something?
dialog: Bad grades?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: You've heard about his test scores,
dialog: right? Top one percent.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Top one-tenth of one percent.
dialog: Everyone on the faculty has been
text: talking about him.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: And he's just getting started.
text: She starts to get choked up.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: So much ahead of you.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Well, a boy that special deserves a
dialog: special gift. This is from me and
dialog: your Aunt Merilee.
text: He hands Benjamin a long wrapped gift. Merilee
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Go ‘head.
text: Benjamin tears off the wrapping to reveal a REMINGTON BOLT-
scene_heading: ACTION RIFLE.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Shot my first buck with that very
dialog: same model.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No. No way. Tori, we discussed
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I know, but -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Benjamin)
dialog: You're not ready.
text: Kyle takes the rifle from him. Benjamin flares with anger.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I'm twelve years old.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Exactly. You're still a child.
text: Benjamin is irate. He stares down Kyle. Arcade games
dialog: malfunction in the b.g.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Give that to me. It's mine.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: What'd you say to me?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I_said - give it to me.
text: Tori and Kyle are stunned. They've never seen this behavior
text: from Benjamin before. Benjamin glares at his Dad -
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 16.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Okay. You're done. No ice cream.
text: Kyle knocks the sundae aside - the glass bowl clattering
text: across the table. Other customers steal glances at them.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're leaving.
text: Kyle stands to go, grabbing Benjamin by the elbow -
text: Benjamin doesn't budge. An immovable force.
text: Kyle is about to lose it -
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Get _up.
text: Benjamin boils. It's a standoff.
text: Tori tenderly touches Benjamin's arm.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin... Listen to your father.
text: Benjamin looks at his mom. A moment passes between them.
text: Benjamin gives in. He rises to go.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Merilee and Noah)
dialog: I'm so sorry, guys.
dialog: Merilee and Noah beg off: not our business.
text: Tori and Kyle leave with Benjamin.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
text: Tori sits on a couch, removes her shoes, rubs her feet. Kyle
text: gets a longneck from the fridge, pops the cap.
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: Turns twelve years old, suddenly
text: gets a mouth on him.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: It was so strange. So unlike him.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 17.
text: Kyle limps toward the living room, thinks he notices something
text: outside - glances out a window behind Tori. He sees wind
text: blowing through the trees, spindly shadows on the yard -
dialog: - WAS THAT SOMETHING MOVING? -
dialog: Maybe just the wind.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I worry about him. Getting older.
dialog: Changing. Maybe it's all normal, I
dialog: don't know.
text: Kyle sits next to Tori. Takes a swig from his beer.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Oh, we were so much worse when
dialog: we were his age. The shit we got
dialog: into? Sneaking out on school
dialog: nights, smoking weed in my
dialog: parents' basement...
text: Kyle twinkles at the memory -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Fucking around on that puke-green
dialog: couch down there. Every time the
dialog: floor would creak upstairs I'd zip
dialog: my damn pants up...
text: They laugh as he nuzzles up to her, puts his hand on her
text: thigh. She returns his affection.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: We were such idiots. But we pulled
dialog: through, didn't we?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Barely. Your parents were okay I
dialog: guess. Mine sucked.
text: She laughs.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: I just want us to be better than
dialog: that.
text: Kyle ruminates. The large window above them, trees wavering
text: outside, scraping the glass.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: How 'bout we all go camping up in
dialog: Drywood this weekend? The three of
dialog: us.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 18.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Oo - we haven't done that in
dialog: forever.
text: She happily climbs on top of him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Know what else we haven't done in
dialog: forever?
text: She smiles as they start kissing.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. FARMHOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT
text: CRRREEEEEEEECHCH!
text: A RICKETY AUTOMATIC DOOR OPENS on a garage packed with boxes,
text: gardening tools, a 1970's sedan, its hood stacked with paint
dialog: cans.
text: Kyle carries the the Remington rifle from his truck into the
text: garage. The wind chimes jangle. He climbs on a work bench.
text: He reaches above a cabinet, moves aside Christmas lights and
text: mason jars filled with nails. Goes to PLACE THE RIFLE on top
dialog: of the cabinet -
text: The light bulb in the garage flickers and dims.
text: Kyle stops. He hears, from outside, A LOW MURMURING NOISE.
text: GHASTLY. SINISTER. The same noise Tori heard from Benjamin.
text: He listens.
text: He can make out the FLUTTER AND SQUAWK of chickens -
text: Rising into a CACOPHONY OF PANICKED SCREECHES, FLESH TEARING,
text: punctuated by a PAINED GUTTURAL MOAN.
dialog: Then - silence.
text: Nothing but the wind chimes.
text: Kyle climbs down from the work bench with the rifle.
text: He grabs two bullets from a box on a shelf, opens the chamber
text: of the rifle, presses them in. He slides the bolt shut with a
speaker_heading: CLICK.
text: He ventures out into the yard, toward the chicken coop, rifle
text: leading the way into the darkness.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 19.
text: He treads lightly, past the squeaking swing set, planning to
dialog: sneak up on whatever got to the chickens.
text: He hears a dripping near a tall tree. He limps toward it. He
text: stops to listen.
text: DROPS OF BLOOD fall onto his face.
text: He wipes at his face, his hand slick with blood. What the
dialog: hell?
text: He looks up -
text: There's a MANGLED CHICKEN CARCASS lodged in the branches.
text: He walks further and discovers -
text: A few more CHICKEN CARCASSES scattered throughout the
text: property, torn open, entrails smeared along the ground.
dialog: Then -
text: A RUSTLING FROM THE CORNFIELD. Kyle spins.
text: SOMETHING'S IN THERE.
text: WHISPERING STRANGE NOISES - a kind of ALIEN GIBBERISH.
text: Kyle steadies his rifle.
text: He HEADS INTO THE DARK CORNFIELD.
text: He uses the barrel of the rifle to nudge aside leafy corn
text: stalks.
text: His heart is pounding. His breath shallow. His footsteps
text: CRUNCHING dry leaves.
text: He can see SPLATTERS OF BLOOD on the leaves of corn.
text: He goes deeper into the cornfield. Now almost engulfed by the
text: stalks. He can barely see a foot in front of him.
text: He comes out on an empty space between the rows of corn.
text: All is silent. He listens for the intruder.
dialog: Then -
text: SOMETHING BLEATS AT KYLE FROM HIS SIDE!
text: Kyle SPINS WITH THE RIFLE -
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 20.
text: He relaxes. It's a HORRIBLY WOUNDED CHICKEN, one wing ripped
text: off, a chunk of flesh missing, squawking in agony, stumbling
dialog: in circles.
text: Kyle aims the rifle point blank at the thing and FIRES,
text: putting it out of its misery. The shot echoes miles away.
text: Kyle stands in the cornfield with his rifle. He calls out to
dialog: the darkness -—
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Fuck you, wolf! I outrank you on
dialog: the food chain! You come round
dialog: again, I'll kill your ass!
text: No reply. Kyle is alone amid a vast sea of corn stalks.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Benjamin heads toward the truck, where Kyle packs camping
text: supplies. He wears a t-shirt, a backpack over his shoulders.
text: He seems more inward, more distant, than he did earlier.
text: Tori calls out from a wraparound porch -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin, where's your jacket?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I don't need one.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: It's 40 degrees!
text: Benjamin slumps his shoulders and sulks.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine, I'll get it.
dialog: She goes -
scene_heading: INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE
text: Through the kitchen and living room.
text: She hastens upstairs.
dialog: Into -
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 21.
scene_heading: BENJAMIN'S BEDROOM
text: Tori sifts through the clutter, looking for Benjamin's jacket.
text: She spots it thrown by his bed. She crouches down and notices
text: between the mattress and box spring a SHEAF OF CRINKLED
text: PAPERS. She takes them out and pages through them.
text: From downstairs, Kyle calls -
speaker_heading: KYLE (0.S.)
dialog: Hon? You about ready?
text: Tori is lost in the pages. Concerned.
text: Kyle joins her in the room.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You find it?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I found... something.
text: She hands him the pages. On top is a Target ad featuring
text: models in bikinis. Kyle is amused -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Is this his idea of porn?
text: He sees a Memorial Day Sale mailer with women in bras. He's
dialog: amused -
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mailers from Target - for the truly
dialog: hardcore.
text: He leafs through and finds PAGES FROM AN ANATOMY TEXTBOOK -
text: Medical diagrams of the FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. An
text: illustration of a NAKED FEMALE and her endocrine system. CROSS-
text: SECTIONS OF THE VAGINA, THE CERVIX, THE UTERUS.
scene_heading: PINK TISSUE. TANGLES OF RED AND BLUE VEINS. TECHNICAL. RAW.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Is it just a guy thing?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Not any guy I know. Not this.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 22.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Maybe it's time you had a talk with
dialog: him. You know, birds, bees, et
dialog: cetera.
text: Kyle sighs. He doesn't want to.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Fine. I'll give him the same talk
dialog: my dad gave me: ‘It's the second
text: hole from the back of the neck.'
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Ugh.
text: She swats at him.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON
text: A crisp afternoon, sun dead over the horizon. A cheap domed
text: tent set up at a campsite. Tori takes a couple of gnarled red
text: steaks from a package and salts them.
text: Up the hillside, Kyle and Benjamin crinkle through brown
text: leaves, gathering firewood.
dialog: Kyle tries to be casual -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: So, uh, Ben... I know you just had
dialog: your birthday.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Which means you're a young man,
dialog: your body's starting to change.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: So you might find yourself more and
dialog: more interested in women. And
dialog: women's bodies.
text: Benjamin looks up at Kyle - cold, upset -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Were you in my room?
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 23.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What? No.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I don't like it when people go
dialog: through my private stuff.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Look, I respect that. I was the
dialog: same way at your age - I thought
dialog: about girls all the time, and no
dialog: one ever told me it was okay to
dialog: touch it or play with it.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You know. The, uh - my penis.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: But here's the thing: sex isn't
dialog: about organs and body parts. I
dialog: mean, it is. But it's really about
dialog: finding the right person, falling
dialog: in love.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: And making babies.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Eventually. Even then, that's not
dialog: the only purpose of sex. Your
dialog: mother and I, we still - you know,
dialog: partake. And she can't have babies.
text: Benjamin is taken aback.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That's why we went to an adoption
dialog: agency.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Mom can't have children? Like no
dialog: matter what?
text: Benjamin chews his fingernails, simmering. He looks at Tori,
text: seeming betrayed. Kyle is baffled.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 24.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What's this about? Were you wanting
dialog: a baby brother or sister? Because
dialog: we're happy with you. With the
dialog: three of us.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: That's not it.
text: Kyle gets close to Benjamin, tries to connect with him -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Look, maybe my words came out
dialog: stupid. Just know that you're a
dialog: guy, and you're gonna be feeling
dialog: certain urges about girls you see
dialog: in movies, girls in your class,
dialog: whatever. It's okay to give into
dialog: them now and again.
text: Benjamin looks up at Kyle. He nods, placated.
scene_heading: INT. CAITLYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Benjamin's classmate Caitlyn lies on her comforter in pajama
text: bottoms and a t-shirt, talking on her phone, her frizzy hair
text: dangling over the foot of the bed.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: Okay... Jesus, I'm at, like, zero
dialog: percent, so I should probably go.
text: Caitlyn rises and crosses toward her desk. She passes her
text: second-story window and doesn't see - outside - A BLURRY
text: FIGURE IN HER YARD, WATCHING HER.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN (CONT’D)
dialog: (on her phone, laughing)
dialog: Same to you, dork. Mwah.
text: She hangs up her phone and sets it on her desk. She plugs it
text: into her charger. Her home screen blinks weirdly and goes
text: dead. Probably out of battery. Caitlyn turns off her lights.
text: She passes her window again. This time the figure is CLOSER -
scene_heading: SOMEHOW RIGHT OUTSIDE HER WINDOW - HOVERING.
text: Caitlyn plops into her bed, throws covers over herself.
text: We see, behind Caitlyn - HER WINDOW IS OPEN. The LONG CURTAINS
scene_heading: FLUTTERING LIGHTLY.
text: Caitlyn nestles into her pillow. She closes her eyes.
dialog: 25.
text: Everything calm and quiet.
dialog: Then she hears -
scene_heading: EERIE MUSIC PLAYING.
text: Something spooky and romantic, like Mazzy Star.
text: Caitlyn is terrified. She lifts her head and sees -
text: Her laptop is OPEN, GLOWING. The song playing on iTunes.
text: She gets out of bed.
text: She approaches her computer, confused. No one in sight. She
text: shuts the laptop. The music stops.
text: She turns around to head to bed.
text: THE MUSIC PLAYS AGAIN BEHIND HER.
text: Caitlyn sees her laptop open again. Her heart rate quickens.
text: She's almost shaking with fear.
text: She slams the laptop shut. She stacks heavy books on the lid.
text: Her room now silent.
text: She notices the accordion doors on her closet SLIGHTLY AJAR.
text: She slowly advances toward it.
text: She reaches out to the knob of the door...
text: She grasps it and -
text: SLOWLY SLIDES THE ACCORDION DOORS. They SQUEAK open.
text: The closet is pitch black.
text: Caitlyn reaches up, pulls a chain, and turns on a bare light
dialog: bulb.
text: Just clothes on hangars. Shoe boxes. Piles of old toys and
dialog: board games.
text: Caitlyn steels herself and - QUICKLY PARTS THE CLOTHES ON
speaker_heading: HANGARS —
text: Just a plain wall behind the clothes.
text: She parts more hangars.
text: Then a couple more.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 26.
dialog: Then parts another -
text: A FACE GLARES AT HER!
dialog: She jumps back!
text: It's just an old RAG DOLL with a torn-up face.
text: Caitlyn lowers her guard.
text: She turns off the closet light. Closes the door, turns, and -
text: - walks, oblivious, DIRECTLY PAST BENJAMIN STANDING BEHIND HER
scene_heading: LONG FLUTTERING CURTAINS.
dialog: 
text: The hair on her neck raises. She senses something awful and
dialog: terrifying -
text: She sees BENJAMIN STARING AT HER, CURTAINS SWIRLING AROUND HIM
text: IN THE NIGHT AIR.
text: CAITLYN LETS OUT A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM.
text: She TURNS TO RUN OUT OF HER ROOM. The door SWINGS OPEN -
text: A DARK SILHOUETTE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY - WRAPPING UP CAITLYN
text: IN HER ARMS.
dialog: It's her mom, ERICA.
text: Caitlyn is crying.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: What's wrong? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: Someone's there! By the curtains!
text: Erica flips on the LIGHTS.
text: She approaches the windows -
text: Slowly. Cautiously.
text: She grasps the curtains -
text: AND OPENS THEM.
text: There's no one there. The window is closed. Nothing amiss. But
text: Caitlyn is a wreck.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Honey, no one's here.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 27.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: He was right there. I think it
dialog: was... this kid from my class.
text: Erica is dubious.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Were you watching scary movies on
dialog: your phone again?
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: I wasn't, I swear.
text: But even Caitlyn is starting to doubt herself.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN (CONT’D)
dialog: Can I sleep in your bed tonight?
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Of course. Of course.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPING TENT - NIGHT
text: Tori STARTLES AWAKE.
text: She's in a sleeping bag next to Kyle in their tent. She feels
text: at an empty sleeping bag - Benjamin is gone.
text: The tent door is unzipped, flaps blowing in the breeze. Just
text: crickets and katydids outside.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin?
dialog: Kyle wakes -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin - he's gone.
text: The two of them scramble out of the tent. Kyle calls out -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Ben!
text: In a panic she grabs a flashlight. Kyle starts to split from
dialog: Tori -
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You check that way, I'll take over
dialog: here.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 28.
text: Tori nods nervously and goes into the forest.
text: She shines the flashlight everywhere. Acres of trees receding
text: into total darkness.
text: She's alone. She hears a FLUTTER somewhere in the trees, a
text: crow SQUAWKING.
text: She looks behind her. No sign of Kyle. The embers of the
text: campfire receding into the night. She's scared.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin, can you hear me?... Where
dialog: are you, baby?
text: Tori hears RUSTLING IN THE TREES ABOVE. Seeds and acorns
text: dropping around her.
text: She shines the flashlight up into the tall trees - vertiginous,
text: dizzying, casting eerie shadows. She thinks she sees SOMETHING
text: MOVING UP THERE.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Benjamin?
text: Her flashlight starts to flicker and spasm.
text: Tori rattles it, trying to jar the batteries back into place.
text: The light goes back on. She shines it up. Nothing up there.
text: She lowers the flashlight -
text: BENJAMIN IS DIRECTLY BEHIND HER.
text: Tori startles - then loosens.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God, Benjamin! Where were
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
text: Taking a pee.
text: Tori lets out a huge laugh.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Did I scare you? I didn't mean to.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (still laughing)
dialog: No, it's just... You had me and
dialog: your dad pretty freaked.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 29.
text: She hugs her son.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just glad you're here.
scene_heading: EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
text: The school day is over. Benjamin is at the end of the walkway
text: in front of the school, apart from other kids, as he sits
text: hunched over his notebook, wearing headphones and doodling.
text: A ways back from him, Tori wears a Hy-Vee employee polo, walks
text: with her sister Merilee, deep in conversation -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You don't think I should take him
dialog: to someone? A professional maybe?
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: For what? Talking back to his dad
dialog: and keeping weird jerk-off material
dialog: under his mattress?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: It's more than that. Benjamin was
dialog: always my special little guy. Such
dialog: sweetness. But lately he's...
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Uh - yeah, it's called puberty.
text: Merilee laughs, but Tori is pensive. She wants to say more.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, Benjamin is highly gifted.
dialog: Kids like him are often anxious,
dialog: depressed, they may have problems
dialog: integrating socially. What appears
dialog: troubling to you is actually normal
dialog: for his age. He'll grow out of it.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I hear you. Maybe I'm overreacting.
text: Merilee wraps Tori in a soothing hug, then breaks it off -
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Sorry, I'm late for my 3 o'clock.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Go.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 30.
text: Merilee hustles off.
text: Tori approaches Benjamin from behind. We can hear, muffled,
text: the same song that played in Caitlyn's bedroom.
text: She peers over Benjamin's shoulder and sees what he's doodling
text: - VARIATIONS ON HIS INITIALS, LOTS OF STYLIZED B'S, next to
text: sketches of CAPES AND MASKS.
text: Tori sees Benjamin obsessing over a CRUDE BALLPOINT DRAWING OF
text: CAITLYN'S FACE with her frizzy hair, HER EYES WIDE AND
speaker_heading: FEARFUL.
text: Tori zeroes in on the drawing - leaning in - closer -
text: BENJAMIN TURNS SUDDENLY, STARTLING HER. GLARING AT HIM. Tori
text: is flustered.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Um... who is she?
text: Benjamin closes his notebook shut. He storms into the parking
text: lot toward Tori's car.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry!
text: She follows after him.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: She's cute, by the way!
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT
text: Kyle sits at an old desk in the study. Just a desk lamp on. He
text: has his iPad and checkbook open, bills spread out before him.
text: He picks up a certified letter from the local bank. Not good.
text: He tears it open. Scans the letter.
dialog: We catch scraps of the letter -
text: "NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE"
dialog: ",..missed payments..."
dialog: "Property to be sold within 90 days unless..."
text: Kyle sets the letter down.
text: He sits there, fuming - then, overcome, he crumples the
text: letter. So angry he wants to crawl out of his skin.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 31.
text: He looks through the open doorway and sees Tori fiddling with
text: a flickering light bulb.
text: Kyle goes to the door and CLOSES IT quietly.
text: He pulls up his pant leg and unstraps a plastic PROSTHESIS -
text: an artificial leg from the knee down. He sighs, some pain
dialog: relieved.
text: He opens a bottom desk drawer.
text: Reaches behind some hanging files, deep in back -
text: And pulls out something bundled inside an old sock.
text: He unfurls it to reveal a PILL BOTTLE OF OXYCONTIN.
text: He twists off the cap, shakes out a couple of pink pills.
text: He swallows the pills, sits back, and waits for them to change
dialog: him.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - STUDY - LATER
text: Later in the evening, Kyle is in a fog - drooly, nearly passed
dialog: out.
text: He hears a DIGITAL CHIME.
text: Kyle perks up a bit. Orients himself.
text: He looks down at the iPad on his desk.
text: An ALERT from the security cam. Something moving outside.
text: Kyle opens his home security app -
text: He sees the EERIE BLACK-AND-WHITE NIGHT-VISION ON THE CHICKEN
text: COOP. All seems still.
text: Then, suddenly, CLOSE UP OF WINGS FLAPPING, a fury of
text: feathers. Chickens are dying.
text: Kyle, creeped out, sees WHITE WISPS amid the chicken coop. The
text: footage is jagged - freezing and skipping.
text: He REWINDS the footage and freezes the frame.
text: He sees what looks like a BLUR.
text: Kyle is confused. He un-pauses the image.
text: The footage plays. Kyle peers closer -
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 32.
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: A HAND JUTS INTO FRAME.
text: Kyle can make out A WHITE FIGURE - GHOSTLY, BLURRY, WITH
scene_heading: LUMINESCENT EYES.
text: He's horrified.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - CELLAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Kyle, holding the iPad, leads Tori down rickety wooden stairs.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Kyle! What is this about?
text: They get to the bottom of the stairs. At one time an old root
text: cellar - stone walls, low ceiling - now a laundry room lit by
text: a bare light bulb.
text: Kyle - agitated, clammy - fidgets.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It was a person.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: What was?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I saw something in the chicken
dialog: coop. Wasn't a wolf. Wasn't an
dialog: animal. It was a person.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: A person?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (apologetic, emotional)
dialog: Babe, I think it may've been
dialog: Benjamin.
text: She looks at him askance -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: No.
text: He opens up the security cam footage on the iPad, presses
text: play, and shows it to her.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: This is from the camera I put up.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 33.
text: She hears the audio - fluttering and tearing - but THE VIDEO
text: IS PIXILLATED, CORRUPTED.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: There's nothing here.
text: Kyle is confused. He takes the iPad back, tries to find the
dialog: footage.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don't know what's going on. There
text: was someone. A hand.
text: Tori slumps as he prattles on -
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: This was our fear. All along.
dialog: Abnormal shit. Truly out-there
dialog: shit.
text: Tori stares at him pitifully.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You see what I'm saying, don't you?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (solemn, direct)
dialog: You're doing it again.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: The Oxy.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: That's... No. That's ridiculous.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You have that look in your eye,
dialog: you're talking crazy -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No, I haven't -
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: Tori, that's not what this is
dialog: about.
text: She gives him a withering stare.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 34.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: It would make a lot more sense that
dialog: your new camera is broken than that
dialog: our son magically killed a bunch of
dialog: chickens.
text: Kyle is chastened. Tori walks up the stairs.
text: Kyle turns to the iPad. He presses play, sees only CORRUPTED
speaker_heading: DATA.
text: The footage is a pixilated mishmash, almost taunting him. He's
text: frustrated, defeated, wondering if he really is seeing things.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY
text: A red-haired 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL stands with her hands folded
text: across her chest, her eyes closed.
text: She lets herself FREE FALL BACKWARD - into a circle of other
text: kids who pass her around, her eyes closed, a version of the
dialog: trust game Willow in the Wind.
text: Benjamin is on one side of the circle, Caitlyn on the other.
text: He looks at her. She looks away, unsettled.
text: A P.E. teacher blows his whistle.
scene_heading: P.E. TEACHER
dialog: Okay now - there we go! When we
dialog: trust each other, good things
dialog: happen!
text: He looks at Benjamin.
speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You're up next, big guy.
text: Benjamin dutifully enters the middle of the circle.
speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's hear it for Benjamin!
text: Some kids clap. Benjamin stands up straight, folds his arms

speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Nothing to be afraid of! Your
dialog: classmates have your back -
dialog: literally!
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 35.
text: Benjamin closes his eyes. He lets himself fall.
text: Caitlyn watches, fearful, as kids PASS BENJAMIN around the
dialog: circle.
text: Someone passes him to Caitlyn. She steps aside and LETS HIM
speaker_heading: DROP.
text: He SPRAWLS ONTO THE GYM FLOOR. The other kids ooh and wince.
text: Royce laughs. Benjamin lies there, unmoving, SEETHING INSIDE.
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: Way to trust the floor, Breyer!
text: The teacher rushes to Benjamin -
scene_heading: P.E. TEACHER
dialog: You okay, bud?
text: He gingerly lifts Benjamin into a sitting position.
text: Some students cringe, others giggle. Benjamin glares at
text: Caitlyn.
speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it, Caitlyn. Give him a hand
dialog: up.
text: Caitlyn is terrified to go near Benjamin.
speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (warning)
text: Caitlyn.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: He's a pervert.
text: Royce and his buddy Fauxhawk laugh. Benjamin fumes. He stares

speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: You lie.
scene_heading: P.E. TEACHER
dialog: Hold on now - we're all on the same
dialog: team here. Caitlyn, help him up.
text: Caitlyn hesitates.
speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Help him up or you fail this class.
text: Caitlyn squirms.
dialog: 36.
dialog: Then -
text: She reluctantly reaches her hand down to Benjamin.
text: Benjamin grasps her hand.
scene_heading: HE SQUEEZES IT.
text: TORRENTIAL PAIN hitting Caitlyn hard.
text: Benjamin stays LOCKED IN ON HER. A fixed beam of rage.
speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Benjamin!
text: Caitlyn lets out an ANIMAL WAIL OF PAIN.
speaker_heading: P.E. TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Let_go!
text: Benjamin squeezes tighter. His grip like an industrial
dialog: machine.
text: THE BONES IN CAITLYN'S HAND SNAPPING. Then GROUND TO DUST.
text: The other kids PANIC - WHIMPERING - SCREAMING.
text: Benjamin GRINDS HIS HAND INTO A FIST, then lets go.
text: The P.E. Teacher rushes in to help Caitlyn -
text: She falls back, bawling, clutching her wrist, HER HAND HANGING
scene_heading: LOOSE, NOTHING BUT PULP - A BAGGY MONSTROSITY.
text: The other kids SHRIEK.
text: Benjamin's eyes brim with satisfaction.
text: He's at peace.
scene_heading: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON
text: Hand-held. We're moving - quickly. Kyle, drenched by rain,

text: Past a young female sheriff's deputy, walkie squawking.
text: He approaches the sound of PEOPLE YELLING.
text: He rounds a corner and enters a -

speaker_heading: RECEPTION AREA
text: Tori - in her work polo - argues with Caitlyn's mom Erica.
text: CHIEF DEPUTY TOM DEEVER - 45, brawny, wearing a khaki sheriff

dialog: the side.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Did you see my daughter's hand?!
dialog: Did you see it?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I'm sorry she's in pain, Erica, but

speaker_heading: ERICA

speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Suspended? He should be arrested!
speaker_heading: DEEVER

dialog: taken aback.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Last Saturday night he was camping
dialog: with us. Thirty miles away!
text: Kyle glances at Benjamin, wondering if he was really with them
text: the entire night.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: (to Tori)
dialog: You just can't admit there's
dialog: something seriously fucked up with
dialog: your kid.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Because he's adopted there's
dialog: something wrong with him? That's -
dialog: beyond disgusting. We're done here.
text: Tori goes to get Benjamin. Erica badgers her -
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Who's his father? Some kind of
dialog: serial killer?
text: Tori escorts Benjamin out of the office. Benjamin passes Erica
text: and GLARES AT HER, DEAD-EYED, COLD.
text: Deever positions himself in front of Erica, trying to calm her
text: down. Benjamin walks out with his parents, never breaking his
text: gaze at Erica.
scene_heading: INT. TORI AND KYLE'S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Raining outside - thunder GROANING. Tori changes out of her

speaker_heading: KYLE

speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: This is what you care about right
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I care about my family!
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Then start showing it.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: This is how I show it. By holding
dialog: him accountable. Not by slathering
text: him with love and telling him how
dialog: damn exceptional he is.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: He is exceptional, Kyle. He is. The
dialog: two of us were trying - forever -
text: to have a child, then he arrives.
dialog: This miracle.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (derisively)
dialog: Yeah, his behavior has been so
dialog: miraculous lately.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Ask Merilee - everything he's going
dialog: through is normal for his age.
text: Kyle levels his gaze at her -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Tori, he may look like us, but he's
dialog: not us. He's never bled, not once
dialog: in his whole life. Never had a cut.
text: Or a broken bone. Or a bruise. And
dialog: now he's hurting people. Erica was
dialog: right - there is something fucked
dialog: up about him.
text: Tori simmers. Upset. Then -
speaker_heading: TORI
text: He does bleed.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 40.

speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: He cut his hand, that night when he

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: TORI
text: Out in the barn. He found the pod.
text: Kyle is stunned. Furious.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Why the fuck didn't you tell me?!
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Because I knew you'd react like
dialog: this. You always, always thought he
dialog: was something to hide, something to
dialog: be ashamed of -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You_don't get to make decisions
dialog: like that for me!
text: He grabs his jacket, starts to leave.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Out. Don't wait up.
text: He hobbles out of the room and down the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Tori sits at the dining room table, her laptop open before
text: her. She pops open a bottle of beer, takes a swig.
dialog: She types into Google -
dialog: childhood developmental disorders
text: - and presses return. It yields a flurry of results - her eyes
dialog: scanning phrases for meaning, answers -
text: Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder... Encopresis...
dialog: Oppositional Defiant Disorder...
text: She goes to take another drink.
dialog: 41.
text: From upstairs she hears -—
text: A LOUD THUD, like a body hitting the floor.
text: She sets the drink down. Listens.
text: She hears a MUFFLED UNEARTHLY MOAN. PAINED. ALMOST ANIMAL.
text: She leaps up and hastens -—
scene_heading: UP THE STAIRS
text: She heads down the hallway. Toward Benjamin's room.
text: She can hear a SMALL RACKET from inside his room, like objects
text: being thrown about.
text: She tries the door but it's locked. She knocks.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin?
text: She can make out the MUMBLED ALIEN GIBBERISH.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Open the door - please.
text: She bangs on the door with the palm of her hand.

scene_heading: INSIDE BENJAMIN'S ROOM
scene_heading: THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN - DRAPES FLAPPING INWARD - BENJAMIN IN
speaker_heading: HIS PAJAMAS -

text: TORI SCRAMBLES ONTO THE BED -—
text: SHE PULLS DOWN BENJAMIN.
text: FIGHTING WITH THE VIOLENT ENERGY SURGING THROUGH HIM.
text: SHE CORRALS HIM TO THE BED. WRAPS HIM IN HER ARMS.
text: BENJAMIN SEEMS TO SNAP OUT OF IT.
text: He's disoriented - his eyes crazed, savage. Tori grips his
text: face with her hands - desperately trying to soothe him -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin - you're okay - you're
dialog: okay...
text: Benjamin is confused about where he is.
text: He catches his breath. He studies his mother.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm with you now.
text: She cradles him.
text: Benjamin looks directly at Tori. Then -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Who am I?
text: Tori stammers, searching for the right words -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You're... you're our son, you —
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Where did I come from?
text: Tori knew this moment would come. She knows she has to level
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin... I know things have been
dialog: difficult for you. I know you feel
dialog: different from other kids. And you
dialog: are different.
dialog: (slowly, candidly)
dialog: You are not from our world. We did
dialog: not adopt you from an agency. You
dialog: came here, in some... pod. From
dialog: where I don't know.
text: Benjamin nods, processing, almost resigned.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 43.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: You are special. A gift.
text: She grasps his hand in hers.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: There will be people who don't
dialog: believe who you are and what you
dialog: can do. That's why you have to show
dialog: them that you are virtuous. And
dialog: kind. And good.
text: Benjamin can see his purpose.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Thank you, Mom. Everything makes
dialog: sense now.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You have been sent here to do great

scene_heading: INT. CAITLYN'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Caitlyn is propped up in bed, recuperating, her right hand in
text: a bulging cast, her bones pinned with an external frame.
text: A bowl of soup sits on a tray in front of her. She tries to
text: eat it with her left hand. Her hand shaking. Struggling to
text: lift the spoon to her mouth.
text: She sets the spoon down and sees - in the doorway - BENJAMIN,
text: holding flowers. SHE JOLTS. Instantly petrified.
text: Benjamin enters the bedroom.
text: Caitlyn leaps from bed. She backs away from him.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I got you flowers.
text: She drifts toward the corner of her room, terrified.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: You can't.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 44.
text: She's on edge. His demeanor is steady, placid.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Don't be scared. I want to talk to
dialog: you.
text: Benjamin slowly walks closer to her.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know what karma is? It's
dialog: when you do something bad, and then
dialog: something bad happens to you. It's
dialog: another name for justice.
text: Benjamin is almost upon her. Caitlyn is in agony.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's why, from now on, you should
dialog: be careful what you say about me.
dialog: Or karma might happen to you.
text: Benjamin's face is next to hers. She can feel his breath. A
text: tear rolls down her cheek.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you understand?
text: She closes her eyes, wincing, horrified.
speaker_heading: CAITLYN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Yes.
text: She opens her eyes.

text: Caitlyn is shaken. Exposed. She starts to weep.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: No dude, Olivia's trash.
speaker_heading: FAUXHAWK
dialog: Then who would you pick?
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 45.
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: I guess Caitlyn. When she had two
dialog: hands.
text: They both burst out laughing as they approach the arched stone
text: entrance to an old dark TRAIN TUNNEL, graffiti blanketing the
text: sides. All around them, an uproar of SQUAWKING CROWS.
text: The boys notice, sitting above the tunnel, a SLIGHT FIGURE
scene_heading: WEARING A RED CAPE AND MASK - THE EYES AND MOUTH HOLES JAGGED
text: AND TERRIFYING - HIS LEGS DANGLING OVER THE ARCHWAY.
speaker_heading: FAUXHAWK
dialog: Jump, bitch!
text: They both laugh. The figure just watches them.
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: Yo, nice mask.
text: They laugh some more as they ride under the archway, the
text: figure silently looking down at them.
dialog: The guys ride their bikes into -
scene_heading: THE DARK TRAIN TUNNEL
text: Lit only by fading light from each end. The deeper they ride,
text: the darker it gets. Royce makes mock ghost noises -
speaker_heading: ROYCE
speaker_heading: Qooo00000!
text: They ride into the tunnel until it's pitch black. We can't see
dialog: a thing.
text: We HEAR a STRANGE WHISKING NOISE, then the sound of the boys
text: being pitched and thrown to the ground, their metal bikes
text: crashing, wheels spinning.
text: Royce wails in agony.
speaker_heading: FAUXHAWK (0.S.)
dialog: (scared)
dialog: What was that? What was that?
text: Royce whimpers and mumbles incoherently.
text: Fauxhawk turns on the flashlight on his phone and shines a pin
text: light on Royce. HIS NOSE BLEEDS, HIS MOUTH GUSHES THICK BLOOD.
text: ROYCE PULLS BROKEN TEETH FROM HIS GUMS. He's in a daze.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: Something hit me.
speaker_heading: FAUXHAWK
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: No... no...
text: He moves the pin light over Royce's shoulder and sees -
text: standing near their bikes - THE FIGURE IN THE MASK AND CAPE.
speaker_heading: FAUXHAWK (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh God, oh God...
text: THE FIGURE WALKS TOWARD THEM.
speaker_heading: FAUXHAWK (CONT’D)
dialog: (squealing)
dialog: Royce! We gotta go!
text: Fauxhawk helps a dazed Royce to his feet.
text: They scramble as fast as they can toward the light at the end
dialog: of the tunnel.
speaker_heading: FAUXHAWK (CONT’D)
dialog: Don't look back! Don't look back!
text: Royce starts to whimper and cry. The two boys run.
text: They make it to the end of the tunnel -
text: BOTH BOYS ARE KNOCKED DOWN.
text: THEY'RE DRAGGED BACK INTO THE DARKNESS, SCREAMING AND KICKING.
text: They try to crawl away, but something flips them over.
text: A foot pressed down on Royce's chest. He can barely breathe.
text: The MASKED FIGURE looks down on the two of them.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Don't cross me.
text: Royce recognizes the voice as Benjamin's. He gasps helplessly -
speaker_heading: ROYCE
dialog: Breyer?
dialog: (struggling to breathe)
dialog: Don't hurt me. Please.
text: The pressure is released from his chest. Royce sits up.
dialog: 47.
text: They look down the tunnel to see the silhouette of Benjamin
text: walking away, his cape fluttering behind him.
scene_heading: INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - NIGHT
text: A small-town Dairy Queen-like joint that has BBQ sandwiches,
text: soft-serve ice cream, etc. Out in the middle of nowhere. Erica
text: locks up from inside, turns a door sign to CLOSED.
text: The place is lit by bright fluorescents, the windows fogged up
text: in the chill night air.
text: Erica - all in one shot - makes her way to a cash register
text: behind the front counter. She opens it up with a DING. Pulls
text: out the cash drawer. Closes it. Sets the drawer on the
dialog: counter.
text: She looks up and sees - written in the precipitation on all
dialog: the windows -
speaker_heading: DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE
speaker_heading: DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE
speaker_heading: DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE
text: She's disturbed.
text: The overhead fluorescent lights FLICKER.
text: Erica growing more concerned.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: Okay, who's fucking with me?
text: The fluorescent bulbs SPASM ERRATICALLY, buzzing faintly,
text: throwing Erica in and out of darkness.
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: That you, Rick?
dialog: No reply.
text: Erica climbs on top of the front counter.
text: She reaches up to one of the flickering lights. She strains to
dialog: touch it.
text: She taps at the long tube. The light goes on for a moment -
text: Then goes out.
text: She taps the light again - the fluorescent bulb FLARES WHITE
speaker_heading: HOT, then —
dialog: POP!
dialog: 48.
text: THE BULB BURSTS!
text: ERICA TOPPLES OFF THE COUNTER. LANDS ON THE FLOOR, HARD ON HER
speaker_heading: SHOULDER.
text: SHE MOANS IN SEVERE PAIN.
text: Through bursts of flickering light -
text: She tries to prop herself up. Her face is CUT UP, BLEEDING.
text: Jagged shards of glass fall from her cheek.
text: She whimpers. Mewling. Her right eye stinging. A searing
dialog: agony.
text: A SMALL SHARD OF GLASS JUTS OUT OF THE PUPIL OF ERICA'S RIGHT
speaker_heading: EYE.
text: She reaches up to it, letting out tiny cries, her hand
dialog: shaking.
text: She manages to pinch the shard of glass with her fingertips -
text: She holds her breath -
text: AND STARTS TO PULL OUT THE GLASS SHARD FROM HER EYE.
dialog: 
scene_heading: IMPOSSIBLY LONG. BURIED DEEP. COVERED IN BLOOD.
text: SHE PULLS IT OUT, CASTS IT ASIDE.
text: Erica tries to see through the blood, her vision blurred and
text: jagged. Lights flickering amid the darkness - a strobe effect.
text: She looks up and sees, standing over her, in a nightmare burst
text: of flicking light - BENJAMIN IN HIS RED MASK AND CAPE.
text: The light flickers again and he's gone. She can hear him on
text: all sides of her. Everything blurry and confusing.
text: Erica howls out in rage -—
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Get out of here!
text: Erica scrambles behind the counter.
text: Half-blind, she frantically feels underneath the counter -
text: finds what she's looking for: A BASEBALL BAT.
text: She tries to stand - SWINGING THE BAT WILDLY - GRUNTING LIKE
speaker_heading: AN ANIMAL —
dialog: 49,
text: WITH EACH FLICKER OF LIGHT BENJAMIN APPEARS TO BE ELSEWHERE.
scene_heading: NEAR. FAR. ON HER LEFT. HER RIGHT.
text: Erica knocks over displays and condiment dispensers, swinging
dialog: the bat at Benjamin -
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Leave me the fuck alone!
text: She can't fend him off. He seems to be all around her. She's
dialog: losing her mind.
speaker_heading: ERICA (CONT'D)
dialog: Nooo!
text: She swings hard at Benjamin - misses - and HITS A BIG METAL
text: SODA STATION. THE BAT GETS JACKED OUT OF HER HAND and goes
text: spiraling across the floor.
text: She can't find it through the bursts of light. BENJAMIN
text: APPEARS IN FRONT OF HER.
text: Erica howls, turns, and runs toward the back area of the
text: joint, knocking over tables.
text: She staggers down a short back hallway, and comes to a walk-in
dialog: freezer.
text: She lifts the long master lock hanging loose on the latch,
dialog: then enters -
scene_heading: A WALK-IN FREEZER
text: She slams the door shut behind her and locks the handle tight.
text: The air is frigid. But Erica is safe.
text: She can see her terrified breath in the flickers of light.
text: Her breathing slows.
text: She listens for noise on the other side of the door.
text: She hears nothing.
text: And then an eerie HISSING NOISE. Something CRACKLING.
text: A pinpoint dot near the door handle starts to RIPPLE AND MELT.
text: SCALDING FROM INTENSE RADIATION.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: No. No. No.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 50.
text: She backs away from the door. Freaked out. The INTENSE HEAT
text: CARVING A HOLE AROUND THE DOOR HANDLE.
text: Erica retreats further into the walk-in freezer, amid shelves
text: of frozen food. Lights spasming. Nowhere to hide.
text: She looks all around her, braced, ready -
text: In the flicker of light we can see - ABOVE HER — BENJAMIN IN
speaker_heading: HIS MASK.
text: Erica turns - looks up - too late - BENJAMIN SWOOPS DOWN ON
text: HER, THE MOUTH HOLE IN HIS MASK AGAPE, HIS EYES GLOWING RED.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT EVENING
text: Kyle plops a serving of mac 'n' cheese onto his plate. He's
text: uneasy, doesn't want to be here.
text: Tori sits to one side of him at the dining room table.
text: Benjamin on the other, hands folded, staring calmly.
text: Everyone has food on their plates.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (mutters )
dialog: Let's say grace.
text: He reaches out to either side of him - Tori takes Kyle's hand,
text: but Benjamin keeps his hands folded.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Can I say something first?
text: Kyle looks at Tori - this is unusual.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I'd like to tell you something I'm
dialog: grateful for.
text: Tori smiles.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)

text: Kyle brightens. He closes his eyes -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Thank you Lord for this bounty
dialog: before us...
scene_heading: INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWN
text: A misty morning. Deever and the young female deputy - her name
text: is REYES - saunter throughout the place. The emergency light
text: from their squad car swirls lazily in the parking lot.
text: Deever and Reyes pick their way through the wreckage - smashed-
text: up cups and condiments everywhere. Broken light bulbs.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: You say she hasn't responded to any
dialog: calls or texts?
speaker_heading: REYES
dialog: That's correct. This is the last
dialog: place she was seen. Her daughter
dialog: hasn't heard from her.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: Damn. That poor girl needs her mom
dialog: real bad right now.
text: Deever comes to BROKEN GLASS AND DROPS OF BLOOD near the front
text: counter, the spot where Erica removed the shard from her eye.
text: Deever crouches down to scrutinize it.
speaker_heading: REYES
dialog: Sir?
text: Reyes gestures up toward the ceiling.
text: Deever looks up and sees, scraped into the plaster overhead: a

dialog: notebook.
scene_heading: INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Royce is at his locker gathering books - his lip split, his

text: He closes his locker to reveal Benjamin walking down the hall
text: toward him. Royce is guarded, deferential. Benjamin is calm,
text: dead-eyed.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 52.
text: Royce watches Benjamin pass him by. Fauxhawk sees Benjamin and
text: veers out of the way. All the kids in the school watch
text: Benjamin, hushed, terrified.
text: The word is out. A pall has descended on the school.
scene_heading: INT. COUNSELING OFFICE - LATER
text: A smallish office space - inspirational posters, painted
text: cinderblock walls. Benjamin's aunt Merilee sits in a chair, a

text: Benjamin sits across from her on a small couch.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: So Benjamin - this is your first
dialog: day back since the incident...

speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I wanted to talk to you about how

speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)

dialog: Then -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: That you have to be here,

dialog: Look - Benjamin - I know you
dialog: haven't had the easiest time making
dialog: friends. But I think you're worth
dialog: getting to know.
text: scrunches his face.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MERILEE

scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
text: Fun rock music plays. Kyle and Noah play pool with a couple of

text: Merilee walks right past the window, turns on a lamp on the
text: night table. Now all we can see is her reflection in the
dialog: glass.
text: She gathers more clothes from the laundry hamper. Then reaches
text: under her t-shirt, removes her bra, and throws it in the
dialog: laundry.
text: She turns off the lamp and passes the window. The figure
text: outside is gone.
text: Merilee exits the room and heads downstairs.
text: The music plays. Merilee stops by a side table, picks up a
text: glass of red wine, and drinks. Then, above her -
dialog: 56.
text: A SLIGHT CREAK.
text: Merilee stops drinking.
text: She hears more CREAKS. Across the length of the roof above the
dialog: living room.
dialog: Are those... footsteps?
text: Merilee is suddenly alert. Uneasy.
text: She sets down the wineglass.
text: She goes to the front door - opens - and steps outside -
scene_heading: EXT. NOAH AND MERILEE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: The house is off a lonely rural road. Crickets rattling.
text: Merilee slowly backs her way down her front driveway to get a
text: better angle on the roof.
text: She stands on her tiptoes, trying to see if anyone is up
dialog: there.
text: She backs up further -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (0.S.)
dialog: Aunt Merilee?
text: Merilee JUMPS. Benjamin is behind her, in the middle of the
text: driveway, wearing his backpack. Merilee laughs at herself.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Benjamin! What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I was thinking about you.
dialog: Merilee is confused.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: You said if I fell behind in any of
dialog: my schoolwork that your door is
dialog: always open. I've been falling
text: behind in social studies.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: How'd you get here?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I walked.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 57.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Five miles?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: You know what, maybe I should head
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: No, I'll call your mom, have her
dialog: pick you up.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: She's working late tonight.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Okay, well. Noah's out and I'm in
dialog: no shape to drive, so... Why don't
dialog: you just come on in?
text: Merilee heads back toward her front door. Benjamin follows
dialog: her.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Tori is in her work polo. She sets down takeout bags on the
text: kitchen table. She calls out -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin! I have sesame chicken!
text: She goes through the living room turning on lights. The
text: grandfather clock TICK-TOCKS.
text: Tori walks a few steps up the stairs -—
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Benjamin?
scene_heading: INT. NOAH AND MERILEE'S HOUSE - LATER
text: Benjamin stands in an open kitchen - out of Merilee's
text: eyesight - pouring himself a glass of water. A mellow steel-
text: guitar country song plays in the other room.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (0.S.)
text: Ice cubes are in the bottom
dialog: freezer!
text: Benjamin fills up her glass with red wine. He then takes out a
text: Ziploc bag that contains FOUR PINK PILLS - Kyle's OxyContin.
dialog: 58.
text: He squeezes the bag, powdering the pills between his fingers,
text: then DUMPS THEM INTO THE GLASS OF WINE.
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
text: Malik sinks the 8 ball. He and Travis slap five.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: One more?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: (tipsy)
dialog: Naw man - I don't get home soon
dialog: Merilee's gonna kill me.
text: Kyle intercepts Noah as he puts on his jacket.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Sure you're okay?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: (shrugging him off)
dialog: It's just a few miles down the
dialog: road.
text: Kyle nods. Noah zips up his jacket.
scene_heading: INT. NOAH AND MERILEE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Benjamin carries both the glass of water and wine into the
text: other room. Merilee sits on a cushy sofa.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Benjamin.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: What?
text: He sets the glass of wine before her.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: I didn't ask for another glass of
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Oh. I feel stupid now.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Don't. It's fine.
text: She takes a drink. Benjamin sits across from her.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: So can I ask you something?
text: Merilee gives him a look: sure.
dialog: She takes
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: How come you don't have any
dialog: children?
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Benjamin!
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Is that inappropriate?
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Of course it is.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: another drink. Her mind starts to drift.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: I'm ready for kids. Noah, not so
dialog: much. I stopped taking the pill a
dialog: few months ago, just to see.
dialog: (catching herself)
dialog: Oh my God, listen to me. You're
dialog: twelve!
text: Merilee really feeling woozy now. Benjamin stares at her. She
text: grows introspective. A little sad.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Noah says things are going so good
dialog: now - why risk messing that up with
dialog: a child?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: If I ever had a child, I'd see it
dialog: as a gift. A miracle.
text: She laughs. Fading. Half-conscious...
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Get back to me in ten years, see if
dialog: you still feel that way.
text: Merilee leans her head back. She looks up at the ceiling.
dialog: The music
text: becomes MUFFLED, DREAMY, DROPS OUT...
text: She mutters something unintelligible then drifts off.
dialog: 60.
text: Benjamin sits across from her, staring at her as she lies
text: there passed out.
text: Several moments pass.
text: He reaches down to his backpack, unzips it. He pulls out his
text: red mask with the mouth and eye holes.
text: He puts it over his head.
text: He stares at Merilee.
scene_heading: EXT. NOAH AND MERILEE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Noah walks from his truck - a flatbed with a fiberglass truck
text: cap - toward his front door.
text: He inserts his key, opens the door, and enters -
speaker_heading: HIS LIVING ROOM
text: A dim lamp on. A doleful song playing eerily. Noah goes into
text: the kitchen, opens the fridge.
text: He grabs a beer, pops it open. He takes a swig as he sifts
text: through mail on the counter.
text: He notices an empty wine bottle on its side on the counter.
text: He hears, from upstairs, a door CREAK SHUT.
dialog: He calls out -
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Mare?
dialog: No answer.
text: Noah turns off the music.
text: The place now DEAD QUIET.
text: Noah makes his way upstairs.
text: He heads down the hallway.
text: The bedroom door is shut.
text: He turns the door knob.
text: The door squeaks open.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE BEDROOM
text: The room almost pitch dark.
text: Noah can make out Merilee SPRAWLED atop the floral comforter,
text: arms and legs akimbo, her long t-shirt hiked over her thighs,
dialog: passed out.
text: Noah crouches next to Merilee. He caresses Merilee's
text: hair. He's unsettled, queasy.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Honey Bear?
text: She's not responsive. He turns on a bedside lamp.
text: BENJAMIN IS BEHIND HIM WEARING HIS RED MASK. HUGE JUMP SCARE.
dialog: 
text: Eyes closed, Merilee mumbles distantly.
text: He's concerned.
text: He stands, turns, and SEES BENJAMIN BEHIND HIM. He FLINCHES -
speaker_heading: NOAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: (shaken, pissed)
dialog: What the fuck?
text: Noah rips off the mask. Benjamin calmly looks back at him.
speaker_heading: NOAH (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I helped put her to bed.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: No - here. In my house. With that
dialog: stupid goddamn mask.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: She was helping me with my
dialog: homework.
text: Noah, furious, grabs Benjamin by the collar -
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Let's go.
text: Noah drags him out of the room.
dialog: Down the stairs. Into -
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: THE LIVING ROOM
text: Noah marches toward the front door, churning.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: I'm very disappointed, Benjamin.
text: Very disappointed.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I didn't do anything.
text: Noah fumes. It takes everything in him not to pound the shit
dialog: out of Benjamin.
text: He makes his way out into -
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Are you going to tell my parents?
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: You're lucky if that's all I do.
text: Noah opens up the passenger door for Benjamin to get in. The
text: door ajar CHIMES. Noah strides toward the driver's side -
text: He notices a light over the garage door FLICKER and BUZZ,
text: shrugs it off, starts to climb behind the wheel. He sees
text: Benjamin is still outside.
text: He storms back over toward the passenger side -
speaker_heading: NOAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamn it, Benjamin!
text: Benjamin stands next to the truck, holding the mask in his
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: You shouldn't say anything to my
dialog: parents.
text: Noah - pissed - grabs Benjamin by the arm -
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: Get in the truck!
text: He throws his weight into Benjamin. Benjamin makes a move - SO
text: CLOSE AND FAST WE CAN BARELY SEE IT -
text: NOAH IS THROWN ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY INTO THE GARAGE DOOR. HIS
scene_heading: RIBS SHATTERED.
dialog: 63.
text: Noah falls in a heap. He gathers himself to his knees.
text: Wheezing. Coughing up blood onto the asphalt.
text: He looks back at Benjamin, who stands there, unmoved. The open
text: car door continues to chime.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I didn't want to hurt you, but you
dialog: made me.
text: Noah sees the coldness in Benjamin's eyes. He crawls toward
text: his truck - pure survival mode.
text: He climbs into the front seat - grimacing.
text: He throws the vehicle into drive and SQUEALS OUT OF HIS
text: DRIVEWAY.
text: The truck TEARS DOWN THE LONG EMPTY ROAD.
text: INSIDE THE TRUCK
text: Noah - rasping, terrified - looks in his side mirror. He sees
text: a GLIMPSE of something, a BLUR.
text: Noah SCREAMING INSIDE. Pure panic.
text: He looks out the side mirror again - nothing there.
text: Then he feels a JOLT - as if something is leaping onto the
dialog: truck cap.
text: He hears footsteps on the roof - what the hell? Noah tries to
dialog: keep his eye on the road -—
text: The truck HEADLIGHTS BROWN OUT. The DASHBOARD LIGHTS FADE.
text: The engine DIES.
text: Noah's truck COMES TO A STOP.
text: Noah tries to start the truck. It clicks over and over.
text: Battery shot. Noah desperately pounds the steering wheel.
text: Noah sits in the middle of country road. Lights out.
text: SURROUNDED BY PITCH BLACKNESS.
text: He's terrified. Hyper-alert. He locks the driver's door. He
text: reaches over and locks the passenger door.
text: He sits there, trapped. His breathing shallow.
text: His headlights flicker -
dialog: 64.
text: Noah can see, up ahead - Benjamin in his mask HOVERING A FEW
text: INCHES ABOVE THE ROAD.
speaker_heading: NOAH
dialog: No. No no no.
text: Noah quivers with fear. Through the flickering headlights he
dialog: sees Benjamin -
speaker_heading: CLOSER -
speaker_heading: THEN CLOSER -
text: HIS MASKED FACE ALMOST ON HIM -—
scene_heading: NOAH SCREAMS AS -—
text: BENJAMIN PLOWS INTO THE THE TRUCK!
text: GLASS PEBBLES FROM THE WINDSHIELD SHATTER INWARD. THE FRONT
scene_heading: CAB ACCORDIONS. NOAH'S LEG SPLINTERS. HIS PELVIS DISLOCATES.
text: THE TRUCK TUMBLING OVER...
text: It comes to a stop.
text: Noah looks down and sees his own blood pooling on the road.
text: He's wedged into the wreckage, the truck resting on its side
text: in the middle of the road.
text: Noah is dazed. His pupils dilated. Blood runs from his jaw
text: hanging loosely, dislocated. He tries to move it into place
text: but it won't stay. His mouth filled with blood.
text: He looks up and sees - through the shattered windshield -
scene_heading: BENJAMIN STANDING THERE.
text: Noah rattles out slow, labored breaths.
text: He sees Benjamin STARTING TO WALK DIRECTLY TOWARD HIM. SLOWLY.
scene_heading: METHODICALLY.
text: Noah reaches into his pocket. Takes out his cell phone.
text: Fingers bloody - shaking - he precariously dials - 9-1-
text: Then DROPS THE PHONE. It clatters onto the hard asphalt.
text: Noah - wedged in, helpless - watches Benjamin approach him, as
dialog: if in a dream.
text: Benjamin squats near him. Leans in close. The slow surf of
text: Noah's breath drawing in.
dialog: 65.
text: Noah gurgles, a faint murmur -
speaker_heading: NOAH (CONT'D)
dialog: What... are you?
text: Benjamin says nothing. Just stares at Noah, scrutinizing him.
text: Noah chokes out a plea - barely audible -
speaker_heading: NOAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me.
text: Benjamin watches, impassive. He reaches out with his finger
text: and INSERTS IT INTO THE OPEN GASH IN NOAH'S NECK.
text: Noah tries to say something but can't.
text: He stops breathing. His eyes glass over. He's dead.
text: Benjamin studies the pearly crimson splotch on his fingertip,
text: almost fascinated.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - LATER
text: Tori and Kyle, keyed up, pace their kitchen. She's on her
dialog: phone -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: Sorry I keep leaving messages,
dialog: Merilee, but it's after ten, we
dialog: still haven't heard from Benjamin.
dialog: Have you seen him at all?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Tori)
dialog: Did he say anything to her at
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (into cell)
dialog: Did he mention somewhere he had to
dialog: be? I know I'm rambling, but I'm
dialog: kinda freaking. So call me. Please.
text: She ends the call, looks at Kyle, and sighs, weary. Kyle gives
text: her a suggestive look.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (too innocent)
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Okay, you told me so. I get it.
text: Kyle sighs, frustrated. Then - the front door CREAKS open.
text: Tori and Kyle rush into the living room -
text: Benjamin ENTERS THE HOUSE. HE'S SHIRTLESS. Holding his
text: wadded-up t-shirt in his fist.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Benjamin! My God. Where were you?
text: Kyle hugs him. Benjamin doesn't hug back.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to your shirt?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I ripped it. Playing soccer.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Is that where you been all this
dialog: time?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Royce and those guys asked if I
dialog: wanted to play after school.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (not buying it)
dialog: Royce asked you to play soccer?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Well, kinda. They started playing
text: rough - elbowing me, tripping me to
dialog: the ground. That's how I tore my
dialog: shirt. So I decided to walk home. I
dialog: should've called, I know.
text: Tori places her hand on Benjamin's shoulder.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I'm so sorry, baby. You okay?
text: He nods. Kyle is leery.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you had anything to eat?
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 67.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I'm not hungry. I just want to go
dialog: to bed.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Okay. Here, I'll wash that -
text: She reaches for his shirt and he pulls it away from her.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Don't worry about it. Thanks.
text: As Benjamin heads upstairs -—
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: ‘Night.
text: Kyle is alone with Tori.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You believe that story?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Why wouldn't I? Royce and those
dialog: boys have been bullying him since
dialog: second grade.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Which he knows you know, which is
dialog: why he came up with that bullshit.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Okay then, what else do you think
dialog: he was out there doing?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don't know what he was doing, I
dialog: don't know who he is. That's the
dialog: whole goddamn point.
text: Kyle sinks into a chair, puts his head in his hands. He feels
text: like he's drowning, and Tori can't help him.
scene_heading: INT. TORI AND KYLE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Middle of the night. Tori asleep. Kyle lying next to her. He
dialog: can't sleep.
text: He pops an OxyContin tablet and leans his head back,
dialog: swallowing it.
text: He hears a SLIGHT CREAK from the hallway floorboards.
dialog: 68.
text: Then the sound of MUFFLED ALIEN GIBBERISH.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Tori? You hear that?
text: She rests peacefully.
text: He gets out of bed.
text: He saunters toward the bedroom door. Opens it.
text: The hallway is dark. Empty.
text: Kyle has trouble getting his bearings. He looks up.
text: He sees BENJAMIN BENT OVER, CONTORTED, CRAWLING ON THE
text: CEILING, HIS EYES ROLLED BACK IN HIS HEAD.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Benjamin?
text: BENJAMIN STARTS TO CRY. HE'S IN PAIN.
text: Kyle reaches up to him -
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come here. It's okay.
text: Benjamin reaches down to his dad -
text: AND GRIPS HIS FACE WITH HIS FINGERTIPS —
dialog: 
text: KYLE TRYING TO SCREAM AS BENJAMIN SLOWLY CRUSHES HIS FACE -
text: KYLE'S BONES SNAPPING - BLOOD AND FLESH SURGING THROUGH
scene_heading: BENJAMIN'S FINGERS —
text: KYLE JOLTS UP_IN BED. SUDDENLY AWAKE FROM HIS DREAM STUPOR.
text: Kyle gathers himself, rattled. Tori sleeps peacefully next to
dialog: him.
text: Kyle peers under the space beneath the closed bedroom door.
dialog: Was he just dreaming?
text: Tori's RINGTONE LOUDLY SPLITS THE NIGHT.
text: She reaches for her phone, mumbles a sleepy hello.
text: She grows troubled. Like the wind's been knocked out of her.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: What?... No... no...
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTY MEDICAL EXAMINER - NIGHT
text: MERILEE SOBS INTO TORI'S SHOULDER as they hold each other
text: tight. Kyle puts a consoling hand on Tori and Merilee's
dialog: backs.
text: They're in a dim hallway. Linoleum floor. Gloomy lighting.
text: Tori - her face red from tears - whispers tenderly -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: It's okay. Let it out.
text: Merilee breaks the embrace, tries to gather herself.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: They won't even let me see him.
dialog: They said he's all -
text: She flutters her hands, indicating Noah is a mess.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Do they know how it happened?
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: He was on Route 18. They think he
text: hit a deer or a cow or something.
dialog: They're gonna do a toxicology
dialog: whatever to see if he was, you
dialog: know, impaired.
text: Tori looks to Kyle, almost accusingly.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: He had, like, two beers. Maybe
dialog: three, I wasn't counting.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Why didn't you drive him home?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No one's even on those roads at
dialog: night.
text: Tori glares at him. Merilee sniffles.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: How's Benjamin?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: We haven't told him yet. Just said
dialog: we had something urgent.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 70.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: So he got home okay?
text: Tori nods yes.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, it's a blur. I don't
dialog: remember when he left exactly.
text: Tori is confused.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Left where?
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: He came over. He wanted help with
dialog: his homework.
text: A FEELING OF DREAD wells up in Tori and Kyle.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Milky first light of morning. Benjamin sits with Kyle and
text: Tori. The two of them have been up all night. They're solemn,
dialog: measured.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: This may be difficult for you to
dialog: hear, but we wanted you to know
dialog: that... your Uncle Noah - he, uh -
text: She's emotional, has trouble finding the words.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: He died last night.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: A car accident.
text: Benjamin takes a deep breath. As if absorbing the news. Kyle
text: studies his reactions.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You all right?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: It's weird. I feel like maybe I
dialog: should cry or something.
text: Benjamin just sits there.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 71.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Now, Benjamin, we know you were at
dialog: Aunt Merilee's last night.
text: Benjamin takes this in, unfazed.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm your mother, and I will always
dialog: defend you. But if you know
dialog: anything about what happened to
dialog: Noah, it's okay to tell us.
text: Benjamin regards his parents for a moment. Then -—
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: All right. I'm gonna be totally
dialog: honest with you.
text: He looks Tori and Kyle in the eye.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
dialog: I was at Aunt Merilee's last night.
dialog: She was helping me with my
dialog: homework. Then she said she was
dialog: tired, so I left, and I saw Noah in
text: the driveway. He was yelling and
text: acting strange, like he was drunk.
dialog: Then he drove off. That's the last
dialog: I saw him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: So all that playing-soccer stuff
dialog: was a lie.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Yes. I made up something that I
dialog: thought would make me sound less -
dialog: I don't know. Less weird.
text: Tori is relieved. Kyle is not.
text: He leans in.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I gotta ask, Benjamin - what other
dialog: things have you been lying about?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (cautioning)
dialog: Kyle.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Were you outside Caitlyn's bedroom
dialog: before you broke her hand?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: He was camping with us, Kyle!
text: Kyle just stares at Benjamin -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Where were you on Wednesday night?
dialog: The night Caitlyn's mom went
dialog: missing?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: This is not helping -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Benjamin)
dialog: What happened to her?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Stop it -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: He's lying to our fucking faces!
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I'm going to go upstairs.
text: Benjamin rises to go.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No - we're getting it all on the
dialog: table! Right now!
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Goddamn it, Kyle!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Benjamin)
dialog: Did you hurt Noah? Did you hurt
dialog: him?
text: Kyle is starting to unravel. Benjamin stares at him.
text: Kyle pins Benjamin against the wall. The lights in the room
text: start to FLICKER.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Stop this - please!
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (to Benjamin)
dialog: What did you do? He was my friend!
dialog: And you just fucking -
text: Benjamin's voice comes out harsh - evil -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: Light bulbs POP AND SHATTER - Benjamin HURLS KYLE INTO A
text: CABINET, plates shattering.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin!
text: She rushes to Kyle, on the ground, aching. Benjamin stands
text: over them.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Just go. Get ready for school.
text: Benjamin turns and calmly walks upstairs.
text: Kyle is alone with Tori. Stewing, she gathers pieces of the
dialog: broken plates.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it, Kyle.
text: Kyle, churning inside, hears the shower upstairs SQUEAK on.
text: He gets up. Brushes past Tori.
text: Ambles up the stairs on his one good leg -
scene_heading: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: Kyle sees the bathroom door closed, hears the shower running.
text: He heads toward Benjamin's bedroom at the end of the hall.
text: He goes into -—
scene_heading: BENJAMIN'S BEDROOM
text: Kyle's heart rate SPIKING.
text: He opens dresser drawers. Sifts through sweatshirts, jeans,
text: shorts, looking for something.
scene_heading: TENSION MUSIC RISING.
dialog: 74.
text: He glances again at the doorway. The shower still running.
text: He goes through items scattered on the floor.
text: He runs his arm between Benjamin's mattress and box spring,
text: but comes up empty.
text: The bathroom shower WHINES OFF. The water stops running.
text: ALL IS SILENT.
text: Kyle freezes. He knows he should leave the room, but he can't.
dialog: He hurriedly PRESSES ON -
text: He opens Benjamin's walk-in closet. Rummages through dirty
text: clothes, old toys, old trinkets.
dialog: He's frantic now. Benjamin could walk in any moment!
text: He finds a gap at the base of the closet where the drywall is
text: detached from the studs.
text: He reaches into the dark cavity and finds something.
text: He pulls out -
text: THE WADDED-UP T-SHIRT Benjamin was holding the night before.
text: He's terrified. Mind racing.
text: He unfurls the shirt.
text: It's tattered. SMEARED WITH BLOOD.
text: Kyle is paralyzed with horror.
text: He leaves the closet -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Dad?
text: Kyle STARTLES, hides the shirt behind his back. Benjamin
text: stands there, towel around his waist.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Kyle is terrified of his son.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Just... uh... I wanted to
dialog: apologize.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 15.
text: Benjamin studies him.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: We've both had a lot going on
dialog: lately. And I shouldn't have said
dialog: the things I said.
text: Benjamin nods slowly.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Thank you. For understanding.
text: Kyle tries to play casual, but he's nervous as hell. He moves
text: past Benjamin out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. STUDY - LATER
text: Kyle has the blood- and paint-streaked shirt splayed out
text: before Tori. The two of them talk low, hushed, but Kyle is
dialog: disturbed, animated -—
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It's right there.
text: Tori is at a loss.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the shirt he was hiding from
dialog: us last night! That's Noah's blood!
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (derisively)
dialog: What are you saying - that Noah's
dialog: truck hit Benjamin?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I don't know. I don't know what I
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: TORI
text: The truck is totaled. Benjamin
dialog: wouldn't have a bone left in his
dialog: body!
text: Kyle pleads with her -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Babe... if we don't do something,
dialog: more people will get hurt.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: More people will die. You've got to
dialog: be with me on this -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You're asking me to turn against
dialog: our son?
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: He is not our son. He's some thing
dialog: we found in the woods.
text: Tori is full of spite for Kyle.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You don't understand him. You never
dialog: did.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: For twelve fucking years I've
dialog: understood him!
dialog: (pointing to the bloody
dialog: shirt)
dialog: This is Benjamin! Right here! A
dialog: monster!
text: Tori starts to cry -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You're wrong. He's good. We can't
dialog: run from him. We need to be his
dialog: parents. We need to love him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: You know I tried and tried to love
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You never did. You never wanted him.
text: Kyle is now on the verge of tears -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Please please - he's killing us -
text: He reaches out to Tori, but she shuns him.
text: She turns and walks out of the room.
text: Kyle is desperate. Fraying.
text: He collapses into his desk chair.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 77.
text: He opens the bottom desk drawer.
text: Reaches behind some hanging files, deep in back. He pulls out
text: the bundled sock, removes the bottle of OxyContin, then stops
dialog: short.
text: He notices, in the same desk drawer -
text: A PILE OF ART PROJECTS made by Benjamin over the years. He
text: sets down the OxyContin and lingers over them:
text: A Father's Day card with crayon hearts and a school photo of
dialog: Benjamin, age 8.
text: A ceramic dish with Benjamin's handprint, age 5.
text: A popsicle-stick picture frame with a photo of the whole
text: family and MOM, DAD, and BENJAMIN written in Magic Marker on
dialog: the sides.
text: He's wracked with emotion. He fights back tears.
scene_heading: INT. TORI AND KYLE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tori lies on her side, curled up in bed. She's lost ina
text: stupor.
text: Kyle climbs in bed next to her. He spoons her. She doesn't
dialog: move.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You okay?
text: Tori shrugs. Gives him nothing.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: So I've been thinking... I was
dialog: wrong.
text: She takes this in.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I shouldn't have accused Ben of any
dialog: of that stuff. I know he has
dialog: problems, yes, but I'm starting to
dialog: think maybe I'm the biggest one.
text: Tori nods. She starts to cry.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm going to take him with me to
dialog: the woods.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 78.
speaker_heading: KYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let him use that rifle, teach him
dialog: how to hunt, like my dad did with
dialog: me. I want to work things out with
dialog: him. Let him know I love him.
text: Tori turns her body toward Kyle. She takes his hand in hers.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
text: Deever sits at his desk with a cup of coffee, binders and
text: files open on his desk.
text: He studies the crash report for Noah.
text: He sifts past EDR data, tire mark analyses, GRISLY CRASH
scene_heading: PHOTOS, NOAH'S TRAUMATIC WOUNDS, HIS DEAD BODY.
text: He finds a long shot of the crushed car. He sees a small
text: blurry detail in the photo.
text: We can't make it out, but he's taken aback.
dialog: Holy shit.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING
text: Kyle wears an insulated jacket, packs up his truck. He loads a
text: pair of hunting rifles next to duffel bags and camping gear.
text: Benjamin hands him the tent -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Thanks, man.
text: He smiles, slides the tent into the back, slams the hatch.
text: Tori meets up with the guys. She zips up Benjamin's jacket.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: And here - take these.
text: She hands him a pair of winter gloves.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: It's not that cold.
speaker_heading: TORI
text: Out there in the woods it is.
text: Benjamin sighs.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Wear them for me.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Okay...
text: He takes them.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, Mom... I'm sorry I lied and
dialog: stuff.
text: Tori regards Benjamin, full of affection for him -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Come here.
text: She hugs him tightly.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: It's okay. We all make mistakes.
dialog: But you'll always be my baby boy.
text: Benjamin hugs her back. She kisses him.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: It's a good hour and a half each
dialog: way, so don't expect us before
dialog: supper.
text: Tori smiles warmly at Kyle.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Be safe.
text: He smiles back at her. A moment between them.
text: Tori watches the guys climb into the truck.
text: The doors shut. The vehicle revs up. Kyle, looking in the
text: rearview mirror, wiggles his fingers goodbye.
text: The truck crunches gravel down the driveway, leaving Tori and
text: the house further and further behind.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING
text: Deever strides onto the stretch of highway where Noah died,
text: his squad car parked on the shoulder.
text: There are still bits of debris in the road. Nearby, a sad
text: roadside memorial - unlit votive candles, handwritten notes,
text: flowers in cellophane.
text: Deever comes to the middle of the road.
dialog: 80.
text: He looks down.
text: There, scrawled on the asphalt, is the SAME DISTINCTIVE 'B'
text: INSIGNIA he saw back at the fast food place.
text: THIS TIME IN BLOOD.
scene_heading: INT. KYLE'S TRUCK - MOVING - DAY
text: An endless road. The car stereo plays some old tune.
text: Kyle glances over at Benjamin, gazing out the window. Gray
text: Kansas sky. Bare trees. Flat land for miles.
text: The song now interrupted by STATIC, the station losing its
dialog: signal.
text: Kyle tries to adjust the dial. No good. He changes stations. A
text: farm report. A country song. All of them ENGULFED BY WHITE
speaker_heading: NOISE.
text: He shuts off the radio.
text: They drive in silence. Just the SQUEAK of shock absorbers
text: going over bumps in the road.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - LATER
text: Kyle and Benjamin sit on a log by the parked pickup, eating
text: sandwiches, their rifles in nylon sleeves nearby.
text: Sunlight glitters through incandescent yellow and orange
dialog: cottonwoods.
text: TENSION MUSIC creeps in as the two guys - father and son - sit
text: side by side, eating, not looking or talking to each other.
text: Kyle offers Benjamin a snack-size can of Pringles.
text: He shakes his head no thanks.
text: Kyle eats a Pringle instead.
text: The two guys eat their lunches, staring off in the distance.
text: A feeling of dread hovering over them.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Tori stands at the sink drying a salad bowl when she notices
text: outside - a POLICE CAR driving up the long driveway toward her
text: house. She's concerned.
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Tori emerges from the house, stands on her porch.
text: Deever steps out of his car and approaches her.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
text: Afternoon, Tori.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Is something wrong?
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: Well... could be. Not exactly sure
dialog: yet. Is your son around by chance?
speaker_heading: TORI
text: He's out hunting with his dad.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: Then maybe you could answer a
dialog: question for me.
text: He shows a Polaroid to Tori.
speaker_heading: DEEVER (CONT'D)
dialog: This look familiar to you?
text: It's the 'B' INSIGNIA IN BLOOD on the road. Tori grows
text: concerned, but hides it -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: No. Should it?
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: It's some kind of signature, left
dialog: at the spots where both Erica went
dialog: missing and Noah died.
text: Tori tries to keep her composure.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I don't... I can't help you with
dialog: that.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: Doesn't it look to you like a B
dialog: maybe? As in Benjamin Breyer?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I don't like where this is going.
text: Deever motions inside -
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: Mind if I come in, take a look
dialog: around?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: If you think you're helping your
dialog: son, you're not.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Get off my property.
text: Deever grits his teeth, frustrated.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Go.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: All right. But you know I'll be
dialog: back.
text: Tori stands there defiantly as Deever heads toward his squad
text: car and climbs in the front seat.
text: He fires up the engine.
text: Tori shuts and locks the front door, turns, and —
text: SPRINTS UP THE STAIRS, ADRENALINE PUMPING, HORRIFIED.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - AFTERNOON
text: Kyle and Benjamin LURCH THROUGH THE WOODS holding their
text: rifles. A low tangerine sun. Dead leaves CRACKLING under their
dialog: shoes.
text: The guys venture deeper into the woods. Kyle's eyes darting,
text: exploring options, a coiled spring.
text: As they get deeper into the forest, a CROW starts to squawk.
dialog: 83.
dialog: First one. Then another.
text: Kyle looks up and sees more and more of them - dark splotches
dialog: in the trees -
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Something must've spooked those
text: crows.
text: Benjamin notices something. He scurries ahead.
text: He crouches down before a slather of mud -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: It was a deer. These are tracks.
text: He examines the tracks, his back to Kyle.
text: Kyle's heart rate quickens. This is the moment.
scene_heading: KYLE RAISES HIS RIFLE - AT THE BACK OF BENJAMIN'S HEAD -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT'D)
dialog: This way.
text: BENJAMIN LOOKS BACK - Kyle quickly LOWERS HIS WEAPON.
dialog: He nods. Sure. Let's go.
text: Benjamin stalks ahead. Kyle follows behind.
text: Benjamin searches around him, every branch carrying
text: information. The crows SCREECH MADLY.
text: Kyle - queasy now, dying inside - follows Benjamin.
text: Benjamin stops to examine a small tuft of fur on a bramble.
text: Kyle stops about ten feet behind him.
text: THE SCREECHING CROWS build to a RISING CHORUS, THEIR SCREAMS
text: RAINING DOWN ON BENJAMIN AND KYLE.
text: KYLE KNOWS THIS IS IT.
scene_heading: HE LIFTS HIS RIFLE.
text: POINTS THE BARREL AT THE BACK OF BENJAMIN'S HEAD.
text: THE CROWS' CRIES CARRY OVER INTO -
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 84.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - BENJAMIN'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
text: TORI CHARGES INTO BENJAMIN'S ROOM, her world spinning.
text: She tears through items on Benjamin's floor. Finds his
dialog: backpack.
text: Unzips it. Pulls out his notebook.
text: She opens it -
text: And takes in PAGE AFTER PAGE OF HORROR —
text: CLINICAL DRAWINGS OF THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM.
text: CATALOG CUT-OUTS OF WOMEN, THEIR FACES SCRATCHED OUT, THEIR
text: EYES POKED THROUGH.
scene_heading: CHILDLIKE DRAWINGS OF WOMEN WITH THEIR LEGS SPREAD. PREGNANT
text: WOMEN IN CHAINS. DRAWINGS OF SEX AND TORTURE.
text: Tori is BREATHLESS, BOTTOMING OUT, leafing through the
dialog: notebook -
dialog: Then she sees -
scene_heading: PAGE AFTER PAGE OF 'B' DOODLES - VARIATIONS ON THE INSIGNIA
text: THAT DEEVER SHOWED HER - NEXT TO DRAWINGS OF BENJAMIN AS A
scene_heading: SUPERHERO, WEARING THE RED MASK AND CAPE, THE 'B' INSIGNIA ON
speaker_heading: HIS CHEST.
text: Tori FALLS TO HER KNEES.
text: She clutches herself, practically dry heaving -
text: A WAIL OF AGONY building inside her, spilling over.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - SUNSET
text: THE CROWS SCREAMING.
text: KYLE WITH THE RIFLE TRAINED AT THE BACK OF BENJAMIN'S HEAD.
text: SURGING WITH ADRENALINE. HIS MOUTH DRY.
text: HE HOLDS HIS BREATH.
text: CHOKING BACK EMOTION.
text: HE SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER —
dialog: 85.
scene_heading: THE RIFLE FIRES -
text: THE BULLET HITS BENJAMIN IN THE HEAD, BEHIND HIS EAR -—
dialog: 
scene_heading: BENJAMIN'S UPPER BODY SPINS AROUND -
text: THE THUNDERCLAP OF THE SHOT REVERBERATING THROUGH THE WOODS -
text: The crows go quiet.
text: Benjamin - staggered but still on his feet - feels the back of
text: his head. No wound. No blood.
text: HE TURNS TOWARD KYLE.
text: Kyle stands there. Frozen. Panic rising.
text: He frantically ejects the shell from the rifle then digs into
text: his pocket.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: You never wanted me.
text: KYLE FUMBLES FOR A NEW BULLET, hands shaking. Benjamin GRINS.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
dialog: You never made me feel at home.
text: Kyle loads the bullet into the rifle, pushes the bolt forward -
dialog: raises the rifle -
dialog: - and FIRES -
text: DIRECTLY AT BENJAMIN'S CHEST.
text: The bullet rips open Benjamin's shirt and RICOCHETS off
dialog: somewhere.
text: Benjamin stares at Kyle with HOMICIDAL RAGE.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Oh God I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
text: Kyle drops the rifle - turns - and RUNS AWAY AS FAST AS HIS
scene_heading: LEG WILL ALLOW -—
text: Through cottonwood trees. Willing himself forward. Faster.
text: Trying to put space between him and Benjamin.
text: He's desperate. Prey.
text: He feels a GUST - a kind of MOAN - blow past him. He changes
text: direction, looks around, still running.
dialog: 86.
text: Trees whizzing by. He thinks he sees SOMETHING TO THE OTHER
scene_heading: SIDE OF HIM - a BLUR.
text: He changes direction again. Huffing. Stumbling. Lungs burning.
text: Benjamin seems to be HERE - THERE - AHEAD OF HIM - BEHIND HIM.
scene_heading: EVERYWHERE AND NOWHERE.
text: Then BENJAMIN TACKLES KYLE TO THE GROUND. HARD. LIKE A SEMI
speaker_heading: HIT HIM.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - BENJAMIN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Tori - worked up - holds her cell phone to her ear. The line
text: rings. To herself -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Pick up, pick up...
text: The line ANSWERS.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: Kyle, I'm so sorry! You were right!
dialog: Benjamin killed Noah! He killed
dialog: him!
text: No reply from the other hand. Just the soft hiss of static.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Kyle?
text: The line still hissing - giving up nothing.
dialog: Then -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (V.O.)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (starting to whimper)
dialog: Benjamin? Where's Dad?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (V.O.)
text: He's gone.
text: Tori's stomach turns. She's terrified.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Gone where?
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (V.O.)
dialog: (accusingly)
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: I don't know - I swear - I don't!
dialog: Tori falling apart -
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: What did you do to him? What did
dialog: you do?
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (V.O.)
dialog: (cold, flat)
dialog: I'm coming home, Mom.
text: The other line CLICKS DEAD.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin?... Benjamin?
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
text: Benjamin is on top of a weak and wearied Kyle. Benjamin drops
dialog: the phone.
text: He clutches his father's head with both hands. RAGE BUILDING.
text: Veins and capillaries around Benjamin's temples swell. His
text: eyes GLOW RED - SMOLDERING WITH IMPOSSIBLE HEAT.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: No - no!
text: INTENSE BEAMS OF RADIATION ERUPT FROM BENJAMIN'S EYE SOCKETS.
scene_heading: KYLE SCREAMS -—
text: AS THE LASERS FIND KYLE'S EYES -
text: A BURST OF BLINDING LIGHT BORES A HOLE IN KYLE'S FACE.
text: HIS SKULL CAVES IN AND COLLAPSES.
text: Kyle's body sags.
text: He STOPS MOVING. His head a gummy mass of boiled skin and
dialog: muscle.
text: Benjamin lets his dad's corpse drop.
text: The forest is quiet.
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 88.
text: Leaves shaking in the breeze.
text: Some animal function has now taken over Benjamin. He roils
text: with predatory fury.
text: He lets out a PAINED, UNEARTHLY WAIL.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: SCREEEEACH. SCREEEEACH. Tori drags a heavy CHINA HUTCH toward
text: the front door, digging up the old hardwood floor.
text: Panting, she catches her breath. Then tries again - exerting
text: herself - PULLING THE HUTCH until it BLOCKS THE DOOR.
text: Tori has barricaded herself in. A bookshelf is pushed against
text: the front window. Kitchen table jammed against the back door.
text: She's alone. Grandfather clock TICKING.
text: She goes to the fireplace set, picks up an IRON POKER, hooked
text: at the tip. She carries it like a weapon.
text: She gently peels back the heavy living room drapes. Peers
dialog: outside -
text: Half moon. Shadowy trees. An old tire swing swaying from an
dialog: oak tree.
text: She closes the drapes.
text: She's a live-wire of edginess, trying to stay calm, trying to
dialog: focus.
text: She holds the iron poker in front of her. Ready.
text: She can hear her own breathing. Her own heartbeat.
text: The world seems to stop.
dialog: Then -
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: THE WHOLE HOUSE SHUDDERS. AS IF RAMMED BY A WRECKING BALL.
text: Sawdust falling.
text: Tori takes out her phone. Dials 9-1-1. The line picks up, a
dialog: woman's voice -
speaker_heading: 9-1-1 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 89.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: My son - he's - he's going to hurt
dialog: me.
text: Tori retreats from the front door, against a wall with framed
text: photos of Benjamin at various ages.
speaker_heading: BAM
speaker_heading: E
speaker_heading: E
speaker_heading: 9-1-1 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Where is your son now?
text: AN IMPACT FROM THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE. The foundation
text: RATTLING. Frame CRACKING.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (rasping)
dialog: He's twelve years old. This
dialog: shouldn't be happening.
speaker_heading: 9-1-1 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Stay calm. Where is he now?
text: Tori feeling like a cornered animal.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: We found him in the woods when he
dialog: was a baby, in some —
speaker_heading: 9-1-1 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Ma'am?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Oh God - this can't be happening.
text: In some sort of pod.
text: Tori hides under the dining room table, a sheer linen
text: tablecloth her only refuge.
speaker_heading: BAM
speaker_heading: BAM
speaker_heading: 9-1-1 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Ma'am, please - where - ?
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (voice cracking)
dialog: He's trying to get in -
speaker_heading: 9-1-1 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: At your front door, ma'am, or -
dialog: ! BAM!
dialog: Blue (11/30/17) 90.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Through the walls. He... has...
dialog: powers.
speaker_heading: 9-1-1 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
dialog: Ma'am —
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: (sobbing)
dialog: I thought he was here for good. But
dialog: I think he's here to kill all of
dialog: us!
text: THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE IS BLOWN IN — WALLS COLLAPSING —
text: BENJAMIN SURGING INTO THE LIVING ROOM LIKE A FREIGHT TRAIN.
text: TORI IS OVERWHELMED BY AN ONSLAUGHT OF WOOD AND DEBRIS. SHE
text: WANTS TO SCREAM, CAN'T SCREAM.
text: THE ENTIRE HOUSE BILLOWING WITH DRYWALL DUST. TORI CAN HEAR
text: BENJAMIN CRASHING INTO THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOUSE.
text: The dust starts to dissipate and clear. Tori stands, gets her
dialog: bearings.
text: HALF THE LIVING ROOM IS GONE.
text: EVERYTHING — WALLS, FLOOR, THE WHOLE SIDE OF THE HOUSE —
text: OBLITERATED IN A CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS.
text: Pink heating insulation torn, dangling. Frayed electric wiring
text: FLICKERING through the haze.
text: Tori grips the poker. Senses ringing.
text: FOOTSTEPS CREAK above her.
dialog: Tori hears —
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN (0.S.)
dialog: (childlike voice)
dialog: Mom?... Mom, are you here?
text: She can HEAR Benjamin proceeding from room to room.
text: She can make out the low rumble of a closet door rolling open.
text: Tori slowly - gingerly - walks toward the open space in the
dialog: living room.
text: She can see - through the haze - Benjamin STARTING TO WALK
dialog: DOWN THE STAIRS!
text: Tori turns and hurries through the dining room, into -
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: THE KITCHEN
text: She motions toward the back door, then spots a glimpse of
text: Benjamin's silhouette through the dust.
text: She can't reach the back door without stepping into his sight
dialog: line.
text: So she backs slowly toward the study, then scurries up -
speaker_heading: A REAR STAIRCASE
text: She arrives upstairs. Almost pitch black.
text: She peers down through the balusters in the stairs - looking
text: for signs of Benjamin. A game of cat and mouse.
text: She listens.
text: She can hear the cellar door CREAK open.
text: FOOTSTEPS heading into the cellar.
text: Tori feels safe enough to head downstairs. She's going to make
dialog: her escape.
dialog: Then -
dialog: SLAM!
speaker_heading: CRACK!
text: A BATTERING from below. Tori turns tail and RUNS DOWN -
text: THE LONG UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
scene_heading: FRANTIC. SPRINTING.
text: SOMEONE STEPS IN FRONT OF HER.
scene_heading: SHE SCREAMS - LIFTS THE POKER -
text: SHE'S WRAPPED IN A BEAR HUG - THE POKER DROPS TO THE FLOOR.
text: IT'S DEEVER AND Reyes ARMED WITH SHOTGUNS.
speaker_heading: DEEVER
dialog: You're safe now. We got you.
dialog: Everything's gonna be o-
text: Something WHISKS PAST HIM. Deever stops short.
dialog: 92.
text: He feels something and looks down - PART OF HIS THROAT HAS
text: BEEN TORN AWAY. BLOOD STARTS SPILLING DOWN HIS SHIRT.
text: Tori's eyes widen in horror - almost hyperventilating.
text: ANOTHER WHISK and Deever's head caves in. His face is
text: deformed, his eyeball coming out a little bit. He falls over
dialog: dead.
text: As Tori SCREAMS, Reyes drags her away - pulling her into -
speaker_heading: A SPARE ROOM
text: An old sewing room with creepy dress form mannequins. Reyes
text: holds her shotgun toward the door, expecting Benjamin to
dialog: follow them.
text: Tori - every dial turned on - leads Reyes into a walk-in
dialog: closet.
text: She opens a door at the other end of the closet and comes out
dialog: on —
speaker_heading: A GUEST BEDROOM
text: Faded wallpaper, oval mirror, religious statuettes on the
text: dresser. No sign of Benjamin anywhere.
text: The two women try not to move.
text: The house eerily quiet.
dialog: They listen.
text: From elsewhere upstairs they hear, faintly -
text: A floorboard CREAK.
text: Reyes signals Tori to hide while she goes to investigate.
text: Tori nods. Reyes heads out into the hallway - silently,
dialog: steadily.
dialog: Tori ducks into -
speaker_heading: HER BEDROOM
text: She's alone now.
text: She wedges herself under the bed.
dialog: 93.
text: She lies down. As low as possible.
text: She can hear strange noises - odd floorboard creaks.
scene_heading: BENJAMIN APPROACHES.
text: Tori is frozen with fear. She retreats as far under the bed as
dialog: she can.
text: Benjamin enters the bedroom.
text: Tori sees his FEET GLIDE PAST - A COUPLE INCHES OFF THE
speaker_heading: GROUND.
text: She covers her mouth with both hands, trying not to give
dialog: herself away.
text: Benjamin moves on.
text: BENJAMIN WALKS PAST WEARING HIS RED MASK AND CAPE. Just a few
text: feet away.
text: Tori covers her mouth with both hands, trying not to give
dialog: herself away.
text: A heavy silence. Nothing moves.
text: Tori cranes her head slightly, peaking out from under the bed.
text: She can see, IN THE REFLECTION OF A MIRROR -
text: Reyes making her way down the hallway. Tori wants to tell her
text: she's in danger, but she can't.
scene_heading: Benjamin INTERCEPTS HER —
text: Reyes gets off a SHOTGUN BLAST but it glances off Benjamin.
text: Tori can see in the mirror - Reyes HOWLS IN AGONY as Benjamin
text: palms her face and SMASHES HER HEAD AGAINST THE WALL - HER
text: SKULL SPLITTING LIKE A MELON. BLOOD SPLATTERING THE MIRROR.
text: It takes all of Tori's power not to scream.
text: Benjamin stands in the hallway, his mask caked with blood and
text: dust. Inhuman.
text: He listens.
text: He HEARS SOMETHING coming from the bedroom -
text: Someone under the bed.
text: He ENTERS THE BEDROOM.
dialog: 94,
text: He crouches down and LOOKS UNDER THE BED.
text: There's no one there.
text: He looks to the bedroom closet. The door SLIGHTLY AJAR.
text: He knows where Tori is.
text: He goes to the closet door.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
text: TORI DANGLES FROM THE SECOND-STORY WINDOW.
text: She looks down.
text: It's a 25 foot drop.
dialog: She has no choice.
text: She lets go -
text: And FALLS TO THE GROUND. HARD.
text: Her ankle twisted, fucked.
text: She wills herself to stand up.
text: And takes off running.
text: Into the backyard.
text: Emergency lights from the sheriff's squad car swirl eerily in
text: the quiet night.
text: Tori limps toward the cornfield - her ankle ringing with pain.
text: She presses on. Running. Frantic.
text: She tears through the thick stalks of corn. Desperate.
text: And then she hears it -
text: Behind her, faintly -
text: A TWO-TONE SING-SONG WHISTLE. The same from the game of hide-
dialog: and-seek earlier.
dialog: 95.
text: Tori wants to cry. Can't cry. She charges forward.
text: She emerges from the cornfield.
text: Headed toward the big barn.
text: She runs across the patchy ground. Comes to -
speaker_heading: THE BIG BARN
text: She bursts in through the entryway. The place creepy at night.
text: A dead, rotting husk of a building. Almost pitch black.
text: Tori climbs up an old ladder. Straining.
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: The building RATTLES. Tori lets out a whimper. She can hear
text: Benjamin CRASHING HIS WAY INTO THE BARN.
text: From behind her, closer this time, Tori hears -—
scene_heading: THE TWO-TONE SING-SONG WHISTLE.
text: She cries to herself -
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: No no no.
text: Benjamin is stalking her. Toying with her.
text: Tori inches her way along -
text: A DARK WALKWAY
text: She feels along the walls.
text: Floorboards at her feet missing or rotting away.
dialog: BOOM! BOOM!
text: Benjamin bursting through walls, literally tearing apart the
text: barn to find her.
dialog: Tori steps further -
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: AN ENTIRE SECTION OF THE BARN EXPLODES INWARD!
text: Tori's path is collapsed. Cut off.
dialog: 96.
text: She tries a different route.
text: SHE CRAWLS UNDER A GAP at the base of the wall.
text: She squeezes her way into -
scene_heading: A HIDDEN STORAGE SPACE
text: She stands up to find, lit by moonlight from gaps in the
dialog: roof -
scene_heading: ERICA'S DEAD BODY HANGING FROM HOOKS - SPLAYED OPEN - HER
scene_heading: REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS LABELED - CERVIX, UTERUS, FALLOPIAN TUBES.
dialog: 
text: DRIPPING WITH MAGGOTS. THE AIR THICK WITH FLIES, FLUTTERING
speaker_heading: MOTHS.
text: And carved all over the wooden walls - BENJAMIN'S 'B'
text: INSIGNIA. Over and over and over.
text: Tori is lost, panicking, trapped.
text: She feels a tremor - the whole barn shaking -
scene_heading: BENJAMIN BURSTS INTO THE STORAGE SPACE -
scene_heading: Tori BACKS AWAY - STUMBLES -
text: AND CRASHES THROUGH ROTTING FLOORBOARDS.
text: She FALLS.
scene_heading: TWO STORIES.
text: AND LANDS HARD IN THE GRAIN PIT AREA.
text: She's dazed.
text: Her nose bleeding. Her back screaming with pain.
text: She sees the rotting roof and the night sky above her,
text: flittering with moths.
text: She has to get up.
text: She staggers to her feet.
text: Scrambles to the TRAP DOOR.
text: She strains to lift the HEAVY DOOR. From somewhere above she
text: hears the SING-SONG WHISTLE, getting closer.
dialog: 97.
text: She manages to lift the door. In the pit below lies the
scene_heading: RUPTURED BLACK POD.
text: She KICKS at the shell of the thing. The pod BREAKS INTO
speaker_heading: PIECES.
text: She GRABS ONE OF THE SHARDS. Rises. And -
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Mom?
text: Tori turns to see -
text: Benjamin STANDING BEHIND HER.
text: The two of them alone in the pit.
text: Tori quivers, terrified.
text: Benjamin slowly removes his mask. His young face is cold,
text: distant.
text: Tori is jittery. Trying to keep it together. Holding the shard
text: at her side, concealed.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: Benjamin - listen to me -
text: She steadies herself.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: I've never stopped loving you.
dialog: Ever. I believe - I still believe -
dialog: that you are a blessing that fell
dialog: down to this Earth.
text: Benjamin remains wary.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: When we found you, you were so
dialog: helpless. So tiny. All we could do
dialog: is keep you safe.
text: Benjamin's anger starts to dissipate.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: No matter what you've done, you are
dialog: still good inside.
text: Benjamin breaks - a 12-year-old boy now, not a killer. He
text: begins to cry. The most emotion we've seen from him.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: I want to do good, Mom. I do.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: TORI
dialog: You will. I'll help you.
text: Benjamin comes to her.
text: He embraces her. Weeping. Burying his face in her shoulder.
text: Tori cries too. She holds him, stroking the back of his head.
dialog: She whispers -
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: You will always, always be my baby
dialog: boy.
text: Tori TAKES THE BROKEN SHARD FROM HER SIDE - LIFTS IT - ABOUT
scene_heading: TO PLUNGE IT INTO BENJAMIN'S NECK -
text: BENJAMIN'S HAND CATCHES HER WRIST.
text: He stares into her eyes - a mixture of rage and wounded pain.
text: He squeezes Tori's wrist. She drops the black shard. Terrified
dialog: for her life -
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: No... No, Benjamin...
scene_heading: BENJAMIN GRIPS HER TIGHTER.
text: HE SURGES UPWARD.
speaker_heading: TORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Benjamin...
text: BENJAMIN SURGES UPWARD.
text: HE SMASHES THROUGH FLOOR AFTER FLOOR OF THE BARN, SNAPPING
scene_heading: TORI'S BONES.
dialog: 
text: HE FLIES HIGHER AND HIGHER —
text: INTO THE NIGHT SKY. OVER THE FARMLAND BELOW. TORI'S BODY IN
speaker_heading: HIS ARMS.
scene_heading: TORI - HELPLESS, BROKEN - LOOKS UP AT BENJAMIN.
text: BENJAMIN LOOKS AT HIS MOTHER ONE LAST TIME.
text: THEN DROPS HER.
scene_heading: TORI FALLS AND FALLS IN SLOW MOTION -
text: HER BODY FLAILING AS SHE STARES UP IN HORROR AT HER SON...
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: A TV NEWSCAST
text: An ANCHORMAN sits at a local news desk. Over his shoulder is a

speaker_heading: ANCHORMAN
dialog: Breaking news this hour. A
text: passenger jet has crashed in the
dialog: small town of Brandenburg, Kansas.
text: Reports are still coming in, but
dialog: there are believed to be no
dialog: survivors among the 268 passengers
dialog: on board. We go now live to our own
text: Dawn Maywell, at the scene of this

dialog: you tell us?
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
text: A young reporter in a parka stands before the smoldering
text: wreckage of a DOWNED PASSENGER JET, billowing smoke. She holds
text: a microphone and speaks to a TV camera.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
text: Investigators are not yet sure what
dialog: caused the plane to drop suddenly
dialog: from the sky. There was no
dialog: inclement weather, no indications
dialog: of engine failure...
text: We PULL BACK to take in a grisly scene -
text: Bodies scattered - on the ground, in a tree, hanging from the
text: ruptured fuselage.
text: A zillion globe lights from emergency vehicles. Firefighters
text: spray water onto the wreckage. Rescue workers attend to the
dialog: scene.
text: PULL BACK further to realize we're on the grounds of the
text: BREYER FAMILY FARM. The plane seemingly nosedived into the
dialog: farmhouse itself.
text: In the back of an EMT vehicle, sitting all alone, is BENJAMIN,
text: wrapped in a mylar blanket.
dialog: 100.
text: He watches the billowing smoke, the swirling lights. He's
text: emotionless.
text: His aunt Merilee approaches him with a Dixie cup of water.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Here. I was able to get you this.
text: She hands him the water. He drinks it.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: And I talked to one of the
dialog: officials. They said you can go if
dialog: you'd like.
text: Benjamin looks up at her. His face passive.
text: She gazes down at him with sympathy. She has trouble keeping
dialog: it together.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Benjamin, I'm so sorry.
text: She starts to weep.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: All those people... your parents...
dialog: dead. It's too much.
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just grateful you're okay.
speaker_heading: BENJAMIN
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: MERILEE
dialog: Come on —
text: She helps him to his feet.
speaker_heading: MERILEE (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll stay with me until we figure
dialog: things out.
text: The two of them walk away from the EMT vehicle.
text: Benjamin reaches out and takes Merilee's hand.
text: She clutches it.
text: Merilee looks ahead. She doesn't see the faint SMILE creep
text: across Benjamin's face.
dialog: 101.
text: They walk past the wreckage, leaving the tragic scene.
text: The camera stays on the crash.
text: It DOLLIES IN on the ruptured side of the airplane.
text: There, seared into the wreckage is the STRANGE 'B' INSIGNIA.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: DURING END CREDITS:
text: We HEAR staticky audio from the cockpit of the plane -
speaker_heading: PILOT (V.O.)
dialog: (casual)
dialog: Tower, our engine instruments look
text: good. Eighty knots, heading two six
dialog: zero.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Winds are at zero one - um. Huh.
dialog: We're seeing something downwind.
text: Unidentified. Approaching.
scene_heading: A HUGE THUMP - CRACKLING NOISE - ALARMS WHOOPING - THE PILOT

dialog: man... Oh my God... A boy...
scene_heading: THEN A MASSIVE ERUPTION - A WALL OF STATIC.
dialog: Come up on —
scene_heading: INT. FEDERAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: A man in a navy tie and a pressed white shirt sits at a table
text: in a small room holding a steaming cup of coffee. Let's call
dialog: this man BLACK COFFEE.
text: A charred orange Cockpit Voice Recorder is plugged into his
text: laptop. The speakers hiss STATIC.
text: Black Coffee rewinds the audio and plays the last part again -—
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: PILOT (V.O.)
dialog: - outside the plane! A man... Oh my
dialog: God... A boy...
text: He stops the recording. He sits back in his chair. Gears
dialog: turning.
text: The door opens. AGENT TWO - young, crisp, female - enters the
text: small room and hands him a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: BLACK COFFEE
dialog: This about the South China Sea?
text: As he scans the report -
speaker_heading: AGENT TWO
text: Nine confirmed dead and counting.
speaker_heading: BLACK COFFEE

speaker_heading: AGENT TWO
