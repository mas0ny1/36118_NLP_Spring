scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a
text: nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.
dialog: 
text: A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
text: button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.
dialog: 
text: Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
text: FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes,
text: also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.
dialog: 
text: LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.
text: She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
text: arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the
text: panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty
text: pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her
text: nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.
dialog: 
text: Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen
text: suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the
text: bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off
text: her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Listen, Beast. What have I told
dialog: you about linen?
dialog: 
text: The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that
text: SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the
text: hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME
dialog: 
text: Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill"
text: from the counter and checks the time against her watch.
dialog: 
text: She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food
text: arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the
text: middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (looking at Beast)
text: It's liver saute.
dialog: 
text: Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: 
dialog: Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But
dialog: you're going to have to eat the
dialog: liver tomorrow.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
dialog: 
text: Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls
text: back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair
text: spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the
text: voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
dialog: 
text: Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is
text: mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat
text: good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
dialog: 
text: A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch
text: pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.
text: She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to
dialog: turn the handle.
dialog: 
text: Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody
text: nose, runs up to her, bawling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.
dialog: 
text: Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (to Chandra)
dialog: Goodness, this is a bad one. Tip
dialog: your head back.
dialog: 
text: She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off
text: balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,
text: staining it for all eternity.
dialog: 
text: Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
text: guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch
dialog: it.

scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
dialog: 
text: PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with
text: BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also
text: present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and
text: two other BOARD MEMBERS.
dialog: 
text: Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her
text: foot. Johansen clears his throat.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHANSEN
dialog: Well, I have a full calendar today,
dialog: and I'm afraid...
dialog: 
text: The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She
text: clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her
text: blood-smeared lapel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry
dialog: I'm late. It's very nice to meet
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending
text: down to shake hands with Johansen and the others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL GAIL
dialog: The Superintendent was just getting
text: ready to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: I do apologize. A student had a
dialog: crisis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. MONTES
dialog: A crisis, you say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
text: A bloody nose...
dialog: 
text: There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase
text: and reveals the stain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
text: A bloody nose of epic proportions.
dialog: 
text: Johansen smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOHANSEN
dialog: OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes. Wow
dialog: us.

scene_heading: EXT. PLAYGROUND - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
dialog: 
text: A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra
text: sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a
text: limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym.
dialog: 
text: Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor
text: her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball
dialog: game.

speaker_heading: LETTY

dialog: Could you tell him it's Letty?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell
dialog: him that they went for my math
dialog: idea. Thanks.
dialog: 
text: Letty dials again. She sees two boys fighting over the ball
text: and moves in to break them up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (to boys)
dialog: Not so rough, guys.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mom? Hi. You'll never guess
dialog: what...I've got the best news.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No, about work. How about dinner?
dialog: 
text: Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (to Jenny)
dialog: You're in trouble, young lady.
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: I know, Mom. But it's the only

dialog: Can you tell Ruth about dinner?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Paul's fine, just fine.
dialog: 
text: The class bell BUZZES.

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Got to go, Mom. The monsters call.

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the
text: patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. Letty sits sipping
text: wine with her mother, MRS. MARTHA MAYER, immaculate in a
text: cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Letty's sister RUTH--early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair
text: and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant, oozing
text: happiness. Letty discretely waves her over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Sorry I'm late.
dialog: 
text: Letty pours her a glass of wine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MAYER

speaker_heading: RUTH

scene_heading: MRS. MAYER
dialog: (leaning toward Letty)
dialog: Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on
dialog: your blouse?
dialog: 
text: Letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: So, I got the district to approve
dialog: my after-school math program.
dialog: 
text: Ruth smiles at her, but vacantly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MAYER
dialog: How wonderful, darling.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What does that mean for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: I'll be running it three days a
dialog: week, and...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MAYER
dialog: Will you get time off to do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Not now, but maybe later, if they
dialog: like the program.
dialog: 
text: Ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit-eating grin
text: plastered across her face.

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (to Ruth)
dialog: What's up with you?
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Me? Nothing. Tell me more about
dialog: the job.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MAYER
dialog: (to Ruth)
dialog: Not a job, a promotion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: No, Mom, it's more of a prestige
dialog: thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Mmmmmmm.
dialog: 
text: Letty passes her hand in front of Ruth's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
text: Ruth. Calling Ruth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: There's nothing to tell.

scene_heading: MRS. MAYER

dialog: Are you sure, Dear?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: No, really. Tell me about the
dialog: promotion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Well, my theory is that people can
dialog: really enjoy math, but they lose
dialog: interest...
dialog: 
text: Ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (almost screaming)
dialog: I'm getting married.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears. Ruth leaps up
text: and hugs her mother. Other diners glance toward the table.
dialog: 
text: One WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with
text: her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth. Other DINERS
text: follow suit. Ruth grins back and starts to giggle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MAYER
dialog: I'm so happy for you. It's just
dialog: wonderful.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin.

scene_heading: MRS. MAYER

speaker_heading: LETTY

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (to Letty)
dialog: Can you believe it?
dialog: 
text: Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse.

dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. MAYER
dialog: Tell us every detail.

speaker_heading: LETTY

scene_heading: MRS. MAYER

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. PAUL
text: LASCHER, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off
text: his expensive suit.
dialog: 
text: He opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly
text: pressed T-shirt. He smooths out another shirt he has
text: accidently rumpled in the process.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: So, another one bites the dust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: It's not another one. It's my
dialog: sister.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Aren't you happy for her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: She's only known the guy a few
dialog: months.
dialog: 
text: Paul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Can I put these here for tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (pointing to the closet)
dialog: In there's better.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's kind of romantic, don't you
dialog: think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I really think if you're going to
dialog: spend your life with someone you
dialog: want to know them pretty damn well.
dialog: 
text: Paul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Believe me, I know your feelings on
dialog: the matter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The receptionist said you called
dialog: earlier about something.
dialog: 
text: Letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: My math program. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Good going. I knew you could do
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Paul kisses Letty on the cheek.

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It looks like we're both bucking
dialog: for advancement.

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Huntley told me today that if I
dialog: come through on the Benton
dialog: deposition, they may consider me
dialog: for senior associate.
dialog: 
text: Letty hugs Paul.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Congratulations. We should
dialog: celebrate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I was thinking dinner on Friday
dialog: with James and Meg at the Saint
dialog: Mark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: I mean tonight.
dialog: 
text: Letty sensually caresses his shoulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Like right now...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Actually, I need to review the
dialog: deposition questions tonight.
dialog: Maybe tomorrow?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Oh, ok. Maybe.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: But I thought if you don't mind,
dialog: you could listen and see how I come
dialog: across?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sure. Of course.
dialog: 
text: Letty continues coloring her multiplication chart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Letty, please, I need your full
dialog: attention.
dialog: 
text: Letty puts the chart down and sits up straighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Let me have it.

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Letty rubs her eyes with fatigue. Bobby stands next to her
text: holding a crumpled paper bag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: My dog ate my turtle, and the shell
dialog: went crunch. I brought it for show-
dialog: and-tell.
dialog: 
text: The children perk up at this news.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: I'm sorry about your turtle Bobby,
dialog: but you know we only have show-and-
dialog: tell on Mondays. Today, we're
dialog: scheduled for grammar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: But my mom says I have to throw it
dialog: away tonight.
dialog: 
text: Bobby opens the bag. He reaches in to remove the turtle. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Don't even think about it.
dialog: 
text: She grabs the bag. From outside, there is a KNOCK. Letty
text: and the students look toward the window.
dialog: 
text: It's Ruth. She's been crying. She waves to Letty. Chandra
text: waves back at Ruth.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.

dialog: 
text: Letty puts up her finger to signal "just a minute" to Ruth.
text: She sets the turtle bag on Bobby's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Class, why don't you...
dialog: 
text: Ruth knocks on the glass again. Letty glances at her
text: distraught sister and walks quickly toward the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: (to class)
dialog: You guys pull out your verb sheets
dialog: and review them.
dialog: 
text: Letty leaves the room. The class watches through the window

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.

dialog: A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics

dialog: 
text: Ruth starts to sob--big, loud, air-gulping sobs. Letty pats
text: her shoulder.

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Maybe, though. Maybe it would
dialog: work. I could throw you an
dialog: engagement party maybe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
text: Principal Gail, trolling the halls, spies Letty with Ruth.

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Neater, Zach.

dialog: looks like an "o."
dialog: 
text: Zach looks back toward his classmates for help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: What's wrong, Zach?

speaker_heading: L
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Try again, Zach. Like that.
dialog: 
text: Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes.
text: He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and,
text: above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks
dialog: like a pretty good "a."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY

dialog: can't do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ZACH
dialog: I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: No, it's not OK. You'll never get

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: It has to be good, Zach. Do you

text: SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around,
text: unsure, confused.
dialog: 
text: Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and
text: looks at the children again.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: I'm very, very sorry, Zach.

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: You know what, guys? Wednesday's
text: not a grammar day. It's a collage

speaker_heading: LETTY

speaker_heading: LETTY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. EMLEE
dialog: I apologize for the inconvenience,

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: I want to see my mother

speaker_heading: DR. EMLEE
dialog: You'll have to. Your family agreed

speaker_heading: DR. EMLEE

dialog: related to depression...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY'S POV:
dialog: 
text: Dr. Emlee continues to talk. His words become more and more
text: distant as the RINGING in Letty's head grows louder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. EMLEE

speaker_heading: LETTY

scene_heading: MRS. SANTUCCI

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: Our relationship meant a lot to me,

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Yeah, but can you stand to be with
dialog: me like this?
dialog: 
text: Letty waits. She looks away. She turns back and stares into

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LETTY
dialog: No. I can't, Michael. I'm so sorry,

speaker_heading: LETTY

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
