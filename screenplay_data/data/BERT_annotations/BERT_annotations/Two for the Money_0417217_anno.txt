scene_heading: BRANDON LANG'S VOICE
dialog: That's me. Five years old. I remember that day. Believe it
dialog: or not, I remember that hit. I remember it because of the smile

scene_heading: EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1983 - DAY

speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER

scene_heading: EXT. HOME MOVIE - 1984 - DAY
text: BRANDON runs, wears a too-big helmet and pads. A DOG chases
text: him as DAD throws a football -- long pass -- TIME SLOWS and --
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: To pop, sports were a religion. To me, it was about purity,
dialog: a place where all wrongs could be made right, or at least temporarily
dialog: forgotten. I was going to fill the whole house with trophies
dialog: for him. There was no doubt in my mind, I was going to make
dialog: him happy...

scene_heading: EXT. STADIUM - 1999 - NIGHT
text: Our eyes adjust to see we're in a STADIUM. It's a night game.
text: Stands packed. A PLAY CLOCK fills the SCREEN. It's the fourth
scene_heading: quarter. Seven seconds left. Score: CAL WEST 31 / SOUTH WEST
text: NEVADA UNIVERSITY 27. A bruised and battered UNLV QUARTERBACK
text: gets a play from the COACH, straps on his helmet as he runs back

text: 10 exhausted, desperate faces come close, hang on BRANDON'S
dialog: every word --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: Last play. Slant red, right back on two. On two, Scottie.
dialog: It's a lock. A guaranteed TD. I've already seen it. So relax.
dialog: There's nothing to worry about 'cept one thing -- after we win
dialog: and they're shoving cameras in your faces, I don't want to hear
dialog: any "Hi moms." Guys, it's overdone, the fans are tired of it
dialog: and if you have to thank some one you can just thank me. See
dialog: you in the end zone.
dialog: 
text: The teams breaks, approaches the line. Loud CROWD roar.
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: I'd been a quarterback since pee-wee football. Set high school
dialog: records. Won state championships. I wasn't driven by joy, it
dialog: wasn't winning as much as terror, pure and simple -- fear of
dialog: losing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TV ANNOUNCERS
text: South West Nevada needs a score. Seven seconds on the clock.
dialog: 22 yard line. Win or lose, this has been a spectacular season
dialog: for Lang. The big question, should he turn pro now or wait until
dialog: -- Lang's got the snap--
dialog: 
text: BRANDON drops back. A GIANT gets a hand on BRANDON'S jersey.
text: BRANDON pulls free, runs. OPPONENTS charge his way, BRANDON
text: vaults, sails in the end zone, SCORES. BRANDON rolls on his
text: back as an OPPOSING PLAYER hurtles in -- mid-air -- unable to
text: stop as -- 300-plus pounds come crashing onto BRANDON'S leg.
text: Sickening sound. BRANDON clutches his strangely angled limb.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: ... My first thought was I can tape it and play next week. Then
dialog: I puked.

speaker_heading: SURGEON VOICEOVER
dialog: Football's done, son...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Brandon... Brandon, it's me.
text: BRANDON opens his eyes, focuses on his FATHER (older, cheap suit,

speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD
dialog: You okay? I saw what happened on the tv. Helluva thing that
dialog: happening like that.

speaker_heading: BRANDON

dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD
dialog: I brought some flowers. From downstairs in the shop.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (pressing the nurse's call button)
dialog: No, you gotta go -- where's the nurse?
speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD
dialog: I'm thinking of getting into a new program, Brandon.
text: A NURSE comes fast through the door, watches unsure --
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Could you get him out, please?
speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD
dialog: It's okay, we're fine, I'm his father.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Just get out!
text: BRANDON tries to rise, IV'S coming loose. The NURSE takes his
text: DAD'S arm, leads him out to the hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD
dialog: (pulling away, straightening)
dialog: He didn't recognize me. Must be all the drugs and all. Boy's
dialog: been through a lot.
dialog: 
dialog: (handing the NURSE the flowers)
dialog: If you could put these in some water and leave 'em in his room.
dialog: Before they die.

scene_heading: EXT. TRACT HOME - DAY
text: Vegas desert. It's raining. A SWNU car pulls up. The COACH

text: a TEENAGE BOY stand under a rusty awning, waiting to greet him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: It doesn't rain much in the desert. Maybe it was that, or maybe
text: the look on my mother's face, or how fast coach left after getting
dialog: me up the steps, but I swore then and there -- no matter what,
dialog: I'd get back -- I would play again...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNLV WEIGHT ROOM - 1997 - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY TRACK - DAY
text: Sprinters dart by. Here comes BRANDON. Several months have

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
text: The TEAM'S practicing for a new season. BRANDON'S on the sideline,
text: flanked by the COACH and TEAM DOCTOR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: Doc told me it would take years to heal. One bad hit and it'd
dialog: be over. But the team needed me and I had to play to get drafted.
dialog: I figured I'd take a chance...
dialog: 
text: BRANDON looks at the field, the PLAYERS, the empty stands and--
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH WEST NEVADA UNIVERSITY STADIUM - 1997 - DAY
text: CROWDED arena. Electrifying scene. BRANDON'S suited on the
text: sidelines. Kick-off. A SWNU PLAYER returns the ball.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: Every minute of recovery I'd dreamt about this moment. There
text: were NFL scouts in the stands. I knew what happened next.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BRANDON leads his team onto the field. Into the huddle --
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Let's ease back into it with our bread
dialog: and butter -- TD first play. We're going
dialog: deep. Split right. Deep two on three!
dialog: (coming up to the line)
dialog: Red 38! Red 28! Set! Set--
text: BRANDON drops back. Blitz. Brandon about to throw when one
text: of his own LINEMEN is knocked into him and -- BRANDON'S off balance.
dialog: Too much pressure on that leg and in one horrible moment...
text: it buckles. BRANDON falls. The play whistled dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
text: ...It was over. I could've gone out with class, a gritty smile
text: and a little wave to the crowd from a stretcher, instead I opted
dialog: to go psycho on national tv.
dialog: 
text: The PLAYER who hit him leans down to help. BRANDON grabs his
text: face mask, starts punching. Pure rage. A REFEREE steps in and
text: BRANDON slugs him, slams his face in the turf. LINEMEN yank

speaker_heading: JIM ROME
dialog: Welcome to the jungle! Hey clones, do you believe this idiot?!
dialog: That cannot happen! This is college football, not the ultimate
dialog: fighting championship! What we have here is too much muscle
dialog: and not enough brain mass -- this is why we need a life-time
dialog: ban! Make an example out of him! Because the sport deserves
dialog: better than this! Talk to me!
dialog: 
text: CAMERA PUSHES IN -- ECU on the TV as we hear --
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: It made all the highlight films. People wrote editorials. Overnight
dialog: I became the poster boy for the "Dark Side of Sports."
dialog: 
dialog: The college yanked my scholarship and I was kicked out of school.

speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRIST

scene_heading: INT. WINDOWLESS OFFICE - PRESENT DAY - DAY
text: CAMERA moves ceiling level above a dreary space. Passing over
text: cramped cubicles. Murmer of voices from each one. EMPLOYEES
text: seen, all reading phone copy into taping devices. Sex lines,
text: astrology and get-rich-quick schemes are heard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: Football wasn't a sport, it was my life. Maybe I couldn't play
dialog: anymore but I couldn't leave. So I went with it,
dialog: 
dialog: rode it out. Then one day, and it didn't
dialog: take long, I woke up at the bottom, and I liked it so much, I
dialog: stayed for six years.

text: Brandon sits at his co-worker's desk. He picks up the text copy
text: sitting beside the recording device, looks it over --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON VOICEOVER
dialog: This guy's gig was sports handicapping. Predicting winners for
dialog: people who bet. I was supposed to just record his picks.
dialog: 
dialog: The thing was, I didn't agree with them.
text: Brandon starts changing game selections, re-writing the copy.
dialog:

speaker_heading: BOSS

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Hey Stu, where's the action this weekend?
speaker_heading: SUPERVISOR/STU

dialog: on Tampa Bay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Crazy.
dialog: Supervisor/stu
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That game's gonna be won by coaching, Stu. Gruden put that Tampa
dialog: Bay team together before he came to Oakland, right? He knows
dialog: every weakness of that team and every strength. He knows Brown
dialog: only likes to catch over his left shoulder and he'll have him
text: double-teamed to the right. He knows Gannon always throws on
text: a 3-step drop and the linebackers will take away the middle of
dialog: the field. Gannon'll be intercepted at least 4 times on Sunday.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: (STU staring at him, pained look)
dialog: ...You got sucked into Tampa, didn't you?
dialog: (STU manages a nod)
dialog: Stu, how many times do I have to bail you out? All right, listen,

dialog: Could maybe still play pro. But that two foot scar running

speaker_heading: MAN VOICEOVER
dialog: This is Walter Abrams. I don't know if you know me but I run
dialog: the biggest sports service in the country. Hell, I started the

dialog: 
dialog: even that reprobate boss of yours. It's
dialog: my job to keep track of who's doing what and what you're doing
dialog: should be rewarded.
dialog: 
dialog: Focus, Brandon. Focus. One day you'll
dialog: look back, see this was one of life's defining moments. Allow
dialog: me to paint a picture for you. Right now I'm getting a massage,
dialog: looking out my window at the greatest city in the world and all
dialog: I'm asking you to do is come up with a number. Write down what
dialog: you make now, cross it out and write what you should be making

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: This is a joke, right?
speaker_heading: WALTER VO
dialog: A joke can be the ultimate intellectual pursuit sometimes. This?
dialog: This is just a job offer. In your top drawer there's an envelope
dialog: with your name on it.
dialog: 
text: BRANDON opens the drawer, pulls an envelope and a ticket.
speaker_heading: WALTER VO
dialog: That's travel cash and an airline ticket. It's not a magic trick,
dialog: Brandon. I paid someone to put it there, who incidentally
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: said the place reminded him of a Turkish prison. I don't have
dialog: to tell you you're
dialog: 
dialog: wasting your time there, Brandon, unless
dialog: this is a part time gig -- unless you're
dialog: planning some kinda "comeback," in which
dialog: case I request you use a fraction of your
dialog: talents and weigh the odds of that dream becoming reality. Two
dialog: leg fractures? Passed on by every conceivable team in the league?
dialog: Any chump can make that call, and anyone who clears the boards
dialog: the way you do week in and week out should live in a penthouse
dialog: on Park Avenue -- which is not for you to construe I'm offering
dialog: that to start, but keep these stats up working for me and I'll

dialog: 
dialog: (slicing the air with his hands)
dialog: Walter get out. I say his driver can't drive, he say you're

scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - TOP FLOOR - DAY

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (assessing BRANDON as he speaks--)

dialog: know and know what you don't know and know I gotta know everything
dialog: you know as soon as you know it, if not sooner! Smile. C'mon!

dialog: Certain things, you either are or you aren't. Which is it?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: When I was a kid I thought I wanted to be a pastor... obviously
dialog: not now. I mean, yeah, I believe in God.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Relax. What do I care? Besides, it's against the law to hire
dialog: based on religious orientation. You're not a republican are
dialog: you? Just kidding.
dialog: 
text: (silent beat, staring at him)
dialog: You're scaring me son. What's with the deer-caught-in-headlights
dialog: vibe? You were a quarterback for God's sake. A leader.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That was six years ago.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: C'mon, you won three conference titles at a major university.
dialog: You think I went to college? I'm autodidactic. Big word, huh?
dialog: Know what it means? Self-taught. Partially by reading, sure,
dialog: but mostly by keeping my eyes open and asking a lot of stupid
dialog: fucking questions. I swear to God I'm looking at myself 30 years
text: ago. A taller, more athletic version maybe, but the resemblance
dialog: is remarkable.
dialog: 
text: WALTER crushes out the cigarette, sprays air freshener.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm not supposed to smoke any more, among other things. It's
dialog: bad for my condition. So before I die, did you do anything other
dialog: than the sports phone in Vegas?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Just the 900 number recordings, it was full time, I mean we got
dialog: 10 bucks a call.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Chump change, Brandon. We're angling for bigger fish here.
dialog: You see, the networks don't talk about it and Uncle Sam can't
dialog: tax it, but sports gambling is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year-business.
dialog: These gamblers have needs, Brandon. Come Monday morning, after
dialog: a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs.
dialog: 
text: WALTER presses a button and the TVS fill with football games.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's every pro game played last Sunday.
dialog: Do you know why Monday Night's the most watched game of the week?
dialog: It's because Monday's the last chance bettors have to climb
text: out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday. Sports
dialog: betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what
dialog: we do is 100% legal -- it's exactly the same as a stock broker,
dialog: only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet.
dialog: We make the big money off our client list. You see, when a
dialog: client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they
dialog: gladly give to keep getting our picks. When they lose we get
dialog: zip. So the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend
dialog: -- is to win.
dialog: 
text: WALTER clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs.
text: Phone numbers and messages ("FOOTBALL SELECTIONS!" COLLEGE AND
text: PRO!" "BASKETBALL PICKS!") flash on the screens. It's a high-octane
dialog: infomercial for sports gamblers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TV WALTER
dialog: Hello -- this is Walter Abrams and welcome to The Sports Advisors
text: and week three in professional football. After a nice five day
dialog: vacation on my yacht I can't be any more ready than I am right
dialog: now. Studying the mismatches this weekend I can only conclude
dialog: they're giving my handicappers a license to steal. I want you
dialog: to take out a blank
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Tv walter con'd
dialog: check right now -- go on, do it -- and write in as much you want
dialog: to cash it for on Tuesday, that's how much money we're making
dialog: for you this weekend. Year in, year out, no stock matches our
text: return, and for the first time in the history of the company
dialog: I'm releasing our three-team college and pro parlays absolutely
dialog: free! That's right. This is why in a business with a higher
dialog: turnover rate than Leona Helmsley's maid staff we're still going
dialog: strong after 28 years! I'm giving these picks away. 800-238-6648.
dialog: 1-800-BET-ON-IT. Absolutely free. We're looking at a big money
dialog: weekend so let's get right into it with our panel of experts--
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: (freeze frames himself, to BRANDON)
dialog: My cable show. Tapes Thursday, airs Saturday and Sunday morning.
dialog: Nationwide. Hell I need a new barber. The man should
dialog: 
dialog: be shot. Look at my hair in the back.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How'd you afford that yacht if the picks are free?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: There is no yacht. Good, keep asking question. Next.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You didn't answer about the free picks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I know. What else?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What's on the second floor?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That's where we print the money. Any more?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No, that clears up pretty much everything.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Great. Welcome aboard. We got some good stuff to work with.

dialog: Ringling Brothers on one.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Ever have a manicure?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Me? No. Why?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Because you need one. Besides, there's a girl you gotta meet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Really? What's she like?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Beautiful, you'll like her--

dialog: 
dialog: woman
dialog: I'm just thinking of doing some work around the eyes. Tighten
dialog: it up a bit. A lift here, look, see these lines?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I see a beautiful woman. What are you --all of 35? I have a
dialog: girlfriend, she was stunning, went in to "tighten it up a bit"
text: and came out with a permanent smile. Even when she cries she
text: looks like she's laughing. Another, she's on her third eye lift.
dialog: Her skin's so tight, I swear, if you put an egg shell on her
dialog: butt she'd look like a baby bird.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I'm just thinking of a tune-up.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Oh yeah, first it's a tune-up, then it's something else, and
dialog: one day you'll come teetering in with your new 36Cs and a stretched
dialog: face and you won't be able to say how unhappy you are because
dialog: of all the collagen they shot in your lips.
dialog: 
dialog: Do youself a favor. Skip the surgery and get a shrink, work
text: on the inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Easy for you to say. You used to model.
text: The other WOMEN CUSTOMERS listening nearby nod in agreement.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Oh yeah, that's true. Those were the good days. Sometimes I
text: like to just curl up on the ledge with my box of retouched photos
text: and reminisce about rehab.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Tightly wound today, aren't we?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I guess. Must be the coffee talking.
dialog: (handing her a fashion magazine)
dialog: Here, read a fashion magazine. Feel more insecure about yourself.

text: TONI walks through the shop, checks her watch, passes a row of

text: them. Only guy there. Cotton between his toes post-pedicure.

speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: ... Brandon?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I'm Toni. Walter said you'd stop by.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Nice to meet you.
dialog: (immediately, re: the pedicure)
dialog: This was his idea.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: He makes all his employees do this?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Every one.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: How often?
speaker_heading: TONI
text: Once. Before they start work.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Weird.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I've never had my nails done before.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I can see that.
dialog: (putting his hands in water)
dialog: Strong hands. Nice. Do you drink?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No thanks. I'm fine.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: No, do you drink?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: TONI

speaker_heading: BRANDON

speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Smoke?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No.
dialog: Toni
dialog: What about gambling?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What about it?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Look, I'm sorry, I'm pressed for time.
dialog: (stopping work, regarding him)
dialog: I asked do you bet. Are you a bettor?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Really? Why not?

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Toni, huh? Are you here full-time?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: It's my shop, I better be. Why don't you gamble?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Well I'll tell you, Toni. I bet on something once. Risked everything
dialog: I had and lost.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I swore I'd never do it again.
dialog: Toni
dialog: You're sticking to that story?
dialog: Brandon
dialog: Hey, we just met. I sure wouldn't want to start our relationship
text: off by lying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Well Walter could definitely use someone with a little resolve
dialog: in his life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (leaning in)
dialog: Ya know, Toni, this is my first time in town. I'm not used to
dialog: how fast things run around here. I'm wondering if you'd like
dialog: to have dinner tonight? Let's get
dialog: 
dialog: to know each other without so many people around.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: ... He didn't tell you.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Brandon, Walter and I are married.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What? Walter just said I was meeting a woman. He acted like...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Walter's got a weird sense of humor.
dialog: Look, he has a big, bright, beautiful spirit, you'll love working
text: for him, but he's held together by meetings. If it has "anonymous"
text: at the end, Walter goes. He has to. He also has to be very
dialog: careful who he let's into his life. In most ways, Walter's
dialog: brilliant -- but he can be bullshitted and I can't. So he sends
dialog: 'em over to me before he hires 'em.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You're kidding me? Coming here... the manicure... this was an
dialog: interview?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: You're swift.
speaker_heading: BRANDON

dialog: You'll make your picks and record them every day, once a day
dialog: Monday through Friday and five times a day on weekends. Each
dialog: call's worth 25 bucks a shot. Right now we get a few dozen hits

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: From now on you have a new name -- John Anthony, "The Million
dialog: Dollar Man."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Hold on. What's wrong with Brandon Lang?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Brandon Lang is still at home with his mother. You're selling

speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: of?

speaker_heading: BRANDON

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: This is John Anthony here, and from Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood,
dialog: all your big money stays and plays with me! Winning consistently's
dialog: the name of this game and I always remain the same, winners on

speaker_heading: TONI

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. I had a check-up yesterday.

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: She's cute.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Cute doesn't half cover it. The girl's gorgeous. And bored

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: So are the two guys she's with.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'll bet you 10-to-1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if
dialog: you leave with her.
dialog: 
dialog: Toni
dialog: C'mon Walter. You might as well go to Atlantic City and open
dialog: a house account. You know you can't gamble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Who's gambling? It's a challenge. If Brandon leaves with her
dialog: I give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he
dialog: made last year. If not, he gives me a grand, which I'll give
dialog: to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't bet, Walter.

scene_heading: REGGIE/INTO PHONE
dialog: --It says here your minimum bet's five grand, so let's be honest

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Look, making predictions is one thing -- but pushing people to
dialog: bet, it's not me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Pushing people? Get real, this country was built on gambling.
dialog: Look at Wall Street -- one big casino. The state spends millions
dialog: hawking the lottery. If people want to pay for advice on who
dialog: to bet, who are we to say no? Stop being selfish, spread the
dialog: word! Check your bible, Brandon, tis better to give than receive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You got a whole room full of salesmen.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to
dialog: speak to the guy making the picks -- and you're picking 80 percent
dialog: winners.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER CON'D
dialog: What's the matter? Gonna lose your purity? C'mon, what do you
dialog: think selling is? We're just talking a few well-timed phrases.
dialog: Let's start with an easy one. A throw-away. "I don't want
dialog: your money, I want your bookie's fucking money?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't want your money --
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: --Jesus, don't start that shit again. Sell me.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't want your money, I want your bookie's money!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What happened to the fuck?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Nothing, I just don't talk like that.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It's not that I can't. Why do I have to?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise
dialog: feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and
dialog: certain concepts the way a well-placed fuck can. Fuck is your
dialog: friend. Fuck can be your best friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'm happy for you and your friend, Walter, but I'm not using
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Chaucer used it 600 years ago. It was good enough for him.
dialog: C'mon--
dialog: 
dialog: (calling out to the SALESMEN)
dialog: --this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck!
text: A chorus of "Fuck yous" fill the air.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: ...I mean you'd think with two mortgages out, repo guys staking
dialog: out my car, my job on the line and my wife threatening to leave,
dialog: you'd think I'd have the goddamn brains to stop, instead of staying
dialog: in the chase, doubling down, which of course is what I did...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My name's Walter. I'm new to the group.
dialog: (various "hellos")
dialog: Hi. I've been going to meetings like this for 18 years. Once
dialog: a week, every Friday night, for 18 years. This, my friends,
dialog: is my 936th consecutive meeting.
dialog: 
dialog: (enthusiastic applause)
dialog: Thank you. Thanks. And my hand to God, I haven't been to a
dialog: track, casino or bet a game that whole time. Not a cent.
dialog: 
dialog: (murmurs of approval)
dialog: I've listened to thousands of sob stories by people like Leon
dialog: here, and I gotta say, Leon -- if I learned one thing it's that
dialog: gambling is not your problem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: It's not?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Not even close. You're a lemon. Like a bad car, there's something
dialog: inherently defective in you. And you. And me! All of us here
dialog: -- we're lemons! Big, juicy, acidic, ice-tea flavoring lemons!
dialog: We look like everyone else but we're defective because when
dialog: most people make a bet they want to win, while we, the degenerate
dialog: gamblers of the world, we're subconsciously playing to lose.
dialog: All humans like going to the edge of the abyss, but what makes
dialog: us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves off into
dialog: the void! And we like doing it so much we do it time after time
dialog: after time! Me? I always felt most alive when they were raking
dialog: away the chips, and every one here knows what I'm talking about.
dialog: People like us, even when we win, it's just a matter of time
dialog: before we give it all back. But when we lose, and I mean the
dialog: kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size of a
text: decimal point, there's a moment when you're standing there and
dialog: you've just recreated the worst possible nightmare this side
dialog: of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you suddenly
dialog: realize -- hey, I'm still here, I'm still breathing, I'm still
dialog: alive! In order to really live you have to be aware of your
dialog: own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is one of
dialog: the best ways
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER CON'D
dialog: I know of getting that feeling. When you win, you defy death,
dialog: but when you lose,
dialog: 
dialog: you survive it, and that's remarkable!
dialog: Us lemons, we fuck shit up on purpose! We need to constantly
dialog: remind ourselves
dialog: 
dialog: that we're alive! Gambling's not the problem, Leon, your fucked
dialog: up need to feel something, to convince yourself you exist, to
dialog: test what's really real, that's the problem!

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: That was great! It was all worth it! Don't you see? I felt

dialog: 
dialog: Anthony. It's not just a new persona.
dialog: You can't play it. You gotta live it. That's how this works.

speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Well that's a thoughtful response. Here I was, worried you'd

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It's the only move. For six years I've been living on Ramen
dialog: noodles. For the
dialog:

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: She's right. There's no going back. I mean that. This is gonna
dialog: cost me. I'm talking about building an empire around you. Do

dialog: Welcome to this week's edition of The Sports Advisors! America's
dialog: premier sports information program with myself, Walter Abrams,
text: Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler and a truly gifted newcomer to the
dialog: Sports Advisor panel, a substantial find -- John Anthony! We're
dialog: entering week six in pro football! This is when the cream rises
dialog: to the top! This is when things get hot! It's oven mitt time!
dialog: This is big-time ball season so let's get right into it with
dialog: the Wizard of Odds -- Jerry "The Source" Sykes! Jerry, what's
dialog: the Sykes System predicting for this weekend?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Walter, my patented computer models tell me we're looking at
dialog: nothing less than the perfect storm of betting opportunities.
dialog: But first, last week I cashed in a big-time call on on Chicago
dialog: as an outright winner over Indianapolis -- making it my 8th straight
dialog: top selection winner right here on this tv show! This Sunday
dialog: I have 5 match-ups I absolutely love, including Miami at New
dialog: York! Stats, rankings, records, weather, the Sykes System uses
text: 42 proven indexs to eliminate the guesswork from sports wagering.
dialog: Without my patented, computer-based picks you have a better
dialog: chance of seeing God knocking on your door with five strippers
dialog: and a bag of Bolivian cocaine than winning on your own! Call
dialog: me for my five games! Absolutely free -- 800-238-6648!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Our experts know how to read between the lines, we know how to
dialog: analyze a point spread, we're not pulling rabbits out of
dialog:

dialog: Chuck, you'd probably eat that rabbit if you got your hands on
dialog: it.

speaker_heading: CHUCK

dialog: Hell yes -- with a side order of fried bookmaker!!! I'm the
dialog: grim reaper of bookmakers! I've put more bookies out of business
dialog: than the I.R.S.! How many gamblers did I bail out last weekend
dialog: with my game of the year! Denver, a 10-
dialog: 
text: point underdog beating Cincinatti by two touchdowns! A $100
dialog: bettor made $10,000!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK CON'D
dialog: A $500 bettor made $50,000! I've got six games on Sunday I'm

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: --Someone wrote some great stuff for me here but the "Million
dialog: Dollar Man," I dunno, it sounds kinda small somehow. I mean
dialog: maybe if you change that M in million to a Z I could get behind
dialog: it. They tried all sorts of names, wanted to call me the Magic
dialog: Man -- but picking 80 percent winners sounds pretty scientific
dialog: to me. So let's just call me John. I was a quarterback. And
dialog: every QB knows the key to victory is anticipating -- the ability
dialog: to see the future and react to it. That is what I do, that's
dialog: the truth, and what do they say about the truth, Walter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ... It bites you on the ass?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Not in my case. You tell us, Jerry.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: It sets you free?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That's right, but with me it makes you M-O-N-EE! I'm picking
dialog: 80 percent, is that
dialog: 
dialog: unbelievable? Well it used to be. I know the leagues! I know
dialog: the players! I
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON CON'D
dialog: know the game! I'm your friend on the field! Your insider on
dialog: the outside! You can't do what I do if you haven't been there!
dialog: Played at the level I have! Maybe you'll get lucky -- guess
dialog: right once in a while -- but these match- ups won't be called
dialog: consistently by anything other than experience! Forget trends!
dialog: Throw out every system you possess! Keep your friends but toss
dialog: their opinions out the window! It's time to change I-would-if-I-could
dialog: to I-can-and-I-am! You wanna know who I like -- call that little
dialog: number at the bottom of your screen!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That's not the point!
speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ... That's it? That's the best you can do? Hell, Toni and I'll

speaker_heading: BRANDON

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Well, sir, that's how I feel about this weekend. That may sound
dialog: cocky, I don't care. I didn't come down here to lie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOVIAN
dialog: Do you have inside information?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: If I did I wouldn't share that with you. My record speaks for
dialog: itself. The truth is I know these teams better than they know
dialog: themselves. I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend, and that includes
text: the Monday Night parlay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOVIAN
dialog: Why should I believe you?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: With all due respect, Mr. Novian, you can't afford not to.
speaker_heading: NOVIAN
dialog: I can afford to do any damn thing I please.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Can you? What I'm saying is can you -- can anyone for that matter
dialog: -- afford to lose as much as a man like you probably needs to
dialog: bet to feel a win? Winning's a funny thing, Mr. Novian... it's
dialog: one of those rare commodities on earth money can't buy. Or was,
dialog: until you called me.
dialog: 
text: Charged beat. A tight grin's glued to WALTER'S face.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: The price is a quarter million, Mr. Novian -- up-front -- in
dialog: addition to a percentage of every game you win.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOVIAN
dialog: Fuck you. I never pay anything up front.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: And we've never charged it before. But with what you're betting,
dialog: 250 up front's a bargain. You want this weekend's winners, that's

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: "Fair?" Honey, you don't know what fair is. What's fair is

speaker_heading: TONI

speaker_heading: BRANDON

speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: "What do I do for myself?" If you drove past my salon and went

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What the hell's gotten into you? What about that night?
speaker_heading: ALEX
dialog: Let me make this real clear so this shit doesn't happen again.
dialog: You mean nothing to me. Oh wait, I take that back -- you meant
dialog: 5000 bucks. Your friend set it up.

scene_heading: INT. BRANDON'S OFFICE - DAWN

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Hello.

dialog: Amir

dialog: I'm wiped out, John...
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Amir?
dialog: Amir
dialog: My business... My house... My credit...
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No, now listen to me -- we got a big weekend coming up, buddy
dialog: --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMIR
dialog: Still you talk like this. Who the fuck are you, like this is
dialog: some kind of game. I was betting a few thousand a Sunday when
dialog: I called you. You pushed me. Every call. All the time with
dialog: your talk... I lost $380,000 this weekend... I was going to get
dialog: married... I had a life...
dialog: 
text: BRANDON staring at the phone, barely holding it together, sees
text: TAMMY standing there -- holding the day's newspapers, hearing
text: the conversation on speaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMIR
dialog: No words now, huh? No more money to squeeze so you shut up.
dialog: How do you fucking live with yourself?
dialog: 
text: Click. Amir hangs up. Crushing beat. TAMMY staring at him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What?
dialog: (face hardening)
dialog: Fuck him if he can't take a joke.
text: TAMMY puts the day's newspapers on his desk, leaves. BRANDON
text: glances down, something catches his eye. BRANDON pulls a newspaper
text: from the pile -- finds himself staring at a full-page ad for
text: JOHN ANTHONY. Big smile. Copy advertising "The Million Dollar
dialog: Man!" and --

scene_heading: INT. BRANDON'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
text: BRANDON paces the dim space. Sits on the bench press. Leans
text: back on the board. He stares up at the weights. Moves the weight
text: pin to 250... and slowly starts to lift. One rep. Two. Three.
text: Four. A bad of sweat forms. BRANDON throws off the jacket.
text: Pulls off the tie. Removes his shirt and shoes. He resumes
text: lifting, grim determination -- the weights rising over and over
dialog: and over -- faster and faster and --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: BRANDON, t-shirt and sweats, approaches WALTER'S office, bursts
dialog: through the door --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I know what the problem is!
text: BRANDON freezes. WALTER watches two MEN unload stacks of money
text: from a briefcase, pile them on his desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'll come back later.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No! C'mon in. We're done here. Right fellas? All through?
dialog: You want a bite before you go? Something to drink?
dialog: 
text: The two MEN leave. WALTER lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Who were they?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We need a bat light or something, you know a signal I can shoot
dialog: up at the
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: Walter con'd
dialog: clouds and no matter where you are you
dialog: can look up and you'll know I need you. Maybe that would work.
dialog: 'Cause last night I must've beeped you a hundred times.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Who were they?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They're from the Salvation Army. How the hell does someone go
dialog: 1-for-8? A fucking monkey tossing darts could do better!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What's with the money, Walter?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: 1-for-fucking-8!
dialog: (coming around the desk)
dialog: I have a plan. From now on we take your picks and reverse everything!
dialog: Like a Twilight Zone episode where everything's the opposite!
dialog: You say black we go white! A is B! Lose becomes win!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: (staring at the pile of cash)
dialog: How much is that?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (sweeping the pile to the floor)
dialog: How much is what? Oh, that -- 275,000 dollars!
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: What happened to the two mill, all the other money?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I was carrying twice that in red ink before you showed up. The
dialog: last few weeks I thought keep the pressure off. He'll come around.
dialog: Climb out on his own. Now I figure fuck it! Time to turn on
dialog: the lights! Let him see the toilet he's drowning us all in!
dialog: Maybe that'll shake him up! So what do you want to know? I
dialog: got three mortgages on this house, I'm gambling again and to
dialog: cover my losses I just got a loan from a guy who works out of
dialog: a bar on a 106th and Broadway! All this -- everything you see
dialog: around you --
dialog: 
dialog: is smoke and mirrors! I shoulda been a magician!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER CON'D
dialog: ... What'd you say when you came in? You were in a good mood
dialog: when you walked through the door and you said something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: You're betting my picks?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You went 82 and 11! You were picking 80 percent -- how could
dialog: I fucking not!? Trouble is I bet heavy after you went a hundred
dialog: percent and rode you right into the fucking toilet! One decent
dialog: weekend and I would have been set for life! One decent weekend!
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BRANDON stares at him, stunned.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: "I know what the problem is!" That's it! You came in with a
dialog: big smile and said, "I know what the problem is!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: ... I'm Brandon Lang, Walter. Brandon's the one who played sports.
dialog: Brandon's the one who can pick games. I lost touch with him
dialog: -- myself. It wasn't an act, man. I became John Anthony. But
dialog: he's not me. If I go back to being Brandon--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: --You can pick again! Of course!
dialog: All you gotta do is go back to being Brandon! Talk like Brandon!
dialog: Eat like Brandon! Forget John Anthony! Burn the suits! It's
dialog: all my fault. I see that now. I pushed you into something you
dialog: weren't. I took the golden goose and tried to turn it into a
dialog: duck. We're winding down the season. There's only two games
dialog: this weekend. Two winners and two over/unders. That's all we
dialog: need. You crunch the numbers, sprinkle in a little Brandon magic,
dialog: we get the sales people burning up the phones and come Monday
dialog: we go four for four going into the big game! Right? Huh? Let's
dialog: get
dialog: 
dialog: something to eat! Go to Smith and Wo's!
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No thanks. I'll stay here. Eat light.
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: (kneeling down, stacking the cash)
dialog: The Brandon thing! What am I thinking trying to get you to go
dialog: out? What would Brandon eat for lunch? Peanut butter and jelly?
dialog: Ramen noodles? What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: (on the floor, helping him)
dialog: I'll get something.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You want anything shipped from home? Your bed? Clothes? Porno
dialog: collection?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: No, I'm fine.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Blow job?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Thanks anyway. Maybe later...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Because it's important.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
text: Pressure doesn't help.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: God forgive me, you're an artist. I fucked with that. Two little
dialog: winners and a couple of over/unders. That's all we need. You
dialog: could phone it in. Two's nothing. Not for you. Not for Brandon.
dialog: Right, Brandon? Isn't that right?

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: These are the winners?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: That's who I like.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Brandon made these picks?
speaker_heading: BRANDON

dialog: 
dialog: Julia
dialog: Can I watch, daddy?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure, Angel. I need you to root for me.
speaker_heading: (pointing at ATLANTA)
dialog: They're the bad guys. Atlanta. We want the blue team. New
dialog: York. They have to win by more than five points. And root for
text: a low score. Both teams have to make less than 42 points total.
dialog: New York and under 42 points.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Why do we like the blue team?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Because Brandon likes them.
text: JULIA looks at BRANDON, smiles. BRANDON'S barely holding up
text: here, forces himself to find a smile in return.
dialog: 
text: THE TV FILLS FRAME. New York kicks off. An Atlanta RECEIVER
text: takes it back for a 60 yard return. We start cutting from the
text: game to BRANDON, to WALTER, the SALESPEOPLE, JULIA, all reacting
text: as the betting Gods raise hopes one play, dash them the next.
text: Play after play. Tide going for New York one minute, Atlanta
text: the next. Tension in the room building. Everyone crowds the
text: TVs as New York defends a 10 point lead with a minute left.
text: 37 points on the board. Only an Atlanta TD can lose the two
text: bets and they're 80 yards from scoring. A few high fives as
text: Atlanta fumbles on a run, recover the ball for a five yard loss.
text: Backed up to their own end zone. Two plays left. WALTER excited,
dialog: things going their way and --
dialog: 
text: BRANDON starting to breath again and -- Atlanta tries a final
text: hail mary, ball coming down into a crowd -- time runs out as
text: a New York PLAYER swats it and an Atlanta RECEIVER pulls it down
text: -- running hard -- open to the end zone -- the room freezes --
text: a New York PLAYER grabs hold -- trying to bring him the bastard
text: down but the Atlanta RUNNER is strong and just makes it in for
dialog: the score -- game over -- and Atlanta hasn't won but they've
dialog: killed the point spread and pushed the game over -- nobody speaks
text: -- the second game comes on right on the heels of the first and
dialog: now Tennessee is kicking off to Kansas City and we're on the
text: roller coaster all over again -- SALES PEOPLE start drifting
dialog: from the room and they've pushed their clients huge on these

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO
scene_heading: INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT
text: WALTER and BRANDON alone in the room. Sound of the ANNOUNCERS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: ...I'm finished. I'm done.
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I can't do this anymore, Walter. I can't sleep at night. I
dialog: can't eat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You're not gonna sit there and tell me you're ending this because
dialog: you have a little indigestion or some insomnia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: It's a lot more than that.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I made it very clear before we started what the stakes were.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Walter, it's over. What use could John Anthony be to you now?
dialog: Only an idiot would follow him after the streak I've been on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: Wrong! Hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot. Bettors will
text: climb back aboard.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER CON'D
dialog: They know you! And when your luck turns they'll remember you
dialog: went 80 percent for half the season! We'll make it all back
dialog: on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Who said anything about next year?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sports betting's year-round.
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I'm not doing this next year.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You made a career choice! I bankrolled it!
speaker_heading: TONI VO
dialog: Let him go, Walter.
text: WALTER and BRANDON turn, see TONI at the door.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Of course you stick up for him!
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Meaning what?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Who's side are you on?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I didn't realize I had to choose.
speaker_heading: WALTER
speaker_heading: (to BRANDON)
dialog: Look, you got a magnificent gift. Own that. So you strike out
dialog: sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences. You're
text: a champion, Brandon. A champion goes down 186 times but gets
dialog: up 187. I'm not letting you stay down. This isn't about you
dialog: or me or Toni, this transcends that -- this is metaphysical,
dialog: this is cosmic, this is eternal -- this is God... Besides, we
dialog: have a contract.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Bullshit!
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: You can't own someone, Walter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen!
dialog: I plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him,
dialog: hooked him up with every major client I have and I will be goddamned
dialog: if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him!
dialog: Why the hell am I even explaining this to you! This is between
dialog: me and him! Get out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Don't talk to her like that.
speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: Can't you feel it, Brandon?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't know what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I think you do. The best part of the best drug in the world
dialog: isn't the high.
dialog: 
dialog: The best part is the time just before you take it! The dice
dialog: are dancing on the
dialog: 
dialog: table. Between now when they stop -- that's the greatest high
dialog: in the world!

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
text: BRANDON comes down the steps, carrying his bag, dressed the same

speaker_heading: WALTER

dialog: 
text: Walter walks back to the bedroom. The tv's on. WALTER pauses
text: to watch another play, about to leave when he spies the Rolex
text: on the nightstand, envelope beside it. WALTER picks up the letter.

text: in the BG. WALTER turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ... He left.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And you didn't you tell me?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: He asked me not to.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Just like that? No goodbye?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: I'm sure it's in the letter.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm sure it is... I wonder what's not in here?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What do you mean, what do I mean? When it comes to Brandon you
text: seem to have all the answers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: He had enough. He wanted his life back.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He said that to you?
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yeah, loud and clear, by leaving.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I think it's something else.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Yeah, tell me.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You know.
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Something was bothering him. I mean sure, maybe he was homesick.
dialog: Or I was thinking maybe he had such, you know, deep feelings
dialog: for me he couldn't face saying goodbye. What a minute. I just
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: thought of something. Just came to me. Out of the blue. What
dialog: about this? Maybe Brandon left without telling me because --

dialog: 
dialog: (full volume, in her face)
dialog: You let him fuck you!
text: ON -- TV. A New York RECEIVER catches a long bomb. Nailed at

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Do I have to?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I know you did!

speaker_heading: TONI

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Don't make this about me!
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: Put me out there on a tray!
speaker_heading: WALTER

text: TONI before WALTER. Inches away --
speaker_heading: TONI
dialog: You were gambling with me that night, Walter. Brandon knew it.
dialog: Knew you. He told me he was sure you were watching somehow.
dialog: So he asked me in to spend the night, put on a show. I didn't
dialog: believe him -- I mean after all we've been through -- but I figured
dialog: what the hell.

dialog: Toni con'd
text: He slipped out the back,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONI CON'D

dialog: up! Like I was something you just toss on the table! Only we
dialog: booked your bet, Walter!
dialog: 
dialog: Brandon and me. The two of us, who evidentally love you more

speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD

speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD
dialog: Where are you headed?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: I don't know, but I got an airport full of planes to choose from.

speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD

speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: Yeah, I told her.
speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD
dialog: Great pick on New York. It's like I always said, you don't bet
dialog: quarterbacks and receivers--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: (finishing his words)

speaker_heading: BRANDON'S DAD

dialog: was a beaut, the way they drove like that, six first downs --
dialog: you shoulda seen me, Brandon -- I'm screaming at the tv...

speaker_heading: TEAMMATE
dialog: You really think we can win today, Coach?
speaker_heading: BRANDON
dialog: ... I'd bet on it.
