text: The thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth..
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: I told you not to use Marshals. But

text: Michelle writes something down on a piece of paper as Aaron

dialog: You were right. Please don't rub it

speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad insisted on having the funeral

speaker_heading: MICHELLE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh come on, honey. I'm sure it's not

text: going to be thinking it.
text: She holds him close.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: Baby, you're the oldest. You have to
dialog: do the eulogy. Besides, I think

speaker_heading: MICHELLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. Look, once this is all over,

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You still smoke?
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You used to smoke.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I used to piss my pants too, but I
dialog: stopped. The only thing I want black
dialog: is my skin. At least open the window.
text: Derek opens the window very slightly.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I've got enough problems of my own to
dialog: deal with.
speaker_heading: DEREK
speaker_heading: (DUBIOUS)
dialog: Yeah? What problems?
speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Still got to use condoms.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Look at it.
text: Norman pulls up his sleeve and makes Derek look at his wrist,

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Come on, man, leave Elaine alone.
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I can't. She's the one.

speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Yeah, just a little nervous...
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: About seeing my dad?
speaker_heading: OSCAR

dialog: around.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
text: I can't help it. He puts me on edge.
dialog: I feel like I owe him money.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: He's going to be more.concerned that

dialog: won't be focused on you. Anyway, when
dialog: I tell him we're getting married,
dialog: he'll have to accept you.
text: Elaine takes his hand. As they exchange a loving look, Oscar
text: takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment. Suddenly
text: there's a BUMP!!! And we see a bicyclist flying over Oscar's

speaker_heading: BIKE GUY

dialog: I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: BIKE GUY
dialog: It was my fault. I ran a light.
text: Oscar starts hyperventilating.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I could have killed you. What if you
dialog: had cracked your head open? I'd have

speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: That's not the point. I haven't been

speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: How was the flight?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Okay. I had to buy the seat next to
dialog: me because I don't trust the airlines
dialog: with my bags. And there was a lot of
dialog: turbulence... I guess that's the
dialog: thing about flying first class. It
dialog: doesn't matter how much you pay if the
dialog: plane crashes, you still end up dead--
dialog: uh...
text: Ryan realizes what he's said and stops speaking abruptly. It's

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: DEREK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: ELAINE

text: ANGLE ON: Aaron and Michelle. Aaron looks worried.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: ."And Jonathan stripped himself of

speaker_heading: REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: And now we'll have a few words from

speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: My father was an exceptional man... He
dialog: was born in 1938. He grew up in
dialog: Alabama on a farm. He loved to take
text: long walks in the woods with his close
dialog: friend, Bobby. He told me how they
dialog: spent their summer days riding their
text: bikes through the fields and swimming
text: in the lake.
text: As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the
text: eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I
dialog: do?"
text: Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted
text: with pain. He looks like he's going to burst.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON: Aaron.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: Dad's first job was working after
dialog: school as an assistant to an
dialog: electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back
dialog: then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear

dialog: shocked a lot. Because of that, he

speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: .He said he was a nice man, and
dialog: surprisingly well dressed. When Dad
dialog: was eighteen, he left home after an
dialog: argument with his father. He never
dialog: told me what that argument was about,
dialog: but I do know that after leaving South
dialog: Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch
dialog: and never saw each other again. Dad
dialog: went to college where he studied
dialog: accounting, a decision which lead to a
dialog: career in corporate finance... But
dialog: his real passion was for the arts,
dialog: with a particular fondness for
dialog: theatre, dance and musicals. He was a

speaker_heading: DEREK (CONT'D)
dialog: How's your skin thing?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Oh that... It's probably nothing. I'm
dialog: more worried about Hepatitis C after
dialog: having Uncle Russell's shit in my
text: mouth. I think I'm feeling yellow.
text: Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek
dialog: confused.
text: ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He

text: moves to his seat.
speaker_heading: UNCLE RUSSELL
dialog: I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was

speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I know you did, Russell. We all did.
speaker_heading: UNCLE RUSSELL
dialog: No! In the bathroom.

speaker_heading: AARON

speaker_heading: I PROMISE--
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: We'll work it out. Let's just get

text: Aaron hugs Michelle.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: I can't believe I still have to do
dialog: this eulogy... with everything I've

text: A beat.
speaker_heading: MICHELLE
dialog: It doesn't change anything, does it?
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Not a thing.
text: Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and
text: appearing flustered.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAVIS
dialog: We're going to have to fly through
dialog: this now. I already missed a funeral
dialog: and two Christenings.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: Sure. Let's go.
speaker_heading: REVEREND DAVIS
dialog: Do you want an open casket?
speaker_heading: AARON/RYAN/NORMAN/JEFF

speaker_heading: REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (speaking very quickly)
dialog: I'd like to apologize on behalf of the
dialog: family for all of the distractions. I
dialog: hope that everyone is settled and

dialog: Aaron, the oldest son, would like to
text: say a few words about his father.
text: Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to
dialog: the front.
text: Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is

scene_heading: ANGLE ON: Aaron.
speaker_heading: AARON
dialog: My father... was an exceptional--
dialog: BANG! BANG! BANG!
text: Suddenly, a loud banging emanates from the coffin. Everyone
text: stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks over to Norman
text: whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a deer

text: continue. He nervously struggles on.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: My father was an exceptional man.
dialog: BANG! BANG! BANG!

dialog: I knew it! I knew it!
text: Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder
text: as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling
text: incoherently.
text: Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin
text: and looks at his dead lover.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (trying to cover)
dialog: What the hell are you doing in my
dialog: Dad's coffin?
text: Frank starts grabbing at Edward's body screaming.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Edward! Edward! Edward!
text: Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but
text: he's holding onto the corpse.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: No! No!
text: Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he
text: passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet.
text: As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks
text: up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to
text: horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is
text: broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs
dialog: at Frank.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA
dialog: You bastard!
text: Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him.
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA (CONT'D)

text: shouts across the room.
speaker_heading: AARON
text: MY FATHER WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN!!!
text: Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned.
text: They all freeze. There's a long silence.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: He had his... shortcomings, but he
dialog: took care of his family. He loved his
dialog: family. He loved this house. He
dialog: worked hard. All I wanted today was
dialog: to show him how much we all loved and
dialog: admired him. To give him the respect
dialog: that he deserved... Is that really so
dialog: much to ask? We all get so distracted
dialog: by the... little things in life. We
dialog: forget about the important things.
dialog: Like the fact that we lost a great
dialog: man.
text: The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more
dialog: than most men. We don't know why a
dialog: man makes the choices he makes. But I
dialog: do know that my father made the best
dialog: choices he could make. Life is
dialog: complicated. We're just thrown here
text: together in a world filled with chaos
dialog: and confusion... and we do our best.
dialog: And Dad did his best...
text: Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of
text: Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by
text: Aaron's words.
speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: He taught us to go for what we wanted
dialog: in life, because you never know how
dialog: long you're going to be here... And
dialog: whether you succeed... or you fail...
dialog: the important thing is that you tried.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: A beat. Michelle looks up at her husband with pride. We see

speaker_heading: AARON (CONT'D)
dialog: So when you all leave here today, I
dialog: want you to remember Dad for who he
dialog: really was... A decent, loving man
dialog: who never condemned anyone for how
dialog: they lived. Who never cast
dialog: disparaging remarks or held prejudices
dialog: against race, gender... height. If
dialog: only we could all be as giving, as
dialog: generous, as understanding as my
dialog: father... Even dead, my father has
dialog: more character than everyone in this
dialog: room. If I am half the man my father
dialog: was, my child will be incredibly
dialog: blessed.
text: Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go.

text: A beat.
speaker_heading: RYAN (CONT'D)

dialog: you know. Move and everything.
