scene_heading: EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN
text: Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of

scene_heading: SUPER TITLE:	SOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE

scene_heading: AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER
text: kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep. He

text: religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO.
text: Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS. The sheepherder looks up --
scene_heading: TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS
text: approach from the East. They touch down near the base of the
text: ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.
speaker_heading: FOUR FIGURES
text: disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear. They
text: wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the
text: teeth. To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens.
text: One of the figures turns to the East. We can see the rising
text: sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of
text: a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He
text: raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day.
text: Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward.
text: They mount the central steps of the ziggurat.
scene_heading: INT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY
text: The shrine is empty. The woman activates a wearable computing
text: device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat.
text: She kneels, studying the floor. In the corner of the room she

scene_heading: INT. ZIGGURAT - STAIRWAY - DAY
text: Dark. Sepulchral. Spooky. The figures descend into --
scene_heading: INT. ZIGGURAT - BURIAL VAULT - DAY
text: -- an empty room with an earthen floor. The sunlight from
text: above barely penetrates down here. One of the figures takes
text: out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating --

speaker_heading: MALE FIGURE
dialog: That's great. We've got dick.
dialog: (turning to the others)
dialog: Is there any reason we had to embark on
dialog: this cluster-fuck during the day?

speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You

text: and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs.
text: ASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma.
text: WOLFE (30s), quiet and deliberative. Right now he's readying

text: We see a cross-section image of the soil and subsurface
text: features beneath them. SOMETHING has been buried down there.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Is that a body --?
text: Wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit. The image resolves
text: further. It's definitely a BODY. Then, we hear the low
text: RUMBLING of more hidden counter-weights and --
text: A SLAB OF STONE
text: slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault.
speaker_heading: GRIMWOOD
dialog: What the fuck --?!
text: Grimwood pounds his fist against the stone. It's solid. He

text: Wolfe points at the ground. A tiny depression has formed,
text: with sand funneling into it.
text: Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole.
text: The grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression
text: gradually widening. Curious, Wolfe leans closer --
text: A CLAWED, ARMORED HAND
text: suddenly EXPLODES upward from the ground. It latches onto
text: Wolfe's neck. dragging him down head-first!
text: Wolfe THRASHES, his head still buried beneath the sand. He
text: knocks over the lantern, which FLICKERS, shorting out.
text: Asher rushes to Wolfe's side. Then Grimwood. They grab Wolfe
text: by the shoulders, SCREAMING, trying to pull him back.
text: Asher is KICKED by Wolfe's thrashing legs. He flies upward,
text: hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned --
text: Danica joins Grimwood. Abruptly, they wrest Wolfe free --
text: headless. BLOOD erupts from the sand. Then --
scene_heading: A HELLISH CREATURE
text: unearths itself, ROARING. It's difficult to make out in the
text: flickering light. But what we do see is terrifying. Spiked,
text: demonic armor, clutching a sword. An elongated, helmeted face
text: with a blood-splattered set of hinged fangs -- hinting at an

speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Hendrix, if he wanted to out of there -

scene_heading: INT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSE - CELL - NIGHT
text: Danica steps into a nearly pitch-black "clean room". We hear
text: BREATHING. Despite her calm demeanor, she's frightened.
text: From the darkness, SOMEONE SPEAKS -- a voice low and rumbling,
text: laced with an ominous gravity.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Why have you woken me?
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Your people need you, Sire.
text: She kneels, bowing her head.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: What makes you think I wanted to be

text: A hand emerges from the darkness, armored. Danica wants to

speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Times have changed. Science has made
dialog: great strides. Your blood, the sacrament
dialog: you provide -- it can set us free now.
speaker_heading: VOICE

scene_heading: INT. LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO - NIGHT
text: Taping is underway. Larry King sits at his desk opposite
text: EDGAR VANCE (40s), a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic
text: demeanor and movie star good looks. CHIEF MARTIN VREEDE (50s,
text: square-jawed), joins via remote feed.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Dr. Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a
dialog: biochemist, isn't that right?
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Yes. I've long believed that in order to
dialog: achieve true health, we have to reconcile
dialog: the body and the mind. Of course that
dialog: also requires letting go of a lot of our
dialog: old notions and superstitions, which is
dialog: what my work is all about.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Let's talk about that. How do you account
dialog: for the fascination with things that go
dialog: bump in the night? Movies, books,
dialog: videogames -- seems like we can't get
dialog: enough of our boogeymen?
text: Vance leans forward, skillfully playing to the cameras.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Monsters provide a means for us to
dialog: transfer our more primal and darker urges
dialog: into something external. In the case of
dialog: vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues
text: like predatory rage and sexual sadism.
dialog: These are scary subjects for people to own
dialog: up to.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: So we pass the buck to someone else?
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Exactly. Historically, people suffering
dialog: from medical conditions have always been
dialog: our psychological scapegoats. In the
dialog: Middle Ages schizophrenia was often
dialog: attributed to demonic possession.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: And vampires?
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Well, there's a hereditary blood disease
dialog: known as porphyria that has symptoms
dialog: remarkably similar to the classic vampiric
dialog: traits. People suffering from this
dialog: disease are anemic, they become sensitive
dialog: to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic --
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me
dialog: that's good for the heart.
dialog: (turning to Chief Vreede)
dialog: Chief Vreede? What's your take on all the
dialog: recent rumors we've been hearing about
dialog: vampires?
speaker_heading: VREEDE
dialog: The only vampires I'm worried about are
dialog: the ones passing the bar exam.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you
dialog: think we'd be on to them by now? The
dialog: truth is, our streets have never been
dialog: safer. Homicides, assaults -- violent
dialog: crime is down across the board. If people
dialog: want to be concerned, they should focus on
dialog: criminals like Blade.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Now who's this? Tell me about him.
speaker_heading: VREEDE
dialog: He's a sociopath we've been pursuing.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Blade is a very disturbed individual.
dialog: Even the name he's chosen for himself is
text: troubling. According to witnesses, he
dialog: operates under the belief that a vast
dialog: conspiracy of vampires live amongst us.
dialog: You have to look at the psychiatric
dialog: underpinnings here. What does a person
dialog: like Blade really want?
dialog: Odds are, he's really trying to work out
text: some kind of inner trauma. He thinks he's
text: slaying monsters, but he's really trying
dialog: to murder aspects of himself.

scene_heading: FOUR STRANDED VAMPIRES,

text: button on either side of the hilt. As Ellingson RUSHES him --
text: -- Blade triggers the first button. ZZZING! The knife-blade
text: ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored
text: chain. The blade penetrates Ellingson's chest. He GASPS as
text: he starts to ASH. But before his disintegration is complete --
text: -- Blade hits the second button. The knife-blade retracts,
text: the razored chain WHIRRING back into the knife-hilt. Blade
text: SPINS, triggers the first button again --
text: The knife-blade FLIES OUT, the razored chain whipping around
text: Denlinger's throat. Blade tugs. The razor chain cuts through
text: Denlinoer's neck, decapitates him. As he ASHES --
text: -- Blade triggers the knife again. As it ejects, he whirls it
text: over his head, making a sound like a BULL-ROARER.
text: Blade drops low, swinging the razored chain. The chain slices
text: through Emond's legs. Emond's amputated legs ASH, the rest of

text: Blade retracts the knife-blade, whirls, THRUSTS it through

speaker_heading: A BIG-RIG CAB
text: hauling a semi-trailer THUNDERS beneath the overpass, sounding

speaker_heading: WHISTLER'S VOICE
dialog: -- GO!!!
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT
text: Blade LAUNCHES HIMSELF into the air. He lands atop the semi,

text: into a spin, clipping other vehicles in the process.
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT
text: Blade gives his car another jolt of nitrous. The Charger

scene_heading: EXT. BUSY STREET - NIGHT
text: The Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat,

speaker_heading: HALE (O.S.)
dialog: Ray! Heard we've got a lead!
text: WILSON HALE (20s), Ray's subordinate, rushes in, excited. Ray

speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: Book us a flight, Hale. Time to take

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY
text: Whistler is buying a pack of cigarettes when he notices	--
text: A BLACK AND WHITE TABLOID
text: on display nearby. The cover story features a BLURRY PHOTO of
text: Blade's recent melee with the vampires.
text: Whistler picks up the tabloid, studying it. Next to the photo
text: is an ARTIST'S SKETCH OF BLADE. The headline reads: "GUN
text: TOTING PSYCHOPATH CAPTURED ON FILM!"
text: Whistler nods to the CASHIER, hands over some more cash.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: I'll take this too.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY
text: Whistler exits the store, perusing the tabloid as he walks.
text: We hear the WHIR of a camera's HIGH-SPEED MOTOR DRIVE and --
text: A SERIES OF DIGITAL SHOTS
text: capture Whistler as he moves down the sidewalk.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON AN FBI AGENT
text: perched on a nearby roof, taking surveillance photos.
speaker_heading: FBI AGENT
text: Subject is heading West.
text: WHIP-PAN to a parked CAR, Cumberland and Hale seated within.
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: Got him.
text: Cumberland starts the car, starts following Whistler.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER (0.S.)
dialog: Congratulations. You're famous. Just
dialog: what we needed.
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON the tabloid as Whistler slaps it down on a workbench.
text: WIDEN to include Whistler and Blade.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: Somebody screwed us. Your face is all
text: over the papers, the television. Media's
text: eating it up.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Like I care?
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: You should. Something like this --
dialog: (gesturing to the tabloid)
dialog: -- taking out a human, even one working
dialog: for the vampires -- far as the rest of the
dialog: world's concerned, you're public enemy
dialog: number one.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Didn't realize this was a popularity
dialog: contest.
text: Whistler shakes his head, frustrated.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: Damnit, Blade, don't you see what's
dialog: happening?! The fuckers are finally
dialog: getting smart. They're waging a goddamn
dialog: PR campaign. Now it's not just vampires
dialog: we have to worry about, we're gonna have
dialog: to take on the rest of the world too.
dialog: (beat, adamant)
dialog: They've got us on the run. These last few
dialog: months we've barely been staying ahead of
dialog: the curve.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: You worry too much, old man.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: I've been doing this since before you were
dialog: born, Blade. The moment you stop
dialog: worrying, you're dead.
text: Then Whistler's face softens for a moment.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: Since the day I found you, you've been
dialog: like a son to me. I taught you everything
dialog: I know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I'm tired. You understand?
scene_heading: EXT. INNER CITY STREET - NIGHT
text: It's rush hour and the streets are choked with traffic.
text: PEOPLE mill past on the crowded sidewalk.
text: We move from face to face, capturing brief portraits of
text: working-class desperation -- an OVERWEIGHT GUY, a PAIR OF
text: HOMELESS TEENAGERS, an ASIAN VENDOR, a STREETWALKER.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S)
dialog: How about that one?
speaker_heading: SECOND VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: No fatties. They taste like Cheetos.
speaker_heading: THIRD VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: What about that shrunken apple-head
dialog: beeyatch-a-saurus over there?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Fucking blow me, man!
text: We hear LAUGHTER and we WHIP-PAN over to a grimy office
text: building, ZIPPING UP the face of it to --
text: A ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE
text: A SKATE-PUNK (SQUID) gets some air, flipping his board up into
text: a nice Ollie backside grab, then scoots over to --
text: -- THREE MORE PUNKS perched on a concrete ledge, watching the
text: people below them. They are: PROOF, FLICK and DINGO. All in
text: their teens, sporting copious piercings and tattoos. Flick
text: wears a ratty T-shirt from "The Lost Boys" movie.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: C'mon, just pick one.
speaker_heading: PROOF
dialog: Once you buy a prize, it's yours and
dialog: yours to keep.
text: They keep looking. Then, Flick suddenly points, excited --
speaker_heading: FLICK
dialog: Got it, got it! Baby on board!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON A MOUSY WOMAN (ABIGAIL)
text: moving below, her figure camouflaged beneath layers of
text: clothing. She's in her 20s, lugging a NEWBORN in a BabyBjorn
text: carrier that's strapped to her chest, clutching a bag of
text: groceries in either hand. She looks a little haggard.
text: As we watch, she reaches an elevated rail station entrance.
scene_heading: BACK TO THE SKATE-PUNKS
text: Dingo nods and smiles approvingly.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: Looks like we got ourselves a combo meal.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEVATED RAIL STATION - VARIOUS - NIGHT
text: A series of shots as Abigail makes her way into the station,
text: passing a few other PEOPLE here and there.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATED RAIL PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: A depressing, dimly lit, partially open-air station. Abigail
text: moves out onto the platform, which is now deserted. She
text: glances around, a bit nervous, and finally sits on a bench.
text: Beat. Just the wind MOANING in the tunnels, across the
text: platform. Then we hear a RUSTLING SOUND --
text: Abigail looks right, sees nothing. We hear ANOTHER SOUND,
dialog: this time from the left --
text: Abigail looks up, briefly glimpsing a FIGURE ducking behind a
text: concrete pillar.
text: Unnerved, she stands, moving a protective hand over her baby.
text: She backs up a few steps, trying to look around the pillar --
text: -- but no one is there. Then a SHADOW MOVES behind her. She
dialog: SENSES it, spinning --
text: -- but again, she seems to be alone. Thoroughly frightened
text: now, Abigail scoops up her grocery bags, turns to exit and --
text: -- slams right into Dingo and Proof! She GASPS.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: Hey, pretty lady.
speaker_heading: PROOF
dialog: Sophisticated mama.
text: Dingo and Proof reveal their fangs. Abigail SCREAMS, runs --
text: -- right into the arms of Flick and Squid! They grab her,
text: RIPPING the BabyBjorn carrier from her chest, SHOVING her back
text: at Dingo and Proof.
text: In seconds, Dingo and Proof have Abigail on the floor.
text: They're tearing away at her clothing, LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: DINGO
dialog: Scream if this hurts, chica!
speaker_heading: ON FLICK,
text: removing the BABY from its carrier. He holds the baby up -
text: only it's not a baby. It's a DOLL with the words "FUCK YOU!"
text: written on its chest. Flick is briefly confused --
text: -- and then the baby doll EXPLODES, covering Flick's face with
text: a cloud of GARLIC GAS!
text: Flick recoils, retching, wiping at his burning face --
speaker_heading: FLICK
dialog: --aghhk -- it's fucking garlic!
scene_heading: ON DINGO AND PROOF,
text: looking back, alarmed. Then Abigail pulls her knee to her
text: chest. A SILVER SPIKE springs out from the toe of her boot.
text: She KICKS UP, imbedding the spike up through the underside of
text: Proof's chin. Proof ASHES.
text: Before Dingo has a chance to act, Abigail gets him in a
text: leglock, FLIPPING him back onto his ass.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
text: jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat. Long tresses of
text: hair spill around her shoulders. She's not mousy at all. In
text: fact, she's beautiful. And cut like an Olympic athlete. And
text: equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons.
text: Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH! Abigail plants her heel in his face,
text: SMASHING IN his nose. She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again.
text: Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES. He goes down as --
text: -- Flick and Squid come charging! Squid gets her in a CHOKE
text: HOLD. She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the
text: nuts as he lands. He curls up, GROANING --
text: Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat --
text: -- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE
text: from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her
text: wrist. She POPs the knife through Squid's chest. He ASHES --
scene_heading: FOLLOWING ABIGAIL
text: as she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE
text: secured to her back. She holds the crescent in the center,
text: the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and --
text: CHINKT! The device extends from either end, telescoping
text: outward into a three-foot long metal arc. Connecting the two
text: ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER.
text: Abigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm. His arm falls,
text: ASHING. Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward
text: through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter --
text: Flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his
text: trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling
text: away to reveal Abigail in the background --
text: Dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life.
text: Abigail gives her UV arc a twist. It retracts. She secures
text: it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking
text: "bloop" GUN with a large barrel. She FIRES --
text: A rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters
text: against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up --
text: Dingo goes down again. He panics, trying to scrape the gunk
text: off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the
text: hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap.
text: Abigail calmly approaches. She stands over Dingo, staring
text: down at him with a look of cruel indifference. She holsters
text: her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE --
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Scream if this hurts, chica.
text: -- and SLAMS the stake into his chest.
speaker_heading: WIDEN OUT
text: Abigail turns, surveying her work. The ashen remains of the
text: vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers. In
text: thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all.
text: A train approaches, pulls into the station. PASSENGERS
text: disembark, flood the platform. They tramp all over the ashes
text: of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter.
text: Abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train.
text: She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away.
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - WHISTLER'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Whistler sits on a cot, contemplating the tarnished wedding
text: ring on his hand. He slowly spins it around his finger.
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Blade sits before a small Buddhist shrine, meditating.
text: Incense burns. His sword rests in a ceremonial holder. Near
text: silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON BLADE'S FACE
text: We hear the SOUNDS OF VIOLENCE -- ECHOING SCREAMS, GUNSHOTS.
text: These are Blade's thoughts. The inner demons he is constantly
text: trying to tame. The sounds CRESCENDO and --
text: --	Blade opens his eyes. He listens. Something is wrong.
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Blade creeps into the outer room, sword drawn.
text: NOISE behind him, turns to see --
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
text: standing in the shadows, clutching a handgun.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: What you've been worrying about.
text: They listen. Just the sound of the ocean swell. Then --
scene_heading: A WINDOW SHATTERS
text: TWO ARMORED SWAT AGENTS lower in on rappelling lines.
speaker_heading: TWO MORE AGENTS
text: CRASH through a bank of windows on either side, swinging in.
text: They FIRE cannisters of TEAR GAS. As Blade moves to engage
text: them, Whistler RUSHES into the heart of the armory --
text: A reinforced door EXPLODES inward. MORE AGENTS storm inside.
scene_heading: FROM THE WATER,
text: a military Zodiac (inflatable boat) roars up one of the wooden
text: boat ramps, laden with gun-toting AGENTS. They jump out,
text: fanning all over the boat house.
text: He hears a
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: On the floor! ON THE FLOOR!
text: Whistler FIRES at them, then makes a run for it. The agents
text: RETURN FIRE, but Whistler ducks behind a concrete pillar --
scene_heading: EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Cop cruisers, unmarked cars, and SWAT trucks sweep in, SIRENS
text: blaring, disgorging a small army of POLICE and FBI AGENTS.
text: POLICE BOATS are pulling up to the dock.
scene_heading: AGENTS CUMBERLAND AND HALE
text: emerge from an unmarked, wearing bullet-proof vests,
text: brandishing firearms. Cumberland barks orders into a radio.
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: Lock it down! Keep them contained!
text: On the rooftops above, various SWAT SNIPERS take position.
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Blade BRAWLS with a half-dozen agents, sending them flying in
text: all directions. He grabs one agent, HEAD-BUTTS him, THROWS
text: him into the path of two others --
text: Then he reaches for another, THROWING him THROUGH a window at
text: the rear, out into the river which runs below --
speaker_heading: ON WHISTLER
text: as he moves with increased urgency. The armory is filling up
text: with tear gas. Coughing and half-blind, he hurries to a bank
text: of computers, types in a series of commands --
scene_heading: THE VARIOUS COMPUTER MONITORS
text: around him synch up, showing the same protocol message:
dialog: Data protection routine enabled
dialog: --	Server 1 protection enabled...
dialog: --	Server 2 protection enabled...
text: In response, a rack of network storage equipment and removable
text: hard drives EXPLODES. Then a second rack of equipment
text: EXPLODES as well.
scene_heading: EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: From their vantage point below, Cumberland and the others can
text: hear the explosions. Cumberland is on his radio, SHOUTING:
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAN D
dialog: What's going on in there?
speaker_heading: AGENT'S VOICE
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: Some kind of self-destruct program!
dialog: They're fragging their hard drives!
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Whistler keeps moving. An agent gets a clear shot at him,
text: FIRES -- Whistler is hit in the chest.
text: Blade SEES Whistler take the hit, but he's cut off from the
text: old man, being swarmed by agents --
speaker_heading: BLADE
speaker_heading: WHISTLER!
text: Whistler staggers, keeps moving. He makes it to another bank
text: of computers, launches the same protocol.
scene_heading: ON MORE MONITORS
text: Erasing information, purging themselves. We see commands:
dialog: --	Workstation 1 protection enabled
dialog: --	Workstation 2 protection enabled
text: With each successive command, the workstations themselves
text: begin self-destructing, EXPLODING one after another.
text: Another agent gets a bead on Whistler, FIRING a round into
text: Whistler's thigh. Whistler SCREAMS --
speaker_heading: ON BLADE,
text: in anguish as he sees his mentor being slaughtered. Then two
text: agents are RUSHING HIM, tackling Blade. As one they fall
text: backwards, into another bank of windows --
scene_heading: EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CRASH! The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of
text: glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below. The
text: roof buckles under their weight, windows SHATTERING --
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: Take him down!
text: An FBI AGENT raises a CODA net gun atop his shoulder, taking
text: aim. BA-BANG! Four projectiles expand out from the barrel,
text: carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them.
text: The netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his
text: movements. Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of
text: him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission --
scene_heading: INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: On the verge of losing consciousness, Whistler props himself
text: against a piece of machinery. He's bleeding, been shot to
text: hell. One of his hands is closed, clutching something.
text: Agents warily close in around him, guns raised.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Move a finger and you're dead.
speaker_heading: WHISTLER
dialog: (flipping them off)
dialog: How 'bout this one?
text: Whistler lets his other hand uncurl. He's got a REMOTE in his
text: palm, with a tiny digital timer counting-down.
speaker_heading: AGENT #2
dialog: He's got something in his--
text: 00:03. 00:02. 00:01. The timer reaches zero.
text: A SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS
text: rock the workshop, knocking the agents back.
scene_heading: EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOUDS OF FIRE and FLAMING DEBRIS MUSHROOM OUTWARD, catching
text: all unawares, sweeping them up off their feet with a hurricane
dialog: force. In the midst of the conflagration --
text: -- Blade briefly manages to tear free of his captors --
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: WHISTLER!!!
text: -- but the wall of FIRE and LIGHT is rushing onward, sweeping
text: up everything in its path, turning the world to white.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: FADE IN. We are CLOSE ON Blade's perspiration-beaded face.
text: His eyelids flutter as he slowly regains consciousness.
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND (O.S.)
dialog: Rise and shine, sleepyhead.
text: PULL BACK. We are in a room with a one-way mirrored window.
text: Blade sits, hands cuffed behind him, BRIGHT LIGHTS shining
text: down on him. He looks disoriented, battered. Very weak.
text: Cumberland and Hale are sitting across from Blade.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Who --?
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: Special Agents Ray Cumberland and Wilson
dialog: Hale, FBI. We've been tracking you for a
dialog: long time.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Whistler --
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Dead. Just like all of your victims.
text: Blade shuts his eyes -- as if he could just wish them away.
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: How many people have you killed? Thirty?
dialog: Forty? A hundred?
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Those were familiars -- people who worked
dialog: for them --
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: And by "them" you mean vampires, right?
dialog: I suppose next you'll be telling us that
dialog: Bigfoot's in on the conspiracy too? So
dialog: what kills these bloodsu~kers, tough guy?
dialog: Maybe you can give us some pointers.
dialog: (counting on his ringers)
dialog: You can stake 'em, right? Then there's
dialog: sunlight -- what about crosses, Wilson?
dialog: Do those still work?
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: I don't know, Ray. What if a vampire's
dialog: Jewish?
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: That's a good point. And does garlic work
dialog: on a Hindu vampire? Or do you need
dialog: saffron or something?
text: Hale laughs. Cumberland shakes his head, his smile fading.
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: You can keep doing your song and dance as
dialog: long as you want, Blade, but it's not
dialog: going to play. You're a stone-cold
dialog: killer. And you're sick as fuck.
speaker_heading: VANCE (O.S.)
dialog: Let's leave the diagnosis to the
dialog: professionals.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON DR. EDGAR VANCE,
text: standing in the doorway. He's the man we saw on Larry King.
text: He takes a seat by Blade, sets a leather case on a table.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Hello, Blade. My name is Doctor Vance.
dialog: I'm with the Department of Mental Health.
dialog: I've been charged with conducting a
dialog: psychiatric evaluation of you.
dialog: (to Cumberland and Hale)
dialog: Gentleman, would you mind giving us a few
dialog: moments alone?
text: Cumberland nods. They rise, exiting the room. Vance smiles,
text: trying to project a sympathetic air.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: I imagine this must be very frightening
dialog: for you. But I want you to know that I'm
dialog: here to help. In order to do that,
dialog: however, I need to ask you some questions.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now. Can you tell me what day it is?
text: Blade just stares daggers at Vance.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: What about the President? Do you know
dialog: who's in the White House at the moment?
speaker_heading: BLADE
text: An ass-hole.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Alright then, let's talk about vampires --
dialog: what can you tell me about that?
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: On the other side of the mirror, Cumberland and Hale have
text: joined Chief Vreede. We hear Blade and Vance via speakers:
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: There's nothing to tell. They exist.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: And are you one of them?
scene_heading: INT.	POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Vance sits forward, drawing closer.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: What about blood? When you drink it, do
dialog: you find yourself sexually aroused?
text: Blade just glares at Vance.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: You see, it strikes me that this business
dialog: of vampirism has strong connotations of
text: sexual confusion. Bodily fluids being
dialog: exchanged, that sort of thing. You have
dialog: to ask where that comes from. I'm
dialog: wondering, for instance, what your
dialog: relationship was like with your mother.
dialog: Were the two of you close?
text: Blade glares. If he escapes, he's going to kill this guy.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dr. Vance steps into the observation room, joining Chief
text: Vreede, Cumberland, and Hale.
speaker_heading: VREEDE
dialog: What's your assessment, Doctor?
speaker_heading: VANCE
text: He's psychotic, with paranoid features,
dialog: possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy.
text: He's exhibiting disorganized behavior. He
dialog: obviously doesn't have a properly formed
dialog: conscience --
dialog: (spreading his hands)
dialog: For his safety and the public's, I'm
dialog: recommending that he be transferred to
dialog: County Psychiatric for further treatment.
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: That's unacceptable. This man's wanted in
dialog: connection with a laundry list of federal
dialog: crimes. I need him on a plane to the
dialog: Detention Center in Washington tonight.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Agent Cumberland, that man is in no
dialog: condition to undergo prosecution.
text: Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief.
speaker_heading: HALE
dialog: Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant
dialog: here that clearly supersedes --
speaker_heading: VREEDE
dialog: I don't care about your warrant. We're in
dialog: my jurisdiction now. You've got an issue
dialog: with that, you take it up with the local
dialog: magistrate.
text: Dr. Vance shrugs as if to say he's sorry.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has
text: already been made. A team from the
dialog: hospital should be here momentarily to
dialog: oversee the transfer.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
text: Asher, Danica, and Grimwood enter, followed by FOUR VAMPIRES
text: dressed as orderlies. The orderlies carry a straightjacket,
text: various restraints, and a collapsible transport gurney.
text: Danica approaches the DESK SERGEANT, flashing a hospital ID.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Hi. We're here to transfer a patient to
dialog: County General?
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Vance enters once more. He opens the leather case on the
text: table, removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: (speaking softly now)
dialog: Just a little something to keep you
dialog: compliant. The normal dose is two, maybe
dialog: three hundred milligrams. But for a
dialog: strapping young hybrid like yourself --
text: Vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: -- I think we'll kick it up to a couple
dialog: thousand.
text: Vance reaches for Blade's arm. Blade struggles, tries to pull
text: back, but Vance manages to inject him nonetheless.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: There. That wasn't so bad, was it?
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You're weak, aren't you? In need of your
dialog: serum. Who would've guessed a mere human
dialog: like myself could overpower you?
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: You're with them -- a familiar --
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Going on five years now.
text: Vance extends his arm, pulling back his shirt cuff a little to
text: reveal a VAMPIRE GLYPH tattooed on the underside of his wrist.
text: Then he pulls his cuff back down, smiles at Blade.
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: It's the end-game, Blade. All their plans
dialog: are finally coming to fruition. So just
dialog: sit back and enjoy the show.
text: Blade looks to the one-way mirror, SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: He's one of them! Damnit, he's working
dialog: for them!
text: Vance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to
dialog: say -- "The man's deranged. What can I do?"
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: On the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging
text: lunatic. Vance enters. He extends his hand to Vreede.
text: They shake. As they do so, we SEE a vampire GLYPH on the
text: inside of Vreede's wrist as well. Another familiar.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror. He blinks,
text: trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: An elevator door opens. Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit,
text: followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney. As
text: they move down the corridor, they pass --
text: -- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede.
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: Just hold it right there --
text: Danica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him.
text: Cumberland looks to Hale. Something isn't right about this.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: Blade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now.
speaker_heading: BLADE'S POV
text: His vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving
text: trails as he shifts his head from side to side and --
scene_heading: ASHER, DANICA, AND GRIMWOOD
text: enter, followed by two of the orderlies. Despite his
text: incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise. Danica plants her
text: heel in his chest, shoving him back down.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere.
text: She draws closer, enjoying herself.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: We moved the humans around like, pawns,
dialog: Blade. Used them to flush you out.
text: Blade tries to LUNGE from his chair at her and -- WHACK!
text: Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw. A brutal blow.
speaker_heading: GRIMWOOD
dialog: Don't worry, Captain Sunshine. Soon as we
dialog: get you out of here, you'll get a chance
dialog: to play.
text: Danica motions to the two vampire orderlies. They step
text: forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade.
text: Blade THRASHES madly. Asher LAUGHS, enjoying this.

dialog: Don't make this any harder than it has to
dialog: be. You're all alone, Blade. No one can
dialog: help you now.
text: BA-BOOM! The one-way mirror SHATTERS, exploding outward in a
text: shower of SLOW-MOTION GLASS FRAGMENTS, carrying with it --
dialog: -- a BODY, one of the vampire mental health flunkies --
text: ASHING in mid-air as he sails into the room! Seconds later --
speaker_heading: A MAN
text: VAULTS through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing
text: two high-tech electronic pistols.
text: Meet HANNIBAL KING (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an
text: irrepressible grin. Slapped to his chest is a "Hello, my name
text: is" sticker with the words "FUCK YOU" written where the name
dialog: should be.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Why'd the Polish vampire starve to death?
text: Danica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly --
speaker_heading: KING
text: He kept biting his own lip.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: King!
text: The lights go out. Immediately, backup lights come on,
text: followed by FIRE ALARMS. In the ensuing confusion ~ both
text: pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire
text: orderlies behind him to take the hit.
scene_heading: THE VAMPIRE ORDERLY ASHES
text: But unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside
text: out. (The reason is King's signature bullets -- SUN DOGS,
text: explosive rounds that give off concentrated UV light.)
text: King whips around, FIRING at --
text: -- Danica, who LEAPS behind the table. She quickly upends it,
text: using it as a shield, FLINGING it at King.
speaker_heading: ON BLADE
text: He shifts his weight, throwing himself and the chair he's
text: sitting on to the floor. Then he KICKS OUT AND UP --
text: -- connecting with Grimwood's mid-section, sending him FLYING
text: BACKWARDS -- straight through the wall into the next room!
text: King holsters one of his pistols and hauls Blade up. At the
text: same time, he FIRES on Asher again, missing him --
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Let's FLY, kemosabe!
text: King drags Blade to the door --
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: -- into the neighboring corridor. Cumberland and Hale SEE
text: them. They reach for their weapons --
speaker_heading: CUMBERLAND
dialog: He's getting away!
text: King FIRES into the room behind him, then pulls a GRENADE
text: secured to a bandolier and tosses it through the doorway --
text: An EXPLOSION rocks the interrogation room, filling the
text: corridor with smoke, knocking Cumberland and Hale back.
text: King turns his attention to Blade's handcuffs, FIRING between
text: them, freeing Blade's hands. Blade collapses against the
text: wall. He's shaking, close to passing out.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Don't die on me, you undead motherfucker!
text: King drags Blade up. They continue down the corridor to --
scene_heading: ABIGAIL, THE FEMALE VAMPIRE HUNTER
text: we met earlier. She's engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a
text: half-dozen UNIFORMED OFFICERS. Three of them are already
text: down. In seconds, she finishes off the other three.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Whistler! We need that serum NOW!
text: Whistler? Abigail spins, dispatching the last officer with a
text: kick to the mid-section while tossing a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR at
text: King. He snatches it, places it in Blade's hands.
text: Blade injects himself in the neck. Moments later, he's
text: reenergized. He looks to King, clear-eyed.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Hey Blacula, you ready to shake and bake?
text: Blade responds by PUNCHING King across the jaw.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Call me that again and I'll give you
dialog: fucking brain damage.
text: King massages his jaw, tossing Blade a pistol even as --
text: --	Grimwood rounds the corner, hungry for blood, TWO MORE
text: VAMPIRE ORDERLIES behind him.
text: Blade FIRES round after round of EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, causing
text: Grimwood and the others to fall back. Blade and King move,
text: joining Abigail. MORE SMOKE, darkness, only the emergency
text: lights to illuminate the station.
speaker_heading: UP AHEAD,
text: a group of POLICEMEN spill from a stairwell, armed with bullet
text: proof vests. They OPEN FIRE --
text: Blade, King, and Abigail retreat into an alcove. They're
text: pinned down between the vampires and a group of policemen.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: We're pinned down!
dialog: (to Blade)
dialog: Can't you do something?!
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: I can't shoot around corners!
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: I can.
text: As King and Blade lay down COVER FIRE, Abigail reaches behind
text: her, withdrawing a device that's been secured there. She
text: gives it a SNAP and it springs open, taking the shape of a --
scene_heading: FUTURISTIC COMPOUND BOW
text: Crafted from aluminum, its limbs imbedded in key positions
text: with vibration-dampening modules, this bow is capable of
text: firing an arrow upwards of 300 feet-per-second.
text: Abigail withdraws a SILVER ARROW with a time-delay explosive
text: tip from her quiver, nocks it in her bow and takes aim at --
scene_heading: A FIRE EXTINGUISHER
text: mounted at the end of the corridor. She lets her arrow fly --
text: MOVING WITH THE ARROW
text: as it banks off the side of the fire extinguisher, continuing
text: down the side corridor where it embeds itself in --
text: -- the shoulder of one of the vampires! The vampire SCREAMS,
text: grabbing the shaft, ripping it out. Then we --
text: MACRO-ZOOM ON THE ARROW HEAD
text: A tiny "egg-timer" dial on the arrowhead spins. It CLICKS in
text: place, a RED LED comes on, and --
text: --	the arrowhead EXPLODES, catching all three vampires with
text: the full force of a UV BLAST. Grimwood ducks away from the
dialog: blast as the other two vampires ASH --
scene_heading: BLADE, KING, AND ABIGAIL
text: come racing out of the alcove. They reach a stairwell. Blade
text: RIPS a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the
text: stairwell at a phalanx of COP REINFORCEMENTS who are charging
text: up the stairs. The cops go down like ten-pins.
text: Blade and company have an opening. But as they charge
dialog: downward --
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: (as King and Abigail
dialog: freeze)
dialog: My sword. They still have it.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (apoplectic)
dialog: Are you insane?! We're practically home
dialog: free! We can't go hunting for your
dialog: fucking butter-knife now!
text: But Blade is already heading back the way they came and --
speaker_heading: KING
text: Hey! HEY!!! COME BACK HERE!!! This is
dialog: supposed to be a rescue!
text: -- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Forget it, King. Let's move.
scene_heading: POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: King and Abigail rush outside. The station is gated. FLASHING
text: POLICE CARS are surging through the mouth of the gate.
dialog: They're trapped. Then --
speaker_heading: CRASH!
text: A window on the third floor of the station EXPLODES OUTWARD.
text: Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in
text: a cat-like crouch. With his sword in his hand. He looks at
text: King, grins, flips him off.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Now we can go.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (nudging Abigail)
dialog: Is he epic or what?
text: The police close in around them, pinning the trio down with
text: FIREPOWER. Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because --
speaker_heading: HEADLIGHTS
text: are washing over them. A beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is
text: SCREAMING up the street. The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk,
text: SMASHES right through the gated wall. SCREECHES to a stop
text: between our trio and the police cars.
speaker_heading: A DRIVER (DEX)
text: leans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors
text: pop open. Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: My name is Dex. And I'll be saving your
dialog: ass this evening.
text: Blade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land
text: Cruiser. Dex reverses, backing out the way he came.
text: The police from the squad cars are FIRING, but the Land
text: Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly SPARK off.
scene_heading: INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT
text: In the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield --
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL'S POV
text: Grimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land
text: Cruiser. Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah.
scene_heading: EXT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT
text: Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in
text: her bow. She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly --
text: SHUNKT! The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye. He goes down,
text: his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background
text: as the Land Cruiser speeds away.
scene_heading: INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT
text: Safe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a
text: battle well fought. Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone.
speaker_heading: DEX
dialog: We have him. We'll be there soon.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (to Blade)
dialog: So my entrance back there -- what do you
dialog: think? Too flashy? Right on the money?
text: King unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof
text: vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Who are you people?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: My name's Hannibal King. I'm a hunter,
dialog: like you.
dialog: (re: Abigail)
dialog: And this little hellion is Abigail
dialog: Whistler.
text: Abigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: That's right, Blade. You're not hearing
dialog: things. She's Whistler's daughter. You
dialog: see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part
text: of Whistler's "contingency plan".
text: King reaches into an inner pocket, pulls out a pack of gum.
text: He selects a stick, offers one to Blade.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Juicyfruit?
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
text: The Land Cruiser rockets away, disappearing into the night.
scene_heading: EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT
text: The Land Cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the
text: weed-choked ruins of an old amusement park. We pass by the
text: skeletal remains of a roller-coaster, a tilt-a-whirl, the
text: vandalized and wood-rotted remnants of a carousel.
text: Finally, the Land Cruiser turns towards a motorized loading
text: door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT
text: As the door grinds closed, the Land Cruiser stops. King and
text: Abigail lead Blade through the darkness. In the gloom we see
text: a half-dozen vehicles in various stages of being retrofitted
text: with armored panels and weaponry, etc. SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
text: mounted above track their progress.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: I thought the vampires murdered
dialog: Whistler's family.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: They did. I'm the product of an earlier
dialog: fling of my Dad's, born out of wedlock.
dialog: After the murders happened, he kept me
dialog: hidden. He wanted me safe. Away from all
dialog: of this --
dialog: (gesturing around them)
dialog: -- but I guess hunting just runs in our
dialog: blood.
text: As King and Abigail lead Blade towards a stairway, Blade
dialog: catches sight of --
speaker_heading: A LITTLE GIRL (5)
text: peering down at him from atop one of the rafters. As soon as
text: he spots her, she ducks into the shadows.
text: They reach the stairway. AUTOMATED GUNS mounted on swivel
text: arms lock on them with infra-red targeting beams.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: When I came of age, I tracked my Dad
dialog: down, told him I wanted in.
dialog: (beat, shrugging)
dialog: Been doing it ever since.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: We enter a sprawling industrial facility that is equal parts
text: mechanics shop, firing range, and laboratory. We glimpse a
text: virtual arsenal of new weaponry and medical equipment,
text: including DNA sequencers, microfuges, and electroporaters.
text: The new equipment fights for space alongside the old -
text: mountains of mothballed parts from the park's broken thrill
text: rides. Here and there we see the oversized fiberglass head of
text: a grinning fun-house creature or the mildewed torso of a
text: fortune-telling mannequin, frozen in its upended booth.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Welcome to the honeycomb hideout.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: How do you bankroll this place?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Internet porn. See, we're using cock
text: suckers to pay for the blood-suckers.
dialog: (off Blade's look)
dialog: Joke. Come on, man. This isn't some
dialog: piddly little hoopty-ass operation, Blade.
dialog: We take our jobs very seriously.
speaker_heading: UP AHEAD,
text: TWO OTHERS pause in their work as King approaches. Dex falls
text: in behind them.
text: HEDGES (20s) is an engineer, always lost in his own world.
text: SOMMERFIELD (30s) is a frail-looking geneticist. She's also
text: blind, operating her computers via a voice-synthesis program
text: and Braille keyboard.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: You met Dex. This is Hedges, Sommerfield--
text: King gestures to them in turn. They're all refugees in one
dialog: way or another, sharing a common guardedness, their lives
text: having been shattered by the vampires.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (nodding back)
dialog: The runt you saw earlier is Sommerfield's
dialog: daughter, Zoe. We call ourselves the
dialog: Nightstalkers.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: You sound like rejects from a Saturday
dialog: morning cartoon.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: We were gonna call ourselves the Super
dialog: Friends, but that was taken.
text: Abigail rids herself of her weapons -- bow, arrows, silver
text: stakes and knives. She hands her compound bow to Hedges.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Tiller needs adjustment.
speaker_heading: HEDGES
dialog: I'll run it through the bow press.
text: Blade examines some of the equipment being developed.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: How many of you are there total?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Enough. We operate in sleeper cells.
text: When one goes down, a new cell activates
dialog: to pick up the slack. Consider us your
dialog: reinforcements.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Sorry. Never been much of a team player.
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
dialog: I don't think you understand, Blade.
dialog: Whistler meant for us to help you. When
dialog: he died, he activated an emergency
dialog: protocol. All his knowledge --
text: She gestures to the computer equipment around her.
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
dialog: --was transferred to our servers here.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: And what makes you think you know so much
dialog: about killing vampires?
text: King reaches for his collar, pulling it down to reveal a
text: telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a BITE MARK.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Well for starters, I used to be one.
dialog: (in a sinister tone)
dialog: Do I pass the audition?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - NIGHT
text: We soar through the night sky, diving down towards a cluster
text: of gleaming, high-tech spires. As we isolate a penthouse
text: apartment atop one of them we hear an ANGRY SCREAM.
speaker_heading: DANICA (O.S.)
dialog: Fucking Hannibal King!
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: An impressively decorated loft bespeaking of money, power, and
text: a certain perverse esthetic. Danica slams her fist straight
text: through the wall, then spins around, enraged.
text: Asher and Grimwood are there too, their wounds being treated
text: by Hendrix and a VAMPIRE TECHNICIAN. At tie moment, they're
text: trying to remove the arrow protruding from Grimwood's eye.
text: An enormous ROTTWEILER sits nearby, attentively watching. A
text: TRIO OF GUARDS flinch with every act of violence. Danica is
text: strong. Clearly, no one wants to get in her way.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: I should've ripped his ripped his
dialog: bleeding heart out when I had the chance!
dialog: (pointing at Asher)
dialog: And don't you dare tell me "I told you
dialog: so"!
text: Asher raises his hands as if to say "no harm, no foul".
text: Danica continues her tantrum, SMASHING a statue apart,
text: SHATTERING a heavy glass tabletop. Finally, she gives it a
text: rest, collapsing into a chair, shoulders sagging.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: You through remodeling?
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Blow me.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Face it, Dan. We got caught with our
dialog: pants down. We underestimated the
dialog: Nightstalkers.
speaker_heading: GRIMWOOD
dialog: Pants down?! They practically fucking
dialog: ass-raped us!
text: Grimwood GRUNTS in pain as the arrow is removed. Asher
text: broaches a more serious subject.
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Has he been told yet?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: About your failure?
text: A MAN (30s) enters the room. The same being we glimpsed in
text: the vault. He has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence.
dialog: We will learn who he is momentarily. But for now, it's enough
text: to know that everyone in the room pays him deference.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Yes, I've been told.
text: He places a hand on Danica's shoulder. She tenses.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Perhaps it's time I entered the fray.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON King buttoning his collar back up. Blade, Abigail,
text: and Sommerfield are gathered around him.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: You know the kind of woman that just
dialog: screams trouble? You see her and every
dialog: warning bell in your brain starts going
dialog: off but you still ask for her number?
dialog: Well that's all I ever hook up with. But
dialog: this betty blew 'em all away in the
dialog: shitstorm sweepstakes.
text: King reaches out to a keyboard, calling up a piece of
text: surveillance footage on a nearby monitor. The footage
text: features Asher and Danica and Grimwood. It's been slowed to a
text: near standstill and now advances frame by frame.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Her name's Danica Talos. You met her
text: earlier. The man on her left is Asher,
dialog: her brother.
text: King types a command. The image ZOOMS IN, tracking Grimwood.
speaker_heading: KING
text: The neanderthal behind them is Jarko
dialog: Grimwood.
text: King freezes the footage on Danica's grainy, pixelated face.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: I picked Danica up in a bar, had a one
dialog: night stand with her -- then spent the
dialog: next five years playing step-and-fetch-it
text: as her little vampire cabana boy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Eventually Abigail found me. Sommerfield
dialog: here managed to treat me with a cure. Now
dialog: I kill them.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's called turning a frown upside
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: We need to pool our resources, Blade.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Because He's come back.
text: King tosses a TOMB OF DRACULA comic book over to Blade. Blade
text: glances at the cover, then looks at them, incredulous.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: You gotta be kidding me.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: He's real, Blade. Dig beneath all the
dialog: movies and myths. All the layers of
dialog: bullshit that've cluttered our culture for
dialog: the last five hundred years and eventually
dialog: you'll strike the truth.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: So the movies are true?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: The movies are just a comforting
dialog: fairytale compared to the real deal.
dialog: There's no happy ending with this guy.
dialog: Peter Cushing isn't going to run in at the
dialog: last second and save the day with a cross
dialog: and some holy water.
dialog: (re: the comicbook)
dialog: See, good old Brain Stoker, he wrote a
dialog: nice yarn. But the events he described in
text: 1897 were only a tiny piece of the mosaic.
dialog: The rea1 Dracula's origin goes back much
dialog: earlier than that.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: How early?
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Try six or seven thousand years.
dialog: Off Blade's astonished look we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MESOPOTAMIA - NIGHT
text: FLASH! We see the man we met earlier (DRACULA/DRAKE) on the
text: banks of the river Euphrates, striding towards us, engaged in
text: fierce battle with UBAIDIAN SOLDIERS. He's clutching the same
text: sword we saw in the ziggurat, clad in the same armor.
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: Dracula's only one of the names he's gone
dialog: by. Now they call him Drake. If you
dialog: believe the legends, he was born in
dialog: ancient Sumeria.
text: As Drake SLASHES his sword downward we CUT BACK TO --
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: -- King continuing his story. As the hunter's monologue
dialog: progresses we will INTERCUT with Drake's own progression
text: through history. Brief, violent FLASHBACKS.
dialog: (NOTE: The backgrounds surrounding Drake will be
text: expressionistic, digital composites, constantly shifting. The
text: focus of the flashes is Drake himself, fighting a shadowy
text: horde, his attire continually evolving through time.)
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Nobody really knows the specifics of his
dialog: origin. But we do know this: he was the
dialog: first of his kind. The patriarch of the
text: hominus nocturna.
scene_heading: EXT. EGYPTIAN DESERT - NIGHT
dialog: FLASH! We are in Egypt now, circa 1650 BC. Drake wages war
text: against the HYKSOS. He is closer to the camera. And will
text: continue to move closer with each successive flashback.
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: Every single vampire -- every single
dialog: monster that's walked the earth since then
dialog: -- owes their existence to Him.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Back to King, holding court before Blade and Abigail.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: He's like the Patient Zero of evil. The
text: original Serpent in the Garden of Eden.
dialog: And just like the Great White shark, he's
dialog: never had to evolve. This guy was born
dialog: perfect. Scour the history books --
scene_heading: EXT. THRACE - NIGHT
text: FLASH! The Peloponnesian War, Southern Thrace, circa 405 BC.
text: We see Dracula battling ATHENIANS. Even closer now, his face
text: spattered with blood. At the same time, the SOUNDTRACK is
text: gradually swelling, expanding in complexity and volume.
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: -- read between the lines --
scene_heading: EXT. HUNGARIA - NIGHT
text: FLASH! 5th century AD, battling the GOTHS. With every swipe
text: of his sword, we WIPE FORWARD into the future.
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: -- you'll find countless references to
dialog: Him. Always mentioned, never named.
scene_heading: EXT. EUROPE - NIGHT
text: FLASH! 8th century AD, the reign of Charlemagne. Battling
text: the VIKINGS. The FLASHBACKS come faster now, assaulting us
text: with ever-increasing rapidity.
text: Drake continues striding forward while the rest of the world
text: evolves around him, centuries whizzing by via computer
text: generated time-lapse photography.
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: He's been there --
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS - NIGHT
dialog: FLASH! 12th century AD, the time of the Crusades. The
text: violence intensifies.
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: -- moving behind the scenes --
dialog: FLASH! 17th century France, the time of Louis the XIV. The
text: pace becomes breathless.
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: -- cutting a bloody path through the Ages
dialog: until suddenly --
dialog: FLASH! 18th century Russia, the time of Peter the Great. The
text: soundtrack is THUNDEROUS. Drake has become a bloody blur of
text: bestial rage and unfettered horror and --
speaker_heading: KING (V.0.)
dialog: -- just like that --
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: -- King SNAPS his fingers. We are back in the present.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: -- he up and disappeared. About a century
dialog: ago the trail went cold. Then we heard a
dialog: rumor. The vampires were searching for
dialog: him -- trying to find the place where he'd
dialog: retreated. According to our information,
dialog: they found him in Iraq about six months
dialog: ago.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And he was pissed.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: Grime. Neon. Near-silence as the cacophonous soundtrack
text: recedes into the background, replaced by the steady drone of
text: inner-city TRAFFIC.
speaker_heading: ON DRAKE,
text: viewed through a long-lens, clad in modern, casual attire,
text: striding in SLOW-MOTION down a PEDESTRIAN-CHOKED sidewalk.
text: Slower. A HEARTBEAT. The pulse of the people. And over
text: this, intruding, the Doppler effect WAILING of an approaching
text: car as it rushes past us in a SCREEN WIPE until we are --
scene_heading: OUTSIDE A GOTH STORE
text: Drake studies a window display. Halloween merchandise.
text: Costumes and monster masks and -- VAMPIRE NOVELTIES. We see
text: vampire lunchboxes, Dracula plush dolls, plastic fangs, key
text: chains. Even Dracula bobbleheads.
text: Drake stands in stark contrast to the mass-marketed caricature
text: on display before him.
scene_heading: INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT
text: Drake enters. The store is crowded with low-end junky goods
dialog: that might appeal to tourists visiting Hollywood Boulevard.
text: A pallid, Goth-guy CASHIER sits behind a counter, eating from
text: a takeout container. He's wafer thin, with a detached
text: attitude. A snot. Further back is a sultry GOTH VIXEN.
text: Behind them, on a TV, a cartoon is playing. An animated
text: vampire cavorts -- "LITTLE BIT" (like the Hot Stuff devil from
dialog: Ritchie Rich comicbooks)
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: In the window -- you sell vampire
dialog: merchandise?
text: Goth Guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin. Doesn't
dialog: want to engage with Drake at all.
speaker_heading: GOTH GUY
dialog: Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a
dialog: few things.
text: He and the Goth Vixen have a snicker at Drake's expense. Then
text: she tries to be a little more helpful.
speaker_heading: GOTH VIXEN
dialog: We've got Dracula lunchboxes. Did you
dialog: see those? And there're bobbleheads, Pez
dialog: dispensers. We've got just about
dialog: anything --
dialog: (selecting a vampire-
dialog: shaped vibrator, playful)
dialog: -- even vampire vibrators.
text: As Drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending
text: rage. Costumes, candles, vampire Christmas ornaments.
text: Posters from different films -- Nosferatu, Lugosi, Lee -- then
dialog: Love at First Bite and The Little Vampire.
speaker_heading: GOTH VIXEN
dialog: Here, check this out --
text: She reaches into a case, pulling out a soft-drink. The label
text: reads: "DRA-COLA" and has a stylized vampire on it.
speaker_heading: GOTH VIXEN
dialog: "Dracola". Makes you want to cry,
dialog: doesn't it?
text: Drake just stares at the can. His mind seems to have
dialog: retreated elsewhere. Back through the ages.
speaker_heading: GOTH VIXEN
dialog: Was there something special you needed?
text: Drake doesn't respond. A kind of melancholy has settled over
text: him. He's an outsider now. The world has moved on.
speaker_heading: GOTH-GUY
dialog: Hey, guy, she's talking to you.
text: Drake looks up as Goth Guy pours a bowl of Count Chocula.
scene_heading: EXT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT
text: CRASH! Goth Guy comes flying through the display window, his
text: trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into
text: the display window of the store opposite us.
scene_heading: INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT
text: Goth Vixen SCREAMS. Drake LASHES out. hauling her over the
text: counter. He sinks his teeth into her throat, drinking her

text: Then Drake tears his head away, lifting his face upward as he
text: flings the girl aside, unleashing an ear-splitting ROAR. And

text: again hinting at another shape Drake might take.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CITY - VARIOUS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT/DAY

scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAWN
text: Sunlight slices down through skylights, bathing Blade, King,
text: Abigail, and Sommerfield in its warmth. Zoe has joined them.
text: She's still cautious and shy, but she's also curious.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Why wake up Drake now?
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: That's what we've been trying to figure
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: When I was under the fang there used to be
dialog: talk about some kind of vampire 'Final
dialog: Solution'. But I could never figure out
dialog: why they'd want to destroy their food
dialog: source. I mean, seems stupid, right?
dialog: They've always had plans for the human
dialog: race. Seems likely that whatever they're
text: cooking up, Drake's return is a part of
dialog: it.
text: Blade nods, pensive.
speaker_heading: KING (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's face it, Blade -- we're fighting a
dialog: losing battle.
dialog: So we kill a few hundred of them a year.
dialog: Big deal. There are thousands of them out
dialog: there. Maybe tens of th'usands. We need
dialog: a new tactic.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
dialog: A biological weapon.
text: Sommerfield moves to her Braille keyboard, types.
scene_heading: ON A NEARBY MONITOR
text: we SEE a real-time magnified view of a virus replicating.
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD (CONT' D)
dialog: For the last year I've been~working with
dialog: synthesized DNA in order to create an
dialog: artificial virus targeted specifically at
dialog: vampires. We're calling it DayStar.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Think about it, Blade. We could wipe
text: them all out in a single move.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: So what's been holding you back?
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: We've tried it on a number of captive
dialog: subjects. We've got the disease vector
dialog: worked out fine -- it's easily
dialog: transmittable. But the lethality in
text: vampires is still spotty.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Bottom line is, we need a better DNA
dialog: sample to work with.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We need Dracula's blood.
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
text: Vampire DNA is a hodge-podge of different
dialog: genes, mixed in with all sorts of useless
dialog: junk DNA. Because Dracula's the
dialog: progenitor of the vampire race, his DNA is
text: still pure. It hasn't been diluted by a
dialog: hundred generations of selective mutation.
dialog: It still has all the necessary cellular
dialog: compounds for the virus to code to. We
dialog: get his blood, we can boost Daystar's
dialog: viral efficacy to a hundred percent.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: So. You want to join our club? Can we
dialog: sign you up for a Nightstalkers secret

scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - DAY
text: A darkened room, relatively austere. The only source of light
text: are a series of small, slitted skylights in the ceiling above.
text: From these skylights, narrow, blinding white shafts of
text: sunlight knife downward to penetrate the gloom.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
text: sits in a chair, his body partially illuminated by one of the
text: sunlight shafts, his face turned upward into its brilliance.
text: FOOTSTEPS. Drake opens his eyes, SEES Danica hovering in the
text: darkness, just on the edge of a shaft of light.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: This world sickens me. The humans have
dialog: soiled it with their filth.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: We can raze their cities to the ground.
dialog: We can bring the old world back.
text: Drake just stares at her, not convinced.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Come closer.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: (re: light)
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: And do you know why?
dialog: (off Danica's silence)
dialog: Once, all of my kind could brave the day.
dialog: We were true predators. The world was
dialog: ours. And then, somewhere along the way,
dialog: the purity of our bloodline became
text: diluted. Polluted with human DNA.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: That's impossible --
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Is it?
text: Drake stands, drawing close to Danica. He grips her wrist --
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: You are bastard children. No longer as
dialog: pure as you pride yourselves on being.
text: -- and pulls her hand towards one of the sunlight shafts. To
text: her credit, Danica keeps staring at Drake. She'll be damned
dialog: if she will give him the satisfaction of seeing her break.
text: Drake pulls her hand closer to the light -- to the very edge.
text: And the tips of Danica's fingers begin to burn. She winces,
text: clearly in agony --
text: -- and Drake releases her hand. She cradles it against her
text: chest, blinking away tears that have welled up in her eyes.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: My people. How far you have fallen.
text: Drake reaches out, brushes a tear from Danica's cheek, then

text: sunlight and darkness.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAY
text: Blade, King, and Abigail stand before a table where an
text: assortment of weaponry and ammunition has been laid out on
text: display. Hedges is there too, assisting them. Zoe watches.
speaker_heading: HEDGES
dialog: We've got a wide assortment of ass-
dialog: kickery for your viewing pleasure --
dialog: (hefting a pistol)
text: Electronic pistol. Comes with a built-in
text: fingerprint security system. Fires a
text: three-shot burst in 1/500th of a second.
text: Bullets can also be triggered remotely.
text: King tosses Blade a bullet. He studies it -- it's more
dialog: complex than a standard round.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Explosive rounds?
speaker_heading: KING
text: But with a concentrated burst of UV light
dialog: instead of your standard hollow-points. I
dialog: call 'em sun dogs.
dialog: (to Hedges)
dialog: Hedges -- super-size me, baby!
text: Hedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms. On the
text: stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: This little mamacita -- a modified
dialog: version of the Army's Objective
dialog: Individual Combat Weapon. Pick your
dialog: poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking
dialog: mini-rockets. Whatever gets you hard,
dialog: this puppy will pump out.
dialog: (gesturing to Blade's
dialog: sword, sarcastic)
dialog: Of course it doesn't have the range of a
dialog: sword but --
text: Next, Hedges shows Blade the CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE that
text: Abigail used. He gives the device a twist and --
speaker_heading: HEDGES
dialog: We call this the UV arc --
text: CHINKT! The device extends from either end, telescoping
text: outward. Connecting the tips is a concentrated UV LASER.
speaker_heading: HEDGES
dialog: You hold the arc in the center, curved
dialog: away from you. Connecting the tips is a
dialog: powerful UV laser beam. Because of its
text: high focus, the laser cuts through vampire
text: flesh like a knife through butter.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: We're still trying to sort out fact from
dialog: fiction when it comes to Dracula. Turning
dialog: into mist? Kinda doubt it. But general
dialog: shape-shifting? Maybe.
speaker_heading: HEDGES
dialog: (off Blade's look)
dialog: Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like
dialog: that. But another human, someone with the
dialog: same approximate body mass -- given enough
dialog: practice it might be possible.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: HEDGES
dialog: He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal
text: structure. Probably something more like a
text: snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the
text: place of a normal array. Commensurate
dialog: with this would be an exquisite control of
dialog: electrical potential across his tissues,

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - DAY

speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Time to apply some pressure. The weak

scene_heading: INT. LAND CRUISER - DAY

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: She's making playlists. Likes to listen
text: to MP3s when she hunts. Her own internal
dialog: soundtrack, you know? Dark-core, trip
dialog: hop, whatever kids these days are
dialog: listening to. Me? I'm more of a Kenny G
dialog: fan.
text: Finished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on

scene_heading: EXT. SEEDY BAR - DAY

text: flyers we see a vampire glyph.
scene_heading: INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY
text: BANG! Blade KICKS open the door. A couple of LOW-LIFES take

text: One of the low-lifes takes off running, back past the
text: bathroom, shouldering a door at the rear --
scene_heading: EXT. SEEDY BAR - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY
text: --	STUMBLING right into Abigail's arms. She trips him up,
text: swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him. She pulls the

text: We can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing,
text: raising his hands in a "please don't hit me anymore" manner.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY
text: The Land Cruiser rockets down the streets.
scene_heading: EXT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSES - VARIOUS - DAY
text: In quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives --
dialog: -- a pool hall --
dialog: -- an internet cafe --
dialog: -- an electronics repair shop --
text: All are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms
text: with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where
text: the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested.
text: In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to
dialog: oldfashioned strong-arm tactics:
text: -- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar.
text: -- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw.
text: -- Abigail KICKS a familiar in the stomach.
text: Cut to a flurry of EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of VAMPIRE GLYPHS being
text: exposed on the backs of familiar's necks, one after another --
text: THEN A MONTAGE OF FACES
text: as familiars have their heads cainfully SMASHED against --
dialog: -- walls --
dialog: -- car hoods --
dialog: -- pool tables --
text: -- into windows and doors and garbage cans.
text: The bullying moves come faster, the shots becoming more and
dialog: more abstract until --
scene_heading: EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - DAY
text: -- WHAM! Blade tosses HOOP, a skinny familiar, off a roof.
text: It's a four story drop. Hoop falls, SCREAMING -- but then
text: jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down.
text: We see now that Hoop has rope tied around one of Hoop's
text: ankles. And Blade is clutching the other end of the rope.
text: Blade hauls Hoop back up -- but still keeps him dangling
text: upside down. King and Abigail look on.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Want another spin, ass-hole? Eventually,
dialog: your head's gonna pop off.

speaker_heading: HOOP

scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
dialog: Dr. Vance, the psychiatrist who gave Blade the mental

speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: This is Dr. Vance. Did someone page me?
scene_heading: EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - DAY

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Hey, Blade -- why didn't the vampire bite

scene_heading: INT. VANCE INSTITUTE FOR WHOLE BEING - LOBBY - DAY

speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: I'm Dr. Vance. Welcome to our facility.
dialog: As a member of the medical profession I
dialog: want to assure you that I will do

speaker_heading: VANCE

speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: Now, I'd like to take a moment to exolain
dialog: how a series of remarkable new

text: He FIRES at the keycard lock, KICKS down the door --
scene_heading: INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: --	startling Dr. Vance himself, who is rising up from behind
text: his desk. Vance is wiping his mouth, not dressed like a
dialog: doctor would normally be. But we hardly notice this as --
speaker_heading: VANCE
dialog: What --?
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Payback, Vance.
text: --	Blade aims his shotgun at Vance's head. Vance just
text: smiles, seemingly unconcerned as --
text: --	Abigail circles around the other side, getting a view
text: behind Vance's desk where --
speaker_heading: VANCE'S BODY
text: lies on the floor. His throat has been ripped out. And this
text: body is dressed like a doctor.
text: King puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even
text: as we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE coming from beneath
dialog: the Vance double's flesh --
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Jesus, it's him! It's Drake!
text: The Vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of
text: Blade's shotgun aside, re-directing the BLAST, which SHATTERS
text: a glass window. Then he KICKS Blade in the chest, KNOCKING
text: him clear across the office as --
text: --	King advances. The Vance double's face WARPS, the bones
text: in his head shifting around. He reaches for King, SLAMS him
text: onto the desk, TWISTS the stake from King's hand and brutally
text: SHOVING it into King's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top.
text: Then the Vance double whirls around to engage Abigail -- only
text: we see that it's Drake now, having taken Vance's shape.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
text: BACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow.
text: She spins, falling --
text: -- and Drake is moving like a hurricane, LEAPING through the
text: window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast.
speaker_heading: BLADE
text: gives chase. He looks out the window, SEES Drake landing on
text: the ground, some three stories below.
scene_heading: EXT. VANCE INSTITUTE - REAR ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY
text: Drake runs with inhuman speed. He effortlessly scales a chain
text: link fence, then BARRELS straight through a wooden barricade,
text: sailing over a trash dumpster. Seconds later, Blade follows,
text: catching sight of Drake rushing out into --
scene_heading: EXT. STREET MARKET - VARIOUS - DAY
text: -- a crowded urban market. What unfolds is a foot-chase at
text: super-human velocity. Vampire and hunter are moving at least
text: twenty miles an hour, BATTERING ASIDE various pedestrians,
text: SMASHING through and over stalls of merchandise.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY
text: Drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes
text: of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST.
text: Abruptly, Drake cuts into the traffic, LEAPING atop the hood
text: of an oncoming car. The car's HORN sounds, brakes SQUEAL.
scene_heading: BLADE FOLLOWS,
text: jumping onto the hood of another car. More
text: HORNS sound.
text: In this manner. Drake and Blade race across the flowing
text: traffic itself. using the hoods and roofs of the cars like
text: moving stepping stones.
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET
text: Drake mounts the steps of an older apartment building,
text: THUNDERS his way through the main entrance --
scene_heading: INT. OLDER BUILDING - STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Blade is on Drake like a shadow. We're internal now, the
text: sound of Blade's LABORED BREATH moving to the foreground of
text: the soundscape.
text: Chaos. A BARKING DOG darting from a doorway. Up ahead, an
text: OLD MAN has been knocked over. An insane dash up two flights
text: of stairs, then down a corridor, passing MORE TENANTS.
text: Somewhere, a WOMAN SCREAMS. We hear GLASS BREAKING and --
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: My baby
dialog: -- there's another open door --
scene_heading: INT. OLDER BUILDING - APARTMENT - DAY
text: -- Blade tears into an apartment, passing a HYSTERICAL WOMAN,
text: an upended crib. He SEES a broken window by a fire escape --
scene_heading: EXT. OLDER BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - DAY
text: Cut onto the fire escape. A glimpse of Drake overhead.
text: Blade clambers up the fire escape, moving in a near-blur. One
text: story of steps up the rickety metal ladder --
text: SMASH! A LARGE PLANTER comes down from above, nearly striking
text: Blade. He lets go with one hand, swings outward --
text: -- then he's climbing again. A CLOUD OF PIGEONS take wing,
text: flapping frenetically about him, momentarily blinding him.
text: Another story, a third, a fourth. As he reaches the top,
text: Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him --
scene_heading: EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY
text: -- FLIPPING himself over and onto the roof. He lands in a cat
text: stance, drawing his sword, quickly scanning the area.
speaker_heading: DRAKE (O.S.)
dialog: So you're the hunter they all fear.
dialog: Blade spins --
speaker_heading: DRAKE
text: stands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an INFANT in his
text: arms. In the full glare of the afternoon sun.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: (re: infant)
dialog: Just so we understand each other,
dialog: Daywalker.
text: With his free hand, he massages his jaw. We hear a few more
text: Pieces of POPPING CARTKAGE as the very last of Drake's
text: cermanent features seem to settee into clace.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Why did you kill Vance?
speaker_heading: DRAKE
text: He'd outlived his purpose. He'd become a
dialog: liabi1ity.
text: Drake nods at Blade's sword --
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before.
dialog: Eight or nine centuries ago. The hunter
dialog: who carried it was an accomplished
dialog: fighter.
scene_heading: EXT. SEASIDE CLIFF - DAY (THE PAST)
text: Drake in his armor, head to head with a 14th century VAMPIRE
text: HUNTER. The hunter has BLADE'S SWORD. Drake tears the sword
text: from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back
text: through the man's chest. And as the man GASPS we are --
scene_heading: EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY (THE PRESENT)
dialog: -- back to here and now.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: He was honorable, in his own way. He
dialog: died a good death.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: I wouldn't know about that.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: You lie. You're part of a grand
dialog: tradition, Blade. You hunters have
dialog: plagued my people since the day we first
dialog: walked the earth. And I have vanquished
dialog: them. One by one.
text: Blade pauses, looking for some kind of opening.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: How can you exist in the daylight?
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: I've always been able to. Haven't you
dialog: read Mr. Stoker's fable? I was the first
dialog: of the vampires. I am unique.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: That's why they brought you back.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Yes. My children seek to isolate the
dialog: properties in my blood that make me immune
dialog: to sunlight. Through me, they believe
dialog: they can all become Daywalkers.
text: Drake glances down at the street people. Throngs of PEOPLE
text: are massing there, pointing up at him.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: The world's changed much since I went to
dialog: sleep. How crowded it's become. Look at
dialog: them down there. Lives brief as
dialog: fireflies. Do you think they can ever
dialog: grasp what it means to be immortal like
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: You're not immortal. I must've heard a
dialog: hundred of you people make the same claim.
dialog: And every one of them's seen the end of my
dialog: sword.
text: Drake smiles, intrigued by an obviously worthy opponent.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Perhaps I will as well, then. But I think
dialog: it's more likely that you will fall before
dialog: mine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Catch.
text: Drake tosses the infant at Blade. Blade twists around to
text: catch it, scooping it safely up. But when he looks back --
dialog: -- Drake is gone.
speaker_heading: KING (O.S.)
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: INT. VANCE INSTITUTE - VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON King being propped up against the wall by Abigail.

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Jesus, it hurts. I wanna be a vampire
dialog: again -- fuck! Did you see that guy?!
dialog: We're gonna lose, man. We're gonna
dialog: fucking lose.
text: Abigail ignores King, cuts open his shirt. She removes a
text: small aerosol cannister from her belt.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Fibrin sealant foam, it's an elastic
dialog: protein. Help me spread the wound open.
dialog: The foam should seal the hemorrhaging in
dialog: his body cavity from within --
text: Together they spread the wound apart. King is really hurting,
text: breathing hard as he tries to fight back the pain.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Hey, hey -- what'd the one lesbian
dialog: vampire say to the other?
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Shut up, King.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: -- see you in twenty-eight days --
text: King's voice trails off as he passes out. Abigail triggers

text: foam condenses, sealing the wound up.
scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: Blade and Abigail enter the HQ, hauling King between them.

scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - INFIRMARY - DAY
text: King drowses on a cot. His shirt is off and his chest has

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Hey, Blade -- say we're successful. Say
dialog: we wipe the vampires out. What happens
dialog: then? You ever ask yourself that?
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: Somehow I don't picture you parked on a

scene_heading: INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - LABORATORY AREA - DAY
text: Later, Sommerfield and Hedges consult with Blade and Abigail.
speaker_heading: HEDGES
dialog: So basically we're in an arms race.

text: Caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store.
scene_heading: INT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - NIGHT
text: Caulder unlocks an accordion security gate, opens the door.
text: He leads Blade and Abigail through the darkened aisles. There
text: are fish tanks on either side, aerators BUBBLING, aquatic
text: animals of every kind swimming about.
text: IN THE BACK
text: is another arsenal/lab area. This one is smaller than the
text: Nightstalkers' main headquarters. Caulder moves to a
text: computer, calls up a file. A dialogue box for a media player
text: opens. Caulder activates a video file.
speaker_heading: CAULDER
dialog: Sommerfield left a video message for you.
speaker_heading: ON THE MONITOR
text: The video plays. We see Sommerfield's face on the screen.
text: She looks grave, as if she might have been crying.
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
dialog: (on video)
dialog: If you're watching this, I'm already dead.
dialog: If Zoe's still alive, I want you to
dialog: promise you'll take care of her. I've
dialog: been reading her The Oz books every night.
dialog: We just started The Emerald City of Oz,
dialog: the one with the Nome King --
text: Her voice cracks and she pauses, wiping away a tear.
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
dialog: I think I've managed to cultivate a
dialog: workable strain of the Daystar virus. As
dialog: a precaution, I transmitted the genetic
dialog: sequence to Caulder, in case our main
dialog: stock was destroyed. In order for it to
dialog: achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to
dialog: interfuse it with Drake's blood. If it
dialog: works, any vampires in the immediate
dialog: vicinity should die almost instantly.
dialog: After that, it should take only a few
dialog: weeks for the virus to spread throughout
dialog: the rest of the world.
text: Zoe hesitates, deciding how to broach the next subject.
speaker_heading: SOMMERFIELD
dialog: There's one other thing, Blade. You need
dialog: to know that there's a chance the virus
dialog: could destroy you too. Because you're a
dialog: hybrid, I'm not sure whether your immune
dialog: system will be able tolerate it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry. We didn't have enough time to
dialog: properly test it.
text: The video cuts to STATIC. Abigail turns off the monitor,
text: looking to Blade. God only knows what he's thinking.
speaker_heading: CAULDER
dialog: Take a look at the plague arrow.
text: Caulder reaches for a refrigerated aluminum case, snapping it
text: open. Inside, resting on a bed of form-fitting foam, is a
text: glass ampule that's been fitted into a stake-like contraption.
text: It looks like the head of a high-tech harpoon.
speaker_heading: CAULDER
dialog: I only had time to fabricate a small batch
dialog: of Daystar. I outfitted it with a
dialog: compressed gas projectile, so you should
dialog: be able to fire it from one of the
text: fourbarrel rifles or a bow.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just make sure the shot counts, cause we
dialog: don't have enough for a second try.
text: A SERIES OF DISSOLVES
text: Abigail sits before a laptop, creating another custom MP3
text: playlist. We watch as she hi-lights songs with her mouse,
text: moves them over to her portable device with a few CLICKS.
text: Abigail unhooks her MP3 device, slips her earbud headphones
text: into her ears. The SOUNDS of Fluke's track Atom Bomb fade up,
text: gradually shifting from tinny source music to SOUNDTRACK.
speaker_heading: MORE DISSOLVES
text: Blade and Abigail suit up, arming themselves. We SEE:
text: Blade loading rounds into his pistols.
text: Abigail selecting arrows, checking the range-dials.
text: Blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers.
text: Abigail working with Caulder, affixing the plague capsule to
text: one of her arrowheads.
text: Blade polishes his sword. Finished, he sights down the length
text: of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back
text: scabbard with a flourish.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
text: We hear the RUMBLE of two motorcycles. Blade emerges from the
text: alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket. Abigail
text: appears a moment later on her own customized bike.
text: Blade revs his engine. Then the two bikes take off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Drake sits before Zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his
text: right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his

dialog: stand nearby.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Do you know who I am?
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: You're the Nome King.
text: Drake smiles at this.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: The Nome King. I like that.
dialog: (leaning closer)
dialog: Tell me, child. Do you want to die?
text: Zoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: I'm not afraid -- I'll go to Heaven.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: There is no Heaven. No God. No angels.
dialog: No happy ending for good little girls.
dialog: The only thing you have to look forward to
dialog: is nothingness.
text: As Drake talks his pupils seem to widen -- until the darkness
text: nearly occludes the whites of his eyes. Zoe stares at him.
text: Can't tear her gaze away. His eyes are hypnotic.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: But what if you could change that? What
dialog: if you could remain a child forever?
text: He reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: What if you could keep this little doll-
dialog: like face of yours until the sun itself
text: cooled to a cold, hard rock?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wouldn't you like that? Wouldn't you
dialog: accept that gift?
text: Zoe reaches out, calmly touches Drake's cheek.
speaker_heading: ZOE
dialog: My friends are coming to kill you.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: WHACK! Grimwood PUNCHES King, whose body sags, weakened from
text: the beatings he has undergone. Asher and Danica look on.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: -- gonna be sorry you did that --
speaker_heading: ASHER
dialog: Nobody's coming for you, King.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Sure they are. Left a trail of digital
dialog: bread crumbs --
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: One thing you need to know about us
dialog: Nightstalkers. When you join our club,
dialog: you get this nifty little tracking node
dialog: surgically implanted in your body --
speaker_heading: GRIMWOOD
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Scout's honor. One of us gets lost, the
text: others just dial up the satellite and
dialog: presto, instant cavalry.
text: Grimwood looks to Asher and Danica, unsure.
speaker_heading: AS HER
dialog: He's bluffing.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: (smiling, playing along)
dialog: Okay, King, where did they put this
dialog: tracking node of yours?
text: He motions for her to draw closer, whispering.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: It's in my left ass-cheek --
text: WHACK! Danica slaps King's face, making him see stars.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Alright. alright, it's in my right ass-
dialog: cheek --
text: WHACK! Danica slaps King again, this time knocking his head
text: the other way. He spits out blood --
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: No, seriously --
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: -- it's in the meat of my butt, right
dialog: below my Bart Simpson tattoo --
text: Danica PUNCHES King's mid-section. He sucks air. Despite his
text: attempts at humor, he's hurting now. His body sags --
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: -- pull down my tighty-whities -- see for
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: ENOUGH! It's not funny anymore!
text: Behind Danica, Grimwood and Asher both COUGH.
text: King lifts his bruised face, staring up at Danica through
text: blood-shrouded eyes. For the first time, we get a sense of
text: his true hatred for her.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: No, it's not, you horse-humping bitch --
dialog: (wincing as he breathes)
dialog: -- but it will be a few seconds from now.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: (coughing)
dialog: And what happens then, lover?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Hammer time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: See, that tickle in your throat you're
dialog: feeling right now?
text: Danica COUGHS again, blinks repeatedly, as if her eyes were
text: irritated. She rubs them, looks to the others. They're
text: feeling the effects too. And Grimwood's face is smoking!
speaker_heading: KING
text: That's atomized colloidal silver.
text: Danica keys into the RUMBLE of the air-conditioning system and
text: a HISSING SOUND beneath that. She looks up --
speaker_heading: KING
text: It's being pumped into the building's air
dialog: conditioning system.
text: ANGLE ON THE HEATING REGISTER ABOVE
text: We GO MACRO, shrinking down until we see a CLOUD OF TINY
text: SILVER PARTICLES blowing into the room. The particles are
text: dusting the vampires, being unwittingly inhaled by them and --
text: WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL
text: as the vampires react en mass, suddenly gagging, their throats
text: and faces on fire.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Which means that the fat lady should be
dialog: singing right about --
speaker_heading: GRIMWOOD
text: has caught the worst of it. A whole lung-full. He SHRIEKS as
text: He coughs up blue-tinged FLAMES, the flesh on his face
dialog: simultaneously burning away and --
speaker_heading: KING
speaker_heading: -- NOW
scene_heading: THE SKYLIGHT ABOVE THEM
text: SHATTERS as Blade crashes down. He lands in a cat-like
text: stance, then flips over into a cartwheel, KICKING Grimwood in
text: the face. As Grimwood goes down, Asher and Danica scatter --
text: Blade tackles Grimwood, sending both of them over the railing
text: into the lower level of the penthouse.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: ALARMS are ringing. Asher and Danica rush down the hall,
dialog: trying not to breathe the silver-contaminated air. We SEE
text: other vampires staggering from doorways, COUGHING, GAGGING.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Drake hears the ALARMS. He reaches for his sword, which rests
text: in a nearby stand. As he heads out, he strides past Zoe,
text: still chained to the wall.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: On the lower level, Blade and Grimwood are going at it.
speaker_heading: REINFORCENENTS
text: flood in from multiple entry ways. It's an all-out melee.
text: Blade is seriously overwhelmed, but the sheer number of
text: vampires and humans is actually slowing them down.
text: Blade takes on a half-dozen of them at once, stunning one of
text: the familiars, using him as a human shield, TOSSING him aside
text: to trip up another on-rushing pair.
text: Then he pauses, instantly calculating the geography of the
text: room, the relative positions of the other combatants,
text: assessing decorations and furniture as possible weapons. His
text: battle plan ready, Blade engages his enemies once again.
scene_heading: MEANWHILE, ON THE UPPER LEVEL
text: Abigail appears at the lip of the smashed-in skylight. She
text: lowers herself down on a rope, rushes to King's side --
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Nothing a hot tub full of Bactine won't
dialog: fix.
text: Abigail hits the release switch on the high-tech pillory and
text: the cuffs around his wrists open. As Abigail helps King out:
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Zoe --
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Drake's got her.
text: Abigail nods, handing King her pistol. Then she's out the
text: door. Seconds later, King follows --
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAYS - VARIOUS - NIGHT
text: Abigail pauses, slipping her earbuds in, turning on her MP3
text: player. The bumping-strains of Fluke's Absurd track kick in.
text: Abigail uncilps her UV arc, telescopes it outward and --
text: -- suddenly it's like we're in a first-person shooter video
text: game. She moves through the corridors with mathematical
text: precision, feeling the MUSIC in her bones, slicing through
text: every vampire she encounters with deadly efficiency.
scene_heading: VAMPIRES AND HUMAN FAMILIARS
text: are coming out from every doorway.
text: Abigail PUNCHES one in the solar plexus, DECAPITATES another,
text: finishes off the first. Then she's moving on, taking down a
text: third, fourth, and fifth vampire with her rapid-fire stake
text: dispenser. Throwing stakes with blinding speed.
text: After a half-dozen stakes, her dispenser is empty. Without
text: missing a beat, she presses a tab on the dispenser, ejects the
text: clip, then reaches to her belt where a back-up is secured and
text: slaps it in place. The mayhem continues.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
text: Blade unsheathes his sword. He parries two combatants with
text: clubs, then whirls around, DEFLECTING a GUNSHOT from a third
text: with the flat of his sword.
text: Grimwood is furious. His men are tripping all over
text: themselves. He grabs an antique battle axe that's secured to
text: the wall. He sees an opening, SWINGS at Blade's head --
text: -- Blade drops and the axe slices through one of Grimwood's
dialog: own men.
text: In an eye-blink, Blade is up again, advancing. He cuts down
text: another familiar, pushes forward, cuts oown a second --
text: Now Blade and Grimwood are face to face. Grimwood swings his
text: axe again. Blade hooks his sword beneath it, FLIPPING it from
text: Grimwood's hands.
text: Blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc, CUTTING straight
text: through Grimwood's mid-section. The upper half of Grimwood's
text: body topples away --
text: -- then he rights himself. A half-vampire. He's still alive,
text: running forward on his hands, trailing viscera. He SPRINGS UP
text: at Blade, all claws and gnashing teeth.
text: Blade catches Grimwood by the throat, whirls him around --
text: -- and manages to IMPALE what's left of Grimwood with his
text: sword-point. Grimwood ASHES in Blade's arms. The only thing
text: left are his steel teeth, which CLATTER to the floor at
text: Blade's feet.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
text: Abigail enters, SEES Zoe. TWO VAMPIRES GUARDS stand nearby.
text: In a flash, Abigail flings TWO SILVER STAKES at them. Both
text: stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to ASH.
text: Abigail hurries over, SHOOTS apart the lock on Zoe's shackle.
text: Zoe wraps her arms around Abigail, hugging her tight. Abigail
text: takes Zoe by the hand, pulling her towards the door.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Come on, hon. Let's get you out of here.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: King stumbles out into the hallway, pulling his shirt back on.
text: As he limps down the corridor, a GROWL makes him pause --
speaker_heading: KING'S POV
text: Beau, the vampire rottweiler, lopes around the corner. Then --
scene_heading: TWO MORE ROTTWEILERS
text: emerge behind Beau. They're all GROWLING now.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Fuck. Me. Sideways.
text: The three of them break, BARKING like crazy, snouts splitting

speaker_heading: CUT T0:
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT
text: Blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
text: stands before him, waiting, sword in hand. He extends it,
text: touching the tip to the floor. A challenge.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Are you ready to die, Blade?
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Been ready since the day I was born,
dialog: mother-fucker.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: (with a smile)
dialog: Then allow me to accommodate you.
text: Drake does a back-flip over the balcony. Forty feet down.
text: Blade follows, drawing his sword as he LEAPS --
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: -- and lands. Now the two warriors face each other, swords
text: raised, eyes locked, their stances frozen. Like classic
text: samurai. Whoever moves first, loses.
text: Beat. MOVING IN on both men, CIRCLING around them. Slow the
dialog: heart. Slow the breath. Find the opening.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
text: breaks first, bringing his sword over in less time than it
text: takes to blink an eye. No one could possibly deflect the
dialog: blow. And yet --
speaker_heading: BLADE
text: manages a COUNTER-STROKE with super-human grace. He advances,
text: parries, his sword CLANGING and SINGING like a blacksmith's
text: hammer on sheet metal.
text: Cut, thrust, block, diagonal downward slashes. The moves come
text: faster. Drake DUCKS, barely avoiding being decapitated.
text: Blade's sword cuts right through a column instead.
text: Drake retaliates. Blade locks swords with him. For a moment,
text: the two warriors are nose to nose. Then Blade twists his
text: sword free, cutting open Drake's cheek --
text: Drake GROWLS, back-flipping up onto a ledge. He touches his
text: fingertips to the cut, tastes his own blood. Then we hear the
text: telltale sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING. For a brief moment, his
text: facial features shift, giving us yet another glimpse of his
text: true form. As his anger increases, Drake begins to devolve.
text: He DIVES at Blade, HOWLING, raking his CLAWS at Blade's face.
text: He strikes out, KNOCKING Blade across the atrium. He SPRINGS
text: forward, dragging Blade up by his throat, sinking his fangs
text: into Blade's shoulder. Blide SCREAMS and we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: -- as King runs. He hazards a look back. The vampire dogs
text: are quickly gaining on him.
speaker_heading: UP AHEAD
text: It's a dead-end. Just plate glass windows and a whole lot of
dialog: nothing beyond.
text: The dogs are almost on King when suddenly, King JUMPS,
text: snagging an overhead pipe. As he swings his body upward --
speaker_heading: THE DOGS
text: skid on the floor, unable to stop their momentum, and CRASH
text: straight through the plate glass window.
scene_heading: EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
text: An EXPLOSION OF GLASS as two of the vampire rottweilers tumble
text: into the night. They fall like stones -- twenty stories down

scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: King drops back to the floor, cackling, pleased with himself.
text: It takes him a second to realize that --
speaker_heading: ONE OF THE ROTTWEILERS (BEAU)
text: -- didn't take a swan dive out the window. He's right behind
text: King. And now he's SPRINGING FORWARD --
text: WHAM! King is hit in the chest by the SNARLING beast. He
text: drops the pistol as he's knocked back onto the floor. The dog
speaker_heading: LUNGES again --
text: With one arm, King struggles to keep his face from being bit
text: off, while searching blindly for the discarded pistol. King
text: locates it, FIRING into the beast's chest --
speaker_heading: THE ROTTWEILER
text: ASHES, disintegrating all over King's face. King gets a
text: mouthful of the charcoal remains, tries to SPIT them out.
speaker_heading: KING

dialog: Bad dog.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT
text: Abigail emerges onto the gallery with Zoe. She spots an
text: alcove, indicates that Zoe should hide. Then she slips a

text: Abigail rushes to the handrail, looking down at Blade and
text: Drake. Her view is obscured. She can't get a good shot.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Drake digs his fangs into Blade's shoulder. Blade struggles,
text: manages to slip a stake from his bandolier --
text: WHAM! Blade SLAMS the stake into Drake's ear canal. The
text: beast SHRIEKS in pain, dropping Blade. But all the gambit has
text: done is drive Drake into a berserker rage.
text: Drake swings his fist. Blade ducks. Drake's fist goes
text: through the wall, PUNCTURING a steam pipe. Steam vents --
text: Drake reaches in, RIPS an eight-foot section of the pipe from
text: the wall, bringing a SPARKING nest of electrical cables along
text: with it. He swings the pipe section around, WHACKING Blade.
text: KRUNCH! Drake swings the makeshift club again. He's a one
text: man demolition crew, decimating everything in his path. He's
text: SMASHING holes in the floor, the walls, plowing through
text: partitions of glass and steel.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT
text: Abigail moves down the gallery, looks up --
text: A SERIES OF LIGHTING GANTRIES
text: span the length of the atrium ceiling.
text: Abigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space --
text: -- catching hold of one of the crosspieces. Like an acrobat,
text: she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry. If she loses
text: her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet.
text: BA-BANG! A bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering
text: her with SPARKS. MORE BULLETS follow.
text: ANGLE ON PAIR OF VAMPIRES
text: FIRING from below, trying to pick her off. Suddenly, UV

scene_heading: WHIP-PAN BACK TO KING,

text: He's playing guardian angel to Abigail, laying down cover fire
dialog: so she can continue. But then --
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: KING!!!
speaker_heading: DANICA
text: appears behind King. She TACKLES him, wrestling him to the
text: floor, pummeling his face with her fist.
text: King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched.
text: He swings his electronic pistol up --
text: Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the
text: stock. King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor.
text: She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again --
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
text: Back to Abigail. She's breathing heavily, trying to call up
text: new reserves of strength. She glances down --
dialog: Big mistake.
text: She forces herself to look back up. She swings herself
text: pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece. A
scene_heading: SHOT RINGS OUT --
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ASHER,
text: down below, armed with a rifle. He FIRES again --
text: -- grazing Abigail's shoulder with the bullet. Abigail CRIES
text: OUT, nearly losing her grip.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT
text: King rolls on his side, spits out a bloody tooth.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: No offense, Danica --
dialog: (gasping in pain)
dialog: -- but I've wanted to kill you since the
dialog: moment we slept together.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: I was that bad, huh?
text: King reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol, points
text: it vaguely in Danica's direction. She LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: DANICA
dialog: No bullets in your gun, King.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Yeah, but here's the beauty --
dialog: (wiping his bloody mouth)
dialog: -- these babies can be triggered remotely.
text: King pulls the trigger. The scattered sun dog bullets ERUPT
text: with UV LIGHT. Danica SHRIEKS, trying to shield her already
text: burning face from the glare. She runs, horribly wounded.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Drake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll.
text: He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty
dialog: feet --
text: SMASH! Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging
text: glass chandelier/lighting fixture.
text: Blade FALLS back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword.
text: Drake pounces on him. Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows
text: anymore. In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's
dialog: eyes.
text: Drake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style, SHATTERING an
text: entire section of the limestone flooring.
text: A SHOCK-WAVE ripples out from the point of impact, sending
text: waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air,
text: knocking Blade off his feet.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - UPPER GALLERY - NIGHT
text: King loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the
dialog: railing, and FIRES at Asher --
speaker_heading: THE SUN DOG
text: screams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's
text: open mouth. The bullet EXPLODES. UV LIGHT causes Asher's
text: skull to burn up from the inside out. His headless corpse
text: falls forward over the gallery railing. Then it too
text: carbonizes and BURNS UP.
text: Relieved, King sinks to his knees.
scene_heading: BEHIND KING,
text: we SEE Zoe slip from the alcove. She makes for the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
text: King has bought Abigail more time. She swings her body
text: forward, hooking her legs over the next crosspiece. Then she
text: lets go with her hands. Now she is hanging upside down,
text: secured only by the tension in her calves.
text: Abigail reaches behind her, removes her bow. BLOOD from her
text: wounded shoulder drips down over her collar bone, reaching her
text: cheek, briefly obscuring her vision. She wipes it away. Then
text: she reaches back once more and --
text: -- because her quiver is pointed downward, a number of arrows
text: slide out. Abigail panics, twisting her body --
text: -- managing to lust barely snag the ~la~ue arrow as it tumbles
dialog: Past her!
text: Beat. Abigail shuts her eyes, trying to find her center.
text: With her eyes closed, she nocks the arrow and draws the bow
text: back. Then she opens her eyes.
dialog: She's only going to get one shot -- and she's going to have to
text: take it while hanging upside down.

scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: Drake shoulders a support column, SNAPPING it in two. An
text: entire section of the gallery walkway above comes CRASHING
text: DOWN, burying Blade in debris --
text: -- but it's not enough for Drake. He LEAPS forward, fishing
text: Blade out, hauling him up --
text: Drake head-butts Blade -- once, twice. Blade's eyes roll to
text: whites. Drake looks down, SEES Blade's discarded sword.
text: Drake scoops it up, STRIKES at Blade --
text: Blade manages to roll to the side, avoiding the blow.
text: Drake STRIKES again, dealing Blade a glancing blow --
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
text: ON ABIGAIL. Waiting. More blood has trickled down her neck,
text: into her eyes. But she can't wipe them anymore. She's
text: already got her bow drawn. She's committed to the shot.
text: We can hear ABIGAIL'S HEARTBEAT as she settles. She takes a
text: final breath, holds it -- and lets the plague arrow fly.
text: ON THE PLAGUE ARROW
text: as it streaks downward, hurtling towards Drake at more than
text: 300 feet per second. Then, at the last possible instant	--
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
text: CHINGG! Drake deflects the arrow with his sword. It

speaker_heading: ON ABIGAIL,

dialog: BACK TO DRAKE
text: swinging Blade's sword around. PLUNGING it into Blade's side.
text: As he pulls it back out again --
speaker_heading: BLADE
text: GASPS, sinking downward. He's on his knees now, in shock.
text: Drake ROARS again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of
text: violence and predation. And the nightmare shape that was only
text: hinted at before, finally takes center-stage.
text: BLOOD suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson. His
text: canines elongate, his lower jaw distends.
text: Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing
text: a suit of razor-sharp thorns. He doesn't need a sword
text: anymore. He's become a living weapon. Drake is gone. Now he

text: Drake swings the sword overhead. He's going to decapitate
text: Blade. And just as the sword reaches the top of its arc --
speaker_heading: ZOE
text: emerges from the shadows behind Drake, clutching a silver
text: stake. She SHOVES it into Drake's back, pushing with all the
text: strength her little body can muster.
text: Drake staggers. The blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the
text: same. He turns on Zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for
dialog: one crucial second --
speaker_heading: ON BLADE,
text: summoning the last of his reserves. He pitches his body
text: forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow. And
text: before Drake even realizes what is happening --
text: WHAM! Blade sinks the plague arrow deep into Drake's chest.
text: Drake drops the sword, turning back to face Blade --
text: Exhausted beyond measure, Blade sags.
scene_heading: INSIDE DRAKE'S CHEST - MACRO SHOT
text: as the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon. We SEE the virus
text: flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as
text: his circulatory system carries it throughout his body.
scene_heading: ON DRAKE'S FACE,
text: letting loose an INHUMAN SCREAM, vomiting up a spray of blood
text: mist. His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into
dialog: his more familiar face. At the same time we --
scene_heading: GO MACR0 ONCE MORE
text: Shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake
text: expelled. We continue shrinking until we are moving with the
text: individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions
text: latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic.
text: Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by --
speaker_heading: DANICA,
text: having retreated from her defeat by King. She clutches her
text: throat. We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny
text: BLACK THREADS expand across her face. She sways, falling onto
text: the floor. She reaches a beseeching hand towards King --
text: -- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips.
speaker_heading: MORE VAMPIRES
text: are feeling the effects now too. One by one they drop,
text: choking, going into convulsions. As they writhe on the floor,
text: we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies.
text: BACK TO BLADE AND DRAKE
text: Drake slumps against the wall. Hero and villain are now
text: separated by only a few feet. Both at death's door.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: Well done, hunter. Well done.
text: Blade stares back. At this point, he's just trying to remain
text: conscious. He's lost a ton of blood.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: You fought with honor --
text: Drake shudders, his breathing becoming increasingly shallow.
speaker_heading: DRAKE
dialog: -- as I knew you would. The humans are
dialog: coming for you, you know. In their eyes,
dialog: you and I are the same.
dialog: Allow me one last indulgence, then --
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: -- a parting gift --
text: Drake grows still, his eyes locked on Blade's.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL AND KING
text: rush to Blade's side. Zoe joins them. Blade is dying, fading
text: fast. Abigail shakes Blade --
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: Blade!
text: Her voice sounds distant and muted, overridden by Blade's own
text: HEARTBEAT which is fading up, dominating the soundtrack.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL
dialog: BLADE!!!
text: Blade's eyes can't focus anymore. They're clouding over.
speaker_heading: BLADE'S POV
text: We drop away from Abigail and King -- like
dialog: we're falling down
text: a dark tunnel.	 Then the world FADES TO WHITE.
scene_heading: EXT. CITYSCAPE	- DAWN
text: FADE IN FROM WHITE. We see the sky, the burning orb of the
text: rising sun. A trio of FBI helicopters ride out from the dawn,
text: swooping down over the stirring city.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: It didn't take long for the authorities
dialog: to arrive.
scene_heading: INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - DAWN
text: Cumberland sits in the front passenger seat, Hale behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PLAZA - DAWN
text: As the helicopters touch down in the plaza we see a small
text: convoy of POLICE and FBI VEHICLES converging around them.
text: Cumberland and Hale are among the first out. They rush
text: towards the Phoenix Towers entrance, guns drawn, DOZENS OF
text: AGENTS and OFFICERS behind them.
scene_heading: INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - DAWN
text: The first rays of sun penetrate through the atrium windows
text: setting the scattered vampire corpses ablaze. Danica, Asher,
text: and the others all ignite.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: When they got there, all of Drake's
dialog: people were dead.
text: By the time Cumberland and his men have entered, fanning out
text: through the atrium, all they find are a series of corpse
text: shaped piles of ash and singe marks.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: In the weeks that followed, the rest of
dialog: the world's vampires also perished.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We'd finally won.
scene_heading: ON CUMBERLAND,
text: surveying the scene, frustrated by what he's found. Then we
text: hear SHOUTS coming from the back of the atrium.
text: AT THE BACK OF THE ATRIUM
text: they find Blade. He's dead, slumped against a wall. There's
text: no sign of Drake. The vampire king is gone.
scene_heading: INT. FBI MORGUE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON Blade's face, his body being wheeled on an autopsy
text: gurney. PULL BACK to reveal that we are in an FBI morgue.
text: Cumberland and Hale stand nearby, overseeing everything as --
scene_heading: A TRIO OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS
text: lift Blade's body onto an autopsy table. They turn on a bank
text: of overhead UV lights. The lead examiner reaches for a
text: scalpel. But as he touches the scalpel to Blade's chest --
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: And Blade? Cumberland and Hale finally
dialog: got their body --
speaker_heading: BLADE'S FACE
text: changes. We hear a series of POPS and CRACKS as subdermal
text: cartilage begins to loosen and shift. At the same time, the
text: skin begins to lighten as melanin is gradually leached away.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: -- but it wasn't the one they were banking
dialog: on.
text: ON CUMBERLAND AND THE OTHERS
text: as they react with varying degrees of shock.
text: BACK TO THE BODY
text: We realize that it's not Blade lying before them. It's Drake.
text: Somehow, even in death, the vampire king managed to take
text: Blade's shape and temporarily retain it.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.O.)
dialog: The virus didn't kill Blade. But the
dialog: authorities very well could have. So in
dialog: the end, realizing that own his people
dialog: were doomed, Drake decided to give Blade a
dialog: gift.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (CONT ÃâD)
dialog: By taking Blade's shape, he bought Blade
text: enough time to escape. Offering Blade a
dialog: second chance at life - -
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SEASIDE CLIFF - DAY
text: A bright summer day. Blade stands at the edge of a cliff,
text: looking out over a sun-struck ocean. For the first time since
text: we've seen him, he's not wearing armor or sunglasses or
text: handguns or rifles. And were it not for the sword he holds,
dialog: we might even mistake him for an ordinary man.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: And so Blade took it.
text: Blade flings his sword over the cliff, into the ocean below.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: We never saw him again.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: We see the sword sinking, reflecting the refracted sunlight
text: from above as it twirls end over end.
text: BACK TO BLADE
text: At peace with himself at last. After a moment's reflection,
text: he turns and walks away.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: He disappeared completely.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But that's what heroes do. They simply
dialog: fade out. And in this way --
text: A SERIES OF DISSOLVES
text: as Blade moves further and further away from us, dwindling
text: into the horizon until he disappears entirely.
speaker_heading: ABIGAIL (V.0.)
dialog: -- they become legends.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: Over darkness we hear the sound of TRAFFIC.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
text: FADE IN. We are moving towards a local punk dive wedged into
text: a crowded block in the meat packing district.
text: A DOORMAN (LUCIUS) stands outside, checking CUSTOMERS' IDs.We
text: hear HILLBILLY THRASH MUSIC coming from within.
text: ANGLE ON KING AND ABIGAIL
text: approaching. King holds his four-barreled rifle. Abigail
text: peels away, disappearing into an alley as King nears the front
text: door. The doorman recognizes King, knows he's trouble.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Evening Lucius.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: King, what the hell are you doing here?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: Just a little sport hunting.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB CROWBAR - NIGHT
text: A BAND belts out a cover of Sam and the Shams' Little Red
text: Riding Hood. The band members look a little lupine. As King
text: weaves his way through the crowd, Lucius hurries alongside.
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Ain't no vampires left, King. So who do
dialog: you have to hunt?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: That's an interesting question, my friend.
dialog: And I've got a question for you in return.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB CROWBAR - BACK AREA - NIGHT
text: As King pushes his way through to the bathrooms, we hear an
text: UNEARTHLY ROAR coming from the men's room.
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: What do you get when you cross a vampire
dialog: with a werewolf?
text: The door to the men's room EXPLODES OPEN. Abigail comes
text: flying out. She hits the far wall of the hallway, slides to

speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (raising his four-barrel)
dialog: A fur coat that sticks to your neck.
scene_heading: A HILL-BILLY HIPSTER WERE-CREATURE,
