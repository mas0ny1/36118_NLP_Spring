scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HILLS - DAY
text: Open on a GEIGER COUNTER scanning over a rocky terrain.
text: A SAND STORM blows over the landscape. We are lost somewhere

dialog: According to the instrument, the area contains high levels of
dialog: radiation...
text: THREE MEN WEARING FULL ANTI-RADIATION SUITS have left their
text: jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks.
dialog: Not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high
text: winds, they walk towards the hills.
text: The man holding the counter stops in his tracks -
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: (loudly through the
speaker_heading: STORM)
scene_heading: ALRIGHT, GUESS.
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: I'D SAY 43.9?
speaker_heading: MAN 1

text: Suddenly, for no apparent reason, THE GEIGER COUNTER GETS
text: LOUDER AS THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET.
text: In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to
text: stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb...
text: He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still
dialog: nothing in sight.
text: He sighs. His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter
dialog: simply needs an adjustment...
text: He turns it off when A MAN COVERED WITH BLOOD, HALF NAKED,
text: comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face-
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: HELP ME... HELP ME, PLEASE HELP ME!
text: Scared to death, the scientist pushes him away and backs off.
text: The man covered by blood falls on the ground and starts
text: crying, begging for help. The scientist doesn't have time to
speaker_heading: REACT-
text: THE RUSTY POINT OF A PICKAXE COMES THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS
text: MASK AND OUT OF HIS FOREHEAD!
text: Terrified, the man covered with blood watches the scientist's
text: dead body-fall to the ground revealing, for a quick second, A
text: DARK SHAPE FLASHING IN THE SUN.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: In the distance, the other scientists continue their work,

speaker_heading: DISCOVERY-
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: What the hell is it?

text: THE PICKAXE SWINGS THROUGH HIS BACK.
text: IMPALED LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT, HIS BODY IS SWEPT INTO THE AIR
text: ONLY TO BE SLAMMED AGAINST THE ROCKS...
text: Blood splatters on the third man, who steps back suffocating
text: with fear behind his mask.
text: The shadowy figure continues the assault on Man 2, finishing
text: him off. Powerless to stop'the massacre, the last scientist
text: runs away in a panic.
text: At the top of the hill, he appears, out of breath. He doesn't

text: As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side
text: Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks.
text: Before him, on the ground, is Beauty.
text: Dead. Disemboweled.
text: Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning

dialog: one. Tracking.
text: Suddenly he stops.
text: The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES

text: deserted. No sign of life anywhere. All the houses and cars

text: Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are
dialog: from the 50's.
text: Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at
dialog: his side...
text: No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an
text: occasional cloud of dust. Doug walks up to a house and knocks
text: on the front door.
text: No one to open the door. Doug wipes one of the windows-

text: THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE BUT MANNEQUINS!
text: They have been dressed and placed into real life situations.

text: On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the
text: sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-
scene_heading: TEST SITE 3B - MILITARY ZONE - HIGH RADIATION RISK
text: The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street.

text: is missing, having apparently been torn off.
text: Beast GROWLS.
text: The man turns around, revealing his horrible face-
text: A METALLIC BRACE is screwed on four sides of his head helping
text: him stand straight. ENORMOUS CYSTS DISFIGURE HIM AND COVER
text: EVERY VISIBLE PART OF HIS BODY. Let's call him "CYST".
text: Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the
text: noise. He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun!
text: The alley is empty. The generators are still motoring.
text: All seems normal. Cyst turns back towards main street.
text: Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog
text: hidden inside.
text: Doug breathes a sigh of relief. Close call.
text: Quietly, Doug gets out of the car. He hesitates as to whether
