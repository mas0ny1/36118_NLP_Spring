scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD. DAY.
text: Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
text: unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
text: residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in
text: shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram
text: to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed
text: Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
text: point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
text: ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
text: attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.
text: Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
text: front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.
scene_heading: INT. MURPHY RESIDENCE. DAY.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (screams)
dialog: Oough! Ahhh!
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE AGENT
dialog: (to others)
text: Upstairs.
text: Troops pour into the house.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: What's going on? What's the matter?
dialog: Who are you?
text: The troops, and one or two trenchcoated agents, continue
text: entering the house and heading upstairs, still with rifles
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Hey!
text: Upstairs, crowded in the narrow hallway, the troops
text: descend on a bedroom.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (off camera)
dialog: Dade! Dade!
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Knock it down.
text: The battering ram knocks down a bedroom door.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM.
text: The prosecutor, a woman of about forty, gives her closing
text: argument blandly. She'd rather be somewhere else.
speaker_heading: PROSECUTOR
dialog: The defendant, Dade Murphy, who calls
dialog: himself "Zero Cool", has repeatedly
dialog: committed criminal acts of a malicious
dialog: nature. This defendant possesses a
text: superior intelligence, which he uses to a
text: destructive and antisocial end. His
dialog: computer virus crashed one thousand five
dialog: hundred and seven computer systems,
dialog: including Wall Street trading systems,
text: single handedly causing a seven point drop
text: in the New York Stock Market.
text: As she speaks, the camera pans across the court, panning
text: down and stopping on the defendant: eleven year old Dade
dialog: Murphy.
dialog: Fast forward to the sentencing.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Dade Murphy, I hereby fine your family
dialog: forty-five thousand dollars...
text: The court gasps, Dade's father winces
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: ...and sentence you to probation, under
dialog: which you are forbidden to own or operate
dialog: a computer or touch tone telephone, until
dialog: the day of your eighteenth birthday.
text: Now Dade winces, in fact we almost expect him to cry.
text: Opening credits roll to a backdrop of Dade and his family
text: and lawyer fighting through a gaggle of journalists and
text: photographers, in slow motion, and driving away.
text: SEVEN YEARS LATER.
text: Aboard a jetliner, Dade Murphy is staring blankly out the
text: window, wearing headphones. Exterior view from the
text: aircraft of approaching New York City. The view becomes a
text: direct overhead of the buildings and streets of the city,
text: which then metamorphoses (through animation) into chips
text: and digital signals on a stylised computer board. The
text: title logo.
scene_heading: INT. DADE'S ROOM.
text: Segue to Dade Murphy, now 18, wearing mirrorshades indoors
text: and at night, working on his new computer. His mother
dialog: calls him.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: (off camera)
dialog: Dade?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah, mom?
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: (after a semi-pregnant pause)
dialog: I'm taking over a TV network.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy
dialog: birthday.
scene_heading: INT. OTV STUDIOS.
text: In the OTV Studios security department, a phone rings, a
text: man answers nervously.
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from
dialog: Accounting. I just had a power surge here at
text: home that wiped out a file I was working on.
dialog: Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know
dialog: anything about computers?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just
dialog: went AWOL, and I've got this big project due
dialog: tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get
dialog: it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari
dialog: Kari...
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Uhhh.. ahahaha...
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management
dialog: techniques.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Could you, uh, read me the number on the
dialog: modem?
speaker_heading: NORM
dialog: Uhhhmm...
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches
text: on it... lets my computer talk to the one
dialog: there...
speaker_heading: NORM
scene_heading: 212-555-4240.
text: Dade goes to work on OTV. He closes his eyes and a flurry
text: of half-second video clips from old TV shows flashes by.
text: He opens his eyes. His screen says ENTERING ARPS 331 and
text: then wipes to another screen. Automated Record Playback
text: System. There is a graphic representation of the
text: station's automatic videotape changer. Dade turns on his
text: TV set and turns to OTV. It is running a Rush-Limbaugh
dialog: type TV show.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: ...so-called American Indians, Latinos and
dialog: Blacks come from a genetically mediocre
dialog: stock...
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yak yak yak. Get a job!
text: Dade presses a key on his keyboard. The Video Changer
text: diagram lights up in red. At the station, a robotic arm
text: selects a videotape from a huge rack of thousands of
text: tapes. The "America First" tape slides out of the VTR and
text: is replaced by an episode of "The Outer Limits" as Dade
text: watches, drinks Coke and smiles, full of himself.
speaker_heading: TV
dialog: You are about to experience the awe and
text: mystery, which reaches from the inner mind,
dialog: to... The Outer Limits.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yesssss!
text: Suddenly, the ARPS screen is replaced by an ominous
dialog: message:
speaker_heading: U HAVE TREAD
scene_heading: UPON MY DOMAIN &amp;
scene_heading: MUST NOW SUFFER
dialog: WHO R U?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Hey! What?
text: He starts to type ZERO...
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: No, wait.
dialog: Dade types:
scene_heading: CRASH OVERRIDE.
text: WHO WANTS TO KNOW?
text: Dade's screen dissolves into:
speaker_heading: ACID BURN
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Unbelievable. A hacker!
text: Then the screen changes again:
speaker_heading: ACID BURN
scene_heading: SEZ LEAVE B 4
speaker_heading: U R EXPUNGED
text: "The Outer Limits" suddenly flashes off.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah, okay "Acid Burn", that's enough.
text: Dade starts hacking. Apparently so does Acid Burn. The
text: tape changer machines at OTV are swamped, sometimes
text: fighting over the same tape. The program on TV keeps
dialog: changing.
text: The message comes up on Dade's computer screen:
speaker_heading: I WILL
speaker_heading: SWAT U LIKE
speaker_heading: THE FLY U R
text: More dueling tape changers, more half second video clips.
text: Another message.
speaker_heading: I WILL
dialog: SNAP YOUR BACK
scene_heading: LIKE A TOOTHPICK
text: As the duel continues, Dade types back a taunt of his own:
text: MESS WITH THE BEST
dialog: DIE LIKE THE REST
dialog: One last from Acid Burn:
dialog: YOU ARE
speaker_heading: TERMINATED
text: Then his own computer confirms for him that the connection
text: is terminated.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Shit on me!
text: Next morning. Mrs. Murphy is unpacking. Dade emerges
text: from his room in a housecoat. He makes a beeline (dodging
text: moving boxes) for the fridge.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Mm-hmm.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Up all night again, huh?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Can this wait until both my eyes are open,
dialog: please?
text: Dade's mom picks up the phone, mocking a call to the
dialog: building superintendent.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll
dialog: sleep normal hours? He's been playing with
text: his computer all night for a solid week.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well yes, he could be playing with himself.
dialog: Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as
dialog: charming as you yet.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: You haven't been doing anything stupid, right,
dialog: Dade?
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Right, Dade?!
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
text: Dade slams the bathroom door. Mrs. Murphy quickly checks
text: his room. Dade is showering.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
text: (angry, through the bathroom door)
dialog: You hooked it up to the phone, didn't you?
dialog: Dade! Turn the shower off! You screw up
dialog: again and you won't get into college!
text: She pauses and regains some of her cool.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: I'm sorry we had to move in your senior year.
dialog: I didn't want to sell the house but I had to
dialog: take this new job, you know that. You're
dialog: going to love New York, it's the city that
dialog: never sleeps!
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY.
text: We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
text: shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
text: and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
text: on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL.
text: At school, hundreds of teenagers converse, move around,
text: head to class. Dade looks lost among them. He walks up
text: to a skinny latino kid in a faux leopard-skin muscle
text: shirt. The kid is on a pay-phone, speaking in Spanish.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the
dialog: principal's office.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
text: Now Dade really looks lost. He heads off in search of the
dialog: office.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE.
text: Dade is filling out a form.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Do you have your transfer forms?
text: Dade stares at her, stunned. The girl has a decidedly
text: unconventional appearance, yet is a first-rate beauty.
speaker_heading: GIRL
text: It's a relatively straightforward question.
text: Dade notices her lips, and in his imagination launches
text: into a flurry of half-second video clips and art bites,
text: all involving lips and kissing.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Do you speak English?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Sorry, you wanted...?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I wanted transfer forms.
text: He gives them to her.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Thank you.
text: She starts leaving. He doesn't.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Are you coming?
text: Dade clues in, gets up and follows her. She takes him on
text: a brief tour.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR.
speaker_heading: GIRL
text: The gym is through there, and the cafeteria is
dialog: through there.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Great. Cool.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Kate. Kate Libby.
text: They arrive at a classroom.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Here's your class.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, you're not in my class.
text: Kate starts away.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Give me time!
text: A guy in the halls notices Dade.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Hey, you new?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Tell him about the pool, Kate.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Pool?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up
dialog: on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah! Sure.
text: Kate starts away again.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Thanks!
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP.
text: Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
text: roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
text: the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
text: One of them notices Dade.
speaker_heading: GEEK
dialog: Hey! Hold the door!
text: He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.
dialog: Dade
dialog: (realizing he's been had)
dialog: No pool.
text: Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
text: his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
text: raining.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR.
text: Dade is soaking wet, and trudges among his classmates
text: leaving a muddy trail. A three-second video clip rolls
text: through his mind: it is a screaming woman being strangled
text: in an old movie. He walks past Kate, who giggles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh my God! He found the pool.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL COMPUTER LAB.
text: The kids are all seated at computer workstations. Dade
text: is hacking, the latino kid who was on the phone to
text: Venezuela is running a demo involving dirty-dancing
text: skeletons.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: I'm Mr. Simpson. And I'm subbing for Ms.
text: Bayliss who was arrested at the anti-fur
dialog: rally. I know some of you kids got computers
dialog: at home. But these are school property,
dialog: people, and I don't want to see any gum stuck
dialog: to 'em. Chapter 1. Designing graphical
dialog: interface...
text: Meanwhile, the latino kid notices that Dade has been
text: looking up Kate Libby's school records. And hacking
text: himself into her advanced English class.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL QUAD.
text: It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The
text: latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,
dialog: eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Homicidal?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
text: The name rings no bells with Dade.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I
dialog: know you play the game.
text: Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up
text: to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.
speaker_heading: JOEY
text: Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak,

speaker_heading: PHREAK

speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap
dialog: the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to
dialog: save you from yourself but you gotta stop
dialog: letting your mama dress you, man!
dialog: (To Dade):
dialog: Check it...
text: Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I need a handle, man. I don't have an
dialog: identity until I have a handle.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: You know, you're right about that.
dialog: (to Dade)
dialog: Check it, Friday.
text: Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
text: Phreak walks away.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Ultra Laser.
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Doctor Doom!
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET VILLAGE. NIGHT.
text: Dade rolls in on rollerblades. Street vendors hawk
text: computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music
text: vendor catches Dade's attention.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Check this out, each and every one of you.
dialog: Compilation tape, of my own making. I call
dialog: this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring
dialog: artists like, well I got some Hendrix on
text: there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all
dialog: great artists that asphyxiated on their own
dialog: vomit!
text: The small crowd around him finally gets the joke.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!
text: Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be
text: equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the
text: benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy
text: techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with
text: psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a
text: video game with a huge screen. Phreak is at a pay phone.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Please deposit five dollars for the first
dialog: minute.
text: Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a
text: button, and the box emits a series of tones.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Nonono, thank YOU!
text: Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video
text: game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.
text: She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the
dialog: top-10 list.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: That's a nice score for a girl.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (irritated by Dade's presence)
dialog: Think you can do better?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I'll give it a shot.
text: Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.
text: Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet
dialog: above.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Is this kid bothering you, Kate?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Sorry, can I get some room here?
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Why don't you come up here?
text: Kate obliges and joins Curtis. Dade continues playing.
text: He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed
text: chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his
text: high score is about to come up.
speaker_heading: CURTIS
dialog: He's good!
text: Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak
text: is amazed.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: Well, it looks like I'm on top.
text: Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Congratulations. No one's ever beat her
dialog: before. You just made an enemy for life.
dialog: (to someone else)
dialog: Boy meets world. Let's go?
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE CYBERDELIA. NIGHT.
text: Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
text: world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
text: little disgusted.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Curtis.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: And what's he do?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
dialog: slick all day.
text: Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
text: Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
text: speeds off into the night.
scene_heading: INT. DADE'S ROOM.
text: The clock says it's 4:16. As the camera pans up to Dade,
text: it changes to 4:17. Dade is hacking again. It's the
text: school's administration system. Dade schedules a test of
text: the school sprinkler system for 9:30am.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDIR.
text: Dade stands alone in the hall, watching the time closely.
text: Phreak rounds a corner and meets Dade.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: What's up?
text: Dade doesn't answer. He watches the time a couple of more
text: seconds, then opens an umbrella. Immediately the fire
text: sprinklers turn on. Phreak starts getting drenched. He
text: realizes what is happening.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: (amused and highly impressed)
dialog: Oh my God. You...
text: A bell rings and students pour out into the halls by the
text: hundreds. They're all being showered on. A tall
text: cheerleader bounces by Phreak, pushing her pom-pom in his
text: face.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Way cool!
dialog: (to Dade)
dialog: You saw that?
text: Dade nods in the affirmative.
text: Kate walks up to Dade, also understanding what has
dialog: happened.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What the hell is going on?
speaker_heading: DADE
text: Pool on the roof must have a leak.
text: Kate gives Dade a look that could kill and skulks away.
text: Dade walks away under his umbrella, smug and dry.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Man, oh man, this is gonna be good.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM.
text: Dade, Kate, and a couple of other students are writing on
text: the chalkboard. Kate finishes first.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: If God gave men brains bigger than dogs',
dialog: they wouldn't hump womens' legs at cocktail
dialog: parties.
text: The class giggles.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ruth Libby.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: I'm not so sure your mother qualifies as a
dialog: significant author of the twentieth century.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Her last book sold two million copies.
speaker_heading: CLASS
dialog: (almost in unison)
dialog: Woooooo!
text: The teacher reads Dade's quotation.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: "Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient
text: heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in
dialog: the machinery of the night."
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: That's Ginsburg.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Nice. Very nice.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He's not in this class.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I said give me time.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: He's not enrolled in this class.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Well, he's on my list.
text: Kate leaps across a desk and snatches the list from the
text: teacher. Dade is on it. She gives Dade another filthy
text: look, both Dade and the teacher just shrug. The teacher
text: moves on to Cereal.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: "Of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind
dialog: the most?"
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Ozzy Osbourne!
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: You. What is your name?
text: The teacher grabs the list back from Kate.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Uh, Emmanuel Goldstein, sir?
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: You, however, are not on my list.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: (in mock shock)
dialog: Whoa, this isn't wood shop class?
text: The class cracks up. Kate and Dade exchange looks as the
text: teacher escorts Cereal to the door.
scene_heading: INT. DADE'S PLACE.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: How was school?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: (eating)
dialog: Hmmm.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: What did we learn in school today?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Revenge.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: No. No one special.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be
dialog: home late. And would you try and please fill
dialog: these out?
text: She indicates a pile of college applications.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Oh don't worry, it's only the rest of your
dialog: life.
text: She starts to the door.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the
dialog: lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: And unpack.
text: She leaves. Dade looks over the college applications for
text: a second, and pushes them away. He'd rather not do this
dialog: now.
scene_heading: INT. CYBERDELIA.
text: Dade, Phreak and Joey are sitting at a table. Joey is
text: giving a dull account of his hacking adventures. Enter
dialog: Cereal.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: FYI, alright man, you can sit at home, and do
dialog: like absolutely nothing and...
text: Cereal pauses, notices Dade, whom he has never met
text: formally but seen around, and then continues.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: ...and your name goes through like seventeen
dialog: computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's
text: a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living
dialog: large. We have no names, man, no names. We
dialog: are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
text: Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But
dialog: he does know things.
text: Dade and Cereal acknowledge each other.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me.
dialog: I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking
dialog: around...
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: (to Cereal)
dialog: D'you bring those Crayola books?
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Oh yeah, technicolor rainbow.
text: Cereal brings a book out of his bag.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Green one.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: What is that, what is that? Lemmie see. What
dialog: are these?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: International Unix Environments.
text: Cereal pulls out another book.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Luscious orange?
text: Cereal hands the orange book to Phreak.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Computer security criteria, DOD standards.
text: Another book comes out.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: The Pink Shirt Book, Guide to IBM PCs. So
dialog: called due to the nasty pink shirt the guy
text: wears on the cover.
dialog: Another one.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Devil book. The Unix Bible.
dialog: Another one.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Dragon book. Compiler design.
text: Cereal brings out a large red book.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Oh yeah? What's that?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks.
dialog: Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that
dialog: won't fit on a shelf.
text: By now Phreak has made a pile of the books, and the Red
text: Book looks wholly out of place on the top of the pile.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Anyway, anyway, guys guys guys, come on. I'm
dialog: in this computer, right. So I'm looking
dialog: around, looking around, you know, throwing
text: commands at it, I don't know where it is or
dialog: what it does or anything. It's like, it's
dialog: like choice, it's just beautiful, okay. Like
dialog: four hours I'm just messing around in there.
text: Finally I figure out, that it's a bank.
dialog: Right, okay wait, okay, so it's a bank. So, this
dialog: morning, I look in the paper, some cash
text: machine in like Bumsville Idaho, spits out
text: seven hundred dollars into the middle of the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: CEREAL

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't
dialog: hack a bank across state lines from your

dialog: are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: You guys always think I should know

dialog: Am I right?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Alright, what are the three most commonly used
dialog: passwords?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Love, secret, and uh, sex. But not in that
dialog: order, necessarily, right?
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Yeah but don't forget God. System operators
dialog: love to use God. It's that whole male ego
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
dialog: righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
dialog: you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
dialog: supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
dialog: and look for oil and stuff?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The
dialog: big iron?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Maybe. But, if I were gonna hack some heavy
dialog: metal, I'd, uh, work my way back through some
text: low security, and try the back door.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Yeah but oh man,
text: (starts rubbing one of his
text: own nipples in mock sexual
dialog: excitement)
dialog: wouldn't you just love to get one of those

speaker_heading: PHREAK

speaker_heading: PLAGUE

speaker_heading: HAL

scene_heading: INT. JOEY'S ROOM.
speaker_heading: JOEY

dialog: Right, uh...

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yeah, Garbage, okay, give me Garbage.

scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.
text: The Plague glides in on a skateboard. Short and thin,

speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Never fear. I is here.
speaker_heading: HAL
dialog: I've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Let's echo 23, see what's up.

speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: "God" wouldn't be up this late.
text: He sees what Joey is downloading. A file called

speaker_heading: PLAGUE

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: JOEY'S MOM

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Yeah, uh, yeah, okay.

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: SS AGENT
speaker_heading: FREEZE!
speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: AGENT RAY

speaker_heading: GILL

speaker_heading: PLAGUE

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Virus?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Yesterday, the ballast program for a

text: the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: (as if to a child)
text: The little boat flipped over. A virus planted
dialog: in the Gibson computer system claimed
dialog: responsibility.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What, it left a note?
text: Plague hits a button on a remote control, and the virus -
text: a long haired male model - appears on a large screen, in
text: psychedelic colors. The virus speaks in a hammy Italian
dialog: accent.
speaker_heading: VIRUS
dialog: Unless five million dollars are transferred to
dialog: the following numbered account in seven days,
dialog: I will capsize five tankers in the Ellingson
dialog: fleet.
speaker_heading: BOARD MEMBER
dialog: Is that...
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: That is the virus. Leonardo da Vinci. The
dialog: problem is we have twenty six ships at sea and
dialog: we don't know which ones are infected.
scene_heading: DUKE ELLINGSON
dialog: Well then, put the ships' ballasts under
dialog: manual control.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: There's no such thing anymore, Duke. These

dialog: satellite navigation, which links them to our

dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: So what are we supposed to do?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented
text: security officer. I traced the hacker's call.
dialog: The secret service picked him up this morning.
dialog: I'll just search his files for the original
dialog: virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
scene_heading: INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL ATRIUM.

speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: SUIT #1
dialog: Well, how soon?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Well, we're working on it as fast as we can.
dialog: This is a very common occurrence in

speaker_heading: SUIT #2
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: SUIT #1
dialog: Now, you're sure about that, Mr. The Plague?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Yeah, the Secret Service is helping us out 100
dialog: percent. Okay?
speaker_heading: SUIT #2
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SUIT #1
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: We'll be in touch. Talk to you later.
text: The suits get off the escalator, Plague and Margo take the
dialog: next one down.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What the hell was that all about?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
text: I had to move fast. The hacker copied my
dialog: garbage file.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in
dialog: the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the
dialog: hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we
dialog: can't do on our own.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: I don't want to go to jail for this.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: But you've created a virus that's going to
dialog: cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to
dialog: arrest some hacker kid?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Basically, uhmm, yeah. Mmm hmmm.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
speaker_heading: PLAGUE

speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: I'll take care of this.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Alright, sir.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: I can cancel it any time. I don't need any
dialog: program code. But it's the perfect cover, to
text: confiscate the disc and find out how much of
dialog: that garbage file has been copied.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Get it!
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: Why did I ever trust you?
dialog: (going back up the escalator)

speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
speaker_heading: GILL

speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: However, we have come to believe that one Joey

text: her many guests, not noticing Dade or Phreak. Cereal
text: offers Dade a drink from a plastic bottle. Dade, not
text: knowing what he's in for, drinks. Nikon is the Deejay.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Yo, what's up Nikon!
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Yo Phreak! Dade, man, you made it.
dialog: (to Cereal)
dialog: Houston, we have liftoff, 3 o'clock,

dialog: wrong with you! Look at her man...
text: Nikon and Cereal are checking out a truly fine babe.
speaker_heading: NIKON

scene_heading: apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: How did you know that?
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: I got photographic memory.
dialog: (Smiling)
dialog: It's a curse!
dialog: (Into the crowd)
dialog: Lisa!
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Hey, how do you know my name?
text: Cereal and Phreak move through the crowd. Cereal notices

speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Oooo, look at that pooper man. Spandex, it's

scene_heading: INT. MEETING HALL.
text: A 12-step recovery group. Addicts, including Joey

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Hi, my name is Hank, and uh, I'm an addict.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (smoking)
dialog: Uh, my name's Joey but, uh, I'm not an addict.
text: Joey takes a drag. The group reacts indignantly.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Nono, really, really, listen, listen to this.
dialog: I got in trouble with my computer, right,
dialog: okay, and my lawyer told the judge that I'm an
dialog: addict, but I'm not addicted to my computer!
dialog: No really, really,
text: Joey takes another drag.
speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah? Display?
speaker_heading: CEREAL

speaker_heading: NIKON

speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: I want it to have my children!
speaker_heading: CEREAL
text: Yeah, I bet it looks crispy in the dark.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Yo, hit the lights.
text: Dade hits the lights. The four ooo and ahh at

text: in the corner by her laptop.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Shh!
speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your

speaker_heading: NIKON

speaker_heading: CURTIS

dialog: Humm, yeah.
text: Curtis leaves.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: (mockingly)
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: The sensitive type.
text: Kate finally notices that Dade, whom she didn't invite, is at her

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What is he doing in here?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Burn. You're Acid Burn. You booted me out of
dialog: OTV!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I'm Crash Override.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're the moron that's been invading my turf?

dialog: I disguised myself as an Alabama State Trooper
text: and penetrated the FBI NCIC.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Pervert! What are you talking about?
text: She turns her back to him. He does up the zipper on her
text: dress. Their relationship becomes apparent.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
text: The FBI computer holds files on twenty million
dialog: Americans. I just hacked into it.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Congratulations.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: From here I got access to every piece of data
dialog: ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His
text: parents separated five years ago, reconciled
dialog: two years later, filed for divorce last year,

dialog: mother. Hmm.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: So, we get the mother, we get the boy.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S ROOM.
text: Kate's room is empty, and Dade can't resist going back in
text: to play with her laptop, which far outclasses his own,
text: some more. On the balcony, Kate notices and comes back
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: It's cool, I'm just looking.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It's too much machine for you.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah?
text: Dade starts working furiously on it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I hope you don't screw like you type.
text: Dade slows to a two-finger keypoke, not missing a beat.
speaker_heading: DADE
text: It has a killer refresh rate.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI
dialog: bus. But you knew that.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah. RISC is good.
text: They uncomfortably exchange glances.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: You sure this sweet machine's not going to

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Are you challenging me?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Name your stakes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: If I win, you become my slave.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Your slave?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: (realizing his mind is in the
dialog: gutter)
dialog: You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack

speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: And if I win?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (giggles)
dialog: Make it my first born.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Make it our first date.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You're not gonna win.
speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: PHREAK

dialog: So here's the deal. The chosen contest: To

dialog: get one back for Joey.
text: Dade spray paints camouflage onto his keyboard.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Our decisions are final, by a vote of 2 to 1.
dialog: No appeals.
text: Kate rifles through her address book.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: The duel will last until we declare a winner.
text: Dade plays quick-draw with disks.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Use only the dialups, access codes and
dialog: passwords in your collection. Can't ask for
dialog: any help from us.
text: Dade, having mastered the quick-disk-draw in the mirror,
text: looks satisfied.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: (into mirror)
dialog: Talking to me?
text: All five are together at the beginning of the challenge.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Any questions?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
text: Dade and Kate shake hands and the challenge begins.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.
text: At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks
text: up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.
text: "Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other
text: hackers look on.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT.
text: A waiter runs a credit card through a validation machine,
text: sees the message and returns to the patron's table. It is
text: Richard Gill. Right there, the waiter chops the
text: MasterCard in two with a pair of scissors, to Gill's
dialog: horror.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC PHONE.
text: Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and
text: changes an ad.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Alright, he's in the personal ads.
dialog: (reading Dade's ad)
text: "Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking
dialog: for discreet friend to bring dreams to
text: reality. Leather, lace, and water sports.
dialog: Transvestites welcome."
scene_heading: INT. GILL'S OFFICE.
text: At his office, Gill is on the speaker phone with someone
text: responding to the ad.
speaker_heading: GILL
text: I... I... I know where you can stick it... I
dialog: know where you can stick it...
text: Gill punches a button on the phone, another caller comes
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: ...wanna lick your earlobes... I wanna lick
dialog: your lips... I wanna lick your toes... I
dialog: wanna lick your ankles...
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Awww, yeah, you wanna lick something? Lick this.
text: Gill punches another button, another caller comes on.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: That's why they call me Stallion...
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Aw, that's disgusting!
text: Gill punches another button.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: My heart is steaming for you...
text: Gill punches another button. He is becoming quite flustered.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: ...spank you with my...
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Aww, Spank your ass...
text: He punches another button.
text: Another caller comes on, and Gill hangs up the phone,
text: disgusted, offended, and distraught. The Plague is there,
text: witnessing the whole thing.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Animal!
scene_heading: EXT. EMPIRE STATE BULDING OBSERVATION DECK.
text: It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of
dialog: Motor Vehicles. She adds 113 traffic violations and DUI
text: offender status to Gill's record.
text: EXT. NEW YORK CITY, BUSY STREET.
text: Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police
text: grunt. He is thrown onto the hood of his car and
text: handcuffed.
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
dialog: know who I am?
scene_heading: EXT. CHINATOWN, PUBLIC PHONE.
text: Dade's turn. He hacks into the Secret Service's personnel
text: file, and changes Gill's status to "Deceased."
scene_heading: INT. GILL'S OFFICE.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: This is accounting, sir. You enquired about
dialog: an employee of ours, an Agent Richard Gill?
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EMPLOYEE
dialog: Our records indicate he's deceased.
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: I'm what?
scene_heading: INT. CYBERDELIA.
text: The five are playing pool.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Dead.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Dead?
speaker_heading: DADE
text: Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Very impressive.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Super hero like even.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, whatever. What's the score?
text: Phreak clicks the pool scoreboard so it says 60 - 60.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Tie.
text: The other four protest.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
text: Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and
dialog: everything, I guess you two will have to
text: improvise the next round.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our
dialog: date.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And if I win, so do you.
text: Dade thinks about it a second.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Deal.
text: Kate gives Dade a look that says "I'm going to hold you to
dialog: that."
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S BED. NIGHT.
text: A shapely figure wearing a red leather legless suit with a
text: zipper that goes all the way around the crotch. Hands
text: caress the sultry figure as the camera pans up. The body
dialog: belongs to Dade Murphy.
text: Kate wakes up gasping. It was only a dream. She pants
text: and regains her breath. Then she smiles. She enjoyed
dialog: that dream.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oooohhhh...
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY.
text: Kate, at her locker, stops Dade.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Dade. I didn't know your size, so I guessed.
text: She opens her locker to reveal a red leather bustier and
text: bikini bottom.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You are man enough to stick with the deal,
dialog: aren't you?
text: Dade walks off.
scene_heading: INT. DADE'S PLACE.
text: Dade signs an electronic pad for a package from UPS. He
text: takes the package.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Thanks.
text: He closes the door and opens the package. It is a laptop
text: computer, clear plastic shell, full colour screen. Very
text: high-end, perhaps the equal to Kate's machine. He turns
text: it on. The Plague's face, distorted, appears. It speaks.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: You wanted to know who I am, Zero Cool? Well
dialog: let me explain the New World Order.
dialog: Governments and corporations need people like
dialog: you and me. We are samurai. The keyboard
dialog: cowboys. And all those other people out there
dialog: who have no idea what's going on are the
dialog: cattle. Mooo! I need your help, you need my
dialog: help. Let me help you earn your spurs. Ahh,
dialog: think about it. Enjoy the laptop, "Cool"!
dialog: Tell me where the disk is.
text: Plague's face vanishes.
scene_heading: INT. JOEY'S ROOM.
text: Joey lies on his bed with a comic book, looking
text: despondent. His mother enters.
speaker_heading: JOEY'S MOM
dialog: You look pitiful. Okay, okay, you're not
dialog: grounded anymore.
text: She kisses his forehead and leaves. He springs back to
text: life, gets up and gets the disc from where he stashed it
text: in the air vent.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK.
text: Joey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.
text: Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Yo, what's up?
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,
dialog: listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file
dialog: from...
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it,
dialog: Joey, come on.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
text: Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.
dialog: Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're
dialog: asking me about it, alright? Will you take a
dialog: look for me?
text: Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,
text: and Phreak notices.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.
text: Joey sees, and runs for it.
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Shit!
text: The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after
dialog: Phreak.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.
text: Phreak has lost his tail. He puts Joey's disc behind a
text: condom machine in the boys' room at school, and sticks it
text: there with gum.
scene_heading: INT. PHREAK'S ROOM.
text: Phreak frantically destroys all records of his hacking
text: career. He knows he's about to be busted.
scene_heading: DREAM SEQUENCE.
text: The Secret Service is about to burst in on Phreak. He
text: still hasn't destroyed any records, and starts manically
text: going through everything. Gill is on his laptop screen.
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: I'm watching you...
scene_heading: INT. PHREAK'S ROOM. MORNING.
text: A knock on the door. Phreak awakes. It's his mother.
speaker_heading: PHREAK'S MOM
dialog: Ramon? Wake up. Ramon! Wake up! Vamano.
dialog: Time for school, come on.
text: The secret service bursts in through the window just as
text: Phreak's mom opens the blind. She screams, Phreak leaps
text: to his feet.
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Secret Service, don't move!
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Deja vu!
speaker_heading: AGENT BOB
dialog: Ray Sanchez, you are under arrest, under the
dialog: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986.
text: Phreak's mom becomes very angry and starts slapping
text: Phreak, cursing in Spanish.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: What are you waiting for, arrest me already!
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION LOCKUP.
text: The undersized Phreak is just a morsel to the hardened
text: thugs behind these bars and they taunt him viciously as he
text: is led to his one phone call.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: You get one call. Uno. Understand?
text: The cop locks the dial on the phone.
text: Phreak waits for the cop to leave, and hangs up. He
text: starts rapidly pushing the hangup hook, and he hears a
text: ringing tone.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Hello, operator services.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: What number please?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
text: 555-4202.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
text: Just one moment.
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Thank you.
text: Kate answers.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Hey, it's me.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Phreak?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
text: I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He
dialog: really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the
dialog: disc with a file he copied and now I'm in
dialog: jail! They're charging me with some serious
dialog: shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do,
dialog: like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and
dialog: they keep asking about you guys.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You think they're going to bust us?
speaker_heading: PHREAK
dialog: Yeah! You better figure out what's on that
dialog: disc, cause we're being framed. It's in that
dialog: place where I put that thing that time?
text: He hangs up just as the cop returns.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL BOYS' ROOM.
text: Kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the
text: boys look on amusedly. She finds the disc behind the
text: condom machine and pockets it. Then she buys a condom from
text: the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.
scene_heading: INT. DADE'S PLACE.
text: Kate knocks. Mrs. Murphy lets Kate and Cereal in.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Hi!
dialog: (looking Kate over)
dialog: Well, now I see what all the fuss is about.
text: (she shows them to Dade's room)
dialog: Dade... you have company.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: It's a nice room.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We need your help.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Do my ears deceive me?
text: Kate starts to leave.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got
dialog: a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up
dialog: call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand
dialog: free access to data, well, it comes with some
dialog: responsibility. When I was a child, I spake
dialog: as a child, I understood as a child, I thought
dialog: as a child, but when I became a man I put away
text: childish things.
dialog: (pause)
text: What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse
dialog: 11, no duh. Come on.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need
dialog: your help to figure out what's on this disc.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I can't. Everybody who touches that thing
dialog: gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested,
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or
dialog: something.
text: Cereal leaves the room.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What is it with you? I know we've been
dialog: playing games, but, we're supposed to be on
dialog: the same side and we really need your help. I
dialog: really need your help.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I'm sorry, I can't.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, could you just make a copy of the disc?
dialog: And just hide it in case we get busted, so we
dialog: have something to give our lawyers, something
dialog: that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do
dialog: that?
text: A knock on the door. Dade's mom peeks in.
scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY
dialog: Listen you guys, help yourself to anything in
text: the fridge. Cereal has.
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (to Mrs. Murphy)
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Okay. I'll copy it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, thank you.
text: Later. Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's
text: records on his screen.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: The girl. The girl has the disc I need.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I told you, I don't play well with others.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a
dialog: file.
dialog: Dade does.
text: An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's
text: picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into
dialog: Dade's mother.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
text: Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the
dialog: state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement,
text: two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole.
text: When she's arrested, she will not have a
dialog: trial, she will not pass go, she will go
dialog: directly to jail. Then I change this file
dialog: back to the original, and your mom disappears.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: That's bullshit.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: What can I tell you. Computers never lie,
dialog: kid. Your mom will be arrested at work,
dialog: she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip
dialog: searched.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse
dialog: things than death and, uh, I can do all of
dialog: them!
text: Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked
text: mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over
dialog: her.
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT.
text: Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Talk to me.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's
dialog: on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it
text: out. She's not the one who planted the virus.
dialog: You leave her alone.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,
dialog: she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
text: Dade hangs up and waits for some time. A limousine drives
text: by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,
text: jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase
text: but gives up quickly.
scene_heading: INT. KATE'S ROOM.
text: Dade shows up. Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the
dialog: disc.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Kate, listen.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh, hold on...
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I have to tell you something.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Hold on a second!
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Looks like a hacker wrote it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Come here, look at this. This thing is dense.
text: Nikon points out part of the code.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This
text: is taking forever and a day to figure out.
dialog: I'm gonna make some coffee.
text: Dade takes Nikon's place.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Tag, you're in.
text: Hours pass. Dade studies and reverse engineers the
text: garbage file. The other hackers watch, and do just about
text: anything but be hackers. Finally, over boxes of
text: half-finished pizza, Dade makes an announcement.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: This isn't a virus. It's a worm!
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: What's this one eat?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: It nibbles. You see this?
text: Dade indicates a rapidly scrolling data display.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: This is every financial transaction Ellingson
dialog: conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to
text: the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: And no one's caught it because the money isn't
text: really gone. It's just data being shifted
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out
text: with the money and erases its tracks.
speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: NIKON

speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the
text: fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and
dialog: that's us. We've got to get the rest of the
dialog: file, so we can find out where the money is
dialog: going before the worm disappears, so we can
dialog: find out WHO created it.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I know, I know who wrote it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I didn't know what was on it.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: (agitated)

speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Why did he come to you?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Zero Cool? Crashed fifteen hundred and seven
dialog: systems in one day?
text: Nikon closes his eyes and access his photographic memory.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Biggest crash in history, front page, New
dialog: York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought
dialog: you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero
dialog: Cool! Oh, shit!
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: That's far out!
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: This is Zero Cool, man! Whooo, haha!
speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: Well that's great. There goes MIT.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I'll make it up to you!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I'll hack the Gibson.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: They'll trace you like that
dialog: (snaps his fingers)
dialog: man, cops are gonna find you, they're
dialog: gonna find you with a smoking gun.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Fucked if I care, man.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll
dialog: take you ten minutes to get in, and you've
dialog: still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the

speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Oh wow, we are fried.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (suddenly lighter-hearted)
dialog: Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With

speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: You're both screwed. I help, we can do it in six.
speaker_heading: NIKON

scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE ELLINGSON BUILDING.

speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of
dialog: honor, I might take advantage of this
text: situation. Erotically, as it were.
text: Kate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye

text: start trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a
text: security guard.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Alright, hold it right there!

speaker_heading: DADE

scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET.

speaker_heading: NIKON

dialog: But he forgot the most important thing.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Ta-da!
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Yo, brain dead, the manual!

scene_heading: PHONE COMPANY TECH
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: CEREAL AND NIKON

scene_heading: INT. SECRET SERVICE BULDING.
text: A woman is seated at the desk. Agent Gill walks by.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Find it?
text: Cereal emerges from the desk, between her legs. His tool

speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Phone's alright. The problem must be

text: Cereal walks away with his buttcrack seriously showing.
scene_heading: INT. ELLINGSON MINERAL OFFICES.
text: Nikon poses as a flower delivery boy. He winds his way

scene_heading: INT. PLAGUE'S LOFT.

speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: (pacing)
dialog: They had a large chunk of the garbage file?
dialog: How much do they know?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
text: Not everything. But enough to implicate us.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: You said the worm was untreaceable!
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers.
dialog: But don't worry. All we have to do is launch
dialog: the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be
text: put away.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
speaker_heading: PLAGUE

text: Margo starts to protest.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Look, there is no right and wrong. There is
text: only fun and boring. A thirty year prison

dialog: prefer serves it, us? Or them?
text: Plague clicks on "Launch". The virus repeats its demand.
speaker_heading: VIRUS
dialog: Unless five million dollars are transferred to

scene_heading: EXT. OPEN SEA.

speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: (sternly)
text: The virus goes off tomorrow morning at 10:30,
dialog: and those hackers tried to get into our system
dialog: again. At this point I insist you take more
dialog: strenuous action, or Ellingson Mineral will
dialog: hold the Secret Service responsible.
text: Gill gets on the phone.
speaker_heading: GILL

dialog: Get me arrest warrants on Kate Libby, alias

scene_heading: INT. NIKON'S PLACE.
text: Nikon and Cereal taped Gill's orders.
speaker_heading: CEREAL

speaker_heading: NIKON

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Hey, Burn. We got a little problem here.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY.
text: Cereal, Nikon, Dade and Kate skate through a run down

text: the results of their password gathering spree.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Alright, so what have we got?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever
text: Polaroid head here got inside Ellingson.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how
dialog: many but... my head hurts.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the
dialog: Da Vinci virus?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Check this out. It's a memo about how they're
dialog: gonna deal with those oil spills that happened
dialog: on the fourteenth.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What oil spills?
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Whoa, whoa. Yo, brain-dead, today is the
dialog: thirteenth.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Well this hasn't happened yet.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same
dialog: day the worm ends its run. I mean... Da Vinci
dialog: virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was
dialog: being charged with? Look...
dialog: (quotes the memo)
dialog: "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson
dialog: tankers" - they blame hackers!
speaker_heading: NIKON

dialog: Damn!
speaker_heading: CEREAL

text: Kate gets ready to get off the subway.
speaker_heading: NIKON
dialog: Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, where are you going,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I got an idea. We've got a few hours, right,

scene_heading: INT. INDUSTRIAL DANCE CLUB.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: There they are!
speaker_heading: DADE
text: Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: They're elite! Let's get 'em.
text: Dade and Kate push through the crowd. The song changes to
text: a fast industrial rap number, Razor and Blade leave the
text: stage, and Dade starts getting moshed. He climbs on the
text: stage to follow Razor and Blade. For his trouble, he is
text: thrown back onto the crowd, who pass him around overhead.
text: Finally the crowd lets him go. He catches up with Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I lost 'em. Where were you?
text: Dade tries to explain, but is at a loss for words.
text: They make their way to the entrance to Razor and Blade's
text: lair. Video monitors are everywhere.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I don't like this.
text: A robotic arm with a revolver swings around to point at
dialog: Dade.
speaker_heading: DADE
text: AAAAAUGH! I definitely don't like this!
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: (through video intercom)
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Ummm... we come in peace?

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We need your help. If you're up to it.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: She's buff. Ballsy.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: Let's keep her.
speaker_heading: RAZOR

scene_heading: INT. RAZOR AND BLADE'S PLACE.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills
text: at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DADE
text: It's somehow connected with the worm that's

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We need your help to overload the Gibson so we
dialog: can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the
dialog: worm program.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
text: She's rabid, but cute.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: See, we're very busy. A TV network that

speaker_heading: DADE
text: (noticing the stench of sellout)
dialog: Let's go, Kate.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: Wait. Nobody said no. But you are going to
dialog: need more than just two media icons like us.
dialog: You need an army.
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: That's it! An electronic army! If I were us,
dialog: I'd get on the internet, send out a major

speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: Hackers of the World, Unite!
speaker_heading: BLADE
dialog: How are you going to take care of the cops?
text: Dade just smiles.
scene_heading: INT. DADE'S ROOM.

text: Suddenly there is gridlock on the streets of New York
dialog: City.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK.
text: Nikon is playing chess against two Hassidic Jews.

speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand
dialog: Central. Let's hit it!
text: Nikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave.
text: Dade, Cereal, Nikon, and Kate skate through the streets.
text: Dade's program to freeze all the traffic lights on green,
text: runs on schedule at 9:00:00 precisely. Picture New York City in
text: morning rush hour, and every traffic light is green. Instant
text: gridlock ensues. The four skate through the traffic easily, while
text: the Secret Service, now pursuing them, is stuck. Gill punches a
text: parked car in frustration. Its alarm goes off.
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.
text: The four hackers skate into Grand Central Station and head
text: to the lowest level. They meet up with Joey.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Hey Joey, you made it!
scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES.
text: The hackers are now setting up laptops at a bank of pay
text: phones. Dade is wearing a "Pirate Eye" eyepiece.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Now listen up, use your best viruses to buy us
dialog: time, we have to get into Plague's file and
dialog: copy the worm.
text: Cereal screams.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Ai! Boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! Alright, that was

dialog: alright?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Cereal.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: KATE

text: Joey takes Cereal's place.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Alright, let's boot up.
text: The four boot up their machines. Various vanity screens
text: come up on the laptops. They begin to hack. We see the
text: inside of the Gibson. Viruses of all kinds begin to pour
text: in. In the offices and data processing rooms, the
text: Ellingson staff are in pandemonium. Happy faces with eye
text: patches appear on their screens. "Sit on my interface."
text: "Shit for Brains." "Arf Arf Arf!" Cookie monsters.
scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.
text: The big monitor shows the attack in progress.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: What is it? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
speaker_heading: MARGO

text: I WANT A COOKIE. GIVE ME A COOKIE NOW!
speaker_heading: HAL
text: There's a new virus in the database.
speaker_heading: MARGO

speaker_heading: HAL
text: It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I

speaker_heading: PLAGUE

speaker_heading: HAL
text: We have a Zero Bug attacking all the login and

speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Run anti-virus. Give me a systems display!
text: The systems display comes up. Red flashes everywhere,

speaker_heading: PLAGUE

speaker_heading: HAL
text: The rabbit is in the administration system.
text: Rabbit icons start to fill the systems display.
speaker_heading: PLAGUE
dialog: Send a Flu-shot.
speaker_heading: MARGO
dialog: Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
speaker_heading: HAL

scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES.
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: Are we fashionably late?
dialog: Hackers in England, Italy, Japan, Russia, everywhere

scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.
speaker_heading: SYSOP

scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.

scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL PUBLIC PHONES.
speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: I found it! I found it!
scene_heading: INT. COMPUTER ROOM, ELLINGSON MINERAL.

speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: DADE

text: The SS arrive. Gill himself has his .357 drawn.
speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Freeze!

speaker_heading: GILL

speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: GILL
speaker_heading: FREEZE!
text: The SS have caught up with the hackers. Agent Bob seems to

scene_heading: EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION.
text: Outside, he notices Cereal, who wasn't present to be

speaker_heading: DADE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: DADE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thanks for your help.
text: Dade turns on the intercom. Gill can be heard through it.
speaker_heading: GILL

scene_heading: MRS. MURPHY

speaker_heading: REPORTER
text: ...and attacked the Ellingson's computer

speaker_heading: GILL
dialog: Well, I'm afraid not. Hackers are a grave

dialog: Mineral.
text: Razor and Blade busily work on keeping him on the air.
speaker_heading: CEREAL
dialog: But for what, you ask? World domination?
dialog: Nay. Something far more tacky. A virus called
dialog: Da Vinci, that when launched, would cause
dialog: Ellingson Mineral tankers to capsize was to be
dialog: blamed on innocent hackers. But this virus was
dialog: really the smokescreen, right. What could be
