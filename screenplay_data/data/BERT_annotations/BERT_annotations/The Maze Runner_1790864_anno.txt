speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. THE BOX
text: A confined space, pitch black. Slowly, shapes and boundaries
text: emerge as a dim room, the size of a large freight elevator,
text: gradually comes into focus.
text: A TEENAGE BOY is awakening. From his POV, through a_ groggy
text: haze...all around there are massive steel STORAGE DRUMS. He
text: slowly sits up, his vision still drifting...
text: Suddenly, there’s an escalating, high-pitched hum and he
text: notices a faint point of light at one edge of the ceiling.
text: He watches as the light grows, bisecting the space...
text: Then, a violent lurch, and the vibrations stop. And, now,
text: from above, he can hear the muffled cacophony of what sounds
text: like a CROWD, growing in volume.
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: I’m down here!
text: He's blinded as the ceiling gpens, and the space is
text: absolutely flooded with light.
text: Slowly, from the white-out, his vision returns.
text: Revealing...DOZENS of YOUNG MEN staring back at him. They’re
text: kneeling, crowded around the container he’s arrived in. Some
text: are barely teens, others seem to be in their early twenties.
text: The faces of many are streaked with mud, some bruised and
text: cut. Not one is smiling.
text: The TEENAGER’S focus darts back and forth as...
speaker_heading: HECKLER ONE
dialog: Send him back!
speaker_heading: HECKLER TWO
dialog: We’re gonna need a bigger
dialog: graveyard!
text: Laughter, even louder, as the world spins. Then...
speaker_heading: COMMANDING VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Enough!
text: At once, the CROWD above pulls back out of view, quiet. A
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: COMMANDING VOICE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on and grab him.
text: And then, two FIGURES suddenly hop over the edge of the
dialog: container.
text: The TEENAGER turns to see FIGURE ONE land behind him, and
text: then back to FIGURE TWO, who’s coming toward him.
dialog: +
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 2.
text: Their features are blurred -- just tall, menacing
text: apparitions, who each grab him by an arm..
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: Wait!
dialog: .--and toss him up over the edge...
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOX - THE GLADE - DAY
text: .»..onto the hard, dirt surface. Still the TEENAGER’S POV, on
text: his stomach, as he slowly pushes up to scan the snickering,
text: whispering CROWD..
text: They ‘re all wearing modified versions of the same strange
text: uniform -- sleek gray tunics and slim trousers -- but many
text: have cut-off their Sleeves, or their pants at the knee, and
text: others adorned their chests with various scrawled
dialog: decorations.
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: Where the hell am I?
text: Then, the commanding voice, GALLY (21), steps forward.
text: GALLY'S face is gaunt, something dark and unhinged just
text: beneath the surface. His left eye clouded over, his right,
text: cold and piercing.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Get up, boy. This is no way to
dialog: make a first impression.
text: The TEENAGER tries to avoid GALLY’S menacing gaze, and looks
text: past him, only to find an impossible sight in the near
dialog: distance...
text: A massive stone Wall rises 100-stories into the sky, defying
dialog: the laws of physics.
text: The TEENAGER looks back to GALLY, now frantic, as his vision
text: again goes wobbly. His eyes roll back and...
speaker_heading: SLAM CUT TO
speaker_heading: BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - THE GLADE - LATER
text: The TEENAGER’S eyes snap open. He’s now on his back, staring
text: at the ceiling of a rock cave. He tries to sit up, but
text: can’t. His arms are tied down.
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: (screams
dialog: Please!! Help me!!
text: His cry reverberates. A beat, then, from outside his cell,
text: the sound of footsteps.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 3.
text: The TEENAGER strains to see again, and finds himself staring
text: through the bars at CLINT (17) -- nervous, bright eyes,
text: angular features. CLINT turns down the corridor and shouts
dialog: to someone...
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: He’s awake!
text: The TEENAGER is frantic as CLINT enters the cell and
dialog: approaches...
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: Just relax. You’1ll be out of here
dialog: soon enough.
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: But why am I tied up?
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: For your own safety. We never know
dialog: how you Greenies are gonna react.
dialog: beat)
dialog: Now, lay back...
text: GALLY enters, moving with a pronounced limp. The TEENAGER
text: lurches up against his restraints...
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: Get these ropes off me!
text: But GALLY says nothing, unmoved by the TEENAGER’S terror.
text: From down the Hall there’s more commotion.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: He’s coming...
text: Before the TEENAGER can ask who.... CLINT and GALLY move to
text: either side of the cell, standing erect, at attention.
text: And, then, he enters...
text: ALBY. Tall, charismatic.
text: prailing ALBY, his Guards -- two muscular brutes, carrying
text: hand-made cross-bows and wooden clubs, whose names we’1ll
speaker_heading: learn are NEWT (20) and ATLAS (18).
text: CLINT keeps his eyes downcast, visibly nervous. GALLY, on
text: the other hand, looks directly at ALBY, who pronounces...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Let’s get started.
text: The TEENAGER quiets as ALBY approaches.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 4.
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m Alby.
text: A beat, close on the TEENAGER’S face. He’s actually
text: straining to remember. Then it comes to him...
speaker_heading: TEENAGER
dialog: I’m...I’m Thomas.
text: ALBY pulls up a stool and sits.
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Welcome to the Glade, Thomas.
dialog: (to, Clint)
dialog: Untie him.
text: THOMAS’ eyes dart back-and-forth among the three men as CLINT
text: loosens his restraints...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: The Glade? Who the hell are you
dialog: guys? Do I know you?
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Thomas, I look after everyone. As
dialog: soon as we're done here, we’ll make
dialog: sure you get settled.
text: THOMAS, massaging his wrists, looks at ALBY, and relaxes a
text: moment in the presence of his authority.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Please...I just want to know what’s
dialog: happening.
text: ALBY nods, sympathetic.
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: What’s the last thing you remember?
text: THOMAS is about to answer, but when he opens his mouth, he’s
text: speechless. Nothing.
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides your name, can you think of
dialog: anything about yourself? Names of
dialog: friends? Family?
text: Again, THOMAS wants to answer, but struggles, drawing only a
dialog: blank.
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have any idea where you
dialog: live? The name of a city?
text: The enormity begins to hit him...
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you_know what year it is,
dialog: Thomas?
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 5.
text: Breathless, beads of sweat forming, THOMAS’ heart is
dialog: pounding.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Just like all the others.
text: ALBY turns to him...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t keep
dialog: trying.
text: Resigned, ALBY stands, suddenly, his demeanor hardened. He
text: turns to CLINT again...
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: CLINT
text: Frankly, pretty unimpressive.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: They’re shorthanded in the eastern
dialog: fields.
text: ALBY nods. Turns back to THOMAS one last time..
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: We have Laws here. Obey them. Work
dialog: hard and you’1l be kept fed, alive,
dialog: and reasonably comfortable.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PIT - THE GLADE
text: GALLY now drags THOMAS from the dark corridors of the Pit --
text: a shallow cave complex -- into the bright afternoon light of
text: the Glade, a circular expanse the size of a large pit mine.
speaker_heading: ALBY (V.O)
dialog: The Glade’s twenty acres of forest
dialog: and farmland...
text: There are primitive structures and large groves of trees that
text: block THOMAS’ view in several directions. But, everywhere he
text: looks those towering walls loom around the perimeter...
speaker_heading: ALBY (V.O.)
text: Surrounded by walls that touch the
dialog: heavens.
text: THOMAS notices that in each of the four cardinal directions,
text: the walls split open...
speaker_heading: ALBY (V.O.)
dialog: We call it the Maze.
text: CRANE UP, DIRECTLY OVERHEAD...to reveal a spiraling labyrinth
text: of twisting and turning passages” that unravel around the
text: Glade forever into the distance.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 6.
speaker_heading: ALBY (V.O.)
text: The Maze stands between us and
dialog: home...whatever world exists
dialog: outside this prison.
text: As ALBY'S voice fades and we return to ground-level, THOMAS
text: stares down his one clear sight-line where an entrance to the
text: Maze is visible a few hundred yards in the distance. *
dialog: *
text: GALLY takes THOMAS by the arm and pulls him toward a SHORT
text: BOY waiting nearby, who goes pale as GALLY gets closer... *
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: You're the Field Hand? Chuck?
dialog: CHUCK . *
dialog: Um. That’s right, sir...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: (to Thomas )
dialog: Chuck will show you your trade,
dialog: cover the rest of the basics.
text: CHUCK tries to give THOMAS a reassuring look
speaker_heading: GALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Chuck)
dialog: After shift’s over, take him to the
dialog: Homestead. *
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: This is ridiculous! You can’t just *
dialog: put me to work! *
text: Now, GALLY grabs THOMAS by the shirt and picks him up off the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: GALLY *
dialog: You'll do as you’re told. Or
dialog: you! 11 learn quick what every man
dialog: ere already knows: Do not make me
dialog: angry.
text: GALLY drops THOMAS, who's trying hard not to tremble.
speaker_heading: GALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Chuck)
dialog: Now, get him out of here.
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD PATH - THE GLADE - CONTINUOUS *
text: THOMAS walks alongside CHUCK, who’s rushing down a clear path
text: through the trees, roughly the size of a two-lane highway.
text: On either side of the path, a series of walkways have been
text: hung, and, off in the distance, several haphazard structures
text: appear to be suspended in the branches.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 7.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Pretty cool, huh? Most of it was
dialog: already built when the first guys
dialog: got here.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: How long have you --
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Long enough to tell you anything
dialog: you’re wondering. Pegged me a
dialog: Field Hand right from the start,
dialog: just like you. But Clint gays
dialog: another few months he might teach
dialog: me to medic.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And no one knows what’s happening?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: There were twenty guys at the
dialog: beginning. Every week since for
dialog: three years, the Box brings
dialog: supplies. And every month, a new
dialog: arrival like me and you. Just a
dialog: name but no memory.
text: THOMAS can hardly believe what he’s hearing...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We must be from someplace.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Just follow my lead and stick with
dialog: the program.
text: Now, on their left, the trees begin to thin and THOMAS
text: notices several strange FIGURES in the distance. They’re all
text: older, rail thin, and their clothes are in tatters.
text: THOMAS slows, but CHUCK pulls him by the arm...
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Changed Boys. Best to keep your
dialog: distance.
scene_heading: EXT. EASTERN FIELDS - THE GLADE - DAY
text: THOMAS and CHUCK arrive at the Eastern Fields, where a dozen
text: FIELD HANDS are working under the afternoon sun to empty the
text: same STORAGE DRUMS delivered earlier with THOMAS.
text: The DRUMS are filled with water, and the FIELD HANDS are
text: attaching hoses that empty them into a series of low-lying
text: irrigation ducts servicing the crops...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
text: Brought back an extra set of hands.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 8.
text: ZACK, a short, powerful boy, comes out from behind a nearby
text: SHED, carrying a SHOVEL...
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Let’s hope you didn’t rub off on
text: the walk over.
dialog: (beat, to Thomas)
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Thomas.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I’m the boss man. Whatever Chuck
dialog: here does, do the opposite.
text: CHUCK hangs his head, embarrassed. ZACK hands CHUCK the
speaker_heading: SHOVEL.
speaker_heading: ZACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Both of you head out to the spuds
text: and start turning soil.
text: As CHUCK starts to walk away, one FIELDHAND sticks out a leg
text: and another shoves CHUCK, sending him crashing hard to the
text: ground. THOMAS instinctively lunges forward...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Hey!
text: The FIELDHANDS look at THOMAS, amused at his outburst. Even
text: CHUCK looks surprised as he struggles to his feet.
text: THOMAS stands still, as ZACK now moves closer, eyeing him
text: head-to-toe. But THOMAS just looks past ZACK, at that
text: towering Wall, closer than ever.
text: Suddenly, ZACK SUCKER-PUNCHES him in the stomach.
text: THOMAS shakes off the blow as the others snicker. He slowly
text: lifts his eyes, and steps nose-to-nose with ZACK.
text: ZACK winds up for a head-shot...but THOMAS catches his fist,
text: mid-swing, in a vice-grip.
text: The other FIELDHANDS are shocked silent.
text: THOMAS forces ZACK'S hand down, surprised by his own
dialog: strength
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: How ‘bout that...
text: THOMAS releases ZACK and walks past him into the fields,
text: CHUCK trailing.
dialog: +
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 9.
scene_heading: EXT. EASTERN FIELDS - LATER
text: In the shadow of the Wall, THOMAS, drenched in sweat, heaves
text: a shovel of dirt into a nearby pile. Out the corner of his
text: eye, he notices ZACK and some other FIELDHANDS in the
text: distance, watching him.
text: And then, a few feet away, CHUCK collapses, panting. THOMAS
text: turns to him...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Follow your lead, huh?
text: Laying on his back, CHUCK smiles...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I got this down to a science.
text: Somewhere in the Glade, a bell clangs.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Especially the quitting part.
text: All around, the other FIELDHANDS drop their tools and head
text: back toward the forest.
scene_heading: EXT. NORTH GATE - THE GLADE - DUSK
text: THOMAS follows CHUCK and a stream of GLADERS down a wooded
text: path, finally emerging into a clearing...
text: .--and stares, captivated, at one of the entrances to the
text: Maze. He tries to push through the crowd, but before he can
dialog: get close...
text: MINHO (21) and ARON (20)... Both over six feet tall, not an
text: ounce of body fat on them, come bounding out of the Maze at a
text: full sprint, and stop to catch their breath just inside the
dialog: Glade.
text: MINHO is wearing an armband, and they’re both carrying packs
text: strapped to their shirtless backs, animal skin canteens,
text: cross-bows, and razor-sharp spears.
text: THOMAS stares at them, awestruck. CHUCK whispers...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: The Runners. They’re the
dialog: strongest, the fastest.
text: The gathered GLADERS move aside so the RUNNERS can pass,
text: patting them on the back, offering to carry their gear,
text: offering words of encouragement.

dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 10.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D) *
dialog: They're looking for a way out of *
dialog: the Maze. *
text: THOMAS can’t take his eyes off them... *
speaker_heading: THOMAS *
dialog: Why do they need weapons? *
text: And then, suddenly a THUNDEROUS CLAP, as the Walls SLAM shut, *
text: closing off the Maze, as the last light of day vanishes. *
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD CLEARING - THE GLADE - NIGHT *
text: A boisterous scene in the Glade’s central clearing, the *
text: Homestead -- a large open space filled with wooden tables, a
text: cook shed, a few fire circles, and what looks like a make-
text: shift playing field.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You want something to eat?
text: The Glade cook, WINSTON, and his KITCHEN HANDS are handing
text: out bowls of steaming chili to a long line of takers. The
text: food looks good enough, but after what he’s just seen...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Not hungry.
text: Everywhere THOMAS turns, small groups of GLADERS are talking
text: loud: Yj Some are gathered around what looks like an arm-
text: wrestling match, and others are kicking around a ball of
text: vines and tree rubber.
text: AS THOMAS takes in the rowdy atmosphere...
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.S.
dialog: Alby always says...Gotta keep up *
dialog: our spirits. The guys know they *
dialog: get caught moping, Newt and Atlas
dialog: are gonna give ‘em a pep talk. A
dialog: rough one.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yeah, well, I’m not so sure about
dialog: your fearless leaders.
dialog: (biting)
dialog: How long they been stuck here?
text: THOMAS glances up at the sky -- it’s a charcoal grey, with a
text: few pinpoints of light. He studies it...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess the sky looks familiar.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sort of.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 11.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Took me a week before I stopped
dialog: shaking. Just_had this terrible
dialog: ache inside. Like there were
dialog: family, friends...Who knows? People
dialog: I was missing.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I’m not sure what’s worse. I keep
dialog: trying... But I feel nothing.
text: Suddenly, a ball comes flying at them and THOMAS barely
text: dodges it. There’s laughter from the playing field...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Chuck)
dialog: This place blows, you know that?
dialog: There’s not much CHUCK can say.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll see you tomorrow.
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE - THE GLADE - NIGHT
text: THOMAS walks into the surrounding Grove, past several GLADERS
text: already bedding down for the night, who eye him warily. He
text: finds an empty tree at the fringes.
text: THOMAS collapses in the dirt, alone at last, his back against
text: the rough trunk. He can still see the fire circles burnin
text: in the clearing and hear the laughter, shouts, and cries o
text: the other boys blowing off steam all around him.
text: Then, from somewhere out in the Maze, a piercing SHRIEK cuts
text: through the night, the menacing cry of some other-worldly
dialog: creature.
text: THOMAS‘ eyes water. But before a tear can fall, he wipes it
text: away with his sleeve, and buries his head, exhausted.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE - THE GLADE - MORNING
text: THOMAS’ POV as he slowly awakens...Bright light, splintering
text: through the tree branches, which gradually come into focus.
text: He sits up...to find CHUCK standing right in front of him.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You’re gonna miss the chow. Long
dialog: day in the fields without it...
text: THOMAS closes his eyes again.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Damn. It wasn’t a nightmare.
dialog: *
dialog: 12.
text: He pulls himself up, stiff and aching.
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD CLEARING - THE GLADE - DAY
text: The clearing is buzzing with activity as the GLADERS prepare
dialog: for the day ahead of them.
text: There’s a long line at WINSTON’s cook shed. As THOMAS and
text: CHUCK take their place at the back of it, all eyes turn to
text: MINHO entering the clearing, leading the RUNNERS. They
text: ignore the line and WINSTON rushes to serve them. Then, the
text: cook looks up...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: A little respect Gladers? Let’s
dialog: hear it!
text: All the GLADERS begin clapping in unison, a tribute the
text: RUNNERS barely acknowledge.
text: Over the pounding noise...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: How do you become one? A Runner?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You don’t. Right out of the Box,
dialog: they pull anyone with potential and
dialog: make ‘em a Bagger. Like Newt and
dialog: Atlas. Six months enforcing the
dialog: Laws before they even give you a
text: shot at it.
text: MINHO and his men have finished collecting their rations when
text: suddenly, louder than the cheer, the blast of a loud,
text: prolonged HORN..
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: That must be a mistake.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What’s it mean?
speaker_heading: __ CHUCK
text: The Box is rising...
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOX - THE GLADE - DAY
text: From all over, GLADERS race toward the Box, a rectangular
text: concrete bunker built into the earth, topped with steel
dialog: doors.
text: THOMAS follows CHUCK, who’s very excited...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I don’t get the big deal...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 13.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: It’s never come twice in a week.
dialog: Never.
text: CHUCK and THOMAS stop directly across the Box from ALBY, who, *
text: today, is also dressed like a RUNNER. He looks uneasy.
text: Beside ALBY is GALLY, NEWT, ATLAS and a crew of BAGGERS.
text: The ground vibrates, and there’s a high-pitched SCREECH as
text: the elevator rises into place. Slowly, the ground splits,
text: and the doors retract, opening...
text: Everyone surges forward, angling for a better look. This
dialog: time there are no massive storage drums...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: There! In the corner...
text: Only a small FIGURE, curled up, face down.
text: NEWT and ATLAS leap in. A quick beat and NEWT looks up...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: There’s something wrong... *
text: NEWT turns over the FIGURE, trying to pick him up. Stops,
dialog: frozen. *
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: I said get him up here! *
text: ATLAS tosses the FIGURE to the surface. The GLADERS gasp.
dialog: THOMAS sees...
text: It’s a teenage GIRL, sprawled out helpless at ALBY’s feet,
text: shoulder-length hair obscuring her features, loose fitting
text: clothes draped over her clearly feminine figure.
text: THOMAS stares, captivated, from across the expanse of the
text: open Box. Suddenly, the GIRL’S head turns toward him,
text: revealing her face. THOMAS buckles over and...
speaker_heading: FLASH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
text: ...the view from the street of an ordinary brick Town House.
text: Through a gentle shower of white snowflakes, framed_in the
text: second-story window is the silhouette of a LITTLE GIRL, her
text: face obscured by shadows....
dialog: PRELAP...
speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.S.)
dialog: Thomas!
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 14.
dialog: As we...
scene_heading: FLASH BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOX - THE GLADE
text: pei Seek trying to keep THOMAS from falling into the Box
dialog: elow
text: THOMAS struggles to stand, as several GLADERS stare at him,
text: their attention drawn by the commotion. THOMAS, confused,
dialog: reeling...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Still faint from yesterday...
text: Across the Box, GALLY has noticed. THOMAS looks away.
text: Meanwhile, the GLADERS are buzzing as ALBY and GALLY examine *
text: the GIRL at their feet, visibly unnerved by her presence. *
text: She has a tag affixed to her wrist. It reads: “She's the *
dialog: last one. Ever.” *
text: GALLY looks ashen as ALBY removes the tag and conceals it. A *
dialog: long beat, then...
speaker_heading: ZACK *
dialog: Let us get a look at her!
text: The GLADERS erupt and surge toward the GIRL. ALBY and GALLY
text: seem frozen, as NEWT tries to push back the mob...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Atlas!
text: ATLAS unholsters his club, and several other BAGGERS help
text: form a perimeter around the GIRL.
speaker_heading: ARI
dialog: C’mon! We've all got a right!
text: Finally ALBY snaps out of it. He holds up his RUNNER’S SPEAR
text: and erupts...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: The right to choke on my blade if
dialog: you come one step closer!
text: The GLADERS stop cold, shocked by the threat.
text: GALLY is still crouching beside the GIRL, focused only on *
text: her, oblivious to the standoff.
text: ALBY slowly composes himself. Lowers his weapon, almost

dialog: I'd trade my life for any Glader.
dialog: Every man here knows that.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: The CROWD
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 15.
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: And right now this girl deserves
dialog: the same protection.
dialog: buzzes...
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: When she wakes up, we'll find out
dialog: what she knows, if anything. *
dialog: (to Gally)
dialog: Take her to my quarters, under
dialog: tuard, and make sure Clint has a
text: ook at her.
dialog: (to the Gladers)
dialog: Today, I lead the Runners into the
dialog: Maze. I expect a full day’s work
dialog: from the rest of you!
text: A brief beat before anyone moves, then...
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Alright. You heard him. *
text: The crowd disperses but THOMAS stands watching the GIRL as *
text: the BAGGERS unfold a stretcher. *
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. EASTERN FIELDS - THE GLADE - LATER
text: A pick slams violently into hard earth. THOMAS draws a deep
text: breath and swings once more into the long drainage ditch he’s
dialog: carving into the soil. *
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Where'd they take her?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
text: Near the Map Room. There’s a path
dialog: from the Homestead --
text: CHUCK stops himself...
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait. Why? You’re not thinking...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I need to see her.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: It’s not allowed...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Allowed?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Gally will --
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 16.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Wake up Chuck! You do everything
dialog: you're told and how’s that working
dialog: out for you?
text: CHUCK steps back, a bit wounded.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Some of them are jerks. I get
dialog: that. But it’d be worse without
dialog: the Laws.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Don’t talk to me about the Laws!
dialog: They seem great for one thing:
dialog: Givin Gally an excuse to be an
dialog: asshole!
dialog: THOMAS is really rattled...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT’D)
dialog: Something happened back there, and
dialog: I can’t explain it.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What?
text: A beat, as THOMAS considers telling CHUCK what happened.
text: Then, the bell clangs_indicating the Walls are about to begin
text: closing. The other FIELD HANDS lay down their equipment.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Maybe you should stay away from me.
dialog: I don’t wanna get you in any more
dialog: trouble.
text: THOMAS drops his pick and follows the crowd...
scene_heading: EXT. EAST GATE - THE GLADE - DUSK
text: ..--back to the East Gate, where most of the GLADERS have
text: gathered to await ALBY and the RUNNERS.
text: But as THOMAS pushes through the crowd, he notices the mood
text: is grim. The bolts have extended from the wall, and the sky
text: is once again darkening.
text: He looks around and spots_all the RUNNERS, except one...
text: MINHO. Also missing is ALBY.
text: ARON and the others crouch, peering out into the Maze,
text: waiting. GALLY stands back, calm, detached from the air of
dialog: crisis.
text: THOMAS notices that NEWT, ATLAS, and all the BAGGERS are also
dialog: present.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 17.
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: No way they’re just lost. Not Alby
dialog: and Minho.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If they’re not back now, it’s
dialog: because they’re goners...
text: One of the RUNNERS, ARON, looks to GALLY...
dialog: What if we wanna take our chances?
text: GALLY turns to NEWT...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: The Gate. Now.
text: NEWT nods and the BAGGERS spring to action, deploying in a
text: line across the entrance to the Maze, blocking the RUNNERS’
dialog: access.
text: GALLY shows no emotion...
speaker_heading: GALLY eons D)
dialog: Tomorrow the Glade has to keep
dialog: functioning.
text: From inside the Maze there’s a loud, piercing, human CRY...
speaker_heading: ARON
dialog: That’s gotta be them. They must be
dialog: right around the corner...
text: ...and the RUNNERS surge forward.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Hold the line!
text: The BAGGERS push back, and several begin to wrestle violently
text: with the RUNNERS.
text: Then, that horrific ear-splitting SHRIEK once again echoes.
dialog: Followed by...
speaker_heading: ALBY (0.S.)
dialog: Just go! Forget me!
text: At the sound of ALBY’s voice, ARON dips low and flips NEWT
text: over his back, making a dash for the Maze. But before he can
text: make it, GALLY floors him with a CLUB to the STOMACH.
text: THOMAS turns to find CHUCK beside him...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: They’re just gonna let them die out
dialog: there??
text: THOMAS takes a step closer to the melee and time slows...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 18.
text: He spots an opening as GALLY and ARON face-off, and walks
text: toward the Glade’s exit. Now GALLY shouts at him...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Don’t move another inch!
text: THOMAS pauses. Then, a whisper in his head...
speaker_heading: GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Run, Thomas...
text: And THOMAS bolts, jeaping over GALLY and ARON, and racing
text: into the Maze, just as the doors SLAM shut behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCE CORRIDOR - EAST JUNGLE - THE MAZE - NIGHT
text: THOMAS immediately turns around, faces the closed Gate,
text: absorbs what’s just happened. He can’t hear a thing from
text: inside the Glade, or inside his head. It’s dead quiet.
text: A beat, THOMAS swivels, back still against the Gate, and we
dialog: get our first real look at the Maze, ahead in the darkness...
text: A long, straight corridor, extending fifty yards in the
text: distance. THOMAS admires the towering Walls on either side
text: of him. They’re covered in a thick mess of leafy vines.
text: THOMAS takes a breath and moves a few steps forward.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Alby! Minho!
text: His call reverberates, but there’s no answer. As THOMAS
text: walks, he looks up and notices some of the vines hang across
text: the passage ahead, a web of growth, impossibly high above
dialog: him.
text: THOMAS reaches the end of the corridor, and a T-intersection.
text: In both directions, the passage turns out of sight after a
text: short distance. He stops.
text: Then...the rustle of something moving cuts through the
text: silence. THOMAS, frantic, looks both ways...
text: Another murmur...growing louder. THOMAS is really panting.
text: He makes a choice and heads right, rounding the corner into
text: another corridor which seems to extend indefinitely.
text: Whatever is moving is now right behind him... He starts to
text: run, stumbling, as he looks back over his shoulder. Now,
text: he’s sprinting, the sound of his pounding heart and heaving
text: breath drowning out everything.
text: Then suddenly... He’s TACKLED...SLAMMED into the Wall, and
text: pinned there. A hand’s over his mouth, and he’s staring eye-
text: to-eye at MINHO.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: (whispers )
dialog: Not a sound, you hear me?
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 19.
text: THOMAS, stunned, manages to nod. MINHO removes his hand and
text: backs slowly across the corridor to an opening THOMAS hadn’‘t
text: noticed. MINHO ducks through the overgrowth, and THOMAS
dialog: follows...
scene_heading: EXT. EAST JUNGLE CIRCLE - THE MAZE
text: ...stepping into a circular chamber, thirty-feet in diameter.
text: There are arched doorways leading off it in every direction.
text: Propped in one corner is ALBY, a massive gash on his
text: forehead, torso hung forward, limp, unconscious.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Is he -- ?
speaker_heading: MINHO
text: Cracked his skull. Out cold, but
dialog: still breathing. You're the new
dialog: kid, aren't you?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: What the hell happened?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: No one was going to help. I
dialog: thought --
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: You did this on purpose?
text: MINHO can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D
dialog: Keep your mouth shut and do what I
dialog: say.
dialog: (beat, to himself)
dialog: I need to think...
text: From somewhere out in the Maze, another SHRIEK, the loudest
text: yet... MINHO thinks a beat, then throws ALBY over his
text: shoulder. Without saying a word, he takes off through one of
dialog: the exits...
text: THOMAS looks at all the identical doorways, considers his
dialog: options. Decides to follow...
scene_heading: EXT. INTERNAL CORRIDOR ONE - EAST JUNGLE - THE MAZE
text: THOMAS runs to catch up with MINHO who’s moving as fast as he
dialog: can down a corridor...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Let me help you with Alby....
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 20.
text: MINHO ignores him...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: We're sitting ducks in the
dialog: jungle...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What’s out there?
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: I told you to keep quiet.
text: They approach another T-intersection. MINHO puts ALBY down
text: and covertly sneaks a glance in both directions.
text: Then, from somewhere close, they hear that piercing SHRIEK...
text: reverberating...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s like it has our scent or
dialog: something...
text: MINHO thinks and then looks down at ALBY. Makes a
dialog: decision.
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: We leave him.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Chances are we’re all dead anyway.
dialog: We split up, give The Griever three
dialog: different targets.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: The Griever?
text: THOMAS looks down at ALBY, helpless...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT’D
dialog: But, isn’t he your frien
text: MINHO grabs THOMAS by the shirt, furious...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: His rules: Escape is all that
dialog: matters!
text: As MINHO moves to go, THOMAS sees the tangle of vines above
dialog: him. Has an idea...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Wait!
text: But MINHO has already disappeared around the corner. THOMAS
text: is alone, and for a moment all is quiet.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 21.
text: THOMAS looks back toward the circular room, where they came
dialog: from.
text: And then, another SHRIEK...
text: THOMAS turns around to the Wall and starts tearing Vines
text: away, frantic.
text: THOMAS finds a thick Vine and pulls down, putting as much
text: weight on it as possible. High above, somewhere in the
text: darkness, it stays anchored.
text: He grabs an adjacent Vine and now turns to ALBY, securing the
text: injured boy against his back. Then, he starts ¢limbing.:.
text: THOMAS struggles with each inch, hand over hand, finding
text: footholds in the stone behind the ivy. He’s only five feet
text: off the ground, when, another SHRIEK, and...the “GRIEVER”
text: seems to be getting closer.
text: THOMAS scrambles faster...dragging ALBY on his back, higher
dialog: and higher.
text: Until he SLIPS...sliding half the distance back to the
text: floor...and comes face-to-face with...two RED, demonic eyes
text: peering out from the darkness.
text: THOMAS, paralyzed, can barely make out the creature in the
dialog: shadows. And, then...
text: The GRIEVER’s entire body rolls into a BALL and catapults
dialog: forward...
text: Hanging on desperately, ALBY’s weight pulling him back,
text: THOMAS now braces his feet against the Wall, and finds
text: himself at an angle, like he’s repelling.
text: The GRIEVER is closing...
text: Holding onto the vine, THOMAS runs up the Wall...as the
text: GRIEVER passes just underneath him.
text: The GRIEVER uncoils, spins around and let’s out a blood-
text: curdling SHRIEK...
text: Another ten feet up, THOMAS looks down over his shoulder.
text: and sees the GRIEVER slithering up the Wall straight toward
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Great.
text: THOMAS looks up again -- thinks about trying to outrun it --
text: then down, and sees the GRIEVER is already halfway to him.
text: THOMAS turns to ALBY, who’s limp body just dangles in the
dialog: Vines.
text: A beat, as THOMAS confronts what he’s about to do. He looks
text: hard at ALBY...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 22.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly )
dialog: I tried. I’m sorry.
text: Now THOMAS focuses back on the approaching GRIEVER. It’s ten
text: feet away... five feet away... and its STINGER slowly
text: unfolds...
text: Just at it’s about to strike, THOMAS leaps off the Wall,
text: simultaneous sliding down the Vine that he’s holding...
text: He lands hard, rolling into the dirt, and slamming into the
text: far Wall. He looks down at his hands, both chafed raw, and
text: up at the GRIEVER.
text: The GRIEVER has stopped, still clinging to the Wall, a foot
text: below ALBY. Before it can react, THOMAS takes off running...
scene_heading: EXT. VARIOUS CORRIDORS - EAST JUNGLE - THE MAZE
text: -..around the corner in the same direction MINHO followed,
text: but there’s no sign of him.
text: THOMAS sprints, following the corridor’s serpentine path,
dialog: turn after turn after turn, until...
scene_heading: EXT. DEAD END CORRIDOR - EAST JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Thomas...
text: He trips, stumbling to the ground...
speaker_heading: GIRL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: When I wake up I won’t remember.
text: THOMAS rises to a crouch, his eyes darting in every
dialog: direction...
speaker_heading: GIRL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to save them.
text: Now, THOMAS is totally panicked, standing up, spinning in
dialog: every direction...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What...the hell...is happening???
text: THOMAS stands still, and for a long moment, there’s silence.
text: THOMAS gets his bearings: He’s at the center of another T-
text: intersection. To his eft, fifty yards down, the passage
text: ends in an arched doorway. To his right, fifty yards down,
text: is a solid wall with no outlet.
text: Then, from behind him...

dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 23.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Never stop moving!
text: THOMAS, startled, turns to see MINHO jogging toward him... *
speaker_heading: THOMAS *
dialog: Did you hear that voice? *
text: MINHO looks at him like he’s nuts...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Keep it together. *
text: Suddenly, DUST kicks up all around them and the Wall ahead *
text: drifts sideways, taking the doorway with it... *
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT/D)
text: Pieces of the Maze shift every
dialog: night! One of the reasons it’s
dialog: been so hard to solve it...
text: They turn to see the Wall at the far end of the corridor also
text: sliding. MINHO shouts over the now THUNDERING noise...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: Stay!
text: MINHO runs toward the dead end. He’s almost to it when...
text: The GRIEVER careens into the middle of the corridor,
text: separating THOMAS from MINHO. It SHRIEKS...looks both ways,
text: then turns toward THOMAS.
text: THOMAS stares at it, no place to run. MINHO looks back...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: Holy sh--!
text: But his cry is drowned out by the deafening rumble of the
text: Walls’ movement.
text: The GRIEVER curls up and takes off toward THOMAS...Who pauses
text: a beat, then sprints directly toward it...
text: It’s a game of chicken as the distance closes. Then, just as
text: it looks like THOMAS might run head-on into the GRIEVER... He
text: cuts to his left...and runs along the Wall, perpendicular to
text: the ground, until he’s past it...
text: The GRIEVER spins to follow... *
text: Ahead, MINHO is S*reveat wildly. The Wall at the once dead
text: end has shifted to reveal a new doorway, but the opening is
text: fast sliding out of view...
text: THOMAS sprints, the GRIEVER directly behind him... *
text: Just as the GRIEVER is about to catch them, THOMAS and MINHO
text: leap through the disappearing doorway...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 24.
scene_heading: EXT. BOULDER ROOM - THE MAZE - CONTINUOUS
text: ..-landing hard on an irregular, rocky surface. *
text: A loud SHRIEK as the GRIEVER’S head is squeezed, and the Wall *
text: comes off its tracks, coming to a stop.
text: The pinned GRIEVER violently thrusts its STINGER at THOMAS
text: and MINHO, who scramble out of range.
text: For a beat, they stare at its RED EYES, which seem to be
text: studying them. “And then, the GRIEVER gathers all its
text: strength and pulls back, disappearing into the darkness.
text: Finally, it’s quiet. Both MINHO and THOMAS slowly peel
dialog: themselves up.
text: A long beat, as MINHO studies THOMAS...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: That was a nice move back there. *
text: THOMAS nods, numb with fear and exhaustion. He looks around
text: and sees they’re in an enclosed space the size of two
text: football fields. It’s filled with black, volcanic BOULDERS,
text: some piled high, others scattered alone like they were
text: forgotten. MINHO notices THOMAS taking it in...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
text: Chambers and corridors get bigger
dialog: the farther out from the Glade you
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: So, you know where we are?
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Roughly. We map this section
dialog: pretty regularly.
text: And then MINHO realizes...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: But this room's always been closed
dialog: off to us.
text: THOMAS gestures back to the disabled Wall behind them...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Not anymore. *
scene_heading: EXT. BOULDER ROOM - THE MAZE - LATER
text: MINHO and THOMAS carefully traverse the blackened rocks, now
text: halfway toward the far wall.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Is it some kind of animal?
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 25.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Everyone’s got a theory.
text: Another few steps, then MINHO stops dead.
text: A round cloud of mist floats up and hangs in the air,
dialog: swirling.
text: And then, VROOM! it EXPLODES in a burst of FIRE, and THOMAS
text: recoils from the rush of heat.
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: Just watch for the gas clouds. You
dialog: have a couple seconds before
text: they're ignited.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: How do you come out here every day?
text: MINHO keeps walking. He’s spotted a small archway ahead, not
text: on the ground, but twenty feet up the Wall, like some kind of
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Now, that’s a first...
text: MINHO leads THOMAS up a nearby hill of boulders, climbing til
text: they've reached the porthole. MINHO pulls himself up on the
text: ledge and THOMAS comes up beside him.
text: THOMAS’ POV... Below them is a long, narrow room unlike the
text: other corridors of the Maze. Every surface is smooth and
dialog: polished.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What’s down there?
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: No idea. Never seen anything--
text: And, then in the darkness, the GRIEVER slithers directly
text: below them. THOMAS and MINHO hold their breath, but the
text: creature keeps moving disappearing at the other end of the
dialog: passage.
text: THOMAS and MINHO slowly exhale.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That lead to another part of the
dialog: Maze?
text: MINHO starts climbing down...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: We'll check it out tomorrow. Right
dialog: now, it looks like we pulled offa
dialog: miracle. It’s almost morning...

scene_heading: EXT. INTERNAL CORRIDOR ONE - EAST JUNGLE - THE MAZE - DAWN
text: The sky above the Maze has begun to glow with the early light

text: where THOMAS left ALBY, fruitlessly scanning the Vines above
dialog: them.
dialog: They're about to give up when...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: There!
text: MINHO looks to where THOMAS is pointing. ALBY’S foot is
text: barely visible through the vegetation. But it’s still.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: At least it didn’t drag away his
dialog: body.
dialog: Then, from above...
speaker_heading: ___ ALBY
dialog: (faint)
dialog: Min...
text: MINHO looks at THOMAS. He can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Alby!
text: And MINHO starts climbing...
scene_heading: EXT. EAST GATE - THE GLADE - MORNING
text: The Wall’s bolts retract, and they slowly split open,
dialog: revealing...

text: barely conscious.
text: GALLY is waiting just inside the Glade, along with NEWT,
text: ATLAS, CLINT and the other RUNNERS.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: I don’t believe it...
text: The RUNNERS rush to help carry ALBY.
text: They lay ALBY down and gather around. CLINT approaches
text: carrying a strange CRYSTAL TUBE...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: He’s not stung. You can put away
dialog: the Serum.
text: CLINT nods and slides the tube back into his satchel. He
text: kneels and examines ALBY...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 27.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: The cut’s not as bad as it looks,
dialog: but we gotta get him to a bed...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: (to Aron)
dialog: You heard him!
text: ARON, still steaming from the altercation the night before,
text: makes a point of first looking to MINHO, who nods his assent.
text: Only then do the RUNNERS begin loading ALBY onto a stretcher.
speaker_heading: MINHO
text: When he’s settled, regroup in the
dialog: Map Room.
text: As the RUNNERS lift ALBY and begin carrying him off, CLINT
text: passes THOMAS who stands dazed, unsure what to do.
speaker_heading: CLINT
text: Incredible. A night in the Maze.
dialog: And a Field Hand’s one of the first
dialog: to survive it...
text: THOMAS tries to smile, appreciative. And then...
text: GALLY signals NEWT, who roughly grabs THOMAS by the arm...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Hey!
text: ...drawing MINHO’s attention...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: What are you doing?
text: GALLY starts limping away, no interest in arguing.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: He violated the Laws and entered
dialog: the Maze.
dialog: (to Thomas)
dialog: You're going to the Pit until we
dialog: decide what to do with you.
dialog: MINHO can’t believe it...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: After what happened out there? He
dialog: saved Alby’s life!
text: GALLY stops to face MINHO...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: I'm calling the shots right now.
dialog: And the Laws will be enforced. For

dialog: You're all too arrogant to see

speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: I remember what you did in the

dialog: starting to think the guys are
dialog: right. “You belong in an asylum.

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Please! Both of you!

text: GALLY...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: You don’t trust me for some reason.
dialog: Fine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Then I assume you won't care if I

speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to be a Runner.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - THE GLADE - LATER
text: A cell door slams shut on THOMAS. He watches as NEWT
text: disappears down the corridor, then looks around at_the other,
text: empty cells ringing this small cavern deep in the Pit.
text: At the very back of the room, THOMAS notices an enclosure
text: that looks different. Behind two layers of extra-thick
text: fencing, stacked side-by-side...
text: More of those CRYSTAL TUBES CLINT was carrying.
text: THOMAS stares at the crystal, and for a brief moment, as the
text: candlelight falls at the right angle, he catches a glimpse of
text: his own fractured reflection.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 29.
text: He shifts position, trying t to © recapture his first distorted

dialog: How’d you get in here?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Told the guard I screwed up and
dialog: drew clean-up duty.
dialog: (beat, with a smile)
dialog: He believéd me.
text: THOMAS also smiles. CHUCK slides the food through the bars
text: and sits down in the hallway. As THOMAS digs in, starving...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Thanks. Those things I said,
dialog: yesterday --
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You were blowing off steam. That’s

dialog: So? What was it like? From the

dialog: What could we have done to get this

speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: As you can see, it’s a simple
dialog: arrangement, everyone doing their
dialog: part to keep the place functioning.
text: THERESA looks around, taking it all in, and trying to avoid
text: eye-contact with the few passing GLADERS who stop to gawk at
dialog: her.

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Keeping this many guys under

speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Third month, I’m walking near the

text: Killed in a brawl between two

text: THERESA blanches...
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I got organized, put an_end to

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: And now I show up...

dialog: One big distraction.
text: Before ALBY can reassure her, she reaches out, putting a hand
text: on his arm.
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you for helping me.

dialog: contact.
text: THERESA thinks a moment. Then...
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D
dialog: Not sure how much use I'll be in
dialog: the fields but you said there are

scene_heading: INT. MAP ROOM - THE GLADE

speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: These are all different sections of
dialog: the Maze, on the same da We line

dialog: hopefully an exit...
text: THERESA is fascinated by the images before her, running her

dialog: familiar.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You mind if I stay here for a
dialog: while?
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: I've studied these for years. I

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I didn’t mean that... But this

scene_heading: EXT. GRASSLANDS CORRIDOR - THE MAZE - DAY
text: THOMAS and MINHO have stopped for a quick water break inside
text: a grassy corridor. They are mid-argument...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I’m telling you we should go back
dialog: to the cave. There could be
dialog: something inside there!
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Yeah, I’m guessing two giant

scene_heading: INT. MAP ROOM - THE GLADE
text: THERESA stands at the center table, which is now crowded with
text: parchment scrolls spread all over. She runs her hand through
text: er hair, and sits back on a stool, overwhelmed.
text: ALBY knocks and enters...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Ready to give up?
text: THERESA smiles...
text: A breeze blows through the open door and sends some of the
text: maps floating off the table.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I’m so sorry...
text: THERESA kneels to collect them and ALBY rushes over to help
dialog: her...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Don’t worry. They’re all
dialog: labeled...
dialog: But THERESA has stopped gotiecting them. The one parchment
text: she’s holding is caught in the late afternoon sunlight,
text: rendering it nearly translucent.
text: THERESA stands up slowly, lost in thought. She lays the
text: parchment on top of another map on the table. Some of the
text: ines match in both versions, forming thicker sections when
text: the two maps are held together.
text: THERESA concentrates intensely. ALBY rises beside her...
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you remembering something else?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Not exactly...
text: Then, there’s another knock. It’s NEWT...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: We have a problem. The Box rose,

speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: NEWT
text: It’s completely empty. No storage

speaker_heading: ZACK ;

speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: C’mon Zack...Alby’s gonna know what

speaker_heading: ZACK

speaker_heading: ALBY (0.S.)
text: There’s less than a quarter tank in

speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Which is why I’ve kept a reserve.

speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 53.
speaker_heading: ALBY (CONT'D)
dialog: That, plus what’s left in the

text: The MOB takes this like a punch in the gut.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: So that’s where all your Laws led
dialog: us...Starved like dogs!
text: THOMAS and MINHO now come upon the edge of the gathering, as
text: the MOB grows louder...
speaker_heading: ZACK (CONT'D)
dialog: You've been lying to us from the
dialog: start!
text: MINHO moves closer to the action. THOMAS is about follow

speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: It’s not his fault!

speaker_heading: GALLY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. MAP ROOM - THE GLADE
text: THOMAS jogs up to the Map Room, where one BAGGER stands by

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: They need you at the Homestead.
speaker_heading: BAGGER
dialog: But... Alby said to watch the girl--
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. MAP ROOM - THE GLADE

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You..

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Please. We need to talk.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Where’s the guard? Alby said --
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Theresa... I’m sorry.
text: THERESA stops retreating but is still skeptical...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not sure how... But you were
dialog: right.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I do know you.
text: His admission sinks in for both of them. THERESA waits for

speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: When they pulled you out of the
dialog: Box...I realized right awa In

dialog: (beat)
dialog: I might have seen where we come
dialog: from.
text: THERESA can’t believe what she’s hearing...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: What? Where???
dialog: THOMAS finally wants to get it all out...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (rambling)
dialog: It’s not that simple. We were just
dialog: little kids, but I think I saw your
dialog: mother. And my father. Something
dialog: was wrong and we were going away...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You’re not making any sense...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I know. None of it does. And
dialog: before you woke up. I heard your
dialog: voice in my head. It’s like our

text: His rambling only makes her confused, angry...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Our minds... Like telepathy?
dialog: beat
dialog: that!e eSnpossible. I don’t

text: He’s stopped. And then she realizes...
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT'D)
dialog: Yesterday, why didn’t you just say
dialog: something???
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We can’t tell them yet. It’s too
dialog: dangerous.
text: Now, she’s really shocked.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Dangerous??
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We don’t even know what it means...
dialog: They ve been here three years and
dialog: not. ing changes. Then, we show up
dialog: and it’s all falling apart!
dialog: 55.
text: THOMAS stops, takes a breath. Takes a few steps closer to
text: THERESA. With a softer tone...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s a guy outside right now,
dialog: Gally, trying to convince them it’s
dialog: our fault there’s no more water.
dialog: That we’re the reason their world
text: is crumbling around them.
text: This gets THERESA’s attention. Slowly realizing THOMAS’
dialog: may be justified...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: We need to do something...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: That's why I’m here... To see if we
dialog: can o disc out what’s happening.
dialog: If we discover anything useful, I
dialog: promise we’ll come clean. But
dialog: until then, we have to keep quiet.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You mean lie.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: If we need to, yes.

speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Alby may seem like a good guy but

speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, you have to trust me.
text: A long beat, then...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: So, how do we do this?
text: THOMAS breathes a sigh of grateful relief.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I don’t know. Do you remember
dialog: anything more than my name?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Just that. But there’s something
dialog: about the Glade...I was scared at
dialog: first, but I should still _be curled
dialog: ye in a corner weeping. Except, I
dialog: eel...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Comfortable.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Me too...Out in the Maze, it’s like
dialog: I've seen it before.
text: A moment, then THERESA beckons THOMAS closer to her...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Take a look at this...
text: THOMAS moves around the table, next to THERESA where he can
text: see her piles of maps laid out side-by-side.
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT'D)
dialog: So far I’ve only had time to study
dialog: this one section. I realized on
dialog: any given night, only a few of the
dialog: 1s move...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: They know that.
text: THERESA gives him an eye...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Right. But I don’t think they
dialog: realize there’s a pattern.
dialog: 57.
text: Now, THOMAS is interested. THERESA picks up the first pile
dialog: she’s assembled...
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D)
text: These are maps of a desert section,
dialog: every’ 7th gay: They’re all
dialog: slightly different, except for a
dialog: few of the Walls which a ways
text: return to the same position.
text: THERESA compresses the pages together, and holds them up to
text: the light. The recurring walls are bolder than the rest...
text: Revealing a Runic symbol.
text: THERESA registers THOMAS’ amazement...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I’m not sure. But all these years,
text: the Maze has been speaking to them.
dialog: Each section painting out some kind
dialog: of message.
text: THOMAS and THERESA stand close together, a charged moment,
text: taking in her discovery.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Amazing...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: It shouldn't take long to find the
dialog: other symbols.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: But what do we do with them?
text: THOMAS and THERESA slowly look up from the maps and study
dialog: each other. Then...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Catching up on old times?
text: ALBY is in the doorway, along with MINHO. ALBY looks
text: haggard, angry. MINHO, exhausted. An awkward beat of
dialog: ilence, then...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: C’mon Thomas, we gotta brief the
dialog: others...
text: Off THOMAS’ look of confusion...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: After listening to Gally, at least
dialog: half the Glade wanted you Banished.
text: Forced out into the Maze alone
dialog: tonight. Sacrificed to the
dialog: Griever.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Then I_told them about the cave and
dialog: your plan to attack it.
dialog: Now THOMAS is really freaked...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Min, you said yourself, even if we
dialog: can draw them out, we have no idea--
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Save it. We’re out of options.
text: ALBY stares at THOMAS...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: I hope you find something. If you
dialog: come up empty tomorrow, there’s
dialog: nothing more I can do. You're
dialog: finished.
text: THERESA looks at THOMAS, who stands afraid, despondent. He

text: the size of an airplane hanger...
text: The ground is solid cement, but the sloping rock walls are a

dialog: ceiling. This is a hive.
text: And, at the far end of the cavern, too far to make out any

speaker_heading: JAYSON
dialog: Took a wrong turn. My bad.

text: JAYSON understands his predicament -- there’s no way for him
dialog: to get past the creatures.
speaker_heading: JAYSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Much luck, boys. We had a good

dialog: But MINHO’s out of patience...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Even if we could get past all those

speaker_heading: NIGHT.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 65.

scene_heading: INT. STUDY - ALBY’S DWELLING
text: THOMAS faces ALBY and MINHO, his confidence shattered.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I’m sorry guys. I really thought
dialog: we were onto something.
text: Before either of them can answer, they’re interrupted by the

text: ALBY approaches the window, THOMAS and MINHO close behind
dialog: him...
scene_heading: EXT. ALBY’S CLEARING - THE GLADE - NIGHT
text: ALBY, THOMAS, and MINHO look down into the clearing where
text: most of the GLADERS have gathered.
text: At the front of the mob is GALLY.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: The Walls didn’t close, Alby.
dialog: Whatever Thomas did out there, the
text: Maze and the Glade are one now.
text: ALBY absorbs the news.
speaker_heading: GALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Soon the Grievers will be here.
dialog: Weeks have become days. For some
dialog: of us, only hours.
text: ALBY tries to project command of the situation...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Listen to me! All of you! We’1l
dialog: barricade the Homestead. Fight
dialog: them off from the trees...
text: The GLADERS are silent, terrified, already defeated.
text: THOMAS spots CHUCK in the crowd, his face streaked with
text: tears, pale white.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: I warned you not to provoke them!
dialog: Now they'll kill every last one of
dialog: us!
text: ALBY scans the hopeless crowd...
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: You want to lie down?! You’re
dialog: Gladers! You’re men! If we must
dialog: die, then die like men!
text: No one will make eye contact. His exhortation falls totally
dialog: flat.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: You've delivered us all to the
dialog: slaughter.
dialog: ALBY makes one last bid to preserve his authority...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Have you all forgotten what I’ve
dialog: done for you? You think I wanted
dialog: this burden? I did it for you!
dialog: Together, we’ve risen to every
dialog: challenge! And we can rise to this
dialog: one!
text: But now, the final blow...He spots NEWT, standing with the
text: crowd, right beside GALLY.
text: As ALBY’s face registers his shock at the betrayal, NEWT
text: looks up, remorseless...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: You're soft, Alby. That was always
dialog: your roblem.
dialog: eat)
dialog: I don! t know who_to believe
dialog: anymore, but if I’m going down
dialog: tonight, I’m going down with my
dialog: brothers.
text: Then, from behind him, NEWT pulls THERESA -- disheveled,
text: trembling -- and hands her over to GALLY.
text: GALLY, now totally unhinged, drags her forward, pointing up
text: at THOMAS...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: They must be cast out!
dialog: I've begged you to listen!
dialog: (beat )
dialog: But I’m done asking.
text: THERESA looks up at THOMAS, terrified.
text: A beat, as ALBY takes the measure of the crowd and realizes
text: he’s lost them. He turns to THOMAS...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: He’s right, you know. You've
dialog: brought nothing but disaster.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 67.
scene_heading: EXT. ALBY’S CLEARING - THE GLADE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Led by GALLY, NEWT and a crew of BAGGERS hauls THOMAS and
text: THERESA out of the clearing, through the shouting, heckling
dialog: CROWD...
text: CHUCK is running alongside them, shouting at NEWT...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You can’t do this!!
text: Until one of the BAGGERS violently shoves him to the ground.
text: Then, THOMAS spots MINHO and the other RUNNERS heatedly
dialog: arguing.
text: MINHO is about to step forward into GALLY’S path, who braces
dialog: himself for a confrontation.
text: But THOMAS looks MINHO in the eye.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Don’t. The Glade needs you. Save
dialog: as many of them as you can.

speaker_heading: THOMAS and THERESA.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PIT - THE GLADE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: THOMAS

dialog: I won’t let anything happen...
speaker_heading: THERESA

speaker_heading: GALLY

scene_heading: EXT. WEST GATE - THE GLADE - NIGHT
text: MINHO stands watch by the open West gate. He’s pacing with a
text: plant and cross-bow strapped across his back. A lit torch is
text: anted in the ground, uminating the first few feet of the
dialog: Maze. ee
text: MINHO stops. The low rumble of what sounds like an oncoming
text: train is approaching.
text: PRELAP... a CLANGING BELL, as...
scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM
text: THERESA sits on the edge of a cot, in a dark, windowless
text: room, somewhere in the Glade. She stands, startled.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - THE GLADE
text: THOMAS also hears it. He gets up from the tiny cot in his
text: cell and strains to look down the empty hallway...
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD CLEARING - THE GLADE
text: MINHO, ARON, and TIM converge from all directions in the
text: Homestead Clearing, which is totally abandoned.
text: NEWT walks out of the trees to greet them...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Gally?
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Wanted to ride it out with his

speaker_heading: MINHO nods.
speaker_heading: NEWT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MINHO

scene_heading: EXT. NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, & WEST GATES - THE GLADE
text: QUICK CUTS... Long lines of glistening GRIEVERS barrelling
text: out of the Maze and into the Glade...
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE - THE GLADE
text: Pure chaos as all the GLADERS crowd into a central cluster of
text: three large tree-houses, connected by elevated walkways.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 69.
text: MINHO is the last to climb up, and NEWT pulls up the ladder
dialog: after him.
text: The BAGGERS and RUNNERS are spreading out along the walkways,
text: armed with a combination of spears, cross-bows, and clubs.
text: Mixed among them are ZACK and several FIELD HANDS,
text: brandishing their tools as weapons. Even WINSTON the cook is
text: wielding a butcher’s knife.
text: ALBY takes it all in, clearly sidelined, as CLINT approaches,
text: struggling under the weight of a large Satchel. He Opens it
text: to reveal the CRYSTAL TUBES that contain the Serum.
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: What little that’s left...
text: ALBY nods, then turns to look inside one of the tree-
dialog: houses...
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL TREE HOUSE - HOMESTEAD GROVE - THE GLADE
dialog: -Twenty of the youngest GLADERS, including CHUCK, are
text: huddled in the crowded space. They look up at ALBY, sheer

text: ALBY offers a half-hearted nod of assurance, and closes the
dialog: loor.
scene_heading: EXT. EASTERN FIELDS - THE GLADE
text: A long line of GRIEVERS tears through the Eastern Fields,

dialog: destruction...
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE - THE GLADE
text: MINHO, NEWT, and ALBY are side-by-side, waiting. ALBY is

text: MINH primed and ready.
text: And then, the CRACK, SNAP, and BOOM of nearby trees being
dialog: mowed down...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Let’s take a few of the bastards
dialog: with us.

scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM

dialog: louder...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 70.
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE - THE GLADE
text: As the mass of GRIEVERS crowd the base of the tree cluster...
text: A panicked ATLAS turns to NEWT.
speaker_heading: ATLAS
dialog: Now?
text: But NEWT hesitates. MINHO steps forward...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Only when they start to climb! Aim
dialog: for their eyes and their stomachs!
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - THE GLADE
text: THOMAS has flipped over the cot in his cell and is bracing
text: the frame against the wall, furiously trying to stomp it into
dialog: pieces. Then...
text: A SHRIEK... from down the hall, and he stomps one more
dialog: time...
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE - THE GLADE
text: ..-followed by a chorus of SHRIEKS as the front line of

speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Fire!
text: THWACK! THWACK! THWACK! THUCK! THUCK! THUCK! The GRIEVERS
dialog: absorb the arrows and...pause.
text: Then they begin to pulse, as the arrows are pushed back to
text: the surface of their skin.
text: As_ the last arrow is disgorged and drops to the forest floor

scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM
text: THERESA is crouched in the farthest corner from the door as

speaker_heading: THERESA (0.S.)
dialog: Help me!!!
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 71.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - THE GLADE
text: As THOMAS freezes in place. He’s nearly broken off the
text: longest piece of the cot’s frame, but now stands still.
text: He takes a breath, tries to focus...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Theresa, you’re doing it again...
scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM
text: THERESA’S face freezes in shock. She’s heard him. She
dialog: concentrates...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Thomas?
speaker_heading: THOMAS (0.S.)
dialog: It’s me...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: How can I hear you?
speaker_heading: THOMAS (0.S.)
dialog: This is what I was talking about!
dialog: It’s some kind of telepathy! Where
dialog: did they take you?
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I don’t know... There was a dead
dialog: tree --
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - THE GLADE
text: Her voice trails off in THOMAS’ head...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Theresa???
dialog: Now frantic..
speaker_heading: THERESA (0.S.)
dialog: Hurry!
text: THOMAS turns back to the cot and delivers one last
text: devastating kick, finally shattering it.
text: THOMAS picks up the longest piece of the cot’s frame, a long
dialog: wooden rod, just as...
text: A GRIEVER slithers in front of the cell, facing him.
text: THOMAS is inches from the beast, and for a moment, they
text: simply stare at each other. Then...
text: The GRIEVER lunges forward, breaking through the bars of the
text: cell, and sending THOMAS slamming into the wall behind him.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 72.
text: The GRIEVER’S mouth opens...and SNAP...its STINGER shoots
text: forward, which THOMAS deflects with the rod, sending it into
text: the rock wall, inches from his body.
text: The GRIEVER quickly tries to retract the STINGER, but it
text: won't budge, the barbed tip stuck in place.
text: THOMAS spins off the wall, raises the rod above his head, and
text: brings it down ina crushing blow, which SNAPS the STINGER
text: right in the middle...
text: As the GRIEVER lets out a ROAR of agony, THOMAS sprints by
dialog: it...
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE
text: The tree cluster is now covered in climbing GRIEVERS, several
text: nearly level with the walkways...
text: MINHO races to where the first GRIEVER is about to overtake a
text: BAGGER, who's clubbing it to no avail...
text: MINHO arrives Just as the GRIEVER’S STINGER rockets up,
text: stabbing the BAGGER right through the forehead...
text: As the BAGGER collapses, the GRIEVER pulls itself up onto the
text: walkway, exposing it’s belly for a split second...
text: Which MINHO ferociously IMPALES with his spear. He drops his
text: shoulder and lunges forward, sending the GRIEVER flying...
text: MINHO watches in pappy disbelief as the GRIEVER crashes to
text: the forest floor below. He looks to his left, and sees...
text: NEWT has witnessed the move...and quickly repeats
text: it...sending another GRIEVER hurling to the ground...
text: MINHO looks to his right and sees...
text: ADBY completely still amidst the madness, his expression
dialog: lan!
text: Then, that awful RUMBLE again, and the GRIEVERS below part to
dialog: let through...
text: A barreling onslaught of rolling GRIEVERS, which collide with
text: the base of the trees, sending splinters o£ wood exploding
dialog: into the air...
text: The walkways heave...and a BAGGER loses his footing,
text: plummeting into the seething creatures below.
text: Then, the next GRIEVER impacts, and the tree sways...
scene_heading: EXT. GALLY’S GROVE
text: THOMAS races across the field toward Gally’s Grove...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 73.
text: The overturned tree’s massive tangle of roots has been
text: obliterated -- a round tunnel carved right through it,
text: exactly the shape of a rolling GRIEVER...
text: THOMAS slows slightly, then bounds through it...
scene_heading: EXT. GALLY’S CLEARING
text: ...emerging into GALLY’S clearing, where...
text: The barricades are all overturned, and the shelter lies in a
text: heap of rubble. Several bodies -- dressed in the rags of the
text: CHANGED BOYS -- are scattered amidst the wreckage. But no
text: sign of THERESA.
text: Then, from the trees to his right... a SHRIEK. THOMAS spots
text: a barely visible path and takes off toward it...
scene_heading: EXT. STABLES PATH
text: py gronning past the bodies of three more CHANGED BOYS, laying
text: flat on their stomachs, mowed down from behind.
text: Suddenly SOMETHING dashes out of the trees cutting him off.
text: It’s one of the SHEEP from the GLADE’S small herd, which
text: BLEATS, before disappearing...
text: Ahead, THOMAS can see the Stables...
scene_heading: INT. THE STABLES
text: «+-a long building with a central hallway lined with paddocks
dialog: for the various animals.
text: THOMAS enters. Down the hall to his left, he hears movement
text: in the darkness. He sprints right, past empty paddocks until
text: spotting a fully enclosed room in the back corner.
text: He opens his mouth to shout, when, from inside the room...
scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Thomas!
text: THERESA leaps up just as...
text: THOMAS bursts through the door.
text: THERESA embraces him.
text: A beat, then... SHRIEK!... and THOMAS grabs her hand...
dialog: *
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Let’s get out of here.
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE
text: The central tree cluster buckles one last time under the
text: relentless assault of the GRIEVERS and slowly begins to
dialog: topple...
scene_heading: INT. CENTRAL TREE HOUSE

dialog: entire structure...
scene_heading: EXT. HOMESTEAD GROVE
text: ++.goes crashing to the ground, sending the GRIEVERS
dialog: scattering.
text: All is still for a moment, then...
text: FOCUS ON...CHUCK, bleeding badly from his head, trying
text: desperately to lift a piece of wood that has him pinned
dialog: own...
text: Nearby, CLINT, dazed, is scrambling to collect the CRYSTAL
text: TUBES, several of which have fallen out of his satchel...
text: BACK TO.. CHUCK, who gives the wood plank one last push, but
text: it doesn’ t budge, and he closes his eyes, fading into
dialog: oblivion.
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Get up!
text: MINHO, lifting the debris, is standing over him, watching
text: several nearby GRIEVERS now slowly retreating back through
dialog: the forest...
text: Across the clearing...
text: ALBY stands frozen amidst the mayhem. Fallen torches have
text: ignited brush fires all around him, and he stares off into
text: t e@ near distance where the Cook Shed and tables are also
dialog: burning...
text: Then, ALBY turns and sees MINHO. They lock eyes, and MINHO
text: calls out to him...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT'D)
dialog: Alby!!!
text: But ALBY’S face makes it clear he’s already surrendered. He
text: ignores MINHO and walks toward the fires.
dialog: 75.
text: MINHO watches his old friend disappear and takes off with
dialog: CHUCK toward safety...
scene_heading: INT. STABLES
text: THOMAS and THERESA race back down the Stable’s central
dialog: Hallway.
text: They are about to run out the exit when, from the opposite
dialog: end of the building...
speaker_heading: GALLY (0.S.)
dialog: No!!!
text: -.-followed by another SHRIEK,..and, then BOOM!...a paddock
text: door is blown clear off its hinges.
text: THOMAS and THERESA pause. THOMAS thinks, then pulls
text: THERESA’s arm to continue moving. She stands firm.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: He wants us dead!
text: THERESA still doesn’t move. Off her look...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Fine! But you stay here.
dialog: She ignores that also...
text: THOMAS moves down the dark Hallway, THERESA a few steps
text: behind him, until they can_see the GRIEVER slowing forcing
text: GALLY back against the wall.
text: THOMAS looks around frantically, and picks up a three-pronged
text: HAY FORK lying on the ground.
text: THOMAS stops ten feet behind the GRIEVER. GALLY now sees him
text: and stares in disbelief.
speaker_heading: why? GALLY
dialog: ly?
text: The GRIEVER spins to face THOMAS...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I’m not what you think I am!
text: .--and starts inching toward him.
text: THOMAS suddenly lunges and STABS the GRIEVER directly between
text: its S, glowing red eyes, embedding the HAY FORK deep in its
text: The GRIEVER SHRIEKS in agony...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Cc’mon!
dialog: 76.
text: .--allowing GALLY to slide past it and regroup behind THOMAS.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Take the girl and get out of here!
text: GALLY hesitates a moment, then looks at THERESA...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: I won’t harm you.
text: GALLY and THERESA start moving more quickly toward the exit,
text: THERESA keeping an eye on THOMAS who’s backing away slowly,
text: trying to keep the GRIEVER’S attention.
text: Suddenly, the GRIEVER swings the still-protruding handle of
text: the HAY FORK at THOMAS... catapulting him into the closest
text: paddock.
text: The GRIEVER turns into the paddock, bearing down on THOMAS,
text: who's trapped, gasping for air, and struggling to stand. The
text: GRIEVER is about to pounce on him, when...
text: SLAM!...THERESA pounds it with a shovel...drawing it away...
text: The GRIEVER turns, rolls up and barrels after her, as she
text: sprints down the Hallway...
text: Just as the GRIEVER is about to overtake THERESA, she
text: suddenly leaps back-and-forth between the walls on either
text: side, grabbing onto a rafter as the creature rumbles past
text: beneath her...
text: THOMAS emerges from the paddock in time to see THERESA
text: complete an acrobatic flip off the ceiling beam, dropping to
text: the floor in a perfect landing.
text: Off THOMAS’ look of disbelief, THERESA calmly stands up and
text: together they race outside.
scene_heading: EXT. MAP ROOM - THE GLADE
text: MINHO and NEWT lead a dazed mob of two dozen GLADERS, CHUCK

scene_heading: EXT. EASTERN FIELDS - THE GLADE

speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: We rest here.

speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: Treat the stung, first. Then the
dialog: others.
text: CLINT nods. As he moves off into the crowd of walking
dialog: wounded...
speaker_heading: CLINT (0.S.)
dialog: Anyone need the Serum?!
text: NEWT approaches MINHO...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Sitting ducks out here. They
dialog: backed off for no reason, no
text: telling when they’1l come back.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: We collect whatever water we can
dialog: can from the aqueducts. Then, I
dialog: don’t know... I guess we keep
dialog: moving.
text: Before NEWT can reply, THOMAS, THERESA, and GALLY emerge --
text: together -- from another section of trees.
text: MINHO and NEWT stand, stunned, as the group walks toward
text: them. THOMAS surveys the small battered group of remaining
dialog: GLADERS...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: The others?
text: By the look on MINHO’s face, THOMAS knows the answer.
text: THOMAS turns back to the survivors...WINSTON is applyin
text: pressure to another BOY’S bleeding leg, and ATLAS is helping
text: ashion a splint, while CLINT scurries among them. But
text: there's no sign of ZACK, ARON, TIM and so many other familiar *
dialog: aces.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Alby...
text: MINHO shakes his head, his eyes glistening as the anguish
text: overtakes him.
text: THOMAS finally spots CHUCK sitting up, alone in the crowd.
text: His clothes are torn and he’s holding his sleeve to his own *
text: wounded head.
text: THOMAS turns to THERESA...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: That boy over there, by himself...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I see him.
text: THERESA jogs over to CHUCK, kneeling beside him.
dialog: 78.
text: NEWT is now simmering, about to challenge THOMAS, but THOMAS
dialog: preempts him...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Gally was right.
dialog: (beat
dialog: She and I are different. We can do
dialog: things I can’t explain. And before
dialog: the Glade, we knew each other.
text: GALLY says nothing. NEWT and MINHO are shocked...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: You have memories?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Just a glimpse of the world we came
dialog: from...
dialog: MINHO can’t believe this...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Nothing useful. Nothing that will
dialog: help us get out of here.
text: They continue staring at him, expectantly...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
text: There was ash falling from the sky.
dialog: People were scared. And my father.
dialog: He was sending me someplace...
text: He trails off as the others absorb this. And then, NEWT
text: snaps, gesturing at the carnage...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: You’re the only one who remembers a
dialog: god damn thing, and you still want
dialog: us to believe you had nothing to do
dialog: with this?
text: THOMAS sees THERESA is walking back toward them.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Just wait... Let us show you.
dialog: (to Theresa)
dialog: You have it?
text: THERESA nods and hands over a sheet of paper which THOMAS
text: unfolds.
text: On the page is a sketch of the Maze -- a circle Theresa has
text: divided into six wedges, like slices of a pie. Inside each
dialog: wedge is a Runic Symbol" Five are clear, complete, and one is
dialog: half-formed...
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 79.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: The Maze wasn’t moving to change up
dialog: the routes. It was forming these
dialog: ols. Theresa found them. The
dialog: last one’s incomplete because the
dialog: grassland maps aren’t finished...
text: As MINHO, GALLY, and NEWT take it in...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re on your side. I don’t know
dialog: how else to prove it.
text: A beat, and then, matter-of-fact...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: You may be now. But there’s a
dialog: reason you're different. I’m sure
dialog: of it.
text: Now it’s MINHO’s turn to snap, his frustration with GALLY
dialog: boiling over...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: It’s always the same, isn’t it?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Even if what you’re saying about
dialog: him is true, what good is it? What
dialog: the hell’s he supposed to do about
dialog: it?
text: GALLY’S calm, silent. And so is THOMAS. A long beat as he
text: makes a decision.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (to Minho)
dialog: I can go through the Changing.
text: MINHO and THERESA look at THOMAS in disbelief...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: That’s insane --
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Thomas...
text: But THOMAS cuts them off...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: If Gally’s right, it could bring
dialog: back the rest of my memory.
dialog: There’s a chance I’1l remember
dialog: something we’ve all been missing.
text: THERESA can’t believe what she’s hearing...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: And what if he’s wrong? Please,
dialog: Thomas...You can’t do this.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: What if you see nothing and wake up
dialog: a zombie?
text: Now, NEWT interjects...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: I say it’s the least he can do.
dialog: And don’t care if it kills him.
text: MINHO ignores him, focused on THOMAS...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: I’m sorry I let them lock You UP,
dialog: but you don’t have to do this!
dialog: know who you are...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: So do I, Min. I’m a Glader.
dialog: (beat) .
dialog: A Maze Runner. And escape is all
dialog: that matters.
text: A beat, as THOMAS’ resolve sinks in. THERESA turns away from
dialog: him.
text: NEWT looks up at the sky which is beginning to lighten...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Where to? Can’t stick around here
dialog: much longer.
speaker_heading: MINHO
text: The Maze. More places to disappear
dialog: if we need to.
text: MINHO turns back to THOMAS...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: You can’t just walk up to one,
dialog: hoping it stings you...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I have an idea.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: And the hours of pain and
dialog: torment...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Gally will help me through it.

dialog: there’s no more use arguing.
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - THE GLADE
text: THOMAS enters his old cell. He approaches the spot where the
text: GRIEVER’S STINGER was embedded in the rock wall and carefully
text: removes a still glistening needle.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE CORRIDOR - THE MAZE - MORNING
text: The surviving GLADERS march through the Maze, THOMAS and
text: MINHO in the lead. NEWT and ATLAS guard the rear, while
text: THERESA and CLINT help along the most severely wounded.
text: The GLADERS, inside the Maze for the first time, stare in awe
text: at its massive Walls and endless corridors.
text: Only GALLY, limping along, keeps his eyes down, blocking out
dialog: his surroundings...
scene_heading: EXT. MAZE REFUGE - THE MAZE
text: They finally arrive at a large circular room in the
text: Grasslands, with four passages leading off in the cardinal
text: directions. As THOMAS looks around...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Good chance they won’t find us
dialog: here. At least, not for a while.
dialog: If they do, we’ ve got options.
text: The others spread out, finding soft spots on the mossy
text: ground. THERESA approaches WINSTON...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Water now. I think most of them
dialog: can hold out on food for another
dialog: few hours.
text: MINHO, still beside THOMAS, points to one of the passages...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: That’s a dead end.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t think the others should see-
text: He trails off...
text: THOMAS nods. MINHO takes one last look at him and turns to
text: NEWT...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: C'mon. Let’s work out a watch
dialog: schedule.
text: Now GALLY approaches...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: The process can take hours...
text: THOMAS surveys the GLADERS, lingering on THERESA, who’s busy
text: passing a canteen.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Let’s get started.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: EXT. CHANGING CHAMBER - THE MAZE
text: The Walls of the Maze form a small, square room, where GALLY
text: is driving the last of four spikes into the ground, at the
text: corners of a blanket. Each spike is attached to a rope that
dialog: will tie down THOMAS’ hands and ankles...
text: A CRYSTAL TUBE of SERUM is laid out on a rag, alongside the
text: Griever’s STINGER.
text: THOMAS watches as GALLY finishes...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: What’s it like? Really...
text: GALLY looks up at him.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: You're wondering if it’s worse than
dialog: death
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your own?’ Definitely.
text: THOMAS turns away. Then...
speaker_heading: GALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: But, worse than watching your
dialog: friénds slaughtered? Men you've
dialog: lived beside and cared for? I
dialog: guess that depends on what kind of
dialog: man you are.
text: A beat as THOMAS absorbs GALLY’s words. Then...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: And, what if I’m not as strong as
dialog: you?
text: GALLY thinks, and for a moment, seems to soften.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Strength comes from purpose.
dialog: eat)
dialog: Alby knew that_better than anyone.
dialog: It’s why we followed him. Loved
dialog: him. At least why I did.
text: Suddenly, THERESA emerges at the threshold of the room...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Can I have a minute?
text: GALLY gives THOMAS one last look, his face pained and hard
text: again, before he exits.
text: THERESA sees the spikes in the ground and, under her
dialog: breath...
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D)
dialog: Looks cozy...
dialog: 83.
text: THOMAS is not sure what to say.
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D)
dialog: What are you hoping to see,
dialog: exactly?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: A big ‘Exit’ sign too much to ask
dialog: for?
text: She doesn’t even smile.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Don’t do it Thomas.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There’s no guarantee it’1l help,
dialog: and you could lose your mind like
dialog: the rest of them. Best case,
dialog: you'll end up like Gally!
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I don’t know...The whole bitter
dialog: lunatic vibe is growing on me.
text: THERESA begins to tremble, and he realizes how upset she
dialog: is...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to--
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: We can hear each other’s thoughts
dialog: Thomas! That means something! If
dialog: you do this, we might never find
dialog: out how, or why...
text: THOMAS can’t bring himself to lie and reassure her. He looks
dialog: at the ground...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I have to try. This is bigger than
dialog: us. Those guys out there are
dialog: counting on me.
text: She steps closer. THOMAS looks up at her..
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: If I lose you, I’1ll lose the only
dialog: real thing that’s left in me.
dialog: From THERESA’S searching brown eyes we...

dialog: 84.
text: THERESA’S POV this time, Jooking out on the street below,
text: where a young THOMAS stands amidst a gentle shower of white

text: THERESA presses her hand to the window, reaching out to her
dialog: best friend, her soulmate, as we...
scene_heading: FLASH BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CHANGING CHAMBER - THE MAZE
text: THOMAS, now directly in front of her, their faces inches

speaker_heading: THOMAS (V.O.)
dialog: What did you see?
dialog: And neither do her's...
speaker_heading: THERESA (V.O.)
dialog: Tom... I saw you.
text: And they KISS, with the combined passion of both the first
dialog: and what-could-be the last time.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I feel like I was sent here for a
dialog: reason. To stop you from doing
dialog: this...
text: For a beat, it looks like THOMAS might cave. But then...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I lost you once before and still
dialog: managed to find you. Here, in the
dialog: worst place imaginable. I'’11 find
dialog: you again. I promise.
text: THERESA backs away, devastated.
scene_heading: EXT. CHANGING CHAMBER - THE MAZE - LATER
text: THOMAS is on his back, tied to the stakes, a piece of wood
text: between his teeth to bite down on.
text: GALLY slowly slides the Griever stinger into the soft side of
text: THOMAS’ elbow, holding the needle in his flesh as the black
text: venom courses into him, darkening his veins as it spreads.
text: As THOMAS’ teeth clench, he throws his head to one side,
text: spitting out the wood in agony.
text: GALLY raises the molten, yellow Serum to his lips and THOMAS
text: devours it.
text: GALLY lays down the empty CRYSTAL TUBE. THOMAS turns to it,
text: and for the first time, can clearly see his own reflection.
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 85.
text: A beat as THOMAS stares at his own face, then...
text: THOMAS’ entire body spasms like he’s being electrocuted. His

dialog: sterile white laboratory...
text: A robotic arm swings into view, carrying one of the CRYSTAL
text: TUBES filled with the Serum. But this TUBE feeds a syringe
text: which is now inches from the creature’s flesh. The syringe
text: rimes itself...and a single drop of familiar yellow Fa id

text: audible sound...a soft, plaintive whimpering.
text: Finally, behind one of the largest trees, we find its source:

text: THOMAS’ POV...through a groggy haze: A gray sky. All around,
dialog: stone Walls rising {mpossib y high.
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 87.
text: THOMAS slowly sits up, unsteady, as his vision slowly comes
text: into focus. He sees GALLY approaching with a canteen of
dialog: water.
text: THOMAS’ voice is dry, cracking...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: They'll keep sending us. They’11
dialog: keep killing more kids til we solve
dialog: it.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZE REFUGE - THE MAZE - DUSK
text: The GLADERS are all hunkered down, some sleeping, others
text: leaning against the Walls, nervous, waiting.
text: CHUCK is studying a cross-bow, awkwardly pretending to aim
text: it. MINHO, NEWT, and ATLAS are each stationed at one of the
text: entrances to the room.
text: THERESA is seated by the passage to the dead end, keeping
text: vigil for THOMAS.
text: CHUCK lowers the crossbow, MINHO turns, and slowly everyone
text: stares as...
text: THOMAS steps into the circle, GALLY behind him. He bears the
text: mark of a terrible ordeal, his face more creased, like he’s
dialog: aged half-a-decade.
text: THERESA rushes to embrace him. But THOMAS stands stiff,
text: unsure how to react, as THERESA wraps her arms around him.
text: She steps back...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Thomas? Are you okay?
text: THOMAS looks in her eyes, but there’s no warmth in his
dialog: expression.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I’m fine.
text: He’s all business. THERESA, hurt and confused, moves away,
text: while THOMAS scans the room for CLINT.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT’D

dialog: There were twenty tubes that rose

dialog: guess now seven...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: You wanna get stung again? This is
dialog: ridiculous...
text: THOMAS turns to NEWT.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: The Serum counteracts the Griever
dialog: venom. It heals us. At least,
dialog: that’s how this group chose to use
dialog: it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But that’s not all it does...
dialog: MINHO’s beginning to understand...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: It counteracts the Griever venom...
text: THOMAS looks at him...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: For us, it’s medicine. For them,
dialog: it’s poison.
dialog: MINHO considers this...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Even if we can kill some of them,
dialog: that only keeps us alive a few days
dialog: longer...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We have to fight our way into the
dialog: Hive. The symbols are an access
dialog: code...the combination to open that
dialog: door.
dialog: (beat
dialog: We have five of the six. We’ll
dialog: have to get lucky on the last
dialog: one...
text: MINHO digests the difficulty of what THOMAS is proposing.
dialog: ATLAS doesn’t like one word of it...
speaker_heading: ATLA
dialog: Why should we believe you? You
dialog: could be leading us into a trap!
dialog: Making it easier for them to finish
dialog: us!
text: THOMAS is about to answer when GALLY steps forward.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Whoever Thomas once was, today he
dialog: saw the path to salvation. So,
dialog: let’s not waste it.
text: THOMAS turns to MINHO...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We can dip the spears and arrows,
dialog: but there’s only enough Serum to
dialog: arm a few of us.
text: MINHO nods, then turns to GALLY...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: You and Atlas hole up someplace
text: safe with the group. Thomas, Newt
dialog: and I will assault the Hive, try to
dialog: buy enough time to enter the code
dialog: somehow.
text: GALLY nods.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: When the door opens, we’ll come
dialog: back for everyone.
scene_heading: EXT. MAZE REFUGE - NIGHT
text: As the last light fades from the sky, CLINT pours a TUBE of
text: Serum into a bucket, as MINHO and NEWT carefully dip arrows,
text: laying them out to ary.
text: CLINT reaches back into the satchel for another TUBE, but
text: finds it’s empty...
speaker_heading: CLINT
dialog: There should be one more...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Must have gotten lost at the
dialog: Homestead...
text: GALLY wanders among the other _GLADERS, hel ing them strap on
text: packs of water and other supplies. Even A’ A goes from boy
text: to boy, offering words of encouragement.
text: CHUCK cautiously approaches THOMAS, who stands off to the
text: side, in quiet contemplation...
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Thomas?
text: THOMAS is forced, curt...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Hi, Chuck.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 90.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: You think we might really be going
dialog: home?
text: THOMAS nods, still distant...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: We're close. That I’m sure of.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I just really hope my parents
dialog: remember me.
text: THOMAS seems unsure what to do with the emotion. He looks at
text: CHUCK like he’s trying to recall what empathy feels like.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Whatever happens tonight, just be
dialog: careful.
text: CHUCK looks up at THOMAS waiting for more words of
text: encouragement. But he’s met only with awkward silence.
text: THOMAS walks away, now approaching THERESA, who’s helping
text: WINSTON pack up the last of the rations. She stands to
dialog: greet him...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Now you want to talk to me?
text: THOMAS is flat, matter-of-fact...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: There’s something you need to know.
text: Reluctantly, THERESA follows him...
scene_heading: EXT. CHANGING CHAMBER - THE MAZE
text: ...into a corner where they can be alone. She stares at him,
text: hurt and silent. THOMAS takes a breath and confesses...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You and I...We were here before.
dialog: With another group of kids. And
dialog: because of us, those kids are dead
dialog: now.
text: She gasps, absorbing the blow...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: The people who built the
dialog: Maze...They selected us. Separated
dialog: us from the others and gave
dialog: us...special skills.
dialog: We were too young to understand
dialog: anything. We must have thought it
dialog: was a game.
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 91.
text: THERESA looks like she’s going to be ill. But THOMAS shows
dialog: no compassion.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT’D)
dialog: We have a chance to get it right
dialog: now. But I need you to focus.
text: A long beat as THERESA remains silent, reeling. Then...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: You don’t feel anything for me
dialog: anymore, do you?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I don’t know Theresa. I just feel *
dialog: different. *
text: THERESA absorbs this.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I hope you’re right about *
dialog: everything. I hope it was worth *
dialog: it.
text: But, before she can walk away, THOMAS reaches out for her.
speaker_heading: THOMAS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BOULDER ROOM - THE MAZE - NIGHT
text: THOMAS, MINHO, and NEWT armed with poison-tipped cross-bows
text: and spears, are perched at the portal to the GRIEVER

text: disappearing down the ramp and out into the Maze...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Figure twenty minutes before they
text: realize the Glade’s empty, turn
text: back, and start hunting.
text: THOMAS nods his agreement. He looks down the mound of
text: boulders to the ground below, where THERESA, ATLAS and the *
text: remainder of the GLADERS are crowded together, hidden among
dialog: the rocks.
text: When THOMAS looks back up, MINHO’s taken off his armband...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT'D)
dialog: Lead Maze Runner’s always worn it.
text: Before he can object, MINHO grabs THOMAS’ arm and slides it
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 92.
text: For a beat THOMAS studies the band, absorbing both the honor
text: and the responsibility. Then, he looks back to MINHO...
speaker_heading: MINHO (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m right behind you.
scene_heading: EXT. GRIEVER CAVERN - NIGHT
text: THOMAS, MINHO, and NEWT walk slowly toward the now familiar
text: opening to the Griever Hive cavern. But as they approach,
text: 1 is quiet. MINHO and THOMAS trade looks.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Where’s the welcoming committee?
dialog: They keep moving...
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE CHAMBER - GRIEVER CAVERN
text: ...-into the entrance chamber, which is also empty. THOMAS
text: gestures toward the back and the Hive itself.
text: The three crowd around the opening and look inside...
scene_heading: INT. THE HIVE - GRIEVER CAVERN
text: ...where two dozen GRIEVERS pulsate throughout the cavernous
text: space. Most are clustered at the far end, near the steel
dialog: door.
text: NEWT looks at THOMAS.
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Don’t worry. If you’ re wrong about
dialog: this, Grievers won’t get you. 1/11
dialog: kill you myself.
text: THOMAS begins uncoiling a rope...
scene_heading: EXT. MAZE REFUGE - THE MAZE
text: GALLY and ATLAS stand watch, while THERESA huddles quietly
text: with the other GLADERS, tense, waiting...
text: Suddenly, a massive RUMBLING approaches...the sound of dozens
text: of GRIEVERS racing toward them...
text: THERESA stands up...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I thought we had more time...
text: .»..as GALLY turns back to the group...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: They’ve found us...

dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. THE HIVE - GRIEVER CAVERN
text: NEWT slowly lowers THOMAS into the chamber, while MINHO
text: stands alert, cross-bow at the ready...
text: THOMAS drops off the rope on the hard floor. Several of the
text: closest GRIEVERS spin to face him...
text: The nearest GRIEVER is about twenty feet away and now fast
text: approaching. From above...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: You want me to take him?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: No. I wanna do this up close.
text: The GRIEVER slithers forward.
scene_heading: EXT. GRASS CORRIDOR - THE MAZE
speaker_heading: GALLY
speaker_heading: FASTER!
text: GALLY pushes frantically through a corridor of grass stalks,
dialog: as every other step...
speaker_heading: SNAP!
text: ..-he uses his SPEAR to trigger a THORN TRAP.
text: Behind him THERESA and ATLAS do their best to herd along the
text: GLADERS. As they send along the last of the stragglers...
speaker_heading: SHRIEK!
text: THERESA and ATLAS look back to see...the GRASS behind them
dialog: parting...
text: And the GRIEVERS rolling toward them...
scene_heading: INT. THE HIVE - GRIEVER CAVERN
text: THOMAS, aiming his cross-bow, stares down the GRIEVER, now
text: ten feet away. He shouts up to MINHO and NEWT...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You_ever notice? These things
dialog: smell awful...
dialog: -..and fires...THWAP!
text: THUCK! The Serum-soaked arrow embeds in the GRIEVER’S flesh.
text: The GRIEVER stops moving and SHRIEKS...then begins slowly
text: pulsing, and...expels the arrow, which falls to the floor.
dialog: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 94,
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Great...
text: THOMAS can’t believe it. He starts back pedaling as the
text: GRIEVER continues at him...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: No...
text: And then...the GRIEVER once again STOPS. Its mouth opens
text: wide, and its STINGER shoots forward, stopping inches from
text: THOMAS’ face.
text: For a brief moment, THOMAS stares directly past the needle
text: into the GRIEVER'S glowing red eyes.
text: And, then, its gelatinous peae begins sinking into the floor,
text: dissolving into a bubbling dle of tar-like slime, its
text: solid STINGER finally crashing to the ground, a harmless
text: piece of debris.
text: A long beat as THOMAS, MINHO, and NEWT stare in disbelief at
text: the first dead GRIEVER they’ve ever seen.
text: Then, one-by-one, every other GRIEVER in the cavern turns to
text: face THOMAS and what’s left of their fallen comrade.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Looks like we got their attention.
scene_heading: EXT. STONE CORRIDOR - THE MAZE
text: The fleeing GLADERS now emerge into a bare Stone Corridor,
text: and GALLY pulls up short...at the edge of BREAKAWAY section.
dialog: From the rear...
speaker_heading: ATLAS
dialog: Why are you stopping?
text: GALLY looks down the corridor and sees a CHECKERBOARD of dark
text: patches, all the way to the end of it. THERESA comes up
dialog: eside him...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: What’s the problem?
text: GALLY stomps on the closest BREAKAWAY and it falls into the
text: abyss. THERESA stares horrified.
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D)
dialog: There has to be another way...
text: GALLY thinks a beat, then...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Send the word back -- everyone
dialog: follow my footsteps exactly!!
dialog: 95.
scene_heading: INT. THE HIVE - GRIEVER CAVERN
text: THOMAS stands facing the horde of GRIEVERS, MINHO and NEWT
text: now beside him. The creatures have crowded together, but
text: otherwise are still, seemingly passive...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: You think they want to surrender?
text: But, with that, the entire hive begins to slowly vibrate, and
text: one-by-one, each GRIEVER seems to BLEND INTO the creature
text: next to it, forming one growing MASS...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Uh. Oh.
scene_heading: EXT. STONE CORRIDOR
text: Most of the GLADERS have reached the end of the minefield,
text: but CHUCK is at the back of the pack, still navigating the
text: BREAKAWAYS, drenched in flop sweat.
text: CHUCK takes a step and STUMBLES, his foot falling through the
text: floor, his entire body lurching’ toward the darkness.
text: But THERESA grabs his arm and pulls him to safety.
text: As they take the last few steps to solid ground, they look
text: back to see...the first in the line of GRIEVERS, barreling
text: into the corridor and then...DROPPING through a BREAKAWAY
text: into the darkness.
text: The other GRIEVERS halt. THERESA turns to GALLY...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Did we stop them?
text: In_ response, the next GRIEVER just climbs up the vertical
text: wall and, parallel to the ground, begins slithering toward
dialog: them...
scene_heading: INT. THE HIVE - GRIEVER CAVERN
text: THOMAS, MINHO and NEWT cower, as the HIVE GRIEVERS have
text: combined into a enormous, teeming, SWARM, towering above
dialog: them.
text: And then...the SWARM slowly begins to take FORM...
text: Morphing into razor-sharp CLAWS. A NEEDLE-covered torso. A
text: swinging TAIL coated in still more poisonous STINGERS...
text: -.-until a massive SCORPION-like creature now stands between
text: them and the doorway. A QUEEN GRIEVER.
speaker_heading: HOMAS
dialog: These things are full of surprises.
dialog: 96.
text: MINHO runs forward, raising his crossbow...and THWAP!...fires
text: an arrow into the creature’s side.
text: The QUEEN takes a wild swing with its CLAW, sending MINHO
dialog: diving to avoid it...
scene_heading: EXT. BOULDER ROOM - THE MAZE
text: The GLADERS race through the Boulder Room, dodging the
text: FLAMEBURSTS that erupt every few feet around them...
text: ...-finally arriving beneath the portal. GALLY shouts to
dialog: ATLAS...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: How much time do we have?
text: .»»-as he begins ushering the GLADERS up the boulder pile.
text: ATLAS hops on a rock to play lookout, but he’s hardly got his
text: balance when...a GRIEVER collides with him, and he goes
dialog: ying...
text: ATLAS falls hard on the burnt ground, dropping his spear, and
text: the GRIEVER lands feet from THERESA.
text: But before the creature can attack...ATLAS rolls over and
text: fires his cross-bow... THWAP! THWAP! THWAP! and the GRIEVER
text: dissolves before them.
text: As ATLAS struggles to reload his bow, two MORE GRIEVERS come
text: slithering toward them...
text: Then, THERESA spots ATLAS’ spear laying in the dirt. She
text: picks it_up, and charges forward, swinging it wide like a
text: sword, slicing through both the GRIEVERS..
text: As the creatures melt, THERESA runs past ATLAS to the boulder
text: pile and starts climbing up behind the last of the GLADERS.
text: THERESA looks back to make sure ATLAS is following, in time
dialog: to see...
text: Another GRIEVER launching itself from on top of the rock.
text: ATLAS tosses THERESA his quiver of remaining arrows, as the

text: THWAP! THWAP! THWAP!
text: THOMAS, MINHO, and NEWT are now spread out around the cavern
text: floor...taking turns firing at the QUEEN from different
dialog: directions...
text: THOMAS shouts...
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Not sure we can kill it!
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Maybe not! But we can try to
dialog: distract it!
text: THWAP! MINHO lets off another arrow...and the QUEEN once
text: again lunges after him...
text: THOMAS eyes the steel door. There’s narrow lane past the
text: QUEEN through which he might be able to reach the exit...
dialog: _., NEWT . . .
dialog: You waiting for an invitation?!
text: THOMAS bolts...as THWAP! THWAP! MINHO and NEWT unleash a
dialog: storm of arrows...
text: THOMAS is almost past the QUEEN, when it realizes what’s
dialog: happening...
text: The QUEEN swings its barbed TAIL in his direction... but
text: THOMAS LEAPS over the hurtling mass of NEEDLES...and tumbles
dialog: to safety...
text: As he peels himself up, he faces the ‘DOOR’ -- a massive
text: steel plate embedded seamlessly in the rock before him.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Now what?
scene_heading: EXT. GRIEVER EXIT CORRIDOR - THE MAZE
text: THERESA drops off the rope into the Griever’s exit corridor,
text: where GALLY and the other GLADERS are waiting.
text: GALLY gestures to the Tunnel entrance in the distance...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: They’re onto us. Might as well
dialog: make our stand in the Hive with the
dialog: others...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: But we don’t know how to get
dialog: there...
text: Then, a high-pitched WHINE from the opposite end of the
text: corridor, as the floor opens up, spewing out a rolling
speaker_heading: GRIEVER.
text: The GLADERS all race toward the Tunnel, GALLY helping usher
dialog: them inside.
text: As THERESA is about to climb through, she looks back in time
dialog: to see...
text: CHUCK has fallen. He’s alone, twenty feet back in the
text: corridor, the GRIEVER bearing down...
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 98.
text: THERESA’S about to run to his rescue, when GALLY grabs the
text: poisoned spear in her hand..
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: I’ll go.
text: THERESA hesitates.
speaker_heading: GALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I never believed I was going home.
dialog: And I can buy you some time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You must show them the way.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: How?
text: GALLY points to his head...
speaker_heading: GALLY
dialog: Thomas can tell you.
text: Before THERESA can answer, GALLY has the spear. He charges
text: forward...slamming the weapon into the GRIEVER’S forehea
text: just before it reaches CHUCK......
text: CHUCK struggles to his feet and races toward THERESA, who
text: helps him into the Tunnel...
text: She turns back to see GALLY watching the creature melt, as
text: more GRIEVERS roll up from the ramp.
text: GALLY looks back at THERESA one last time.
speaker_heading: GALLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell Thomas I was wrong about him.
dialog: And I’m sorry.
text: GALLY smiles -- euphoric -- and then marches toward the
dialog: GRIEVERS and certain death
scene_heading: INT. THE HIVE - GRIEVER CAVERN
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: The QUEEN slams its massive CLAW into the wall, as NEWT dives
dialog: to avoid it.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: I think it’s slowing down! We just
dialog: need to get enough serum in it’
dialog: system...
speaker_heading: NEWT
text: Only two more arrows in my bow.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: I’ve got three.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Thomas?
text: But THOMAS is focused entirely on the ‘DOOR.’ As he takes
text: another step closer, the DOOR shimmers and it becomes one
text: massive SCREEN -- a digital image of the Maze right in its
text: center, surrounded by thirty Runic symbols...
text: For a moment, THOMAS hesitates. And then an idea...
text: He finds the first s ol THERESA decoded, and drags it onto
text: the Maze image, exactly where it was revealed by the Maps.
text: The symbol glows xeon Vand stays in place.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Ok...
text: THWAP! THWAP!...MINHO and NEWT each fire simlutaneously...
text: MINHO shouts to THOMAS, who’s now got three symbols in place
dialog: and hunting for the fourth...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Any luck?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Working as fast as I can...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Work faster...
speaker_heading: THWAP!
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: I’m out...
text: The QUEEN lunges at NEWT, backing him into a corner...
text: Then... THWAP! THWAP!...MINHO fires the last of his arrows
dialog: drawing its attention...
text: THOMAS steps back from the door, five symbols in place. He
text: studies THERESA’S incomplete sketch of the last one. Then
text: pooks back to the remaining choices around the perimeter of
text: the SCREEN.
text: There’s at least three symbols that could match it. Closes
text: his eyes a beat. Picks one and drags it onto the Maze...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: C'mon...
text: A beat, the symbol glows red and then... the whole screen
dialog: resets.
text: THOMAS explodes...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it!!!
dialog: 100.
text: SLAMMING his fist into the still-closed door, then turning to
text: find both MINHO and NEWT backing toward him, the QUEEN
text: bearing down on all of them...
text: THWAP!...THOMAS fires and, for a moment, the QUEEN slows, but
text: quickly recovers...
text: THOMAS slings his empty bow over his shoulder. He, MINHO,
text: and NEWT now have only their spears as The QUEEN surges
dialog: forward...
text: THOMAS runs at the QUEEN, wind-milling his spear to parry its
text: CLAWS...
text: And then... THOMAS leaps into the air, stabs the center of
text: the QUEEN’S torso, straight through, top-to-bottom, and
text: pushes off the spear, vaulting over it...
text: For a beat the QUEEN is pinned to the ground, but it bucks
text: furiously, rotating to face THOMAS.
text: NEWT and MINHO try to engage, but, the QUEEN whips its TAIL
text: in a fury, knocking their spears from their hands and sending
text: the weapons scattering to a far corner...
text: Now, THOMAS, NEWT, and MINHO all stand unarmed...
text: Exhausted, ready to give up...
speaker_heading: _ MINHO
dialog: Any more ideas?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: As a matter of fact...
speaker_heading: THUD!
text: A quiver of poison arrows lands at THOMAS’ feet. From
dialog: above...
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I told you we were close.
text: The QUEEN now makes a final charge at THOMAS, barrelling
dialog: toward him...
text: As he crouches, loads the arrows, and fires them off...
text: THWAP! THWAP! THWAP!
text: ..-landing all three in its forehead.
text: The QUEEN’S legs buckle and it barrels into the ground,
text: inches from THOMAS, dissolving in a massive puddle.
text: For a beat, all is quiet. Then THERESA slides down the rope.
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D)
dialog: Let’s take another look at this
dialog: door, shall we?
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: INT. THE HIVE - GRIEVER CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER
text: MINHO and NEWT divide up the remaining arrows from ATLAS’S
text: old quiver, while CLINT and WINSTON hold the rope steady, as
text: the last of the GLADERS slide down into the Hive.
text: THOMAS stands beside THERESA, entering the first five
text: symbols, while she studies the KEYBOARD...
text: When he’s ready for the last one...
text: Without hesitation, THERESA points to one of the symbols...
text: He looks at her...
speaker_heading: __ , THERESA
dialog: I’m positive.
text: He smiles, about to select it, when...
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.
dialog: I should have banished you both
dialog: from the start!
text: THOMAS and THERESA turn to see...
speaker_heading: ALBY.
text: He’s standing at the base of the rope, armed with a loaded
text: cross-bow. His clothes are torn, his hair almost completely
dialog: white...
speaker_heading: _ THOMAS
dialog: You're alive...
speaker_heading: ALBY
text: And awake for the first time.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Are you hurt?
text: ALBY now raises the cross-bow and aims it at THOMAS. The
text: other GLADERS gasp..
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: He’s been Changed.
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: After I was stung in the Homestead,
dialog: I was happy to die. But then I
dialog: stumbled on some Serum in the
dialog: wreckage. All those years
text: listening to Gally rant and rave...
dialog: Thought I’d get a taste.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Turns out the mad man was_ right
dialog: about everything after all...
text: THOMAS is now holding up his hands defensively...
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Put down the bow, Alby. Whatever
dialog: you think you saw, I can explain...
dialog: But ALBY is maniacal...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: I built somethin here. Something
dialog: extraordinary an they took it
dialog: away!! All these years trying to
dialog: escape...This is the escape fr
dialog: out there!
text: WINSTON and many of the GLADERS turn to THOMAS...
speaker_heading: WINSTON
dialog: What’s he talking about? Where are
dialog: you taking us?
text: ALBY faces the GLADERS...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: We can stay. We'll live in the
dialog: Maze, fight the Grievers...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: It’s over Alby...
speaker_heading: ALBY
dialog: Don’t believe him! He belongs in
dialog: the Pit! He violated the Laws!
dialog: Listen to me!!!
text: ALBY starts to shake, then takes a breath and focuses the bow
text: back on THOMAS...
speaker_heading: TWHWAP !
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Nol!
text: And CHUCK dives in front of THOMAS, taking the arrow directly
text: in his heart.
text: THOMAS catches CHUCK, as...
speaker_heading: THWAP!
text: An arrow pierces ALBY in the gut, and he falls to the ground.
text: All the GLADERS’ turn to NEWT, who fired and took ALBY down.
text: A long beat, then...
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Been listening for too long. Time
dialog: to see, with our own eyes.
text: THOMAS, cradles CHUCK, who looks up at him, life slipping
dialog: away...
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: If you find my mom and dad. Tell
dialog: them I was the best Field Hand in
dialog: the Glade.
text: THOMAS’ hardened demeanor softens and we get a glimpse of the
dialog: boy he was before the Changing.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I’1l tell them you were a hero,
dialog: Chuck. Braver than all the
dialog: Runners.
text: Suddenly from above, a SHRIEK...and a GRIEVER drops into the
text: Cavern. Then ANOTHER...
text: THERESA turns back to the door and drags the final symbol
text: into place. All six symbols glow green on the image of the
text: Maze. Then, the screen goes blank.
text: And finally, it reads: “MAZE TRIAL: COMPLETE.”
text: A beat, then the ground begins to SHAKE, and the steel door
text: rises out of the rock, and rolls to the side, revealing a
dialog: platform.
text: THERESA steps inside and looks up.
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: It’s an elevator! C’mon!
text: The GLADERS hesitate half-a-beat, but with little choice,
text: they pile inside, as MINHO and NEWT do their best to ward off
text: the GRIEVERS with the remaining arrows. As they back into
dialog: the elevator...
speaker_heading: THERESA (CONT’D)
dialog: Thomas!!!
text: THOMAS looks to her, then one last time at CHUCK whose eyes
text: flutter close. He lays down the boy’s body and jumps on the
text: elevator platform, just as it begins to rise...
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR
text: THOMAS, THERESA, NEWT, and the GLADERS stand silent, somber
text: as the elevator slows to a stop before another steel door.
text: The door opens. And the GLADERS all stare in AWE...
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM
text: -+-at a sterile, white room, lit by overhead fluorescents,
text: and split in half by a glass partition. Behind the glass, a
text: massive wall of monitors stream aerial images of the now-
text: empty Maze and Glade from every conceivable angle.
text: And seated before those monitors, at an elaborate computer
text: terminal are a dozen ADULTS in white lab coats.
speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 104.
text: Everything about the setting is sleek, modern, in stark
text: contrast to the natural materials of the Maze’ and Glade.
text: As the GLADERS file out of the elevator and into the room,
text: several of the ADULTS turn around and approach the glass.
text: For a beat, the GLADERS and the ADULTS simply stare at each
dialog: other.
text: Then, one of the ADULTS, a kind-looking WOMAN presses a
text: button on the terminal behind her, and an intercom is
dialog: activated.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Welcome home.
text: The GLADERS remain silent, stunned...
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Congratulations, Thomas! And to
dialog: Fou all on_a wonderful achievement.
dialog: he first Group to complete the
dialog: Maze! And not post complete
dialog: it...We never thought so many would
dialog: survive!
text: MINHO steps forward...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: What the hell is going on? Who are
dialog: you people?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
text: Mr. Minho. Agile, strong, calm
dialog: under crushing pressure. You
dialog: should be very proud.
speaker_heading: NEWT
dialog: Proud? Half our friends are
dialog: dead...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: And, yet, even in the end, when we
dialog: accelerated the stimuli, you kept
dialog: going. You insisted on maintaining
dialog: order, enforcing Laws. Mr. Minho
dialog: and his Runners kept mapping a
dialog: shifting Maze that couldn’t be
dialog: solved. Every day, men did back-
dialog: breaking work in the fields,
dialog: labored to erect structures with
dialog: few tools and meager supplies. And
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Because they never gave up.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: That's right Thomas. Never stopped
dialog: looking for a solution.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And you! Viewed at first with
dialog: contempt, then suspicion, but
text: finally rising to their lead.
dialog: Proving yourself willing to
dialog: sacrifice everything in order to
dialog: save your flock.
dialog: eat)
dialog: You are worthy of the task for
dialog: which you've been groomed.
text: MINHO looks at THOMAS, confused.
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: I don’t understand...who are these
dialog: people?
text: Now a BALD MAN steps up next to the WOMAN.
speaker_heading: BALD MAN
dialog: We are The Consortium.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Humanity’s last hope.
text: Behind the BALD MAN, the control-room monitors are no longer
text: broadcasting the Glade. Instead, a different series of
dialog: images:
text: The sun exploding, turning the sky blood red. Ash andmark, to
text: the ground like snow. Familiar city skylines and landmarks
text: laid ruin. Those armored personnel carriers. Men in
text: biohazard suits stepping over corpses in the streets.
speaker_heading: BALD MAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Since the Flare, the sickness has
dialog: spread faster than anyone
dialog: anticipated. There are hardly any
dialog: sanctuaries left. What you’re
dialog: doing here is critical. “The Chosen
dialog: and their followers will save
dialog: mankind.
text: The WOMAN shoots the BALD MAN a silencing look. She turns
text: back to the GLADERS...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: We know how jarring this must be.
dialog: But you’re safe now. And you’ll
dialog: need your rest. The Maze Trial was
dialog: post the beginning. Phase Two
text: egins soon.
text: MINHO turns again to THOMAS...
speaker_heading: MINHO
dialog: Phase two? I thought we were
dialog: free...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Min --
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Not now, Thomas. You’1l have
dialog: lenty of time to rally your troops
dialog: or the challenge ahead. This is a
dialog: moment to rest and regroup. To
dialog: enjoy.
text: Suddenly, a door to their right opens, and a crew of ARMED
text: CONSORTIUM OFFICERS file in.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: These officers will show you to
dialog: your quarters for the night.
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Thomas. Theresa. You may come with
dialog: us.
text: THOMAS and THERESA don’t move, as the others stare in
dialog: disbelief.
text: THOMAS turns to MINHO and NEWT.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (whispers )
dialog: I know what it looks like. But
text: this isn’t over yet.
text: The WOMAN presses a button and a door opens in the glass
dialog: partition.
text: THOMAS looks at THERESA and together they walk forward and
text: step inside. As they watch the CONSORTIUM OFFICERS begin
text: rounding up the GLADERS...
speaker_heading: THERESA (V.O.)
dialog: You sure about this?
speaker_heading: THOMAS (V.O.)
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: THERESA (V.O.)
dialog: What if it’s worse out there,
dialog: alone?
speaker_heading: THOMAS (V.O.)
dialog: We’re not alone.
text: Suddenly, THOMAS and THERESA, reach into their waistbands and
text: paid out serrated BLADES. They grab the BALD MAN and the
text: OMAN, holding the knives to their throats...
text: The armed CONSORTIUM OFFICERS all turn, but they’re separated
text: by the glass.
text: THOMAS barks to one of the adult TECHNICIANS still seated at
dialog: the computer terminal...
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Bring up the profiles!
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I can’t --
text: THOMAS digs the blade deeper into the BALD MAN’S flesh...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Or I’1l cut his throat.
text: The BALD MAN nods, frantic, and the TECHNICIAN goes to work.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Start with Minho.
text: The TECHNICIAN hits a few buttons and the monitors all
text: broadcast one giant image of...
text: MINHO, no more than eleven years old, atop a smiling man’s
text: shoulders, standing by the Golden Gate Bridge. Next to them
text: is a beautiful woman cradling an infant gir
text: THOMAS looks out through the glass at MINHO. Over the
dialog: intercom...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're from San Francisco, Min.
dialog: You had a mother and fathér. A
dialog: baby sister named Kim.
text: MINHO can’t take his eyes off the photo, and for the first
text: time, we see tears stream down his face.
text: The monitor ghanges and now it’s a young NEWT, on a farm,
text: kneeling amidst half-a-dozen oung ids; a stern older man
text: looking on, arm around his wife’s waste.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT’D)
dialog: Newt, you were born in Oklahoma.
dialog: Oldest of six.
text: NEWT’s hardened facade crumbles. As the GLADERS stand
text: silent, the monitors cycle through a short montage of FAMILY
text: PHOTOS, concluding with...
text: THOMAS. His FATHER’S arm around him, center-field at Yankee
text: Stadium. THOMAS looks up, focusing on his dad...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s my father. My best friend.
dialog: I don’t know if he, or anyone else
dialog: is still alive out there. But I
dialog: intend to find out.
text: THOMAS locks eyes with MINHO...

speaker_heading: Blue (mm/dd/yyyy) 108.
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
dialog: I know we’re all tired. But if we
dialog: want to really be free, we need to
dialog: keep running.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We survived the Maze. We defeated
dialog: the Grievers. And I don’t know
dialog: about you, but I’m done being a
text: pawn in someone else’s game.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We can do this, Min. Together, we
dialog: can do anything.
text: MINHO looks around at the CONSORTIUM OFFICERS who stand,
text: unsure what to do. At the exhausted GLADERS. And back at
text: THOMAS. He nods.
text: THOMAS gives the TECHNICIAN one last order...
speaker_heading: THOMAS (CONT'D)
text: Unlock the access doors to the
dialog: street.
text: Now the WOMAN shouts...
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Don’t do it! We’ve invested too
dialog: much!
text: THOMAS pushes so hard he draws a drop of blood from the BALD
text: MAN'S neck. He glares at the WOMAN.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You wanted to see how we’d handle
dialog: your puzzle? This is our solution.
dialog: (beat)
