speaker_heading: THE HIMALAYAS
text: Wide as all the world. Towering and timeless and rumbling
text: mutely into the sky to scrape the floor of heaven.
text: We're gliding between them as if on a cloud, and CARTER’S
text: VOICE is quiet and humble and yet somehow makes us feel
dialog: as though he knows a great many things we don’t.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Edward Perriman Cole died in May. It was
dialog: a Sunday, in the afternoon, and there
dialog: wasn’t a cloud in the sky...
text: One mountain rises above the rest. A plume of ice and
text: snow billows from its wedge-shaped peak which thrusts up
text: into the jet stream.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: “Life is not measured by the breaths we
dialog: take, but by the moments that take our
dialog: breath away.” Whoever said that knew a
dialog: thing or two.
text: We’re MOVING HIGHER now as the mountain looms closer,
text: drawing us up its massive shoulders.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Even now, I can’t claim to understand the
dialog: measure of a life... Some people will
dialog: tell you it’s how we’re remembered by
dialog: history, or by the ones we've left
dialog: behind. Some believe it can be measured
dialog: in faith. Some say by love... Other folks
dialog: say life has no meaning at all. We’re
text: only dust in the breeze.
text: CONTINUING over ridges and glaciers towards the peak.

scene_heading: A SKI POLE - THRUST THROUGH A CRUST OF FROZEN SNOW
text: The CLIMBER is wrapped in a hooded mountaineering suit
text: and his face is protected by an oxygen mask and ski
text: goggles.
text: With great effort, he lifts his right foot and plants it
text: forward next to the ski pole, his thin breath swept away
text: by the exertion.
text: He pauses and lifts his goggles to his forehead. His eyes
text: are blue and ringed with exhaustion as he turns to take
text: in the view of the entire world beneath him...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: What I can tell you is that, by any
dialog: standard, Edward Cole lived more in his
dialog: last days on earth than most folks manage
dialog: to wring out of a lifetime.
text: Lowering the goggles, the climber turns back to the
dialog: summit.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I know that when he died his eyes were
dialog: closed, and his heart was open... And I
dialog: know that he could hear the mountain...
text: The climber plants the second ski pole and takes another
text: agonizing step as we RISE high above him until he becomes
text: small on the face of the giant.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: And I know the mountain heard him in

speaker_heading: MANNY (0.S.)
dialog: So then what happened?
text: His partner MANNY is beneath the car on a roller. He
text: slides in and out of view over course of the following...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Tesla took his design to the richest man
text: in town, mister J.P. Morgan.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: The stockbroker guy?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: That’s right. Morgan was the major
text: financier for Tesla’s primary rival, a
dialog: fellow by the name of Tom Edison.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Between them, Morgan and Edison
dialog: controlled the entire power grid for New
dialog: York, Boston, Philadelphia, and so on.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: (jingling his pocket)
dialog: So they had some serious jing.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They had “serious jing.” Which is why,
text: when Tesla walked into Mr. Morgan's
dialog: office and unveiled an invention designed
dialog: to provide free, wireless electricity to
dialog: the entire population of the planet -
dialog: remember now, this is 1912 - Mister
dialog: Morgan had no choice but to finance it
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Hold up. He agreed?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Without hesitation.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: But wouldn't free energy put him out of
dialog: business?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Invariably.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Yo, that’s one stupid stockbroker.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: A year later, Tesla invited Mr. Morgan
dialog: out to Long Island, where he had nearly
dialog: completed the first in a series of towers
dialog: which would tap into the Earth and beam
text: its energy through the air to a nearby
dialog: receiver.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Crazy... So what happened?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Morgan knew the invention would make both
dialog: Tesla and himself famous beyond their
dialog: wildest dreams...change human history
dialog: forever. So, he did what anyone in his
dialog: position would do. He went back to his
dialog: office, made a few phone calls, then home
text: to his wife... The next day Tesla
dialog: received notice that Morgan had pulled
dialog: his funding. He was thrown out on the
text: street and the lab was demolished. The
dialog: morning papers carried stories about
text: Tesla’s clinical insanity, quoting
dialog: “anonymous sources” who claimed to have
dialog: seen Tesla consorting with prostitutes
dialog: and demons.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: And Morgan protected his company. That's
dialog: SO...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Machiavellian? I agree.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: I was gonna say wack, but whatever spanks
dialog: your monkey. What happened to Tesla?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He became a pariah. No one dared cross
dialog: Morgan. Nikola Tesla lived the rest of
dialog: his life in isolation and died in
text: poverty. The proverbial tree that falls
text: without a sound.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: He never tried to start over.
text: Carter shakes his head as the phone rings...
speaker_heading: MANNY (CONT’D)
dialog: Yo, that’s a messed-up story.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Most true stories are. Happy endings are
dialog: for suckers.
text: Carter lights a new cigarette as he answers the phone...
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Carter... Hey, how was the
dialog: interview?... Oh... Well, there’s plenty
dialog: of fish in the... Dr. Young?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What did he want?...Uh huh...What does
dialog: that mean?... It can’t be all that bad...
text: He takes a drag of his cigarette then suddenly stops. His
text: expression changes as he listens...
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s not possible.
text: He removes the butt from between his lips as smoke
text: dribbles from his mouth. He looks at the cigarette for a
text: moment then drops it to the floor.
text: ANGLE ON the cigarette butt, slowly burning itself out.
text: In the b.g., Manny pulls himself out from under the car,
text: staring up at Carter.
speaker_heading: CARTER (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Today? That’s no good, the team’s got
dialog: their first scrimmage before... Yeah...
dialog: No, I know. Okay... Yep. Okay.
speaker_heading: MANNY
dialog: Yo, what the hell is that?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (hanging up the phone)

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Kopi Luwak. It’s the rarest beverage in

dialog: better be.
scene_heading: INT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY PLANNING BOARDROOM - DAY
text: Across the aisle, the COUNTY DIRECTOR is flanked by five
text: fellow BOARD MEMBERS who go through the minutiae of
text: beginning the meeting.
text: Edward is in his mid to late 50’s. He’s immaculately
text: dressed and groomed, though his Italian suit appears
text: slightly too large for his gaunt frame.
text: He unscrews a matching cup from the bottom of the thermos
text: and pours a small amount of the brew before handing it
text: over to RICHARD, one of several executives in Edward’s
dialog: retinue.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (coaxing with his hand)
dialog: First the aroma.
text: Richard bends his head to the cup, sniffing it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Note the earthy tones and the complexity
dialog: of the body.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It's just coffee, right?
speaker_heading: COUNTY DIRECTOR
dialog: Mister Cole?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: It’s not ‘just coffee.’
text: Watches Richard take a tentative sip.
speaker_heading: COUNTY DIRECTOR
dialog: Mister Cole. We’re ready to begin.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (focused on Richard)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (clearly doesn’t get it)
dialog: Wow. Really, uh, good.
speaker_heading: COUNTY DIRECTOR
dialog: Mister Cole!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: You're a friggin’ Philistine, you know
dialog: that.
text: Grabs the cup back and stands to face the board.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, Mister Director, fellow board
dialog: members. Very much appreciate you taking
dialog: the time... I’m not big on sugarcoat, so
dialog: you'll forgive me if this comes across as
text: somewhere south of warm and fuzzy...
dialog: (looks directly at them)
dialog: All of you should be immediately and
dialog: pointedly fired. They should haul you up
dialog: by your boot-straps and dump your bloated
text: salaries into the street. The appalling
dialog: decline of Jefferson Hospital is a direct
dialog: result of your gross incompetence and
dialog: utter lack of fiscal erudition.
speaker_heading: COUNTY DIRECTOR
dialog: I beg your pardon! This--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Okay, I got a deal. I’m going to talk for
dialog: a few minutes, and the moment I speak the
dialog: slightest untruth you can shout me down.
dialog: Good? Fair? Good... Your shop is
text: hemorrhaging cash. Overhead costs are in
dialog: the stratosphere. Your lease and land
dialog: costs were criminally overbid.
text: One of the board members raises his hand to protest but
text: the County Director waves him off.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Donations have atrophied to the point
dialog: that you’ve fallen hopelessly behind the
dialog: tech curve in research, pediatrics,
dialog: oncology, MRI...
text: He pauses and savors a long sip of his Kopi Luwak coffee,
text: eyeballing the board over the rim of the cup until his
text: eyelids close in ecstasy from the flavor.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Mmmm... Put simply, your hospital loses
dialog: money every time a patient walks through
text: the door.
text: The board members range from uncomfortable to furious,
dialog: though none say a word.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: More truths... The Cole Group is the
dialog: largest private hospital management firm
dialog: in the region. We have a proven track
dialog: record of corporate governance and exceed
dialog: every requirement of the Sarbanes-Oxley
dialog: Act... Our shops maintain state-of-the-
text: art technology systems, and wield
text: unparalleled clout in negotiating with
dialog: unions and the insurance companies...
dialog: What’s more we've privatized fifteen
dialog: other public hospitals in the past seven
dialog: years, each of which now provide the
dialog: highest standard of medicine to their
dialog: communities.
text: He pours a second cup of coffee and brings it to his
dialog: lips.
scene_heading: FEMALE BOARD MEMBER
dialog: Despite being grossly understaffed?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (pausing before drinking)
dialog: We employ the best of the best of the
dialog: best. The stronger the staff, the less
dialog: need there is for--
text: Suddenly, he coughs into the cup, spraying coffee onto
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me.
text: Pulls a silk handkerchief to his lips as his suits search
text: their pockets for tissues to wipe the table.
speaker_heading: COUNTY DIRECTOR
dialog: What about beds? There have been reports
dialog: that you increase the number of beds to
text: the point of overpopulation.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (wiping coffee)
dialog: That’s because I run hospitals, not bed
dialog: and breakfasts. The sole concern of my
dialog: company is to provide the best health
dialog: care in the world, which we do.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: The sole concern of my shareholders, who
dialog: include three of you, I might add, is to
dialog: turn a profit, which, as you know, we
dialog: also do... Our methods are stringent and
dialog: effective and one has never suffered at
dialog: the hands of the other, and you know
dialog: it... Truths? The truth is you need me
dialog: boys and girls...a fuck of a lot more
dialog: than I need--
text: Coughs into the handkerchief again.
speaker_heading: COUNTY DIRECTOR
dialog: Mister Cole?
text: Edward stares in shock at the ugly puddle of clotted
text: blood staining the white silk of the handkerchief...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: A pair of elevator doors open at the far end of a long

dialog: numbers. This is THOMAS.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Thomas barrels in, passing a curtained off area near the
text: door, and drops the bags onto the empty bed next to the
text: window. Opening the first suitcase, he sets up the room
dialog: with practiced efficiency--
text: He plugs in a cell phone cradle and sets it on the
text: bedside table along with a hi-tech alarm clock... Lines
text: half a dozen shoes and slippers down the length of the
text: bed... Unloads a stack of thick books on living with
dialog: cancer, cancer treatment, cancer nutrition, new cancer
text: protocols... Sets a laptop computer on the table,
text: surrounding it neatly with pens, notepads and Post-Its...
text: Places a massive, Royal Classic copper coffee siphon on
text: the window sill, along with copper-lined cups and saucers
text: and spoons and a dark wooden box covered in Arabic
dialog: writing and Sumatran customs stickers...
text: VOICES are heard in the hallway - a commotion coming
dialog: closer.
text: Thomas quickly removes a vase and flowers. He jogs
text: through the separator curtain and into the bathroom where
text: he fills the vase with water, completely missing the
text: figure lying in the bed behind the curtain.
dialog: 10.
text: The noise in the hallway is reaching a fever pitch as
text: Thomas emerges from the bathroom and nearly loses the
text: vase as he sees Carter lying in the near bed.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (eying the flowers)
dialog: You shouldn’t have.
text: He’s thin and drawn and hooked up to a network of tubes
text: and even his eyelashes have fallen out exposing his
text: sallow skin that’s dappled with angry chemo burns.
text: There are flowers everywhere and the wall behind him is a
text: collage of get well cards and photos of a girls soccer
dialog: team.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I uh... I’m sorry. What are you doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You know, fighting for my life... You?
text: Just as the hallway brigade bursts into the room - seen
text: in silhouette and through the gap in the curtains - as
text: doctors and nurses and handlers hover over--
speaker_heading: EDWARD (0.S.)
dialog: (from his gurney)
dialog: And tell Holcomb I want to know more
dialog: about this bleo-maya-something.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (0.S.)
dialog: Bleomycin.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (0.S.)
dialog: Bleomycin. Thomas says it eats your
dialog: lungs. How do I stoke fear in the hearts
dialog: of my employees if I’m breathing through
text: a hole in my throat for the rest of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (0.S.)
dialog: That’s not exactly what--
speaker_heading: NURSE (0.S.)
dialog: We're going to move you into the bed now.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (0.S.)
dialog: I can do it myself goddammit. I’m not
dialog: dead yet.
dialog: 11.
text: Then a huge clattering is heard as Edward falls off the
text: gurney. He swears bitterly as the doctors and nurses grab
text: him quickly and lift him into the bed.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Where the hell is Thomas?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You rang my liege.
text: Pushing through the curtains, leaving a gap through which
text: Carter views Edward being slid into bed.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You ditched me again.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Wishful thinking on my part.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You let these people drop me. Did you see
dialog: them drop me?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I wouldn’t lose a testicle over it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: That’s funny. That’s absolutely, goddamn
dialog: hysteri--
text: Lapses into a coughing fit which doubles him over,
text: allowing him a look through the curtains at Carter.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Who the hell is that?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Who the hell are you?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: (to Edward)
dialog: One thing at a time. Lean back now.
text: Edward and Carter glare at each other before Thomas
text: gingerly leans him back into the bed.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: That was the first I laid eyes on him. An

scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: This isn’t a skinned knee. I can’t fix it

speaker_heading: NURSE SHING

speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Here.

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How...? Did it...?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Oh, they said it went really well.

speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Edward opens his eyes to see the television is turned on
text: to Jeopardy. Carter is sitting up in bed, firing the
text: answers back at the screen.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: Excuse me...
dialog: (stronger)
dialog: Excuse me.
dialog: (a hoarse shout)
dialog: I beg your pardon!
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Huh? Oh.
dialog: (lowers the volume)
dialog: Doc wanted you to wake up, said I
dialog: shouldn’t pussyfoot.
text: Just as Dr. Holcomb enters like a zephyr.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: So, it couldn’t have gone better. We got
dialog: in, got out and the tumor came back
dialog: benign. All that remains now is to make
dialog: sure you’re not mentally--
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: The dumbass lion waits in a dream beneath
dialog: the stupid white lantern.
text: Dr. Holcomb nods approvingly. Marks the chart.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: Surliness is a good sign. How’s the
dialog: catheter feel?
text: He checks the integrity of the bulging plastic drain
text: implanted into the center of Edward’s sternum.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Like someone took a dump in my chest.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
text: (barely listening as he
dialog: scribbles on the chart)
dialog: Wonderful. Okay, we saved your brain, now
dialog: we're going to kill your body. Your
dialog: markers are through the roof so I'd like
text: to begin the first course of chemo in the
dialog: morning. Good?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I can’t wait.
text: Dr. Holcomb’s expression does little to hide the fact
text: that Edward has no idea what he’s in for. Holcomb surges
dialog: for the door...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Say, Doc. Do you think you could-
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: I'm sorry. I’m running late.
text: Walks out.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (to Edward)
dialog: Real Mother Theresa, that one.
text: Edward tries to sit up but is held in place by the web of
text: tubes running in and out of his body.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I wouldn’t do that if I were you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I have a choice?
dialog: 20.
text: Carter turns back to Jeopardy. Edward takes a moment to
text: accept his situation, then turns his head and studies
dialog: Carter.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: How long have you been here?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What is the quadratic equation!
dialog: (to Edward)
dialog: Huh? Oh, in and out for the last few
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Has it been uncomfortable?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Which part?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The chemo.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They say it’s different for everyone.
dialog: Once you get used to the ‘round the clock
dialog: vomiting and watching your veins turn
dialog: black and the feeling that your bones are
dialog: made of napalm, it’s not bad at all.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (paling slightly)
dialog: Fantastic.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Say, I been meaning to ask you, what the
dialog: hell is that contraption over there?
text: Points over to the high-tech coffee maker.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It's a siphon. Makes coffee.
text: Fumbles his hand for the nurse call button.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I figured that much. What else it do?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Nothing. Just coffee.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I‘1ll be damned... Did you know that
dialog: coffee was originally discovered by a
dialog: shepherd in Ethiopia?
text: Edward just stares at him... Carter continues, as much
dialog: for his own pleasure as for Edward's edification...
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
text: His goats had been eating the cherries of
text: an unfamiliar bush and soon became
text: unmanageable, running and jumping all
text: over creation. The shepherd chewed some
text: of the leaves which gave him a strange
dialog: vitality so he took some branches to the
dialog: local monastery where the abbot decided
dialog: to roast them. When the cherries started
dialog: to burn, the beans inside produced such a
text: pleasant aroma that they brewed them into
text: a stew which eventually spread to
dialog: Columbia, Asia, even Sumatra, like that
dialog: hooch you got over there.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It’s called Kopi Luwak.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know what it is.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You’ve tried it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (makes a face)
dialog: Not even if I was dying of thirst in the
dialog: Gobi desert.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why not, it’s the most expensive--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’m more of an instant coffee man.
text: Edward's I.V. tubes have become tangled in the call
text: button. Carter rolls his eyes, but eases himself creakily
text: out of bed and shuffles over to untangle them expertly.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Your wife’s a nurse?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Twenty-six years. Used to work in this
dialog: ward.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Retired?
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: In a manner of speaking.
text: Hands Edward the call button and shuffles back to his
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You fired her, when this became “your”
dialog: hospital.

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: Double veal chop with lobster truffle oil

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You sure you want to eat all that?
text: He’s watching them through thin eyes as he works his way
dialog: through his own I.V.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm a bottomless pit. It’s true, I could
dialog: eat twice this much if some people
dialog: weren’t such goddamn nursema--
text: He’s cut off as Thomas clears his throat loudly.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
dialog: (to Carter; off Thomas’ look)
dialog: Oh. Uh, you want Thomas to make you a
dialog: plate? Tommy, fix a plate for mister, uh--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Carter.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Pass.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Yeah? It’s the best in New York.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Good enough to taste it twice?
text: Thomas puts the plate in front of Edward who picks up a
dialog: piece of fried artichoke...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You know what they say, living well is
dialog: the best revenge.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Revenge for what?
text: Edward pops the artichoke in his mouth, grinning as he
text: chews.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Whadd’ya got?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EDWARD - PUKING HIS KIDNEYS OUT
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: As his sumptuous dinner hits the floor with the force of
text: a hurricane. He’s moaning and spitting as he climbs out
text: of bed and makes for the bathroom but his I.V. tubes jerk
text: him back and he ends up on the floor where he unleashes
text: another torrent. After a moment, he looks up to see
text: Carter watching him evenly.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I feel like I’m dying.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You are.
text: Winces as Edward vomits again.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Edward is in bed and covered in sweat as he shivers
text: uncontrollably. His eyebrows are gone and the first chemo
text: burn blooms above his right eye.
text: Carter is curled up in his own bed as he turns the last
text: page of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin: A Poem by Mayakovsky then
text: places it atop a stack of completed books on the floor.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Carter stares up at the collage of photos and cards taped
text: to the wall above his head. He removes a photograph of
text: his daughter's soccer team. He’s seen standing proudly in
text: the back row wearing a coach’s hat and a whistle around
text: his neck.
text: Edward groans in his sleep and wrestles with his sheets.
text: The bandages have been removed from his head, which is
text: now scarred and littered with uneven patches of stubble.

speaker_heading: NURSE SHING
dialog: Fourth and final round. Couple more tests
dialog: and we’ll see where we stand.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How long?
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: NURSE SHING
dialog: Soon as I can get Dr. Gibian to look at

dialog: you need.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Thanks Phyllis.
text: She heads out as he checks his watch.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Mind if I turn this on?
text: Edward is sitting up in bed, haggard but lucid as he
text: types angrily on his laptop, sipping a cup of coffee. He
text: waves his hand dismissively.
text: Carter turns the television on to Jeopardy and becomes
text: immediately engrossed...
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: What is The Great Divide?... What is
dialog: somnambulism?... Who was Warren
dialog: Harding?...
dialog: 
text: Edward pauses in his typing. Glances over at Carter...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Do you ever miss one?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (shrugs modestly)
dialog: I missed one last week.

text: his computer.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM - DAY
text: Edward kneels on the floor, head resting on the toilet
text: seat, fast asleep. He’s woken by VOICES coming from the

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ++.-got the corner kick which Karen put
text: right in the box and Angela headed it

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: So who you playing in the championships?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (glumly)
dialog: Essex.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’‘ll have to do some homework on ‘em.
text: Edward shuffles out of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Sorry.
text: He’s a mess as he slowly makes his way around the bed as
text: Virginia walks in from the hallway...
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Three months I’m gone and this place has
text: gone to the dogs. There isn’t an M.D.
dialog: within--
text: Almost walks into Edward...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Excuse me.
text: -..as he shuffles over to his bed and wrestles with the
text: cables and tubes. She watches him for a moment then,
text: despite herself, moves to help him.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Nice and easy.
text: She clears a path then helps him ease into bed.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Mmmm.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Mmmm. Don’t you people use words anymore?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: You people?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Nurses. I meant-- Forget it.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: (walking away)
dialog: Forget yourself.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I beg your pardon.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: You can beg all you want, you ain't
dialog: gettin’ it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How dare you talk to me that way.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I will talk to-- I don’t work for you
dialog: anymore “Mister Cole” so don’t think for
dialog: a hummingbird heartbeat you put the quake
dialog: in my boots with your fat voice because
dialog: all you're doing is taking up oxygen.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: ‘Gin-
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I don’t think so.
dialog: (back to Edward)
dialog: It's been two days since a doctor's
dialog: looked in on my husband and you of all
dialog: people have the nerve to condescend to
dialog: us... I’ve been a nurse my entire adult
text: life with a ringside seat to more human
dialog: tragedy than any woman should have to
dialog: bear and I’ve learned that the one thing
dialog: in this world worse than dying is staring
dialog: your life’s end in the face with no one
dialog: beside you but a nurse you’ve known for a
dialog: week who’s being paid to hold your
dialog: hand... I don’t wish that on you, Mr.
dialog: Cole, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, but I
dialog: know what I know about these things, and
dialog: you might want to make what ever peace
dialog: you can with god and give back just a
dialog: little bit of the respect you so
dialog: desperately demand, because as far as I
dialog: can tell, you are going to die alone.
dialog: 28.
text: Edward's eyes betray him for a brief moment, just enough
text: for her to see she’s laid him wide open. Her regret is
dialog: immediate.
text: She turns to see everyone staring at her including Thomas
text: who has just entered from the hallway carrying several
text: Chinese take out bags.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Peking Duck?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The copper coffee maker reflects a single light source in
text: the otherwise darkened room. Edward stares at the machine
text: from his bed, eyes lost in the gleaming metal.
text: The reflection shifts and Edward rolls over to see Carter
text: adjusting his reading light.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What are you reading?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Book on Robert Smalls.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Never heard of him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: He was a conscripted slave aboard a
text: Confederate steamship, The Planter. One
dialog: night he and some of the crew smuggled
dialog: their families aboard and stole it right
text: out from under the rebels’ noses. He
dialog: turned it over to the Union Navy who made
dialog: him a captain. By the end of the war he’d
dialog: risen to the rank of General and later
dialog: became the second African-American to
dialog: serve in Congress.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Quite a life.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: Quite a life.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I don’t like books.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're joking.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I never saw the point. History’s just...
dialog: history. I'd rather make it than read
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How’s that coming along? Make any yet?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I've done alright for myself.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (dubious )
dialog: All your dreams fulfilled?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Pretty much, yes. What about you?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not exactly. We were practically kids
dialog: ourselves when my first boy came alone.
dialog: Young, broke and black, you take the
dialog: first job they offer you. Thirty years
text: goes by in a heartbeat.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Would you change it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I love my children, if that’s what you
dialog: mean.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I’m sure you do. But you’re a smart guy,
dialog: must have had a plan for your life before
dialog: they came along.
text: Carter thinks a moment, then reaches into the drawer of
text: his bedside table and removes his well-worn wallet. He
text: pulls a small square of yellowed paper out from a pocket
text: and unfolds it gently in his hands.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I made this in high school. Creative
text: writing class. Some kind of exercise to
dialog: get us to think about something besides
text: chasing skirts.
text: He slips out of bed and hands it across to Edward.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “Carter's Bucket List”... You weren't
text: much on penmanship.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Hasn’t improved, I assure you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I don’t understand what this is.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I was trying to be funny, I guess. It’s a
dialog: list of things to do before I kick the
dialog: bucket.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (still reading)
dialog: “Make a million dollars. Run for
dialog: president.”
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I didn’t say it was realistic.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: “Help a complete stranger for the good?”
dialog: How philanthropic.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: I was sixteen.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What’s the one about the mountain?
text: Hands the list back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (without looking)
dialog: “Listen to the mountain and be heard.”
dialog: That’s from my uncle. Second World War
dialog: his squadron flew supplies through the
dialog: Himalayas into China. Called them the
dialog: Hump Pilots... Most non-combat casualties
dialog: of any unit in Air Force history... You
dialog: can honestly say you’ve accomplished
dialog: everything you ever dreamed about?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: I’m a millionaire a dozen times over.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: I grew my company from the ground up,
dialog: built my own house, sold it, built a
dialog: bigger house.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Money ain’t everything.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No, but it sure takes the edge off being
dialog: miserable all the time.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What about your wife?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Which one? We’re talking about dreams,
dialog: not nightmares.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There’s got to be something you haven’t
dialog: done.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Dreams are for teenagers. Let’s face it,
dialog: we've had our time and we did what we did
dialog: with it. We’re all out of wishes. The
dialog: genies left our magic lamps a long time
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (after a beat)
dialog: Suit yourself.
text: He gets back into bed and slips the list between the
text: pages of his book. Edward watches him for a moment, then
text: turns back to staring at the coffee maker.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE SOUNDS OF A BASEBALL GAME
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Carter hides behind the sports section of a local
text: newspaper, highlighting pieces of an article on the Essex
dialog: girls soccer team.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (0.S.)
dialog: Come on you pansies, it’s one out, how
dialog: hard can it be?
dialog: 32.
text: Carter lowers the paper just enough to reveal Edward
text: lying on his stomach with his head propped on a pillow at
text: the foot of the bed, stretching his tubes and cables to
text: the limit as he yells at the Yankee game on the TV.
text: A Red Sox player bloops a single. Edward is beside
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: That's just... That’s... I can’t take
dialog: much more of this!
text: Carter's feelings are commensurate as he puts on a pair
text: of head phones and listens to Mozart’s Requiem Lacrymosa.
text: He finishes the article and reaches down for a second
text: newspaper when he sees Holcomb standing at the foot of
text: Edward's bed. Holcomb’s face is pinched and somber as he
text: speaks... Edward listens implacably, his face impossible
dialog: to read.
text: Carter slides the headphones off to listen...
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: We're not giving up. There are some
dialog: experimental programs we’re conducting
dialog: and I think you'd be an excellent--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Doc.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: --candidate. It’s cutting edge medicine.
dialog: The odds are against you, but-
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Doctor Holcomb.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're blocking my view.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
text: Holcomb steps to the side of the television. Stares for a
dialog: beat...
speaker_heading: DR. HOLCOMB (CONT’D)
dialog: Well, if you have any questions.
dialog: 33.
text: Waits another beat then starts for the door.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (eyes never leaving the
dialog: screen)
dialog: One question.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Carter?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: ‘Something you needed from Dr. Holcomb?
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: I'm sorry, I’m not Mister Carter’s--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You are now.
text: Holcomb stares at him but Edward’s attention never leaves
text: the screen. Finally, Holcomb lifts Carter's chart from
text: the foot of the bed and flips through several pages.
text: After several moments, his shoulders drop and he looks up
text: at Carter and shakes his head slowly.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: I'm sorry, Mister Carter. According to
dialog: this your markers haven't stabilized.
text: Carter takes it in, though it’s the answer he expected.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How long?
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: Several months. A year if you’re lucky.
dialog: As I was just telling Edward, we have an
dialog: experimental program which has had some
dialog: very positive--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Sure, Doc. Whatever you think.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: I’m truly sorry.
dialog: 34.
text: Carter just nods and replaces the headphones over his
text: ears as Holcomb makes his exit.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: There was a survey once, a hundred people
dialog: were asked, if they could, would they
dialog: want to know in advance the day of their
dialog: death. Out of the hundred, ninety-six of
dialog: them said no.
text: Carter closes his eyes as the music washes over him.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: I never understood that. I always thought
dialog: it would be liberating, knowing exactly
dialog: how much time you had left to work with.
text: A tear escapes onto his cheek and he looks over at Edward
text: who is staring back at him over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: So now I knew.
text: Neither says a word and Edward finally turns back to the
dialog: game.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON CARTER; fast asleep. A square of sunlight moves
text: across his eyes until he opens them and squints into the
text: white light. He rolls over, away from the window and face-
text: to-face with a single sheet of yellowed paper propped up
text: against his tower of books.
text: He pulls the paper close to his eyes and sees the title:
text: “EDWARD'S BUCKET LIST.”
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I‘ll be damned.
text: Just as Edward bustles out of the bathroom, arms filled
dialog: with toiletries.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thought you'd never get up.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: ‘Time is it?
text: Edward dumps the toiletries in his half-packed suitcase.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Six twenty-four. I’ve been up since--
dialog: I’ve had a lot on my mind.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (re: the paper)
dialog: So I see.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not bad, huh?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: A hot dog eating contest? “Kiss the most
dialog: beautiful woman in the world?” How you
dialog: figure on doing that?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: That’s one of the tough ones. We’1l
dialog: figure it out.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don’t take this the wrong way, but these
dialog: are a little...shallow?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You're out of your mind, there’s some
dialog: great stuff on there. What kind of tattoo
dialog: do you think I should get?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: None, actually... I think you
dialog: misunderstood-
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No, I understood you perfectly. Your
dialog: whole unfulfilled dreams thing is great
dialog: for someone with a few decades in front
dialog: of him, but I’m looking at weeks, months
dialog: if I’m lucky.
text: (as Thomas enters,
dialog: bewildered)
dialog: About time.
text: Thomas turns and walks out. Edward goes after him, pushes
text: him back into the room.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Pack it up, Tommy. We’re blowing this
dialog: popsicle stand.
dialog: (to Carter)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Your list was a little unrealistic so I
dialog: took the liberty of paring it down a
dialog: little.
text: Turns the paper over revealing Carter’s original list
text: which now has several of the items crossed off in red ink
dialog: - “Run for President”, etc.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What did you-- You had no right--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I got them both down to ten a piece so if
dialog: we budget our time properly we should be
dialog: able to bang ‘em all out before one of us
text: kicks it.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
text: (with an armful of business
dialog: suits)
dialog: Did you want these arranged by color as
dialog: usual or--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Forget ‘em. I’m only about comfort from
dialog: here on out. I dunno, give ‘em to some
dialog: orphans or something.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Orphans? You’ve been mixing medications
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You don’t seriously think-- I was being
dialog: metaphorical, you know, taking stock,
dialog: trying to understand something about--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Blah, blah, blah. Metaphors are for tea-
dialog: drinkers who read poetry out loud to
dialog: their sister. You said yourself you
dialog: haven't done anything. This is your last
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: To make a fool of myself?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: To have your own life. To spend what time
dialog: you have left remembering what it feels
dialog: like to have a future, rather than
text: wallowing in the past as a guinea pig in
dialog: Holcomb’s bullshit science experiment.
dialog: 37.
text: Carter stares at the floor, his mind racing...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You think it’s bullshit?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You know it is... What do you think,
dialog: Tommy. You're in our shoes, what would
dialog: you do?
text: Carter looks up at Thomas who thinks for a moment...
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: I think it’s the dumbest idea I’ve ever
dialog: heard...and you're fools if you don’t do

text: Edward makes for the elevators as Carter struggles to
text: catch up to him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What about my family?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What about them?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I can’t just abandon them.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why, because you’ve been doing such a
dialog: great job supporting them from the cancer
dialog: ward?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No, I just--
speaker_heading: HALL NURSE
dialog: (rushing to stop them)
dialog: Excuse me? Excuse me! Where do you think
dialog: you’re going?

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: NURSE SHING
dialog: I'm sorry, Mister Cole, we can’t let you

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Without a doctor’s written authorization.
dialog: Also my rule.
speaker_heading: NURSE SHING
dialog: Then you’ll understand my need to enforce
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Certainly. In fact, Tommy here’s got a

dialog: again?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Education.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Education, fantastic!
dialog: (to Thomas)
dialog: Really, education? What the hell you
dialog: doing working for me again?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: If I had a nickel for--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Anyway, Nurse Phyllis. Seeing as section
dialog: fourteen, paragraph three of Cole
dialog: Medical’s operations guidelines fails to
dialog: stipulate the kind of practitioner
dialog: necessary to facilitate a release, Doctor
text: Tommy promises to return with a note
dialog: granting us our freedom post haste.

dialog: inside.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CARTER

scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Edward helps Thomas load the luggage into the trunk of
text: the waiting limousine.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: It’s not like we’re flying off around the
dialog: world, at least not at first. I figure we
dialog: knock out the ones we can do locally
text: before heading over to Europe, then
dialog: Africa and--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I can’t go to Africa.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why not? I thought all black people dream
dialog: of going back to the homeland.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It’s not that. It’s-- I’ve never been on
text: an airplane.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (climbing inside the limo)
dialog: You're joking me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (stopping at the door)
dialog: No. I’m not.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You should've put that on the list.
text: He pulls Carter inside and the door closes.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: And so it began...
text: As the big limo roars away, the sound of which becomes...
text: THE ROAR OF AN ENORMOUS CROWD
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EDWARD AND CARTER - IN THE CENTER OF THE THRONG
dialog: 40.
text: Edward is electrified with nervous energy while Carter
text: looks like he'd rather be anywhere else.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Okay, so I figure middle of three then we
dialog: go. You ready?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Good.
text: He, along with everyone else around them, looks off in
dialog: the distance.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I want to go back... I’m serious, have
dialog: your man-- Where is he?
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Have him take me back to the hospital.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (grabbing him)
dialog: No you forget it. This isn’t rational.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Of course it’s not rational, that’s why
dialog: it’s so exciting.
dialog: (the crowd groans)
dialog: That’s our cue. You ready?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No!
text: Edward starts unbuttoning his shirt.
scene_heading: EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - NIGHT
text: As the Yankee outfielders jog out to their positions. The
text: crowd suddenly ROARS as the left fielder passes a naked
text: man who is jogging and waving across the grass.
text: Carter holds Edward's clothes, staring in disbelief as
text: Edward takes a victory lap towards right field.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh lord.
dialog: 41.
text: Stadium security guards hustle out after Edward, forcing
text: him to veer towards deep center field. The crowd boos, as
text: it appears they have him trapped, until he throws a fake
text: on one of his pursuers who trips in the grass much to the
text: crowd's delight.
text: Edward's headed back into left but the NYPD has joined
text: the chase and they’re closing in fast. Edward tries
text: another fake, but he’s tackled by a burly police officer
text: who brings him to the ground.
text: A second officer helps bring Edward’s arms behind his
text: back when something suddenly knocks him off his feet and
text: into his fellow officer.
scene_heading: INT. CARTER’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Rachel does her homework while Roger studies for the L-
text: SATS. The ball game is turned down low on the television.
text: Rachel is stuck on a particularly heinous geometry

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ow! What’d you do that for?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Look!
text: He turns the volume up on the television where Carter is
text: seen streaking away from the fallen policemen, clutching
text: his genitals with a look of incredulous fear on his face.
text: Brother and sister share a look before-
speaker_heading: RACHEL ROGER
dialog: Mom! Mom!
scene_heading: EXT. YANKEE STADIUM - NIGHT
text: Edward streaks after Carter, whooping and hollering.
text: Carter is actually beginning to enjoy himself until he
text: pulls up short. Edward comes to a stop next to him.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Oh crap.
text: They turn and run for the stands followed closely by
text: SEVERAL DOZEN security and police officers
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 42.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: Virginia walks up to the sergeant’s desk.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I’m here to post bail for my husband.
text: The NIGHT SERGEANT barely looks up from his paperwork as

scene_heading: NIGHT SERGEANT
text: Down the hall, second door on the right.
dialog: Sign here.
text: She is less than pleased.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE BOOKING ROOM - NIGHT
text: As Virginia counts out several hundred-dollar bills then
text: hands them to waiting BOOKING OFFICER.
scene_heading: BOOKING OFFICER
dialog: And if you could sign here, that should
dialog: do it.
text: Again, Virginia signs her name where instructed as the
text: officer speaks into a microphone.
speaker_heading: BOOKING OFFICER (CONT’D)
dialog: Release for Chambers, number three.
dialog: (to Virginia)
dialog: It'll be just a second.
text: Virginia walks to a chair across the room from where
text: Edward waits dressed in prison pajamas and Thomas’
dialog: overcoat.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: For the record it was my fault. I talked
dialog: him into it.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: He’s not a grown man?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Even so, I'd like to pay you back for the
dialog: bail, if--
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: That’s not necessary.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Really, it’s the least I can--
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: You've done quite enough, Mister Cole.
dialog: Carter spent thirty years killing himself
dialog: with those cigarettes. If the lord sees
dialog: fit to give him a second chance I'd like
dialog: it to be home with his family where he
dialog: belongs, not in prison, and certainly not
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: He hasn’t told you.
text: The door to the holding cell opens with a CLANG as Carter
text: is ushered out by a guard. He’s dressed in prison pajamas
text: and clings to a blanket as he shivers uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: Told me what?
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: Virginia wipes tears from her face as she walks
text: resolutely to her car. Carter follows her, watching
text: Edward as Thomas helps him to the limo.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I'm taking you back to the hospital. See
dialog: about getting you into Dr. Holcomb’s--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I can't.
text: She opens the driver’s side door. Carter stops on the
text: passenger's side.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Don’t play with me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Gin’, you don’t understand.
text: He sees Edward waiting at the limo door, watching Carter.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: (sees Edward watching)
dialog: I understand plenty. You two think you
dialog: can run off and act like children because
dialog: your time’s up so nothing matters
dialog: anymore. Why don’t you tell your children
dialog: that? See what they have to say when they
dialog: find out you've given up on them.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Given up?! I’ve spent my life giving up
dialog: everything to this family. Thirty years
text: greased up under the hood of a car to see
dialog: that they didn’t want for nothing! And
dialog: they didn’t, ‘Gin... I gave up every last
dialog: one of my ambitions and I wouldn’t take
dialog: any of it back, but if I am gonna die,
dialog: I'd like to go out with some idea of who
dialog: I could have been...of who I am.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: You’re my husband.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I know it. I just wish I knew what that
dialog: meant anymore...
text: He turns and walks over to the limo. He takes a last look

speaker_heading: KYLE (0.S.)
dialog: Need a hand?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No, I got it...
dialog: (to no avail)

speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (about all of it)
dialog: Fool... So foolish...
speaker_heading: KYLE (0.S.)
dialog: Wanna try to get it?
dialog: 45.
text: PULL BACK to reveal KYLE, young and brawny, sitting
text: immediately behind Carter. In fact, Carter is literally
text: sitting in Kyle’s lap.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: How do you suggest we do that?
text: Kyle stands suddenly - he’s huge, about 6’5” and Carter
text: is bound to his torso via a series of nylon jump straps.
text: As his feet dangle, Carter pitches forward until his
text: upper-body is almost horizontal while his hips are still
text: vertically strapped to Kyle.
text: Kyle duck-walks the suspended Carter over to the
text: prescription bottle. Carter extends his arms down but the
text: bottle rolls out of his grasp and into Edward’s
text: outstretched hand.
text: Carter looks up at him. Edward appears as if he hasn’t
dialog: touched a razor in days.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Not a word.
dialog: (grabs the bottle)
text: Back to the chair, Kyle.
text: Kyle waddles back to the chair. Carter almost hits his
text: head on the fuselage.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Kyle)
dialog: You'll have to forgive him, Kyle. He’s on
text: the outs with the wife.
speaker_heading: KYLE
text: (sympathetic hand on Carter’s
dialog: knee)
dialog: Been there, man.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Some things are not up for discussion.
speaker_heading: EDWARD

dialog: back.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
text: Thirty seconds to drop.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: She’s tough, your wife. That’s good. The
dialog: Sequel was tough like that.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The Sequel?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: The second Mrs. Edward Cole. God that
dialog: woman hated me.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: I can’t imagine why.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Maybe because he called her The Sequel.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Thank you, Kyle.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Know what I learned? That independence is
dialog: the only true gauge of human virtue; what
text: a man is and what he makes of himself.
dialog: Not what he has or hasn’t done for
dialog: others.
text: As the Co-Pilot pulls the door open, filling the cabin
text: with whipping wind. Kyle stands and moves them closer to
text: the door. Carter eyes the abyss outside. Edward is
text: nonplussed.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
text: Fifteen seconds. Fourteen. Thirteen.
speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CO-PILOT

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Sure you can.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Five. Four. Three.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I can’t do this!
text: He screams as Kyle jumps and they disappear out the door.
text: Edward watches them fall away then dons his goggles...
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Here we go.
scene_heading: EXT. SMALL AIRPLANE - DAY
text: As they leap from the plane, free-falling into the ether.
text: Everything goes quiet save for the flapping of their jump
dialog: suits.
text: The Co-Pilot dives towards Kyle and Carter, whose scream
text: grows louder as they approach, and lock hands so that
text: Carter and Edward are once again face to face.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: This is amazing!
text: Carter’s too busy being terrified to respond.
speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
text: Cords in five seconds.

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: You wanna do it?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Just let ‘er rip!
text: Carter is unsure which cord is which, so he pulls

dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Amazing. Nine toes in the grave he’s

speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: Okay, let’s deploy.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Right there’s the piss of it. When you’re

speaker_heading: CO-PILOT
dialog: We're in the red zone.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I was in love once.

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Suit yourself. Hey, when I’m done here,

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: We'll see.
text: A whistle sounds and Edward joins the other contestants

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Fun is fine. I have no problem with fun,

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: My work done my way. Personal, selfish,

speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Alone, bitter and scared of anything with

speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Depravity’s in the eye of the beholder.

dialog: Then, despite himself...
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Ah, screw it.
text: ON THE TRACK; the Mustang revs and roars alongside of the
text: Lamborghini before slamming into its side. The Mustang
text: pulls away then smashes into the car again.
text: Both cars careen off the track, punching through a chain
text: link fence then out into the outer parking lot.
text: LONG SHOT; as the two cars play demolition derby in the

scene_heading: EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: And face Darth Vader, I’m sure she’d love

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh, who cares.
scene_heading: INT. EDWARD'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Immense and unused with glowing hardwood floors and a

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Loser buys dinner... Grab this, will ya?

dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, come on. Turkey ain’t gonna carve

scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Paneled walls wrapping around an immense mahogany table.

speaker_heading: EDWARD

text: Balances the potatoes as he rummages through some drawers
dialog: he’s probably never opened before.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: How many people live here?
text: Edward digs up a load of silverware and woven placemats.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Just me... And don’t touch anything. This

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: We went to public school.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Oh.
text: The boys are too polite to laugh.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what, screw it. Just dump it all

text: Opposite her, Edward tries to mirror the layout. Gets it
dialog: right the second time.
text: -- Carter sits with eyes closed and hands pressed
text: together, saying grace. Edward watches him, eyes flicking
text: around the table to see the rest of the family have their
text: eyes closed.
text: -- JUMP CUTS as Carter hands Edward the carving knife;
text: Edward attacks the meat while the others look on;
text: Virginia watches as her perfect roast is hacked to
text: pieces; a blockish chunk lands on Lee’s plate.
text: -- Edward is a wallflower as the family tucks into the
text: meal, passing steaming dishes back and forth through a
text: lively discussion.
text: -- Edward’s on his second plate. He’s talking now,
text: telling a story that has Virginia mildly on edge. The
text: kids seem to love it, except Rachel who makes eyes at
text: him. Edward returns the look until she points to her
text: closed mouth. He gets the picture and snaps his mouth
text: shut, swallowing his food before continuing.
text: -- Carter stares glumly at the tiny slice of apple pie
text: sitting on his plate. Virginia is marking the size of
text: Edward's slice with a pie cutter. Edward motions for a
text: bigger piece. Virginia moves the cutter. Edward’s still
text: not satisfied. She moves it again.
text: -- IN THE KITCHEN; Edward coaxes a steaming cup of coffee
text: from the copper siphon. He puts it on a saucer and
text: carefully offers it to Virginia who has a chain-gang of
text: dishes going at the sink with Carter and the boys. She
text: allows a thin smile as she moves to accept the coffee,
text: then notices Carter behind Edward, shaking his head not
text: to take it. She looks back at Edward and politely demurs.
text: -- IN THE LIBRARY; Edward waits for the last bars of the
text: song to end before lifting the needle and carefully
text: sliding the record back into it’s sleeve.

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Health care’s a perilous industry. The
dialog: only way we can keep the hospitals from

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I understand. It’s business.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Not to the people we let go.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Do you find that difficult?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Only when you meet them. Which I try very

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I don’t blame you.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: We keep them from closing.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: You don’t owe me anything.
speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Give him back to me.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I’m not sure I can--

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I’m not asking for his sake. He’s the
dialog: only one who can decide what’s best for
dialog: him. I’m asking for myself.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I’m prepared for him to die. If there’s
dialog: one thing I understand it’s that, but
dialog: what I can’t do-- I’m his wife. I’m not

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: She wants you back. You can’t blame her

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Because I talked you into it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: (shakes his head; a beat)
dialog: At first, you tell yourself it’s a rut;

text: again... A year goes by, then another and
dialog: soon you’ve been sleeping only on your
dialog: side of the bed so long you forget how to
dialog: reach across and bring her into your
dialog: arms. You forget why you could never walk
text: down the sidewalk without holding her
dialog: hand or what it was about her smile that
dialog: stirred you. She’s the same girl I fell

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Not this. This is too important.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You don’t know me.

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: RACHEL

dialog: They weren’t planning on having more
dialog: kids. Also because when I was eight, I
dialog: chased my ball into the street when a car
dialog: came. It dragged me the whole block
dialog: before it stopped. I was in the hospital

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)

dialog: daughter, she went ahead anyway... We had
text: some distance for a while, she’s as

dialog: happy... The first time he hit her she
dialog: came to me. I wanted to-- I wanted to
text: beat him into the dirt until he begged
dialog: for forgiveness...but she wouldn’t let
dialog: me. She said it wasn’t his fault. He was
dialog: broke. Had a few drinks. Said she picked
dialog: the fight... I gave her some money and
text: she went back to him. When the money ran
dialog: out he did it again. She didn’t come to
dialog: me that time.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I did what any father would do. I got him
text: a job. Administration in a small hospital
dialog: in Great Neck. Gave him an office and a

speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I let him get comfortable. Let him think
dialog: he'd got it made until one night, when he
dialog: was out banging one of the nurses, I had
text: someone crack his computer and move a
text: bunch of money around. The next morning
dialog: he showed up for work and they arrested

dialog: Got him ten years for embezzlement.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And Emily?
speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: But I figure, if that’s what it took... I
dialog: grew up with nothing. I’m not proud of
dialog: everything I’ve done but I’ve played by

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: Where’s your uncle when we need him.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: They expect it to clear?
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Not for a month. Maybe two. That’s the
dialog: really shitty news, in case you were
dialog: wondering.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Next trip, huh?
dialog: They know full well the remoteness of that possibility.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Definitely.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I guess it’s home then.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Maybe not.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: The climbing season’s almost--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Everest isn’t the only majestic thing in
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MT. KILUEA VOLCANO - NIGHT
text: Spewing enormous plumes of ash and lava into the night
text: sky while rivers of molten rock stream from the crater.
text: Carter, Edward, and Thomas stand atop a neighboring peak.
text: Their faces hang in awe in the light of the eruption.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (to Carter)
dialog: What, no story?
text: Carter just shakes his head. Edward smiles and turns back
text: to the show. The ground rumbles. They feel it. Thomas
text: grabs Edward's hand to steady him. Edward does the same
dialog: with Carter.
text: SEEN FROM BEHIND; in silhouette, the three friends stand
text: hand-in-hand at the beginning and end of the world.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
text: Driving through the suburbs of New Jersey. Edward and
text: Carter sit side by side in the back. Taking measure of
dialog: what they’ve accomplished.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Thank you. Really.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Don’t be-- It’s nothing. It’s--
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: You're welcome, is what he’s trying to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Dead in a month my ass.
text: They laugh and he looks out the window.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Tommy, this isn’t Newark. You leave
dialog: your compass back in Beijing?
text: Thomas responds by putting up the divider between himself
text: and the back seat.
text: IN THE FRONT; Thomas exhales a deep breath.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: One more stop.
scene_heading: EXT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
text: Pulling up in front of a small ranch house.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Why are we-- Thomas, you off the
dialog: methadone? What the hell’s--
text: Stops as he sees something through the window. It’s a
text: woman. She’s standing in the window of the ranch house,
text: pacing back and forth as she talks on the phone.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: He kept tabs on her in case you ever
dialog: wanted to--
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (livid)
dialog: This was his idea?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: No, it was mine. Took the whole flight to
dialog: talk him into it.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Hey Carter, will you do something for me?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Name it.
text: Edward opens the door and climbs out of the car and walks
text: briskly away from the house. Carter watches him go...
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Go fuck myself.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURB STREET - NIGHT
text: Edward walks briskly through pools of light from the
text: street lamps. The limo pulls up and Carter jumps out.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: This is what you want?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Telling someone a story doesn’t invite
dialog: you to be a part of it. You had no right.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You're right, I didn’t. But she’s still
dialog: there. Maybe you took the long way home
dialog: but this is the road’s end.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Go away.
text: Walks past him. Carter follows.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What are you so afraid of?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I'm not afraid of anything anymore. If
dialog: you took a second to think it through
dialog: you'd realize--
dialog: (stops walking)
dialog: How did you see it? I knock on the door.
text: She answers.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
text: She’s surprised and angry but I tell her
dialog: how much I love her and missed her, and
text: gradually, piece by piece, the ice starts
dialog: to thaw?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It’s a start.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: No, it’s an end. Because you left one
dialog: thing out. You didn’t think-- How is it
dialog: fair that I show up after all this time
dialog: and inject myself back into her life when
dialog: I could be dead in a week?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You just--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How do I tell her...without her believing
dialog: that I’m only reaching out because I’m
dialog: scared to die alone and didn’t care
dialog: enough to consider what that would put
dialog: her through.
speaker_heading: CARTER
text: Everyone’s afraid to die alone.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I’m not everyone.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Then you're kidding yourself.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: If I am, I’m not the only one.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: What’s that supposed--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: What are you even doing here, Carter?
dialog: You've got a family and a wife whose
text: holding her heart in her hands while
dialog: you’re flying around the world to “find
dialog: the long way home.” Don’t you think she
dialog: knows?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Knows what?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: That you blame her for your lack of
dialog: accomplishment.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don’t you dare--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: That you say things like you “wouldn’t
dialog: trade your life with them for anything”,
dialog: but deep down you question yourself, so
dialog: you say those things because you know
dialog: they’re the right thing to say, rather
dialog: than what you really feel.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: You have no idea what I feel.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Maybe I don’t...but I know this. I love
dialog: my daughter. If I didn’t I would be back
dialog: there, knocking on her door. If you loved
dialog: your wife, you wouldn’t have to go home
dialog: because you’d have been there all along.
text: He pulls out the Bucket List.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: This is fun, Carter. That’s all it ever
dialog: was.
text: Then he tears it in half, then again, and lets the pieces
text: flutter to the sidewalk.
text: He sees Thomas standing by the limo.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Call me after you've taken him home.
text: He walks off. Carter stands there, staring at the
dialog: pavement...
text: Music begins; Jeff Buckley’s “Hallelujah” as Thomas walks
text: around the limo and opens the door for Carter. Carter
text: nods and walks towards him and then stops and turns to
text: look at the Bucket List as the pieces scatter
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: MONTAGE - AS THE SONG PLAYS OVER...
text: CARTER; walking up the steps to his house. He pauses at
text: the door then opens it and carries his suitcase inside.
text: EDWARD; hands in his pockets as he walks down a

dialog: 100.
text: CARTER; in bed with his wife, each on their own side.
text: Distance between them. .
text: EDWARD; in his high-rise office sitting at his desk which
text: faces the window with a view of the city shrouded in fog
text: below. His hair is growing in again. He brings a coffee
text: cup to his lips. It’s empty.
text: CARTER; at the hospital getting a check-up. Holcomb comes
text: in with test results. He’s amazed at Carter’s progress.
text: Carter smiles as he buttons up his shirt.
text: EDWARD; in his office kitchen. The box of Kopi Luwak is
text: empty. He searches the cupboard finding only a can of
text: instant. He puts the can back and walks out.
text: CARTER; at the dinner table with his family. Virginia is
text: saying grace. He’s watching her. She feels it and her
text: eyes open. He reaches out and takes her hand. She smiles
text: as their eyes hold each other and she continues to pray.
text: EDWARD; shakes his head as he switches off the Yankee
text: game. Moves to the bookshelf and browses until he removes
dialog: a book on the Himalayas.
text: VIRGINIA; waiting in the car for Carter. It’s autumn now
text: and the windows are painted with frost. A finger appears,
text: drawing letters on the windshield. WILL YOU MARRY ME?
text: EDWARD; working out on the elliptical machine at the gym.
text: It's late and the place is empty.
text: CARTER AND VIRGINIA; standing in the center of a shopping
text: mall, their friends and family around them as they renew
dialog: their vows.
text: EDWARD; stepping out of the shower. Wipes the steam from
text: the mirror revealing his full head of hair and the
text: journal of tattoos over his body. He touches the erupting
text: volcano on his forearm.
text: CARTER; home in bed staring at a small plastic bull. He
text: puts it away as Virginia comes in, dressed in her
dialog: nightgown.
text: She climbs in bed and he reaches across and pulls her to
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Happy second honeymoon.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Happy second honeymoon.
dialog: 101.
text: They kiss. His hands move to her hips under the covers.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Do you have any idea how long it’s been?
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Do I want to know?
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: No, I don’t think you do.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I love you, ‘Gin.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I know you do.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: It wasn’t that I ever stopped loving you
dialog: so much as I forgot the reasons you loved
dialog: me.
dialog: (she touches his face)
dialog: Remember that night, when I took you to
dialog: the Bowl-O-Rama over on fourteenth
dialog: street?
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: How do you think I could forget our first
dialog: date? You wore that shirt with the stain
dialog: on the front and your black shoes and
dialog: brown belt.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: And you wore a blue dress with little
text: bows down the back.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I can’t believe you--
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I was so out of my league. I remember
dialog: thinking, “What’s a girl looks like this
dialog: doing slumming with a kid who's best
dialog: shirt got a stain on the front?”
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: You weren’t worthy.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: I’ve never been worthy of you.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I was joking, baby. I knew that night
dialog: after I got back. I told my mother I was
dialog: your’s forever if you’d have me...
dialog: Forever’s just getting started.
text: They kiss again, more passionately until she pulls away
text: and stands out of bed.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I got something for you. Wasn’t sure I'd
dialog: need it.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Don’t be long now.
text: She goes into the bathroom and closes the door halfway.
text: We see her feet stepping out of her pajamas and into
text: something black and lacy.
text: When the door opens her hair is down and spilling over
text: her shoulders and a thin, satin negligee.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Carter?
text: The bed is empty. She walks around it.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
dialog: So we’re playing games now? You think you
dialog: can get me all riled up then--
text: She stops as she sees him face down on the floor, his
text: hands twitching.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Carter!
text: She turns him over to see his eyes are rolled back into
text: his head as the seizure storms through him.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Roger!
text: She finds his wallet on the bedside table and forces it
text: between his teeth. Roger appears at the door--
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: What’s the--

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: AMERY
dialog: That’s a lot of food.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I’m a bottomless pit. Besides, I’m in

speaker_heading: AMERY

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: For someone my age? You can say it.

speaker_heading: MAITRE'D
dialog: I’m sorry Mister Cole. It’s your driver.

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Edward emerges from the elevator and walks pointedly

scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB

dialog: Edward.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: When did this happen?
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: It came out of nowhere but it’s his brain

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: So you can operate?
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
text: Day after tomorrow.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: And he'll be alright?
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: In his condition it’s not-- The odds
dialog: aren’t what we’d like them to be.
text: Edward sees there’s little hope. Resumes walking into--
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Where Carter is back in bed covered in tubes. Virginia
text: lies with Rachel on the bed next to him. Rachel is
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: Quiet. I wasn’t sure if I should call

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Of course. Please. Is there anything I

speaker_heading: VIRGINIA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CARTER (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CARTER

speaker_heading: EDWARD

speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Can he be moved without hurting him?
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: Well, technically yes, but--
speaker_heading: EDWARD

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: Pull the car up front.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB

speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Plain English. I’m taking my friend out

text: Carter runs a finger down the items, until he reaches
text: “LAUGH UNTIL I CRY.” He crosses it off shakily with the
text: pen. Only four remain.
text: His finger stops on the half finished “#11) GET BACK IN
text: TOUCH” Edward sees this.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: There's a difference between dying alone
dialog: and living like you're already dead...
dialog: Finish the list, Edward.
text: He places the envelope atop the list.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Go home.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: As Holcomb enters, scrubbed for surgery, with several
dialog: nurses.
scene_heading: DR. HOLCOMB
dialog: We're ready.
text: Carter reaches out for Virginia’s hand and presses it to
dialog: his heart.
speaker_heading: VIRGINIA
dialog: I’ll be here when you get back.
speaker_heading: CARTER
dialog: Forever’s just getting started.
text: Her hand slips out of his as he’s wheeled out of the

scene_heading: INT. GULFSTREAM PRIVATE JET - NIGHT
text: Edward loses himself in the raindrops sliding down the

text: over. On the front is his name and address. He thinks a
text: moment, steeling himself before he opens it.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT
text: Carter lies unconscious with a tube in his mouth as the
text: surgeons do their work. In contrast to Edward, he looks
text: completely at peace.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Edward. It’s turning cold out here
dialog: in Newark and the trees are like
text: skeletons beneath the lamp posts.
text: Winter’s almost upon us and despite what
dialog: the doctors tell me, I know it will be my
dialog: last.
scene_heading: EXT. THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT
text: Seen from the Hudson, the mandala of lights reflect like
text: jewels in the water. Carter sits on the edge of a pier
dialog: taking in the view...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: You know how I love to tell stories so if
dialog: you can spare a few minutes I think I’ve
dialog: got a good one for you...
text: He returns to the letter in his lap, and resumes
dialog: writing...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: There was an old farmer spent his life
dialog: working the earth to give his family all
dialog: the cares and comforts he’d never had.
scene_heading: INT. GULFSTREAM PRIVATE JET - NIGHT
text: Edward reads the words as Carter speaks them.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: One day the farmer fell sick and he
dialog: called his sons to his bedside where he
text: took up a bundle of sticks and said to
dialog: his eldest son, "Show me that you can
text: break it.” The son strained and strained,
dialog: but with all his efforts was unable to
dialog: break the bundle.
text: Edward finishes the letter and wipes the tears from his
text: cheeks. The flashing wing lights of the plane reflect the
text: raindrop on the window indelibly onto his face.
scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Seen from above as Roger, Lee and Rachel lie in bed with
text: their mother, clinging to her as she prays.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: The other sons also tried, but none of
dialog: them could break it. "Untie the bundle,"
dialog: said the farmer, "And each of you take a
dialog: stick."
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURB STREET - DAWN
text: As Edward walks up the path to his daughter’s house. He
text: knocks on the door without hesitation.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: When they had done so, he called out to
dialog: them, "Now, break them," and each stick
dialog: was easily broken...
text: The door opens revealing Emily. She’s surprised and her
text: sleepy features harden instantly. Edward begins to talk.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: No man is an island, my friend. We’re
dialog: just not built that way.
scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Virginia scoops instant coffee into a styrofoam cup. She
text: looks up as Holcomb appears at the other end of the
text: hallway walking towards her. His face is unreadable.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: You measure yourself by the people who
dialog: measure themselves by you, and no matter
dialog: how you battle the current--
dialog: 117.
scene_heading: EXT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAWN
text: Thomas leans against the limo, watching through the
text: window as Carter and Emily speak. Her guard is still up,
dialog: but she’s listening...
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: --our lives are streams flowing into the
dialog: same river towards whatever heaven lies
text: in the mist beyond the falls.
scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: We can’t see Holcomb’s face or what he’s saying as he
text: reaches Virginia, but her expression says it all. The
text: coffee cup slips from her hands and lands at her feet,
text: spilling onto the floor.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Find the joy in your life, Edward. Close
dialog: your eyes and let the waters take you.
scene_heading: INT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAWN
text: Edward shakes Emily’s hand goodbye. She’s not giving in,
text: but it’s a start. He reaches for the front door just as a
text: LITTLE GIRL, still half-asleep, comes out from the back
text: bedroom. Edward is stunned.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Open your heart and listen to the
dialog: mountain...
text: He looks up at Emily who says something to the little
text: girl. He crouches down as the girl walks right up to him
text: and lays her head on his shoulder. His eyes are full as
text: he looks up at Emily in amazement then slowly kisses his
text: granddaughter’s head.
scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES OPERATING THEATER - NIGHT
text: Carter's face is at peace. Virginia’s face comes into
text: frame and kisses him softly. Her tears fall onto his
text: eyelids and continue down his cheeks.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: I promise you’ll be heard.
scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Virginia stands in the doorway, staring at her sleeping
text: children. Rachel opens her eyes and looks at her mother.
dialog: 118.
scene_heading: EXT. EMILY’S HOUSE - DAWN
text: Edward walks the path towards Thomas and the waiting
dialog: limo.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: We're a bundle of sticks, you and I, be
dialog: it in this world or the one that follows.
dialog: I will be forever grateful for the joy
dialog: your life has brought to mine.
text: Thomas opens the car door for him.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: So that’s your daughter?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (emotional)
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: THOMAS
dialog: Pretty.
text: Edward looks angry. Thomas waits for the rebuke. Instead,
text: Edward pats him on the shoulder before climbing into the
text: car. Thomas looks back at the house as the lights go out.
scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE - DAWN
text: Edward pulls the list out of his pocket. With the red pen
text: he crosses out: “KISS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE
dialog: WORLD.”
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Your friend always... Carter.
text: Edward lowers the window and looks out at the painted
text: dawn sky as the limo drives away. He stares for several
text: moments then closes his eyes and listens...
speaker_heading: EDWARD (V.O.)
dialog: Good afternoon. My name is Edward Cole
dialog: and I’m not much of a storyteller.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LARGE ROOM - DAY
text: Edward is in his business suit again. His game face on.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I’m a business man, a good one. I run
dialog: hospitals.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: We take sick people and make them well
dialog: again. Sometimes we succeed and sometimes
dialog: we fail, but we’re getting better at it
dialog: every day... I started out with nothing
dialog: but cold ambition, and over the years my
dialog: company grew until I had everything I
dialog: ever wanted... I know now that-- I know
dialog: now that I was never a wealthy man until
dialog: my best friend came into my life...and
dialog: from this incredible turnout, it only
text: verifies the fact that Carter was truly
dialog: the richest man I know.
text: CAMERA TRACKS until we’re behind Edward revealing his
text: audience of nearly a THOUSAND MOURNERS filling every last
text: inch of the room including Carter’s family who sit in the
text: front row. Familiar faces in the crowd include Manny,
text: Holcomb, Nurse Shing, parents and players of the soccer
dialog: team, etc.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what most people say at
dialog: these things, so I’1l just tell you what
dialog: I think Carter would want you to know.
dialog: He’s dead and I still can’t shut him
dialog: up... He loved his children more than his
dialog: own heart. He loved his wife more than
text: his own soul. He took the long way home
dialog: but he made it back and you took him in
dialog: and made him whole again and you will
dialog: never know how grateful he was.
text: His eyes move from the family to Thomas who stands
text: against the wall with Emily and her daughter.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: (taking out the Bucket List)
dialog: We saw the world together. Pretty amazing
dialog: when you think that only nine months ago
dialog: we were strangers... He saved my life,
dialog: and he knew it before I did.
text: With the pen, he crosses out: “HELP A COMPLETE STRANGER
dialog: FOR THE GOOD.”
text: Beneath it, the last remaining task lies unfulfilled:
text: “LISTEN TO THE MOUNTAIN AND BE HEARD.” Slowly, the words
dialog: on the page--
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 120.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PEAK OF EVEREST - DAY
text: As the climber from the opening scene finally arrives at
dialog: the peak.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (V.O.)
dialog: Carter gave me a book once. It was about
dialog: a man who knew a thing or two about the
dialog: world.
text: The climber walks over to a flat stone and lifts it onto
text: its side. He removes his gloves revealing a wedding ring
text: on his left hand.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: The man said: “Learn as if you were going
dialog: to live forever. Live as if you were
dialog: going to die tomorrow.”
text: His hands lift to his face, removing the oxygen mask and
text: hood revealing THOMAS.
text: He reaches down and lifts A FROZEN CHOCK FULL O’ NUTS CAN
text: from its resting place in the hole beneath the rock. He
text: wipes off a section of frost with his thumb revealing:
text: A PHOTOGRAPH taped to the can -- Carter and Virginia at
text: their second wedding surrounded by their family.
text: Thomas sets the can on the snow then opens his backpack
text: and reaches down to the bottom--
speaker_heading: EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Tomorrow comes for all of us.
text: --and removes A SECOND CHOCK FULL 0’ NUTS CAN which he
text: places on the ground next to the first.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s what we do in-between that makes us
dialog: who we are.
text: CLOSE ON A NEWER PHOTOGRAPH; taped to the second coffee
text: can. It’s Edward. He’s old and grey.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.)
dialog: Edward Perriman Cole died in May. It was
dialog: a Sunday, in the afternoon, and there
dialog: wasn’t a cloud in the sky...
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that he’s closely surrounded
text: by Thomas, Emily and their THREE CHILDREN, hands
dialog: intertwined with--
dialog: 121.
text: --Carter’s grandchildren, each of whom stands with their
text: parents and Virginia. One family.
text: Edward is smiling like we’ve never seen.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He was seventy-nine years old.
text: Finally, Thomas deposits both cans into the hole beneath
dialog: the rock.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Even now, I can’t claim to understand the
dialog: measure of a life, but I can tell you
dialog: this...
text: Thomas replaces the rock over the coffee cans.
speaker_heading: CARTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I know that when he died his eyes were
dialog: closed, and his heart was open... I know
dialog: that he could hear the mountain...
text: THE CAMERA lingers on the rock for a moment then tilts up
text: to reveal the breathtaking view of the entire world
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: CARTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: And I know the mountain heard him in
dialog: return.
text: THE END.
