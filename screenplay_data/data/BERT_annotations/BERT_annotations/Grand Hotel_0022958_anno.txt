speaker_heading: PROLOGUE
dialog: Berlin.
dialog: Season is March.
text: Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours.
text: Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day.
dialog: Time: The Present.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR
dialog: Show general natural action of people going in and people
dialog: coming out but in it is the definite inference of people
text: arriving and people leaving the big hotel.
scene_heading: MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA
text: PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and
dialog: hearing.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE OUT.
text: DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and
text: then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business
dialog: jumble.
text: CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the
text: steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it
text: passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.
text: THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement
text: across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA
text: now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action.
text: Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE
text: PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.
text: At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who
text: emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish
dialog: who she is.
text: THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear
dialog: her saying to Senf:
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya will not want her
dialog: car.
text: This line is only just above the general clatter of action
text: but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain --
text: and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going
text: towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance,
dialog: saying:
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.
text: The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a
text: section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in
text: profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of
text: people drinking before their lunch.
text: We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands,
text: looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde,
text: is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at
text: the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his
text: face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to
dialog: her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a
text: chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at
text: his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA
text: and he moves out towards the lobby.
text: BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the
text: main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of
text: waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A
text: string orchestra is playing.
text: Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous
dialog: Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important
text: to a table.
text: THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just
text: as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel
text: now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:
speaker_heading: MAITRE D'HOTEL
dialog: Where is that gentleman's soup?
text: The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to
text: argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to
text: another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Where's that soup?
text: Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM,
text: into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's
text: counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that
text: moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Quick -- come on -- come on...
text: The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception
text: of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll
text: slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over
text: a cauldron of soup.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small
text: cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and
text: hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face --
text: She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has
text: filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down
text: the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.
text: THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr.
text: Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette
text: carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A
text: horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him,
text: he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to
dialog: tear the place down.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: (anxious voice)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Cold.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (near Preysing's elbow)
dialog: Mr. Preysing...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (in same voice)
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --
text: Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM --
text: He walks out through the door...
text: DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:
text: Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA
text: TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl.
text: Bellboy is with Preysing.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yes, Mr. Preysing --
text: Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of
dialog: switchboard.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (to boy)
dialog: You told me it was on -- you said
dialog: the call was through.
dialog: (he waits irritably)
speaker_heading: SECOND GIRL
dialog: (to first)
dialog: Who's in number three?
speaker_heading: FIRST GIRL
dialog: Senf -- the hall porter.
dialog: (Girl looks off at...)
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: SENF IN TELEPHONE BOOTH
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Yes, it's Senf, the head porter,
dialog: Grand Hotel... Are you at the
dialog: Clinic?,... How's my wife?,... Is
dialog: she in pain?,... Isn't the child
dialog: coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy
dialog: for you to talk... Get away?,... No,
dialog: I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's
dialog: like being in jail. Oh, I hope the
dialog: child comes along all right.
text: At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO NEXT
text: BOOTH. Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from
text: desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off
dialog: the wire... No... I was talking to
dialog: Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh...
dialog: Hello!... Is that you dear?... How
dialog: is everything at home?... What do
dialog: you hear from the factory?... No...
dialog: How are the children?... I left my
dialog: shaving set at home... Yes, is your
dialog: father there?... Hello, father?...
dialog: Our stock has gone down twenty-three
dialog: points. If our merger with the Saxonia
dialog: doesn't go through -- I don't know
dialog: what we can do... Hello, hello...
dialog: yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything
dialog: depends on Manchester... If they
dialog: refuse to come in -- well, we will
dialog: be in bad shape... no... Rely on me,
dialog: I'll make it go through -- I'll make
dialog: it go through... Waiting?... Yes,
dialog: I'm still speaking...
text: THE CAMERA THEN PANS TO Suzette. Suzette is already in the
text: booth and she is waiting for Mr. Meierheim to come on.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: (starting to speak)
dialog: Hello, Mr. Meierheim?... Is that,
dialog: Mr. Meierheim?... This is Suzette...
text: Suzette, Madam Grusinskaya's maid...
dialog: No... Madam Grusinskaya will not go
dialog: to the rehearsal... No... Madam is
text: in a terrible state, she didn't sleep
dialog: all night -- She's very tired... No,
dialog: I'm speaking from a booth -- I didn't
dialog: want to speak in front of her... I
dialog: gave her a tablet of veronal... She's
dialog: sleeping now... You had better come
dialog: to the hotel, I'm afraid...
text: PAN TO BARON just entering booth. He is lighting a cigarette.
dialog: (receiver down - trick)
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (speaking into
dialog: telephone)
dialog: Baron Gaigern speaking. Yes, Baron
dialog: Gaigern himself. Where are you?,...
dialog: Good... No -- first, I need money. I
dialog: need it right now. I have to make a
dialog: showing... That's my business. I
dialog: hope to do it tonight... at the
dialog: theatre or after the show... But
dialog: money -- for the hotel bill, for
dialog: tips... I don't need advice, I need
dialog: money!... Now, listen...
scene_heading: PAN TO KRINGELEIN - booth.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Who is that, This is... Hello,
dialog: hello!... Who is that... Heinrich?
dialog: This is Kringelein. Hello, Heinrich.
dialog: This is Otto Kringelein. Hello! Can
dialog: you hear me?... I've got to speak
dialog: very quickly. Every minute costs two
dialog: marks ninety... What?... Otto
dialog: Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin,
dialog: staying at the best hotel, the Grand
dialog: Hotel... No, don't you understand? I
dialog: want to explain, but I must do so
dialog: quickly, it costs so much. Please
dialog: don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello!
dialog: Listen! You know that will I made
dialog: before my operation? I gave it to
dialog: you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy
dialog: it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin
dialog: to see a great specialist about that
dialog: old trouble of mine... It's pretty
dialog: bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I
dialog: can't live much longer.
dialog: (louder)
dialog: I haven't long to live! That's what's
dialog: the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on
dialog: the line? No, it isn't nice to be
dialog: told a thing like that. All sorts of
dialog: things run through your head. I am
dialog: going to stay here in Berlin. I am
text: never coming back to Fredersdorf.
dialog: Never! I want to get something out
dialog: of life, too. You plague, and bother,
dialog: and save -- and all of a sudden you
dialog: are dead. Heinrich... You don't say
dialog: anything. I am in the Grand Hotel,
dialog: do you understand, the most expensive
dialog: hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a
dialog: room here. The very best people stay
dialog: here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I
dialog: saw him -- not five minutes after I
dialog: was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell
dialog: him exactly what I think of him.
dialog: Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all
dialog: my savings; my life insurance, too;
dialog: I cashed in all my policies, the
dialog: sick benefit fund, the old age
dialog: pension, the unemployment insurance,
dialog: the burial fund and everything...
dialog: What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich.
dialog: I have to hang up now. I have to pay
dialog: three times overcharge. Just think,
dialog: Heinrich! There's music here all day
dialog: long. And in the evening, they go
dialog: around in full dress... Yes, sometimes
dialog: I have pain, but I can stand it.
dialog: Everything is frightfully expensive
dialog: here. You can imagine, the Grand
dialog: Hotel... What? Time's up...
text: Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor
text: approaching through Kringelein's booth. He is looking down
dialog: at something.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: COMPLETE REVERSE - MATCH SHOT - SHOOT THEM BOTH TOGETHER
text: Doctor is looking down at parcel. Kringelein's voice on same
text: track. CAMERA BACKS UP. Show doctor as he passes various
text: booths -- voices of respective people come up sharply.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I'm a sick man -- Heinrich -- Hello -
dialog: hello -- Operator -- every minute
dialog: two marks ninety.
text: Doctor passes Baron's booth next.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Dangerous?... That's my business...
dialog: I'll do it tonight -- ...I'll do it
dialog: alone.
text: Doctor passes Suzette's booth.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Madam is afraid -- she will never
dialog: dance again -- there was no applause
dialog: last night --
text: Doctor passes Preysing's booth.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Yes -- the merger -- Manchester --
dialog: it is my business as much as yours --
dialog: we've already lost eighty-five
dialog: thousand --
text: Doctor passes Senf's booth.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: I'm on duty -- I can't leave the
dialog: Grand Hotel -- it's like being in
dialog: prison -- the baby --
dialog: Doctor crosses to telephone operator:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to operator)
dialog: Any calls?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: No, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (half to himself)
dialog: Grand Hotel -- people -- coming --
dialog: going... Who cares... nothing ever
dialog: happens.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: SEQUENCE "#1"
speaker_heading: FACADE OF HOTEL
text: showing electric sign -- odd angle -- THE GRAND HOTEL --
text: unlighted.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ELECTRIC CONTROL ROOM
text: small section -- Engineer pulling down lever.
speaker_heading: FACADE OF HOTEL
text: sign flashes on.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO: EXTERIOR HOTEL
text: Shooting directly on swinging door -- normal crowd action.
dialog: Tea-dansant at this hour is daily rendezvous for smart demi-
dialog: mondaines, gigolos, out-of-town travelers, etc. -- These
dialog: types indicated.
text: In the distance we hear music.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE SUDDENLY TO:
scene_heading: YELLOWROOM - NEAR SHOT OF BAND
text: This same music is being played by the Eastman Jazz Band in
text: the Yellow Room of the hotel.
text: THE CAMERA does not wait but backs down the room. It is the
dialog: hour of the tea-dansant.
text: As the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality
text: the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron --
text: he proceeds through the door of the restaurant --
dialog: Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the
dialog: restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be
dialog: necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor
text: upstairs -- giving sense of distance.
text: The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds
text: through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty
text: woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is
text: seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FLORIST SHOP
text: Pretty girl is there, she has seen him coming. She turns
text: from the door and hands him a box of orchids, already tied
dialog: in ribbon.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Good little girl -- nice ones?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Yes, Baron.
text: The Baron would stay and flirt but he has a mission; he
dialog: leaves.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LOBBY
text: In the lobby we pick up the Baron leaving the florists with
text: small box of flowers -- he crosses quickly to Senf's desk.
text: SHOT OVER SENF'S HEAD as the Baron puts the flowers down.
text: Senf is busy.
text: The Baron is whistling gaily -- tapping his fingers on the
dialog: flower box -- he is good-natured and patient.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to Clerk -- as
dialog: telephone bell rings)
dialog: Is that for me?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to
dialog: be brought.
dialog: (he replaces the
dialog: receiver)
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to one of the bellboys)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be
dialog: brought.
text: Boy leaves. We hear his voice out of scene at the door.
speaker_heading: BELLBOY'S VOICE
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya's car... to be
dialog: brought.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Good evening, Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (amiably)
dialog: Good evening. Will you send these up
dialog: to Madam Grusinskaya?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Yes, Baron.
text: (he hands the box of
dialog: flowers to the clerk)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya.
text: Clerk hands box to bellboy.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Room one-seventy -- Madam Grusinskaya.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (to Senf)
dialog: Have you my tickets for the theatre?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Oh yes, Baron --
dialog: (to Clerk)
dialog: Baron von Gaigern's seats for Madam
dialog: Grusinskaya.
text: Telephone rings again. Clerk picks it up.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to Clerk)
dialog: For me?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (at telephone -- shakes
dialog: his head)
dialog: No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not
dialog: to be brought.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to boy)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be
dialog: brought.
text: The Clerk hands Senf the tickets which Senf hands to the
dialog: Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Charge them...
text: As the Baron is picking up his tickets he looks around quickly
text: as he hears the voice of Pimenov, who has arrived apparently
text: from his afternoon walk from the rehearsal at the theatre.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (to Senf)
dialog: Good evening -- my key -- one sixty-
dialog: eight.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Oh -- good evening, Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: How's the beautiful lady?
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the
dialog: truth, Baron -- tonight we are a
dialog: little bit nervous. Were you at the
dialog: theatre last night?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya
dialog: dances.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Well -- last night was not so good.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I thought she was splendid!
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Yes -- but the audience.
text: At that moment they are interrupted by a vehement little
text: Japanese with his wife. They are arguing with the Clerk. The
text: Japanese speaks in Japanese to his wife.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (to Japanese)
text: The parquot loges are behind the
text: parquet chairs.
speaker_heading: JAPANESE
dialog: Then they've put me back and I want
dialog: to be up in front. How is that, chairs
dialog: in front of loges?
text: Senf is speaking to a lady at the same time.
speaker_heading: SENF
text: The train leaves at seven-thirty,
dialog: Madam. That is the only through train --
text: the dining car goes along.
text: The Baron and Pimenov exchange glances as the little Japanese
text: speaks volubly to his wife.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: It's always so quiet here.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: If you occupied the room next to
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya, you would
text: appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: My dear sir, I would gladly change
dialog: rooms with you.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (effeminately)
dialog: No doubt you would, Baron. But do
dialog: you know, I'm quite indispensable to
dialog: her. I'm her ballet master and her
dialog: nurse. I hardly belong to myself
dialog: anymore. But, there you are, it's
dialog: Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring
dialog: her.
text: At that moment, Zinnowitz pushes past them.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Pardon me.
dialog: (addressing Senf)
dialog: Is Mr. Preysing in -- I am Doctor
dialog: Zinnowitz.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to bellboy)
dialog: Mr. Preysing -- from Fredersdorf --
speaker_heading: BELLBOY
dialog: (quickly -- paging)
dialog: Mr. Preysing --
text: Preysing steps quickly into scene.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Have I kept you waiting?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from
dialog: Manchester.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: No news yet?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: No. No word.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Everything depends on the Manchester
dialog: merger.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I know -- I know.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as
dialog: your lawyer I made it my business to
dialog: broach the matter ---
text: As they begin to move out of scene, Zinnowitz calls back to
dialog: Senf.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: I'm expecting a young woman -- a
dialog: stenographer -- she will ask for Mr.
text: Preysing. Ask her to wait.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Yes, Doctor Zinnowitz.
text: As they move out of scene, telephone bell goes.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to Clerk)
dialog: For me?
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: No -- letters to two-eighty.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to Clerk)
dialog: If a young woman, a stenographer, --
dialog: etc.
text: This just covers the scene.
text: The Baron and Pimenov are laughing at something one of them
dialog: has said which brings our attention to them again.
text: At that moment the Doctor enters the scene.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Any letters?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: No, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Telegrams?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: No, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Anyone asked for me?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Nobody, Doctor.
text: The Doctor turns slowly away, taking out a cigarette with
text: his one hand.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (glancing at Doctor)
dialog: The war.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
text: (looking up from his
dialog: letter -- glances
dialog: off at the doctor)
dialog: That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You
dialog: know him?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yes -- He always seems to be waiting
dialog: for something -- and nothing ever
dialog: comes.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: The war dropped him here and forgot
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (beams)
dialog: Yes, I was in the war.
scene_heading: CUT IN: FLASH OF DOCTOR --
text: He turns as he hears the Baron say this.
text: He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron...
text: then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get
text: Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception
text: desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
dialog: Please -- please pay some attention
dialog: to me -- I have no time.
dialog: Pan back to desk:
speaker_heading: ROHNA
dialog: (engaged with a lady
dialog: and gentleman, who
dialog: have just arrived)
dialog: If you will wait one moment, sir.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I
dialog: waited three days before I got a
dialog: room at all and what a room that is.
speaker_heading: ROHNA
dialog: It's a very nice room and inexpensive,
dialog: sir.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Did I say I wanted a cheap room to
dialog: live in -- when I came here did I
dialog: ask for a cheap room? Did I?
text: Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty little
text: gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager.
speaker_heading: ROHNA
dialog: Just one moment, sir.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every
dialog: day is precious -- every hour --
dialog: Every minute.
text: Second Clerk is looking straight at him.
text: Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and
dialog: proceeds:
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I came here because I wanted to live
dialog: here, two weeks, maybe three -- God
dialog: only knows -- I've told you I'll pay --
dialog: I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired --
dialog: I'm ill -- I can't wait.
text: As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is
dialog: watching.
text: Assistant Manager enters.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT MANAGER
dialog: Has the gentleman a complaint?
text: Rohna and Kringelein speak together.
speaker_heading: ROHNA
text: The gentleman is dissatisfied with
text: room number five fifty-nine.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I certainly have a complaint -- and
dialog: a fair one.
text: He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov
text: enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The
text: bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and
text: looks up.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I came here from a long distance to
dialog: stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a
dialog: room -- a big room -- like you would
dialog: give General Director Preysing --
dialog: I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can
dialog: pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you
dialog: give him a little room, way up in
text: the corner with the hot water pipes
text: going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
text: (he bangs at the desk
dialog: with his fist)
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: This gentleman can have my room.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Send his bags up to my room.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh -- but -- I --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You're tired. I can see that.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have
dialog: been ill...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You are ill.
text: During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna
text: quietly. The manager how turns.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Mr. Kringelein will take room number
dialog: one-seventy-six, one of our most
text: expensive rooms. It is large and on
text: the front with bath.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (subdued -- exhausted --)
dialog: Does that mean that the bath is my
dialog: own? --- Private?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Certainly, sir.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks.
dialog: That's what I want -- a large room
text: on the front with a private bath --
dialog: Yes, that's what I want. I can pay
dialog: now if you like.
text: He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: That will not be necessary.
text: The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to
dialog: the new room.
text: Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has
text: noticed the money, stoops to pick it up.
text: In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat.
text: Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his
dialog: sleeve.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Thank you, sir.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Not at all, sir.
dialog: (he beams)
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (finding a friendly
dialog: face)
dialog: Permit me -- my name is Kringelein --
dialog: from Fredersdorf.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm Baron von Gaigern.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, a Baron!
dialog: (he is impressed)
text: Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly
dialog: popular.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (turning to Doctor)
dialog: Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor --
dialog: I am --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I know -- I know -- when a man's
dialog: collar is an inch too big for him --
dialog: I know he is ill.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
dialog: (his finger goes
dialog: nervously to his
dialog: collar)
text: Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out.
text: At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where
text: he has bought the evening papers.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (to doctor)
dialog: Is this gentleman a Baron, too?
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Unfortunately no.
text: The Manager comes into scene.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Again?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Please.
text: Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him.
text: At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Have you a minute now?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No -- I told you not to come in this
dialog: lobby.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Time's getting short.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I've told you a hundred times not to
dialog: speak to me with a cigarette in your
dialog: mouth.
text: Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still
text: holds it in his hand.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: I want to speak --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Not now.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: The Baron leaves.
text: General moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov,
text: Kringelein and the Doctor.
speaker_heading: SENF'S DESK
text: On another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in
text: Flaemmchen. Flaemmchen enters. Her back to CAMERA.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (we hear her ask)
dialog: Mr. Preysing.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Will you wait please.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: The stenographer is to go up -- Mr.
text: Preysing telephoned.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Thanks --
dialog: (calling off to
dialog: elevator)
dialog: Heigh! -- Wait!
text: She crosses to elevator.
text: THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR
scene_heading: WITH HER.
text: As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns
text: around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking
text: down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see
text: on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed.
dialog: NOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen.
text: The lift ascends.
speaker_heading: UPPER CORRIDOR
text: Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for
text: the numbers. She moves out of scene.
text: The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move
text: straight down the hall.
text: Pimenov is chatting volubly.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (to Baron)
dialog: Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she
dialog: receive anyone. She can't -- theatre,
dialog: trains, hotels -- hotels, trains
dialog: theatre.
text: We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr.
text: Preysing's room.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I must go and dress -- she'll be
dialog: waking up and calling for me.
text: He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of
dialog: his ballet.
text: At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to
text: Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there
text: is an amusing exchange of glances between them.
text: Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice.
speaker_heading: PREYSING'S VOICE
dialog: Come in.
text: She opens the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: PREYSING'S ROOM
text: Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He
text: stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel.
text: He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him
text: very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: What...! --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I'm the stenographer.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Then you will please wait outside.
text: He is very much affronted.
text: Flaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the
dialog: altogether --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Don't hurry -- take your time.
text: She goes out of the room and shuts the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: UPPER CORRIDOR
text: Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room.
text: Baron loitering in the hall. (Whistling as outlined). Baron
text: approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that
text: Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues
text: whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say:
dialog: "Are you mad?"
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Like dancing?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Not with strangers.
text: Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is
dialog: going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to
dialog: keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (turning to Flaemmchen)
dialog: Never?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You're a fool!
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yes, I am rather.
text: He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets.
text: She glances impatiently at her watch.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: He must be very nice.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (gallantly)
dialog: Whoever is keeping you waiting.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (indicating Preysing's
dialog: door)
dialog: Have you seen it?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Oh, my large and noisy neighbor --
dialog: really? That?
dialog: (indicating Preysing's
dialog: door)
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: That.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (with meaning)
dialog: You?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Oh -- work!!
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (with meaning)
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Dictation.
dialog: (she twittles her
dialog: fingers)
dialog: You know...
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Oh... poor child. If you were free,
dialog: I'd ask you to come and have some
dialog: tea -- but --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Tea would spoil my dinner.
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Reducing?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (she turns invitingly)
dialog: No -- why? -- should I?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Lord no -- charming -- but why one
dialog: meal a day?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (laughing in his face)
dialog: Money -- Ever heard of it?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are
dialog: a...
dialog: (moves fingers)
dialog: ...a stenographer. Don't little
dialog: stenographers earn little pennies?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Very little.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Too bad.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Did you ever see a stenographer with
dialog: a decent frock on? -- One that she'd
dialog: bought herself?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Poor child --
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: I wish I were free tonight -- we
dialog: could --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (with invitation)
dialog: Aren't you?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Free --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (glancing up passage)
dialog: Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow
dialog: though.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Shall we say five o'clock --
dialog: downstairs?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Where downstairs?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yellow Room where they dance --
dialog: (business)
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You're very funny --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (with great meaning)
dialog: Yes? -- Tomorrow?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Really?
text: Flaemmchen laughs at him.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: We'll dance.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: All right. We'll dance.
text: At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his
text: doorway at the end of the passage.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
dialog: Baron -- Oh, Baron!
text: The Baron turns and looks off at ---
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
text: Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He
dialog: waves.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: If I could trouble the Baron to come
dialog: and see this beautiful room. I have
dialog: ordered champagne. Perhaps the
dialog: Baroness could join us.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: FLAEMMCHEN, BARON AND KRINGELEIN
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!
dialog: (to Baron and
dialog: Flaemmchen)
dialog: We are having caviar -- it's expensive
dialog: but that makes no difference -- I
text: see the Baroness is laughing.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Have caviar if you like, but it tastes
dialog: like herring to me.
text: At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette
text: comes out into the hall.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh!
text: By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The
text: Baron turns back for a moment.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (calling back quietly
dialog: to Suzette)
dialog: Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!
text: Suzette turns back into the room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
text: It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are
text: drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of
text: silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow
dialog: Room below.
text: In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers
text: which she has been mending.
text: She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly
text: and looks off dramatically at...
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe,
text: on the chaise-lounge.
text: Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand
text: which is outside the robe moves.
text: The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards
text: Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the
text: chaise-lounge and is looking down.
text: Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling
text: and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE'S VOICE
dialog: (quietly and reverently --
dialog: almost a whisper)
dialog: Madam has slept well.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: No, I have been awake -- thinking --
dialog: thinking.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE'S VOICE
dialog: It is time for the performance.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: The performance?
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: It is time.
text: Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly
dialog: upright --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Always the performance -- every day
dialog: the performance -- time for the
dialog: performance.
text: (she pauses and droops
dialog: suddenly)
dialog: I think, Suzette, I have never been
dialog: so tired in my life.
dialog: (she takes the bottle
dialog: of veronal which is
dialog: nearby)
dialog: Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
dialog: (laughs a little)
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: (speaking into
dialog: telephone)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be
dialog: brought.
text: While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of
text: a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to
text: the floor and although there is only one other woman in the
text: room -- she holds the robe around her.
text: She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her
text: fingers through her hair. She gently massages under her eyes
text: and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time.
text: There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak.
text: Suzette gets madam's clothes ready. She crosses, puts the
text: case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them.
text: Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence.
text: Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her.
text: Grusinskaya pulls her foot away.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I can't dance tonight --
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Let us cancel the engagement.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: But, Madam. cannot do that.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Now is the time to cancel to stop
dialog: entirely. I feel it -- everything
dialog: tells me -- enough -- enough.
text: She leans forward against the dressing-table and her hands
text: unconsciously touch the pearls.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (very quietly)
text: The peals are cold -- everything is
dialog: cold -- finished -- it seems so far
dialog: away -- so threadbare -- the Russians --
dialog: St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court --
dialog: the Grand Duke Sergei --
dialog: (long pause as though
dialog: she were reliving
dialog: incidents of the
dialog: past)
dialog: -- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya --
dialog: it's all gone.
text: She throws the pearls away, down upon the floor.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they
dialog: were to break --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: The pearls won't break -- they hold
dialog: together and bring me bad luck ----
dialog: I hate them!
text: Suzette crosses replacing the pearls.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Orchids come again, Madam -- no card --
dialog: I think perhaps they are from the
text: same young man -- he is at the end
text: of the corridor -- tall -- he walks
dialog: like a soldier -- Madam must have
dialog: noticed how often he is in the
dialog: elevator with us. Last night for
dialog: instance --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh --
dialog: quiet.
text: Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away
dialog: in Russia -- she does not look --
text: Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Send it away -- I shan't need it.
text: There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Come in.
text: She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters.
text: Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble.
text: As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak
dialog: into telephone.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (authoritatively)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya will not require
dialog: her car -- no -- she will not be
text: going to the theatre.
dialog: (she turns)
text: Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will
text: deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood.
text: She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing-
text: table and sits.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: It is time for the performance.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: The performance -- the performance --
dialog: the performance.
dialog: (during this scene
dialog: the orchids fall to
dialog: the floor)
text: It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just
dialog: temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very
dialog: near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with
text: her a revulsion against the word performance.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (tenderly -- as he
text: touches her shoulder
dialog: gently)
dialog: Poor little Lisevata -- she still
dialog: has her stage frights -- it will
dialog: pass.
text: Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he
text: attempts to soothe her.
text: Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: It is not stage fright -- it's
dialog: something more --
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: What -- what is it? Last night...
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Last night?... There was no applause.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: There was -- there was.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: That theatre -- half empty -- dancing
dialog: for those few -- I was frantic -- I
dialog: finished -- the last beat and...
text: (she reclines her
dialog: head as the swan
dialog: finishing the dance)
dialog: ...I waited -- I listened -- but the
text: applause didn't come -- nothing. A
dialog: man in the box -- and just the claques
dialog: behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We
dialog: are dead -- it's finished.
text: There is a sudden knocking at the door.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Meierheim --
text: The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: What is this that you have cancelled
dialog: your car? Who am I that I should
dialog: wait like a fool at the door? And
dialog: here on a whim, you cancel your car.
dialog: Have you forgotten there is a
dialog: performance? Do you know the time?
dialog: Or, are we all mad? Am I your
dialog: manager?... Have we a contract? Have
dialog: we obligations? Am I blind?
text: (glances at his watch)
dialog: ...Or is that the time?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I'm cancelling the engagement.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Oh!
text: Business of Pimenov signaling to him.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Oh! Madam is cancelling the
dialog: engagement. Madam has chosen a funny
dialog: time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha,
dialog: ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight --
text: there's a line in front of the theatre
text: since six o'clock. The house is jammed
text: to the roof.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: The house is not full -- Is it really
dialog: full?
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get
dialog: dressed. And what an audience -- the
dialog: French Ambassador -- American
dialog: Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville --
dialog: er -- er --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (to Suzette)
dialog: Oh -- but it can't be.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
text: (she holds up her
dialog: frock)
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (changed mood)
dialog: All right, Suzette -- quickly --
dialog: hurry.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: We will wait.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: You are late. Hurry.
text: Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
text: Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur
dialog: to bring the car.
text: Show few feet of Grusinskaya getting dressed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: BY ELEVATOR
dialog: Pimenov and Meierheim.
text: Meierheim is pushing the bell.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: How is the house?
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Terrible. After this, no more ballets
dialog: for me. Jazz --
dialog: (snaps his fingers)
dialog: Just jazz.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: If the house is empty again, I don't
dialog: know --
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
text: When she gets her paint on and hears
dialog: the music -- she'll be all right. I
dialog: know these people.
text: They are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing
text: rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost
text: together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA
text: PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE
text: ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar,
dialog: smoke, etc.
text: In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen,
dialog: and a very fat waiter -- comedian.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: You may laugh. Caviar and champagne
dialog: may mean nothing to you, but to me --
dialog: they mean a great deal. You see, I'm
dialog: ill and all of a sudden I got a fear
dialog: of missing life. I don't want to
dialog: miss life -- do you understand?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You are funny. You speak of life as
dialog: if it were a train you wanted to
dialog: catch.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes -- and for me, it's going to
dialog: leave at any minute. Let's drink.
text: The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes
text: her head.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I'm sure this beautiful room must
dialog: appeal to your taste -- distinctive,
dialog: don't you think? Velvet upholstery --
dialog: 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile
dialog: trade and I know.
dialog: (he has a slight case
dialog: of hiccups from the
dialog: champagne. He touches
dialog: the drapes)
dialog: And these are real silk drapes.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (amusedly)
dialog: Silk -- think of that -- silk --
dialog: they are, too.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (who hasn't stopped
dialog: talking)
dialog: Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot
dialog: and cold running water -- You see, I
dialog: can get a bath whenever I like.
text: At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor
dialog: Clerk.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: The stenographer!
text: Flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently
text: through the door. Her manner changes, she puts down her glass.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Her master's voice!
dialog: (turns to Baron)
dialog: I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, don't go.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I'm engaged for the evening.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, can anyone engage you for the
dialog: evening?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --
dialog: (to Baron)
dialog: Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five
dialog: o'clock.
dialog: (she is moving out)
text: Kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands
text: looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as
dialog: though years had returned to him.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: General Director Preysing!
dialog: (possibly he turns to
dialog: Baron)
dialog: Baron, when I was sixteen years old,
dialog: I started as an office boy in that
dialog: man's factory --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Then you know him?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Do I know him -- I know him through
dialog: and through.
dialog: They start to leave. Oh, gentlemen, please don't go.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I must -- I hope to see you again,
dialog: Mr. Kringelein.
text: Baron leaves.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: You will stay, Doctor -- if you have
dialog: nothing better to do?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I have nothing better to do, Mr.
dialog: Kringelein.
text: They move into the room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: NO SCENES: 24 and 25 Sequence omitted from original script.
speaker_heading: NEAR ELEVATOR
text: Pimenov and Meierheim are standing there.
text: Meierheim is pushing the elevator button.
text: The Baron stands near and pauses, he is now a changed man.
text: He looks off as he hears the voice of Grusinskaya, off in
dialog: the distance.
text: Grusinskaya's Voice Hurry, Suzette.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: Shot from the Baron's angle. Grusinskaya is sweeping down
text: the corridor, followed by Suzette.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: BARON, PIMENOV AND MEIERHEIM
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Perhaps you could present me now,
dialog: Mr. Pimenov.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not
dialog: now -- here she is.
text: Grusinskaya sweeps into scene.
text: The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a
text: glance at her.
text: They look at each other. He fixes his eyes on her
text: characteristically. She glances at him. This is the first
text: time they have met in the picture.
text: She is impatient. As if to break an awkward silence, she
text: turns to Suzette.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: My coat.
text: Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. As she takes
text: the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Suzette -- I told you not to bring
dialog: the pearls. I will not wear them
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Take them back, Suzette.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: You haven't time.
text: Suzette hesitates.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Hurry, Suzette.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Such nonsense.
text: Suzette toddles off with the pearls.
text: The elevator opens, collects its passengers, all except the
text: Baron and descends.
speaker_heading: FLASH IN
text: A shot of Grusinskaya's eyes as she goes down, glancing up.
speaker_heading: FLASH IN
text: A shot of the reverse of him looking down.
text: The Baron pauses, hesitates, thinks. We are interested in
text: his action. For the first time he becomes furtive.
scene_heading: HOTEL LOBBY - FROM ELEVATORS
text: Music swells up from the Yellow Room. A great deal of noise,
text: confusion and activity as the elevator stops to emit
text: Grusinskaya, followed by Pimenov, Meierheim and some other
text: people who are rather excited to be in the elevator with the
dialog: great Grusinskaya.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: (off scene)
text: The car for Madam Grusinskaya.
text: The bellboy hears it and passes the word around. It seems to
text: be echoed through the lobby.
text: People turn, as Grusinskaya's spirit seems to rise with the
text: attention she is getting.
text: THE CAMERA precedes her through the revolving door, as she
text: sweeps outside of the hotel.
text: The Baron's chauffeur, Schweinke, is seen to watch her go.
text: He looks furtively around and enters the hotel.

scene_heading: UPPER CORRIDOR - CLOSEUP OF BARON
text: As he watches Suzette returning from Grusinskaya's room. She
text: is about to push lift button - then decides to run downstairs.
scene_heading: IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF BARON
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: END OF SEQUENCE "#1"
scene_heading: PREYSING'S ROOM
text: Zinnowitz and Preysing are standing by door.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: No news from Manchester yet -- Do
dialog: you think we ought to postpone the
dialog: conference?
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Good heavens no. That'd create the
dialog: very worst impression. You must be
dialog: optimistic. You must convince them.
dialog: You know as well as I do that the
dialog: merger must go through.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Yes -- the merger must go through --
dialog: But I am used to making my deals on
dialog: a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am
dialog: an honest business man -- a good
dialog: husband and father -- I have a sense
dialog: of honor -- I have nothing to conceal.
dialog: I couldn't live happily otherwise.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Well, don't get excited about it. We
dialog: agreed that the merger with the
dialog: Saxonia people must go through.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I want to dictate my statement for
dialog: tomorrow. I can't speak without notes.
dialog: I like to have things down before me
text: in black and white.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: I'll see you in the morning then, at
dialog: the conference. Everything'll be all
dialog: right, Preysing... Don't worry.
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Good night.
text: Zinnowitz leaves.
speaker_heading: SEQUENCE "#2"
text: FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM
text: We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the
text: typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that
text: Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind
text: his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an
dialog: odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.
speaker_heading: PREYSING'S VOICE
dialog: Both parties have fully agreed that
dialog: this merger can result only in mutual
dialog: advantages.
text: Preysing moves forward showing that we are in Preysing's
dialog: room.
text: The change of light shows us plainly the time lapse.
text: Flaemmchen is seated at a small table typing. Preying strides
dialog: forward As he strides he says:
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Moreover --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (repeating)
dialog: Moreover --
text: Preysing paces the room.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (repeating)
dialog: Moreover --
text: (he pauses, thinking.
dialog: Picks up telephone
dialog: quickly -- into
dialog: telephone)
dialog: Is there a telegram for me yet?...
dialog: Oh -- when it does, send it up.
text: During this, Flaemmchen, who is tired sits back and rubs her
text: fingers that have been over-worked. She glances at her wrist-
dialog: watch.
text: Preysing comes and stands behind Flaemmchen.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Now, where was I?
text: (he looks over the
dialog: sheet in her
dialog: typewriter --
text: accidentally his arm
dialog: touches her neck)
dialog: Oh -- sorry.
text: (he puts his cigar in
text: his mouth and walks
text: away. As he walks
dialog: away)
dialog: Where was I?
text: As he turns, he catches a down shot on her from behind as
text: she stretches back showing her busts. Seeing his face looking
text: down on her she pulls herself together and seats herself at
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Moreover...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Moreover...
text: It seems a silly kind of lull.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz'
dialog: office?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: No -- only occasional jobs.
text: (she yawns suddenly)
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Tired?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You pay me.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You're a very unusual stenographer --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Moreover...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Moreover...
text: (as he paces the room,
dialog: it is obvious that
text: he is trying to
dialog: collect his thoughts)
text: She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins
text: characteristically to, change the sheet of paper.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I don't see why it's unusual for a
dialog: stenographer to be pretty -- if she
dialog: does her work well, -- seems so silly.
dialog: I don't know why they don't like
dialog: girls like me in offices. Personally,
dialog: I hate offices -- I'd much rather be
dialog: in the movies.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Movies?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
text: She tosses magazine -- as if it were nothing at all over to
dialog: him.
text: He looks down at it without touching it.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I got ten marks for that.
text: He picks it up.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You...
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: Me.
text: As he looks at picture -- he lowers his voice two notes.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You...
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Moreover...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: What brown hands you have.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: That's from skiing.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Skiing?
dialog: (he holds her hands)
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (natural -- unabashed)
dialog: Yes... A man I know took me to
dialog: Switzerland last month...
text: He drops her hand suddenly.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That
dialog: must have been nice -- for him.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Only in mutual advantages --
dialog: moreover...
text: Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to
text: the work in hand.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Moreover... He was a lucky man --
dialog: that man.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Perhaps.
dialog: (she waits at attention)
text: He paces back and forth again.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married
dialog: man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?
dialog: (she takes cigarette)
dialog: I went to Florence once, too.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: With the same friend?
text: By this time she is smoking her cigarette.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (without looking at
dialog: him)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Moreover, the possibility of the
dialog: successful termination of negotiations
dialog: now pending with the Manchester Cotton
dialog: Company...
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Not too quickly.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You're a little too fast.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Can't you understand me?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I understand you perfectly.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Have you got it now?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (typing)
dialog: Cotton Company --
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Should throw a great weight into the
dialog: balance...
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
text: (as he turns his back
text: looks at him
dialog: significantly)
dialog: ...weight into the balance...
text: There is a sudden knock at the door.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Come in.
text: Boy enters with telegram.
speaker_heading: BOY
text: Telegram for Mr. Preysing.
text: With almost hysterical speed, Preysing snatches the telegram --
text: opens it. Flaemmchen powders her nose.
scene_heading: IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING
text: it is bad news. He wipes the perspiration from his forehead.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Oh -- oh.
text: (he throws the telegram
text: away from him, onto
text: her desk. Paces the
dialog: room.)
text: Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she
text: must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Deal with Manchester Cotton Company
text: definitely off.
text: Preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Sorry.
text: Preysing paces the room with the telegram.
text: Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at
text: the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: How nice -- your daughters?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
dialog: (he is talking more
dialog: to himself)
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Is that Mrs. Preysing.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (to himself)
text: Definitely off.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
text: (she is looking at
dialog: picture of Mrs.
dialog: Preysing)
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (turns, speaks quickly --
dialog: definitely)
dialog: That'll be all -- be here tomorrow
dialog: at nine o'clock.
dialog: (he turns, goes out
text: onto balcony with
dialog: telegram)
text: Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up
text: her papers and is prepared to leave.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASH OF CORRIDOR
text: Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to
dialog: elevator.
text: At the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's
text: chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door.
speaker_heading: BARON'S VOICE
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Come in!
text: Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room.
speaker_heading: BARON'S ROOM
text: Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he
text: closes the door behind him and stands there with an
text: inquisitive look.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: You are late -- the dancer's gone to
dialog: the theatre.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (very nonchalantly)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: She's gone to the theatre -- don't
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (very nonchalantly)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: (ready to explode)
dialog: And what are you going to do?
speaker_heading: BARON
text: The pearls are in her room.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: (threateningly)
dialog: Now listen to me. The others are
dialog: getting suspicious of you. I was on
dialog: the telephone to Amsterdam today,
dialog: they think you're scared.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I've been careful, I've been waiting
dialog: my chance.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: You've been waiting your chance.
dialog: You're too much of a gentleman --
dialog: that's the trouble with you.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I told you I'll get the pearls
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Need any help?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Have you got that skeleton key?
text: He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it
dialog: to the Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BARON
text: The floor clerk is out there in the
dialog: corridor -- she sees everything ---
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: (contemptuously)
dialog: I could take care of her.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
text: Chloroform on a handkerchief from
dialog: behind -- while you...
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No -- no -- no -- no...
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Poor girl -- chloroform would give
dialog: her a rotten headache... I know -- I
dialog: had it in the war. Besides, she's
dialog: very pretty -- not young but --
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: You're no good for this business.
dialog: It's just a joke to you...
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (swings suddenly on
dialog: him)
dialog: I don't like your tone.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: (comes up to him --
dialog: face to face)
dialog: No --
text: Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists
text: his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Get out and leave it to me... be
text: ready to leave on the night train
dialog: for Amsterdam...
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: With the pearls?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: With the pearls --
text: The Chauffeur leaves.
text: The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad
dialog: lib.
text: Crosses to window.
speaker_heading: FACADE OF HOTEL
text: The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He
text: proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is
text: apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room.
text: Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room.
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
text: Baron is pretty shaken by jump.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
text: Darkness -- light from transom and building opposite.
text: Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing
text: coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud
text: speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows:
speaker_heading: LOUD SPEAKER
dialog: 'You are listening to the music of
dialog: the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous
dialog: Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
text: Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls
text: in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY:
text: Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud
text: speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene
dialog: bullying waiter.
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
text: The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's
text: balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm.
text: Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is
text: locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers
text: refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd
dialog: way.
text: As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off
text: of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the
text: operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's
dialog: room.
text: He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger
text: prints off with his handkerchief.
text: He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring
text: suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want
text: to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring.
text: Crosses to the door again.
text: Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's
text: voice singing an absurd song.
text: He listens. She is coming in.
text: The key turns in the door.
text: Quickly he hides behind the curtains.
text: Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging,
text: enters the room.
text: He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door.
dialog: After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around.
text: We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.
text: The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear
text: from Preysing's radio.
text: The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer
text: it but continues her duties.
text: At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it
text: up and speaks.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERMAID
dialog: No -- no -- there is no one here.
dialog: (she replaces the
dialog: receiver)
text: At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears
text: at the open door.
speaker_heading: INSPECTRESS
dialog: (to Chambermaid)
dialog: You're late... What have you been
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: CHAMBERMAID
dialog: (grumbling)
dialog: Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come
dialog: back - come back.' They won't get
text: out of their rooms.
text: The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around
text: the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking
text: at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking
text: for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it
text: is locked.
text: Telephone bell rings again.
text: Inspectress picks it up quickly.
speaker_heading: INSPECTRESS
dialog: No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here...
dialog: The Western Theater?... No...
text: Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette.
text: Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE'S VOICE
dialog: Have you seen Madame?
speaker_heading: CLERK'S VOICE
dialog: (replying)
dialog: Isn't she at the theatre?
text: Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes...
dialog: Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?...
dialog: No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at
dialog: the hotel.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT
text: With the Baron watching.
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
text: During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid
text: out of the room. Business ad lib.
text: Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the
text: telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: (into telephone)
dialog: Pimenov?... What's happening?... No,
dialog: I haven't found her. Is Desprez
dialog: dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all
dialog: right. Keep the show going.
dialog: (bangs down receiver)
dialog: Wait till I see her, she'll pay for
dialog: this -- this little trick is going
dialog: to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach
dialog: of contract.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Madame is ill -- her nerves...
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Her nerves... What about my nerves?...
dialog: Who is she anyway? Where does she
dialog: think she is -- Russia? Those days
dialog: have passed.
text: He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is
text: in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one
text: shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into
text: the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance,
text: make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Madame --
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I want to be alone.
text: The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to
text: pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: Where have you been?
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Should I -- Does madame wish...
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Suzette, please go, I want to be
dialog: alone.
text: Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold,
text: waiting for Meierheim.
text: Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: I suppose I can cancel the Vienna
dialog: engagement.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I wish to be alone.
speaker_heading: MEIERHEIM
dialog: You'll be very much alone, my dear
dialog: madame. This is the end.
dialog: (he stamps out)
text: Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it
text: on Meierheim's exit.
text: DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON.
text: It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to
text: door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and
text: throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses
text: slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the
text: strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.
text: Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.
speaker_heading: FLASH OF BARON
text: Watching her.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress.
text: Then she becomes weary again.
text: With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the
text: curtain -- where the Baron is standing.
speaker_heading: BARON
text: We see him tense himself.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out
dialog: of scene.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP OF BARON
text: He peeps around the curtains.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks
text: steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her
dialog: hands and we hear her say:
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: The end -- over -- finished --
text: Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom.
text: Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across
text: the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and
text: darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.
text: She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses,
text: places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are
text: quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone --
dialog: asks for the theatre.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: The Western Theatre --
text: She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror --
text: stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to
dialog: telephone speaks:
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Western Theatre?
text: She glances up at the clock.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet
dialog: master... Grusinskaya -- hurry --
dialog: hurry.
text: Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she
text: commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically.
text: Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.
text: She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into
dialog: the telephone --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel.
dialog: I couldn't go on -- I couldn't...
dialog: No, no don't --
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: ...Just alone... Good night, good
dialog: night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov,
dialog: how is it going, badly?... Uh?...
dialog: Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh --
dialog: and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see --
dialog: they didn't miss me?... They didn't
dialog: miss me.
text: (she lets her hand
dialog: drop with the receiver
text: and goes on talking
dialog: into the air)
dialog: They didn't miss me -- good night,
dialog: Pimenov...
text: She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in
text: her hand, unreplaced.
text: The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind
text: her the Baron peers from the closet.
text: Her head sinks down upon her hands.
text: A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts
text: the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice
dialog: of Opehlia, she speaks:
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (with great humility)
dialog: Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have
dialog: finished.
dialog: (she replaces the
dialog: receiver)
text: The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It
dialog: is in fact, ballet.
text: Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table.
text: She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the
text: table, or hangs it over the telephone.
text: She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the
text: Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.
text: We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly.
text: "No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses
text: to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer.
text: She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little.
text: She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.
text: She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded
text: hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.
dialog: The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he
text: looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for
text: the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his
text: eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.
text: It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.
text: At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his
text: hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her
dialog: bed.
text: She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer
text: who has heard something, then reassured. She places the
text: veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is
text: quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her
text: head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal
text: and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away
text: upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance
dialog: herself.
text: The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to
text: the bedside noiselessly and stands there.
text: She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the
text: glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.
text: She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the
text: floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal
text: falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a
text: sitting position.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.
text: She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be
text: coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the
dialog: bed.
speaker_heading: BARON
text: Careful -- there's broken glass on
dialog: the floor.
text: Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her
text: kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse
text: of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she
dialog: is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be
dialog: a silly movement.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: There.
dialog: (takes a pillow from
text: the bed throws it
text: upon the floor over
dialog: the glass, steps
dialog: back)
text: She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which
text: was lying across the back of a chair.
text: Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She
text: draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron
text: puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances
text: back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this
dialog: man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense
text: of relief with her. She is trembling.
text: The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his
text: danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand
text: marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she
text: will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He
text: could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or
text: silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating
text: sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Please do not be frightened, Madam.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (after a silence)
dialog: What do you want here?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Nothing -- only to be here.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Why do you hide in my room?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: But surely you must know -- because
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Because you love me -- you love me?
text: She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she
text: throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more
text: passionately.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (going over to her)
dialog: Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do
dialog: you good to cry? Are you afraid?
dialog: Shall I go?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I was so alone -- always alone --
dialog: and suddenly you were there and said
dialog: that.
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Don't cry -- it tears my heart to
dialog: see you sob like that.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (regaining control)
dialog: Nerves -- just nerves. You must
dialog: forgive me. I have had a bad evening.
dialog: I am very tired. Do you know what it
dialog: is to be tired -- tired of a routine
dialog: existence?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm afraid not -- I usually do just
dialog: what I feel like doing at the moment.
text: A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the
text: situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her
text: robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial
dialog: Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She
text: sweeps across the room.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: So you feel like coming into a lady's
dialog: room -- and you come... What now?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (following her)
dialog: I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Certainly.
text: She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds
text: it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches
text: him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale
text: the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass.
text: She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks
text: into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to
text: live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Why do you look at me like that?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I did not know you were so
dialog: beautiful... and --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: And then --?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No irony. You're so appealing -- so
dialog: soft -- so tired. I feel like taking
dialog: you in my arms and not letting
dialog: anything more happen to you -- ever.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (involuntarily closing
dialog: her eyes)
dialog: And -- and --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: How tired you are!
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Yes -- tired...
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: So alone.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: Alone. All alone.
dialog: (whispers in Russian)
dialog: Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: You mustn't talk Russian to me.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Strange man...
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Am I quite strange to you?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Not quite strange now. It is as if I
dialog: had been expecting you. You know,
dialog: once when the Grand Duke was alive,
dialog: I found a man hiding in my room -- a
dialog: young officer --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: And...?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: He disappeared. Later he was found
dialog: dead.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I never knew it was so dangerous to
text: hide in a woman's room when she's
dialog: alone.
dialog: (he embraces her)
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Go away. Who are you --?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: A man who could love -- that is all,
dialog: who has forgotten everything else
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: You could love me. It is so long
dialog: since I have heard that word. Nobody
dialog: has loved me for a long time. It is
dialog: so icy-cold to be famous. One is so
dialog: cruelly alone. How is it that you --
dialog: Let me look at you. Your hands. Your
dialog: eyes. Why could you love me?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I saw you just now -- then I saw you
dialog: cry -- and now I see you in the mirror --
dialog: Grusinskaya...
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew
dialog: how I slaved and slaved for
dialog: Grusinskaya -- for the success of
dialog: Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of
dialog: Grusinskaya... and what is she now?
dialog: Just someone who has found that on
dialog: the day success ceases life ceases --
dialog: Are you listening to me -- Do you
dialog: understand? -- I want you to
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yes -- I do understand.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I think you must go now -- the key
text: is on the floor.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm not going -- You know I'm not
dialog: going -- Let me stay here?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I want to be alone.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: That is not so -- you don't want to
dialog: be alone.
text: (he looks back at the
dialog: bed as if remembering
dialog: the suicide.)
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I want to be alone --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No -- You don't want to be alone at
dialog: all -- You were in despair before --
dialog: If I left you, you'd feel worse than
dialog: you did before, You must not be alone --
dialog: You mustn't cry -- you must forget...
dialog: Tell me that I can stay with you --
dialog: tell me.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Just for a minute then.
text: Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: What? Say it again -- I didn't hear.
text: She whispers.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: You -- man...
text: The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She
text: has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting
text: and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly.
dialog: (NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is)
text: She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on.
text: She can't find the other.
text: Business as he gets other slipper for her.
text: He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Thank you -- you are gallant.
dialog: (she turns, her mood
dialog: has changed)
dialog: What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya
dialog: weeping is a sight worth seeing. It
dialog: is many years since she did such a
dialog: thing... You frightened me -- badly.
dialog: You're responsible for this -- painful
dialog: scene.
text: He watches her.
text: The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating
text: warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly,
dialog: volubly.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: The stage frays one's nerves... the
dialog: discipline -- it's so exacting.
dialog: Discipline means doing what you don't
dialog: want to do and take no pleasure in
dialog: doing. Do you know what I mean? Have
dialog: you ever experienced the weariness
dialog: that comes from discipline?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take
dialog: pleasure in doing.
text: Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I see -- you do only what you take
dialog: pleasure in doing. You take pleasure
text: in coming into a woman's bedroom and
dialog: you come. You take pleasure in a
text: dangerous climb onto a balcony, so
dialog: you do it... And what is your pleasure
dialog: now?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (naive as he says
dialog: frankly)
dialog: I should like to smoke.
text: She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes
text: her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing
text: table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds
text: out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches
text: him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale
text: the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass.
text: She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks
text: into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to
text: live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Why do you smile?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Because I can see something in the
dialog: mirror that you cannot. My dear --
dialog: (he pauses suddenly)
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: What can you see?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: You are beautiful!
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Beautiful but so sad. I did not know
dialog: it was so dangerous to look into a
text: woman's bedroom.
text: Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses
text: it. A long tender and sincere embrace.
text: Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his
text: whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I think you had better go now. The
text: key is on the floor.
text: He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm not going... You know that I'm
dialog: not going... Do you think I could
dialog: leave you alone here? After that --?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: The veronal -- you. I'm going to
dialog: stay here with you.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I want to be alone.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: That is not the truth.
dialog: (he catches her wrists)
dialog: You do not want to be alone -- you're
dialog: afraid of being alone -- I know you're
dialog: afraid. I know you. You were
dialog: desperate, just now, if I go away
dialog: you'll be more desperate than ever.
dialog: Say I am to stay with you... say it.
dialog: (he almost shakes her)
text: Her head falls slowly on his breast.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (whispers)
text: For just a minute then.
text: (she pulls away,
text: crosses the room,
text: quickly to the door,
text: with almost a cry.
text: She looks around for
dialog: the key to the door)
dialog: No -- oh, no!
text: He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Just for a minute, Grusinskaya --
text: Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor.
scene_heading: FRONT ON SHOT OF KRINGELEIN
text: approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor.
text: They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's
text: room. THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is
text: characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A
text: distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for
dialog: the first time by alcohol.
text: Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon
text: his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.
text: THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because
text: the Doctor has paused at the door.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful.
dialog: To live -- to live -- in the Grand
dialog: Hotel.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (with a deprecating
dialog: gesture)
dialog: The Grand Hotel.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the
dialog: champagne -- girls when they dance --
dialog: all the shining ice in those big
dialog: silver things -- That's life --
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are
dialog: drunk -- good night.
dialog: (he leaves)
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (to doctor)
dialog: But Doctor --
text: But the Doctor has gone.
text: Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room. He crosses to the
text: mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib.
text: He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat.
text: Imitating the doctor, he repeats:
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk --
dialog: good night.
text: He puts his hat on the knob of the bed.
text: He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the
text: carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm
text: and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass
text: and some water which he sees standing on the night table by
dialog: his bed.
text: He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with
text: water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine
dialog: bottles.
text: His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.
text: He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time --
text: his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.
text: He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops
text: into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden
text: impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine
dialog: away.
text: With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song
dialog: that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid
text: song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters
text: around the room, undressing.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO PASSAGE
text: His voice is still heard in the passage.
text: Rows of shoes outside the doors. The dozing night clerk hears
text: the voice and looks up, startled.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
text: DISSOLVE INTO A WATCHMAN
text: with his clock, hears the voice.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
text: DISSOLVE INTO A CORNER OF DOCTOR'S ROOM
text: He is dozing in a chair with his clothes on. He looks up
text: suddenly, hearing the voice.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO PREYSING'S ROOM
text: He is snoring. The distant voice disturbs him. He turns in
dialog: his sleep.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
text: A beautiful picture -- the distant voices -- shadows.
speaker_heading: BARON'S VOICE
dialog: I've never been as happy.
speaker_heading: GRU'S VOICE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: BARON'S VOICE
dialog: I've never been as happy!
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S VOICE
dialog: Say it again -- say it!
speaker_heading: BARON'S VOICE
dialog: I have never been so happy!
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO KRINGELEIN'S ROOM
text: He is now dressed in an absurd night dress. He crosses to
text: the bed, still singing, climbs into the huge bed -- the great
text: pillows. His hand goes out -- he pulls out the light. He
text: might be an Emperor as he turns with a happy, tired sigh.
scene_heading: DISTANT CLOCK CHIMES.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: END OF SEQUENCE "#2"
speaker_heading: SEQUENCE "#3"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: TELEPHONE ROOM
dialog: It is the first time we have seen it. There are about eight
dialog: girls very busy. Morning confusion. (parts to be written)
text: We pick up essential lines as we PAN DOWN SHOOTING AT THE
text: GIRL'S FACES, assuming the CAMERA to be the board.
speaker_heading: GIRL ONE
dialog: Grand Hotel -- good morning -- no,
text: Baron von Gaigern's room does not

text: von Gaigern's chauffeur calling.

dialog: yes, sir --
text: The word passes down repeated.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Mr. Preysing's calls to one sixty
dialog: two for today.
speaker_heading: CAMERA PANS TO:
speaker_heading: GIRL EIGHT
dialog: -- good morning... Mr. Preysing --

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CONFERENCE ROOM
text: Telephone bell ringing.
dialog: General shot.
text: Gerstenkorn, an old business man and Doctor Waitz, counsel
text: for the Saxonia organization are sitting at a gree table,
text: smoking and waiting.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (glances at watch)
dialog: Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us
dialog: waiting.
speaker_heading: SCHWEIMANN
dialog: (who has returned)
dialog: He likes to play the great man.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: (glancing at market
dialog: report from table)
dialog: The Preysing stock is holding its
dialog: own today on the market.
speaker_heading: SCHWEIMANN
dialog: Ask Preysing what it's costing him
dialog: to keep it up.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: And ask me what it's costing us to
dialog: hammer it down.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: If the Preysing people get the
dialog: Manchester contract, we shall
dialog: certainly merge with the Preysing
dialog: company -- but if they haven't they're
dialog: ruined -- Preysing will have to
dialog: declare himself.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: Shhh -- here he is now.
text: The door opens and Flaemmchen enters. She is agreeably
text: surprised to see the room full of men. She likes men.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (beams)
dialog: Good morning, gentlemen -- Mr.
dialog: Preysing will be here in a minute.
text: Business of Schweimann and Flaemmchen.
text: Gerstenkorn, making notes, glances at his watch again.
text: Door opens suddenly.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (enters)
dialog: Good morning, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: MEN
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Sorry I'm late, I've been waiting
dialog: for Justice Zinnowitz, my legal
dialog: advisor.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against
dialog: us? -- The whole thing seems to me
dialog: to be very simple.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Very simple -- I've always liked the
dialog: way you dressed, Preysing -- English,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (disturbed)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (quickly)
text: They turn out marvelous material in
dialog: Manchester.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they
dialog: do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we
dialog: begin at the beginning? -- Have we
dialog: cigars -- water and everything?
text: Flaemmchen, who has been busy preparing her little table for
text: work is seen in several CLOSEUPS:
speaker_heading: SCHWEIMANN
dialog: (with a wink to
dialog: Gerstenkorn)
dialog: Manchester is a very interesting
dialog: city, don't you think so, Preysing?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (stalling)
dialog: Manchester -- yes -- yes. A man in
dialog: the textile industry naturally has
dialog: to know Manchester.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: There's a lot of business to be done
dialog: with the Manchester Cotton Company.
dialog: They've the whole English market
dialog: right in their hands. Have you any
dialog: connections with -- Manchester?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: We have a good many connections in
dialog: England, naturally.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: I mean with the Manchester people?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
text: (looking at Gerstenkorn
dialog: impudently)
dialog: We are here to discuss our merger.
dialog: Naturally I can make no statement at
dialog: this time. We must begin at the
dialog: beginning.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (winking at Schweimann)
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (far-away commencing
dialog: to read his report)
dialog: Since, on the eleventh of June, this
dialog: year -- when the first negotiations
dialog: for a merger between our respective
dialog: firms was entered into -- both parties
dialog: have fully agreed that this merger
dialog: can result only in mutual advantages.
text: INTERCUT this speech, which if played by Beery will be
text: interesting, with signals, winks and signs between the other
text: three men.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I'm laying before you the last general
dialog: statement of our concern. Active
dialog: capital, plant and machinery, raw
dialog: material and finished product -- for
dialog: instance -- mop rags --
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Mop rags --!
text: Business between Preysing and Flaemmchen finding papers on
dialog: 'Mop Rag' report.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: What we want to know about is
dialog: Manchester.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we
dialog: want to know.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I'd like to wait for Justice
dialog: Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: No water -- What a place!
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: All you have to do is phone for it.
text: Flaemmchen, who is on her toes and busy every minute, rushes
text: to the telephone and gives an order -- her conversation is
text: heard over the conversation of the men in the room -- CAMERA
scene_heading: HOLDS ON FLAEMMCHEN:
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Water -- seltzer, three or four
dialog: bottles and cigars -- good ones.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: I can see this session is going to
dialog: be exhaustive.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Now to proceed with the projected
dialog: merger, the advantages for the Saxonia
dialog: are so obvious...
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Oh -- now let's talk like adults.
dialog: You want to tell us now a along story
dialog: of what your factory can do. We know
dialog: all that you could tell us and if
dialog: you tell the truth it wouldn't sound
dialog: so good. When you first approached
dialog: us...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: We did not approach you.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: (quickly looking
dialog: through the papers)
dialog: Letter on file September fourteenth
dialog: would show that you approached...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (snatching the document
dialog: from his hand --
dialog: losing his temper)
dialog: It isn't so -- this was a response
dialog: to a tentative feeler of your own.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (snatching the document
dialog: violently away)
dialog: Tentative my foot -- a month before
dialog: this your old father-in-law came
dialog: very privately and scratched at my
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Scratched --
dialog: (he nearly chokes)
dialog: We did not take the initiative.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Of course you took the initiative.
text: Zinnowitz enters the room.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the
text: conference is already underway.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz --
dialog: I'm at cross-purposes with these
dialog: gentlemen -- will you clear up the
dialog: situation?
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: But the situation is perfectly clear,
dialog: If you will allow me --
dialog: (he clears his throat)
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: How clear is Manchester?
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
text: Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always,
dialog: I'm told.
dialog: (to Preysing)
dialog: Have you said anything about
dialog: Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I can make no statement about
dialog: Manchester at this time.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Well -- gentlemen.
text: There is dead silence for a moment -- he clears his throat,
text: commences in almost the same tone as Preysing.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Since, on the eleventh of June of
dialog: this year -- when the first
dialog: negotiations for a merger...
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (over Zinnowitz's
text: voice -- with a sigh --
dialog: sits back)
dialog: Thank God we're beginning at the
dialog: beginning.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: (stops suddenly --
dialog: takes glasses from
dialog: his nose -- he is
dialog: speaking, not reading)
dialog: As you remember it -- when you
dialog: approached us...
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (bangs the paper down)
dialog: We did not approach you.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I know you did -- I said you did --
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: And I said we didn't.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: And I know we didn't.
text: During all this commotion Flaemmchen is paying no attention
text: whatsoever. She is calmly spraying herself with a perfume
text: atomizer and smiling at a gentleman. The noise continues
text: over her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: NO SCENE 61
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
text: The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya is
text: reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn
text: about her. She speaks voluably.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition
dialog: was in my blood -- no rest, no
dialog: stopping. We were drilled like little
dialog: soldiers -- We danced in the school
dialog: of the Imperial Ballet, in St.
dialog: Petersburg. I was little and slim
dialog: but hard as diamond -- a duty machine --
dialog: No rest, no stopping. And then -- I
dialog: became famous and whoever is famous
dialog: is alone... But why should I be
dialog: telling you this? Last night I did
dialog: not know you at all -- who are you,
dialog: really? -- I do not even know your
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My
dialog: mother called me Flix.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Flix. -- And how do you live? What
dialog: kind of a person are you?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep
dialog: of a white flock -- I shall die on
text: the gallows.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Really, I haven't a bit of character.
dialog: None at all.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: When I was a little boy I was taught
dialog: to ride and be a gentleman -- at
dialog: school, it was a monastery, I learned
dialog: to pray and lie -- and ---
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: And then, in the war, to kill and
dialog: hide. That's all.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: And what do you do -- now?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large
text: like a happy pig, devouring anything
dialog: of life that pleases me, I really
dialog: belong in jail
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (seriously)
dialog: I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
dialog: (he turns away)
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: That's a silly joke.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (turns -- takes both
dialog: her hands)
dialog: Please look at me. You must believe
dialog: me -- you must believe that I love
dialog: you -- that I have never known what
dialog: love is -- until last night.
text: (he releases her hands
text: and turns away again.)
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: What is the matter?
text: He does not answer.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Flix!
text: The Baron takes the pearls out of his pocket and lays them
text: before her.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (with a little cry of
dialog: pain)
dialog: Oh --
dialog: (in the silence
dialog: Grusinskaya puts her
text: head in her hands
dialog: and thinks)
text: The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then
text: holds back.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Did you come here just -- just for
dialog: that? Oh -- it's horrible.
dialog: Pause.
text: She is suddenly cold.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: You may keep the pearls -- I don't
dialog: want them any more -- I'll make you
dialog: a present of them.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (passionately)
dialog: I don't want them now.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (broken)
dialog: I'll not denounce you.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: So --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: But now, you must go... I give you
dialog: the pearls. But now you must go ---
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I wanted money desperately -- Can
dialog: you understand? -- That's why I wanted
dialog: the pearls. I was threatened -- I
dialog: was desperately in need of a certain
dialog: big sum of money. I've been following
dialog: you -- I've admired you. But I have
dialog: forced myself not to think about you --
dialog: Last night, at last, I managed to
dialog: came into your room and -- and now.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (softly)
dialog: And now?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I couldn't go through with it.
text: (his head goes down
dialog: into her lap -- he
dialog: sighs:)
dialog: Remarkable.
text: His hand touches her hair -- tenderly.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Do you understand?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Yes -- yes -- yes.
text: There is a sudden knock at the door.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Quickly -- here.
text: With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the
text: bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the
text: door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Good morning, Suzette.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: (delighted to see her
dialog: in a good mood)
dialog: Good morning, Madam.
text: She puts the coffee down on the table.
text: Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee
text: down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily
text: crested cigarette case of the Baron.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Madam has slept well?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (enthusiastically)
dialog: Oh, yes, Suzette.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Madam will dress now, it is late.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: Five minutes, Suzette, come back in
dialog: five minutes. I'll ring.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Yes, madam Suzette knows all about
dialog: it.
text: She is a French woman. She is pleased.
speaker_heading: SUZETTE
dialog: Madam is beautiful this morning.
text: As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Yes, Suzette.
text: Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings
text: open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: You must go now.
text: As she speaks the telephone goes. She gives the telephone a
text: dirty look. Telephone rings again. She pulls him across to
dialog: the telephone.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: There -- it begins.
text: With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and
dialog: speaks.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...
text: During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder. A
text: charming light moment. She continues to speak into telephone.
text: His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers
text: the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (to Baron)
dialog: No --
text: During this scene she is listening to Meierheim. She frowns
dialog: suddenly --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you
dialog: mad? We always have great success in
dialog: Vienna... Certainly not. Come here
dialog: and see me... yes... good-bye.
text: She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other.
text: The telephone rings again.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: There -- the day begins... I must go
dialog: to rehearsal.
text: She lets the telephone ring.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Grusinskaya --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: You do believe that I really love
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd
dialog: die after last night.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I want to be good to you -- madly
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Suzette will be back here in a minute.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'll go -- good-bye.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Shall I see you again?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I --
text: Telephone bell rings again.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Suzette will be back here any minute.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: When are you leaving Berlin?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: Very early in the morning.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: For Vienna?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you
dialog: come too -- I think it would be better --
dialog: for us -- for us both.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Oh -- yes but -- later.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Why later?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I have no money now -- I must get
dialog: some first -- I must get some.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I'll give you what you need -- I
dialog: have money.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Oh no -- that would spoil everything.
dialog: I'll -- I will manage somehow --
dialog: I'll manage myself. I will go with
dialog: you. When does the train leave?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
text: Six twenty-seven in the morning...
dialog: But the money?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a
dialog: whole day. I'll be on that train.
text: They move towards the door.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I shall dance and you'll be with me
dialog: and then -- listen -- After that you
dialog: will come with me to Lake Como, I
dialog: have a villa there. The sun will be
dialog: shining. I will take a vacation --
dialog: six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be
dialog: happy and lazy. And then you will go
dialog: with me to South America -- oh!
text: Telephone starts ringing.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: You must go now. Be careful on your
dialog: way to your room.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'll go. -- I love you.
dialog: (he kisses her)
dialog: I'll be on that train. I'll get the
dialog: money.
text: She holds him back. The telephone is ringing.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Don't do anything foolish -- I'm
dialog: alarmed about you.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Don't worry. I'll be on the train.
dialog: (he kisses her)
text: He leaves.
text: Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes
text: deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and looks
text: at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls, kisses
text: them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (speaking into
dialog: telephone)
dialog: Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are
dialog: you, in your room? Come, I will see
dialog: you now... hurry.
text: She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a
text: tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily,
text: she is indeed younger.
text: Suzette is putting out a dark dress.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Not that dark dress -- something
dialog: light -- bright -- it's a sunny
dialog: morning, Suzette.
text: Suzette happily glances at her.
text: There is a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Come in.
dialog: (sings)
text: Pimenov enters, before he can speak --
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Good morning, Pimenov.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: (a little puzzled at
dialog: change in her)
dialog: Good morning, Gru -- your --
text: Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks:
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new
dialog: ballet -- it must have mad music --
dialog: I'll explain it to you later. But
dialog: now, hurry to the theatre -- I want
dialog: full rehearsal -- properties -- full
dialog: ballet and some musicians. Hurry --
dialog: Quickly. I will be there --
text: During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is
text: busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face.
text: Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him
text: the cigarette case on the table.
text: As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost
text: sweeps Suzette to the door with him.
speaker_heading: PIMENOV
dialog: Gru -- you are positively radiant.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Yes, Pimenov.
dialog: (quickly to Suzette)
dialog: One minute, Suzette, I will call
dialog: you.
text: They leave.
text: Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the
dialog: telephone.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (very very softly -
dialog: her voice is like
dialog: music to operator)
dialog: Hello -- will you -- will you get me
dialog: Baron von Gaigern, please... yes...
dialog: Baron von Gaigern -- yes...
text: While she waits, she moves with a sense of dance.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (again into telephone)
dialog: Will you get me Baron von Gaigern,
dialog: please...
dialog: (she speaks quietly)
dialog: Cherie... yes... it is you...
dialog: nothing... good morning, good morning,
dialog: cherie... nothing... no... just to
dialog: tell you I'm happy.
scene_heading: FADE OUT SLOWLY:
dialog: Bring music up.
scene_heading: END OF SEQUENCE "#3"
speaker_heading: SEQUENCE "#4"
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL - SIGN
text: Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel." Precisely the same
text: angle as before. The sign lights.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: LOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK
text: The music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key
text: shot of the lobby.
text: Senf is busy.
text: The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk.
text: Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is
text: barring the way of an important looking alien.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Step back please.
text: Chauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy,
text: happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He
text: does not move but glares at Senf.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: I've told you three times -- Baron
text: von Gaigern is out.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: Did he leave any message for me?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: No, he did not -- there is no message.
text: This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a
text: whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to Senf)
dialog: Any letters?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: No, doctor.
text: During this short scene the chauffeur saunters off.
text: Kringelein comes to the doctor.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a
dialog: day!
text: They move away from the scene.
text: Kringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following
dialog: the chauffeur.
text: The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop
text: and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the
text: back of the Baron in the shot.
text: CAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron
text: in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop
text: waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of
text: orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (to Senf)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (taking the flowers
dialog: and handing them to
dialog: clerk)
dialog: For Madam Grusinskaya.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (to page boy)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: (to Baron)
dialog: Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (Quickly -- shortly)
dialog: All right.
text: (he glances around
dialog: apprehensively)
text: Kringelein is speaking to the doctor.
text: The Baron approaches them.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Baron, we must have gone a hundred
dialog: miles an hour, at least...
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yes, quite.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (to doctor)
dialog: We've been together all day... and
text: in an aeroplane.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best
dialog: shops, the very best. Look, Doctor,
dialog: silk -- feels so nice on the skin...
dialog: a London hat, see -- made in England,
dialog: that's silk, too -- fifty marks...
dialog: Look, the price is on it. That was
dialog: half my salary before. The Baron is
dialog: a very fine gentleman -- no one in
dialog: my life has been so nice to me as
dialog: the Baron.
text: The Baron smiles. He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm going to change and we'll meet
text: for a drink in the Yellow Room.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
text: In the Yellow Room, where the music's
dialog: playing and the ladies are?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Where the music's playing and the
dialog: ladies are...
text: The Baron leaves.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I
dialog: had pain I'd be too happy to notice
dialog: it...
dialog: NOTE: Find cut here.
text: While Kringelein is talking, they move away from the CAMERA.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASH OF BARON'S ROOM
text: The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns
text: up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed
text: under the door, glances at it.
text: FLASH INSERT OF THE PAPER
text: In scrawl: "I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY. WILL BE OUTSIDE OR
scene_heading: AT THE GARAGE." "S"
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BARON
text: We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses,
text: closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the
dialog: conference room.
text: Bring up noise from the conference room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CONFERENCE ROOM
dialog: We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing
text: all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains
dialog: of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business
text: battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on
text: his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a
dialog: pretty picture.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: ...and let me say again for the tenth
dialog: time...
dialog: (he is hoarse and
dialog: tired)
dialog: ...you people were quite ready for
dialog: the merger. You declared yourselves...
dialog: fully agreed on all the terms -- Why
dialog: should the signing of these articles
dialog: be suddenly held up?
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: I've admitted that at one time we
dialog: had reason for desiring ther merger --
dialog: What reason have we now? The Preysing
dialog: Company has fallon upon evil days,
dialog: very evil days.
text: Preysing jumps to his feet.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Evil days -- I've shown you here --
dialog: (he bangs the paper)
dialog: -- my company exports to the Balkans
dialog: alone, sixty-five thousand marks
dialog: worth of mop rags a year.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're
dialog: interested in something quite
dialog: different!
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SCHWEIMANN
dialog: (to Gerstenkorn --
dialog: with a sigh)
dialog: Shall I tell them again?
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (glancing at his watch)
dialog: Why waste time -- it's getting late.
speaker_heading: SCHWEIMANN
dialog: You see -- what we are interested in --
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Ah, come on -- we're going home.
text: Due to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a
dialog: regard for certainties...
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: You've talked enough today, you're
text: hoarse now.
scene_heading: IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING
text: His hand goes to his pocket. Slowly he takes out the telegram
text: and glances at it. The following scene is played over this
text: closeup.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Sorry, Preysing.
dialog: (he gets his hat)
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: You've decided against the merger?
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Yes --
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Then, it's all over?
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Yes --
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: (to Zinnowitz)
dialog: Well -- well -- You could call my
dialog: office.
dialog: There is a general movement to go.
scene_heading: FLASH OF TELEGRAM
text: Trembling in Preysing's hand. "DEAL WITH MANCHESTER DEFINITELY
dialog: OFF."
scene_heading: GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM
text: Gerstenkorn crosses to Preysing.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull
dialog: through. This is a very bad time to
dialog: be in such a crisis. We've...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Why talk -- it's over -- it's over --
dialog: it's finished. You've broken off
dialog: negotiations. You did it. You're
dialog: calling them off. You had nothing on
dialog: your mind all day, but Manchester, --
dialog: Manchester -- Manchester.
dialog: (he develops almost a
dialog: passion)
dialog: You don't suppose for one moment
dialog: that I'm such a fool as not to have
dialog: something that I could say definitely
dialog: about Manchester.
dialog: (he is generating
dialog: almost a passion)
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Oh no -- no -- the session is over.
dialog: Let's go, it's off. Thank you,
dialog: gentlemen.
text: (he starts packing up
dialog: his papers.)
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: If you actually have news from
dialog: Manchester then...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Gentlemen, I am now free to
dialog: announce...
dialog: (he is perspiring,
dialog: his hands are
dialog: trembling)
dialog: ...that the deal between my firm and
dialog: the Manchester Cotton Company has
dialog: been successfully negotiated.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Preysing, you're joking with us.
speaker_heading: SCHWEIMANN
dialog: You're a deep one.
scene_heading: QUICK CLOSEUP OF ZINNOWITZ
scene_heading: GENERAL SHOT OF ROOM
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: In that case give us the articles.
dialog: We'll sign at once. We know all the
dialog: details...
speaker_heading: PREYSING
text: (smiling, slowly folds
dialog: up the telegram and
text: puts it back in his
dialog: pocket)
dialog: I thought we'd suspended negotiations,
dialog: gentlemen.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Under these circumstances it's quite
dialog: a different matter.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Under these circumstances we might
dialog: refuse to sign.
text: By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon
dialog: the table.
text: Preysing is perspiring.
text: Gerstenkorn puts his arms around Preysing's shoulders.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Come on -- business is business --
dialog: Come on --
text: Preysing stands, looking ahead of him.
text: Gerstenkorn picks up the papers glances at them, looks at
dialog: Waitz.
text: Flaemmchen is awakening.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: Here's my signature -- here Preysing,
dialog: sign here.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: What a session this has been.
text: While Preysing is signing.
speaker_heading: SCHWEIMANN
text: It's twenty-five to six.
speaker_heading: WAITZ
dialog: We should celebrate this with a bottle
dialog: of wine.
speaker_heading: GERSTENKORN
dialog: (with his hat and
dialog: coat)
dialog: See you soon, Preysing. Next week
dialog: we'll meet and discuss further
dialog: details.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Next week.
text: Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits.
text: Waitz, Gerstenkorn and Schweimann out.
text: Preysing has not moved.
text: Zinnowitz takes the agreement and waves it in the air to dry
dialog: the signature.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Next week.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: You let me talk till I'm hoarse and
dialog: you had Manchester sewed-up all the
dialog: time. Why?
text: Preysing does not answer.
text: Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Well -- the deal has been put through.
text: Preysing commences to laugh suddenly with increasing violence.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Yes, it has been put through -- it
dialog: has been put through.
text: During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers,
text: glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions
text: to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing
text: is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying
dialog: not to attract attention.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: (to Preysing)
dialog: What's the matter with you?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (hysterically)
dialog: Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: What's bluff?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (throwing the telegram
dialog: on the table)
dialog: That.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: (reading at out loud)
dialog: 'Deal with Manchester definitely
dialog: off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have
dialog: thought it of you.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: No one would have thought it of me.
dialog: I've been getting rusty in
dialog: Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what
dialog: the world wants I guess I can put up
dialog: as big a bluff as anyone. From now
dialog: on...
dialog: (he turns away)
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: You must go to Manchester at once
dialog: yourself and really see it through.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Yes -- I must go to England -- I was
dialog: desperate -- Now I don't care --
dialog: This sort of thing goes to a man's
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: What you need is some relaxation.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd
dialog: like to tear loose -- I'd like a
dialog: drink. I'd like to go down to that
dialog: dancing place. I'd like to start
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: I can understand that -- after your --
dialog: uh --
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's
dialog: the first time in thirty years that
dialog: I've ever... Where's that
dialog: stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: What do you want with her?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I want to see her, I want to do some
dialog: dictating -- report of the conference
dialog: for my father-in-law.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: She had an engagement in the Yellow
dialog: Room at five o'clock -- she was in a
dialog: hurry.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Zinnowitz, would you say she was
dialog: pretty?
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
text: Pretty as a picture.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Let's go down and find her -- I need
dialog: a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.
dialog: (he is picking up
dialog: papers)
dialog: I don't know anything about women --
dialog: been married for twenty-six years.
speaker_heading: ZINNOWITZ
dialog: Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does
dialog: it. Goodnight.
text: Preysing is very excited, they start to leave -- at that
text: moment the telephone rings.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Aeh!
text: He crosses to the telephone.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (into telephone)
dialog: Hello... Father-in-law?... Is that
dialog: you?... The agreement is signed -- I
dialog: did it... yes, father-in-law... but
dialog: now I must go to Manchester.
text: When he picks the telephone up his hands are shaking --
scene_heading: DISSOLVE HANDS INTO:
speaker_heading: COCKTAIL SHAKER
text: -- which shakes more. Music crashes up --
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT:
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO BAR
text: Kringelein and the Doctor are just entering. Kringelein is
text: changed. His hair has been cut short and his moustache is
text: gone, he looks almost saucy.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to barman)
dialog: Barman -- whiskey --
dialog: (to Kringelein)
dialog: For you, Mr. Kringelein?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: For me? -- Oh, please, something
text: sweet and cold.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: A Louisiana flip, sir?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: A Louisiana flip, that sounds very
dialog: nice -- sweet, eh? --
text: During the following speech Kringelein keeps reaching for
text: the moustache that is not there. He is thoroughly happy.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: What do you do in the Grand Hotel?
dialog: Eat -- sleep -- loaf around -- do
dialog: business -- flirt a little -- dance
text: a little. A hundred doors to one
dialog: hall and nobody knows anything about
dialog: the person next to him. When you
dialog: leave another takes your room and
dialog: lies in your bed -- the end.
text: At that moment Flaemmchen enters.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Good evening, Mr. Kringelein --
dialog: Where's the Baron?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I'm waiting for him here. The Baron
dialog: and I have been together all day. A
dialog: hundred miles an hour -- in a motor
text: car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was
dialog: marvelous --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Mr. Kringelein -- How you have
dialog: changed, you look so nice.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh,
dialog: please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me,
dialog: Miss Flaemm, won't you have something
dialog: sweet -- a Louisiana flip.
dialog: (to barman)
text: A Louisiana flip.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (to barman)
dialog: No - absinthe.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: Yes -- that --
text: Kringelein is beating time to the music -- a little carried
dialog: away.
text: Flaemmchen laughs.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You like music?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man
dialog: might --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (mischievously)
dialog: A man might what?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I don't know -- I'd like to do
dialog: anything --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (very quietly)
dialog: Oh -- you would!
text: The Baron enters quickly.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (to Flaemmchen)
dialog: Hello -- sorry I'm late.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink --
dialog: A Louisiana flip?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you
dialog: feel now?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: A little strange, Baron.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I'd given you up.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (to Flaemmchen)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Dance then?
dialog: (they exit)
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (to Doctor)
dialog: She's beautiful -- isn't she?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (to Kringelein)
dialog: Oh -- there are plenty of women.
scene_heading: BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN DANCING
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: What have you been doing all day?
speaker_heading: BARON
text: Chasing around.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Chasing what?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Money.
text: They dance a few steps, in silence.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You were very different yesterday.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yesterday -- yes -- that was
dialog: yesterday.
text: They dance into the crowd.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BAR
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting
dialog: what you're looking for?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: What, Doctor?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: A masculine paradise -- drink, the
dialog: ladies, dancing...
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I had a very good opportunity, a
dialog: young lady asked me to dance -- I
dialog: ought to be able to dance, it seems
dialog: to be very important.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You must learn as quickly as your
dialog: time allows -- Believe me Mr.
text: Kringelein, a man who isn't with a
text: woman is a dead man.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you
dialog: anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you
dialog: all alone in the world.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I'm always alone -- I have been
dialog: everything.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Everything?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I was sent as a military surgeon to
text: South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken
text: prisoner. Home on parole not to fight.
dialog: I was a surgeon in the Great War
text: till the end. Grenade in the face.
dialog: Carried diphtheria bacilli in the
dialog: wound until 1920. Isolated two years.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I've been everything.
text: The music has stopped.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: BARON AND FLAEMMCHEN ON DANCE FLOOR
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: That was lovely.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Will you do me a big favor?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I'll do anything for you.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Would you like to make a man happy?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Yes -- I'd love to.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Then dance the next number with
dialog: Kringelein.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I feel sorry for him.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You're not a bit like you were
dialog: yesterday.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I fell in love last night -- the
dialog: real thing.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Oh -- there's no real thing -- it
dialog: doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I thought that, too -- but I found
dialog: that it does. Come along, dance with
dialog: Kringelein.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Anything for you.
text: They move off. As they approach the bar, happily Preysing
text: pushes into scene, touches Flaemmchen's arm.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Miss Flaemm.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (with the Baron)
text: Presently, Mr. Preysing.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: It's urgent.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Pardon me, the lady has urgent
dialog: business here with me.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Insolent -- Berlin manners.
text: At that moment Kringelein has descended from the stool and
text: crosses to Preysing.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I wish you a very good evening, Mr.
dialog: Preysing. You are staying here, too,
dialog: Mr. Preysing?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I don't know you.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein
text: at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper,
dialog: building C, room twenty-three --
dialog: third floor.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Come and dance with me, Mr.
dialog: Kringelein.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm --
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: No -- now.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Do you gentlemen know each other,
dialog: Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing --
dialog: Baron von Gaigern.
text: They bow stiffly.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend
dialog: and not accept your invitation to
dialog: dance.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I could not think of not accepting.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You say that you are employed by us
dialog: in Fredersdorf, and here you are in
text: Berlin, indulging in diversions which
dialog: ill befit your position and which
dialog: are very much beyond your means --
dialog: Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein,
dialog: I think we will look into your books.
text: Kringelein stands watching Preysing, his eyes narrowing.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Now, children, no fighting -- save
dialog: that for the office. Let's have our
dialog: dance.
text: (her arms go around
dialog: Kringelein. They
dialog: dance off)
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Oh, let the poor devil alone.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I did not ask your advice.
text: The two men eye each other; for a moment there might be a
dialog: fight.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I think it would be much better if
dialog: you went away.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: We shall see who remains here the
dialog: longer.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (shrugging his
dialog: shoulders)
dialog: As you will.
text: Preysing leans against the bar, orders a cognac. The Baron
text: turns his back to him, watching the dancing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FAEMMCHEN AND KRINGELEIN ON FLOOR
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You must look at my face and not at
dialog: the floor.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You're trembling.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I never danced before -- in public.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You dance splendidly.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: For the first time in my life, I'm
dialog: happy.
text: Kringelein shows signs of exhaustion.
text: Flaemmchen watches him quickly.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Let's stop -- I'm tired.
text: It is obvious that she has stopped because of Kringelein's
dialog: distress.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Thank you, Miss Flaemm.
text: They move back to the bar. Preysing catches Flaemmchen's
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Does the world belong to you, Mr.
dialog: Preysing?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: What is this insolence?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Do you think you have free license
dialog: to be insulting? Believe me you have
dialog: not. You think you're superior, but
dialog: you're quite an ordinary man.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Go away -- go away.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Please -- please!
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: You don't like to see me enjoying
dialog: myself.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Who are you? -- An embezzler most
dialog: likely.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: An embezzler -- you're going to take
dialog: that back, right here in the presence
dialog: of this young lady -- who do you
dialog: think you're talking to? You think
dialog: I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot
dialog: dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate
dialog: Preysing.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You're discharged.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get
dialog: out -- you're discharged.
text: Kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor.
text: Flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it.
text: Kringelein starts to laugh.
text: The Baron steps into the scene.
text: The Doctor slowly comes from the bar.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: You can't discharge me -- I'm my own
dialog: master now -- at last. I'm ill, I'm
dialog: going to die -- do you understand?
dialog: I'm going to die very soon. Nothing
dialog: can happen to me now. Nobody can do
dialog: anything any more to me. By the time
dialog: you can have discharged me I shall
dialog: have been dead already.
text: (his laugh becomes a
dialog: convulsive sob)
text: The Baron steps between the two looking straight into
text: Preysing's face.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Come, Mr. Kringelein.
text: (he pulls him out of
dialog: the scene towards
dialog: the bar)
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (his fists clenched,
dialog: between his teeth)
text: The man's insane -- he acts as if he
dialog: is glad he is going to die...
dialog: (hesitates -- to
dialog: Flaemmchen)
dialog: I shall see you in the lobby in half
dialog: an hour.
scene_heading: END SEQUENCE "#4"
speaker_heading: SEQUENCE "#5"
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: KEY SHOT OF LOBBY OVER SENF'S HEAD
dialog: General activity.
text: The house detective, later identified, is talking to the
text: chauffeur. He leaves the chauffeur and crosses to Senf.
speaker_heading: HOUSE DETECTIVE
dialog: Better let him stay -- I've sent for
dialog: the Baron... How's your wife coming
dialog: along?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: I was at the hospital all night
text: walking up and down the corridor.
dialog: They wouldn't let me in to see her.
dialog: She has the pains, but the child
dialog: doesn't come and I have to stay here
dialog: chained to this desk.
speaker_heading: HOUSE DETECTIVE
dialog: It will be all right.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: I hope so.
text: At that moment Preysing enters.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Did you send that page?
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: The young lady's there, sir.
text: Preysing glances off to see Flaemmchen standing looking
dialog: around.
text: Preysing crosses to Flaemmchen.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Sit here.
dialog: (calls to a boy)
dialog: Cognac -- for you?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Nothing.
text: At that moment the Baron and Kringelein pass.
text: Preysing glances up at Kringelein as he passes.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I'm going to keep an eye on that
dialog: Kringelein fellow. I'll find out
dialog: where he gets the money to hang around
dialog: the Grand Hotel.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Well -- you want me?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (looks straight at
dialog: her)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I must go to England -- at once.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You see, I'd like to take a secretary
dialog: with me for my correspondence and --
dialog: humm -- humm -- for company on the
dialog: trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody --
dialog: I don't know if you quite understand
dialog: me. You said you have travelled with
dialog: gentlemen -- and I mean --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I understand perfectly.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: What do you think your salary would
dialog: be -- for such a trip?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Wait -- I must figure it up.
dialog: (she smokes and thinks)
dialog: First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes --
dialog: it's cold in England in March, I'll
dialog: need a suit... You'd want me to look
dialog: nice?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Of course -- of course.
dialog: (he is fidgeting)
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: A thousand marks --
dialog: (she waits anxiously
dialog: thinking it might be
dialog: too much)
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: It's agreed -- I will get a room
dialog: here for you.
text: She is looking away.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I can get a room here in the Grand
dialog: Hotel for you.
text: She still looks away.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Can you pay some attention to me?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (looking off)
dialog: Insolent young cub!
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You mean Baron von Gaigern?
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Baron!
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Well, he's a gentleman!
speaker_heading: THE BARON
text: Who is leaning against a chair by a pillar with Kringelein.
text: THE CAMERA APPROACHES THEM.
text: They are not speaking. The Baron is looking off at:
text: FLASH A SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE OF CHAUFFEUR
text: Sauntering between the door and Senf's desk.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: THE BARON
text: He slumps on the arm of the chair.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (watching him)
dialog: The Baron is tired?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --
dialog: (he shrugs his
dialog: shoulders)
dialog: Well -- well --
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could
dialog: go to the Casino -- the place we
dialog: passed with the marvelous bright
dialog: lights?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't --
dialog: I am broke!
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
text: The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur --
speaker_heading: CUT IN:
scene_heading: FLASH OF CHAUFFEUR
text: Arguing with Senf.
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: BARON
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Kringelein.
dialog: (he strides off)
text: Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron.
text: He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing
text: to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron
text: money. Charming scene.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: BARON AND CHAUFFEUR
text: Moving into position. They are talking.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I've quit.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: You can't.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'm not going to get those pearls
dialog: and neither are you.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: What about the money?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I'll pay you back.
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I have an idea working in my head...
text: (he glances at
dialog: Kringelein)
speaker_heading: CHAUFFEUR
dialog: You might find a bullet through that
dialog: head...
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: If you did that, you'd get nothing
dialog: except the police after you. If you
dialog: wait -- I'll give you your six
dialog: thousand back --
text: At that moment a voice is heard.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya's car -- Madam
text: Grusinskaya's car.
text: It is passed along.
speaker_heading: INSIDE PORTER
dialog: (calls through his
dialog: little telephone)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya's car --
speaker_heading: MEGAPHONE
dialog: (outside)
dialog: Madam Grusinskaya's car --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (quickly to chauffeur)
dialog: Later.
dialog: (Chauffeur exits with
dialog: bad grace.)
text: Baron looks off...
scene_heading: FULL SHOT -- FROM HIS ANGLE
text: Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot.
text: Music comes up.
text: Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim.
text: People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward.
text: As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly
text: aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: (to them)
dialog: Go on please -- go on, Suzette.
text: She and the Baron are alone.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Bless you...
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Are you coming to the theatre? Oh --
dialog: I shall dance tonight -- How I shall
dialog: dance -- I want to feel that you are
text: in the theatre.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: No! I can't explain now. Oh, look --
dialog: the pearls. You wear them now...
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Why do you think --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: They've brought me such good luck --
dialog: you --
text: He takes her hand, kisses it quietly.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: I'm worried about you.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: On the train?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Yes -- I will be on the train.
speaker_heading: GRUSINSKAYA
dialog: Till then.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Bless you --
text: During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As
text: Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the
text: Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his
text: mind miles away.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Was the Baron joking, or is it really
dialog: true that the Baron is -- in financial
dialog: straits.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Absolutely true, Kringelein and I
dialog: have to raise some money immediately.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: If the Baron -- if you would permit
dialog: me --
text: The Baron looks at him suddenly.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I would be awfully glad to oblige,
dialog: you've been so decent to me. Three
dialog: hundred?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: If I could get into a game I might
dialog: win some.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Gambling! I'd like that. I have over
dialog: six thousand eight hundred marks
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: If we could scare up some men to
dialog: play.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: We could come to my room.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (with enthusiasm)
dialog: Good!
text: At that moment Flaemmchen passes.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Going?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Yes --
text: Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something
text: that is on her mind.
text: A curious little scene.
text: She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door.
text: The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to
dialog: Kringelein.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Ready, Kringelein?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Ready, Baron.
text: They move off and are last in the crowd.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:

speaker_heading: SEQUENCE "#6"
dialog: No scenes 88-93 inclusive
dialog: Sequence omitted from original script.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: KRINGELEIN'S ROOM
text: Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are
text: playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc.,
text: on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The
text: game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the
text: monotonous words of the players.
text: White faced, the Baron has the bank.
text: Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach
dialog: the table.
text: Kringelein's back is to us.
dialog: They are smart people, not professional gamblers.
text: There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around
dialog: tightly. We do not see the cards.
text: The following voices are heard:
speaker_heading: BARON'S VOICE
dialog: All right, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: I play -- I play -- Here -- Up --
dialog: Playing --
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
dialog: Yes -- me.
text: Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Is that too much, Baron?
speaker_heading: BARON
text: (glances down at his
dialog: own money)
dialog: No -- not at all.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: All right then.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: All right then.
text: There is tension in the room. The Baron deals two cards.
text: Kringelein takes cards.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Don't show them.
text: Kringelein turns it down. He is like a little boy learning a
dialog: new game.
text: The Baron deals himself a card.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (to Baron)
dialog: What do I do now?
text: The Baron is serious. There is enough money on the table to
dialog: take him to Vienna.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: (next to Kringelein)
dialog: Turn 'em up.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I
dialog: win, don't I --
dialog: (he turns the card up)
text: The Baron rises.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: There you are gentlemen.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: (to Kringelein)
dialog: Will you take the bank, sir?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes -- I'll take everything gentlemen --
dialog: please, let us drink -- champagne ---
dialog: champagne is expensive and good. I'm
dialog: winning more than I used to earn in
dialog: a year -- double what I used to earn.
dialog: (he is counting his
dialog: money)
text: They hand him the cards.
text: Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Where is the Baron -- where are you,
dialog: Baron?
text: At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking --
text: his face is white -- he has lost.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (rising quickly)
dialog: Excuse me, gentlemen.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (sitting down in
dialog: Kringelein's place)
dialog: I'll take the bank -- All right,
dialog: gentlemen.
text: Kringelein has come to the Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: That was my last.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: You've lost everything?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I've no luck.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
dialog: (he puts bills in
dialog: Baron's hand.)
text: Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking
text: plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my
dialog: last chance.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you,
dialog: Baron and to win.
dialog: (he drinks)
dialog: It's good, -- come along, Baron.
text: They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the
dialog: bank.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I take five hundred.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: All of that at once, Baron?
text: The Baron picks cards, shows them to Kringelein who doesn't
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Eight.
dialog: (he is triumphant.)
speaker_heading: DOCTOR'S VOICE
dialog: (rings in background)
dialog: Nine.
text: The Baron throws the cards into the middle of the table and
dialog: turns to Kringelein:
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: That's it. The luck's with you.
dialog: (he walks away.)
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Come along, Mr. Kringelein. Sit here.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I'm having luck for the first time
dialog: in my life.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: Your bank, Mr. Kringelein.
text: Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down
text: on the table.
text: Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Out, Baron?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: For a while -- I'll recover -- in
dialog: ten or twenty years.
dialog: (he points)
dialog: Look at that.
text: He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's
dialog: voice:
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
dialog: I've won again, Baron -- I've won
dialog: again.
text: Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor. As Baron
text: approaches table.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Baron, I drink and win -- I drink
dialog: and win -- I win and drink!
dialog: (he is pulling money
text: towards him, counting
text: it, eagerly,
dialog: frantically, not the
dialog: movement of a miser,
dialog: not a greedy movement,
dialog: but the movement of
text: an excited child
dialog: liberated. Money has
dialog: become so much mad
dialog: paper to him.)
text: During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has
text: answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: There are complaints in the hotel
dialog: about the noise.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: What time is it? Getting late? Let's
dialog: break it up!
dialog: (to Kringelein)
dialog: You've been very lucky... Where's my
dialog: coat? Let's go. He's drunk anyway!...
dialog: Goodnight, Baron. Let's wind up the
dialog: game, I'm broke and tired; you can't
text: play against him. I put my hat down
dialog: here, somewhere. I think I'll have a
dialog: drink before I go. By the way, I've
dialog: got to see you tomorrow morning.
dialog: How've you been, Doctor?
text: Business ad lib. General business of slow normal exit.
text: Kringelein looks up from counting his money. He has been
text: like a little boy with a Christmas stocking. He looks up
text: suddenly, sees men are leaving --
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a
dialog: while.
dialog: (he stands to his
dialog: feet)
dialog: Be my guests!
text: By this time the men are pausing by the door.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I oughtn't to presume, but I --
dialog: (he is a little drunk)
dialog: I'm so grateful to you -- it's been
dialog: so marvelous. The first time in my
dialog: life I have gambled -- I've danced!
dialog: Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but
dialog: it's the first time in my life I've
dialog: ever tasted life!
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: (slapping him on back)
dialog: Splendid!
text: There is a general feeling in the room that although this
dialog: man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no
dialog: wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a
text: nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has
text: reached an emotional pitch.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but
dialog: very dangerous. You must have courage
dialog: for it, then it's wonderful. You
dialog: gentlemen don't know that because
dialog: you are all healthy and happy, but I --
dialog: believe me -- a man must know death
dialog: and not until then does a man know
dialog: anything about life.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Rejoice in life while yet the small
text: lamp burns.
text: General noise among men, some are ribald, others are serious.
text: Two men come and shake hands with Kringelein, bidding him
dialog: goodnight.
text: The Baron puts his hand restrainingly on Kringelein's
dialog: shoulder.
text: Kringelein almost staggers towards the sideboard. The men
text: are nearing the door.
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: (starts singing)
dialog: It's a short life and a gay one...
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
text: (seizing a glass of
dialog: champagne)
dialog: Every glass high to life -- the
dialog: splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief --
dialog: brief life -- and the courage to
dialog: live it.
dialog: (turns to Baron)
dialog: Baron, you know -- I've only lived
dialog: since last night -- but that little
dialog: while seems longer than all the time
dialog: before -- all the --
text: (he collapses suddenly
dialog: onto the floor)
dialog: Business ad lib.
text: The doctor is there quickly. The Baron next.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Drunk.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER MAN
dialog: Poor fellow.
text: General normal business ad lib between the men. Perhaps three
text: of them help him up, including the Baron. They carry
text: Kringelein to the bed.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: (of players mingling)
text: Drunk? No, he's ill. Looks ill.
dialog: (well paused over:)
dialog: He's a doctor -- The doctor's here --
dialog: He's just drunk!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Gentlemen, this man is ill -- very
dialog: ill -- if you will leave.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Certainly, Doctor. Goodnight!
dialog: Goodnight, Baron! Bad luck!
speaker_heading: DRUNKEN MAN
dialog: He's not used to champagne -- why
dialog: does he drink it?
text: Little comedy on exit. Ad lib.
text: INTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn,
dialog: tragic.
text: One man, perhaps, remains.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Can I help, doctor?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: No, the Baron will stay.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Certainly.
text: Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully
text: making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows
text: behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his
text: hands are limp.
dialog: By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course
dialog: know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from
text: Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket.
dialog: We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see
text: his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his
dialog: inside pocket --
text: He stands looking down at Kringelein.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (drops Kringelein's
dialog: hand)
text: It will be over in a minute.
text: Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely:
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Over -- over so soon -- it has just
dialog: begun.
text: (he closes his eyes
dialog: suddenly)
dialog: Oh, the pain.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be
dialog: afraid.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (mutteringly)
dialog: I'd like to live a little longer but --
dialog: I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
speaker_heading: BARON
text: (touching his shoulder
dialog: gently)
dialog: You'll be all right, Kringelein.
dialog: (he moves from the
text: bed -- takes out a
dialog: cigarette, moves to
text: the table. He seizes
dialog: his drink)
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
dialog: (out of scene)
dialog: My pocketbook... my money in it...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR'S VOICE
dialog: What do you say -- what?
text: We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR'S VOICE
dialog: You what -- Oh, isn't it there?
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN'S VOICE
dialog: No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost
dialog: my pocketbook.
text: Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them.
text: The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: There is no pocketbook here... On
dialog: the floor probably.
dialog: (He glances down)
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (starting up suddenly)
dialog: More than fourteen thousand marks...
dialog: were in that pocketbook.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: (looking at Baron)
dialog: Fourteen thousand marks... One can
dialog: travel -- one's happiness might depend
dialog: on fourteen thousand marks -- don't
dialog: you think so, Baron?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (with a shrug)
dialog: Quite possibly.
text: At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the
text: ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, I've got to find it.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Stay where you are.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: No -- I must find it --
dialog: (he starts talking)
dialog: Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
dialog: (he pulls himself to
dialog: the side of the bed)
text: The doctor goes to restrain him.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: I'm all right, Doctor. There's no
dialog: pain now -- only you don't know what
dialog: that money means to a man like me.
text: He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the
text: floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness,
text: his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually gets
text: under the card table.
text: The Doctor looks at the Baron.
text: The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (talking at intervals
text: as he crawls looking
dialog: for money)
dialog: You don't know, because you've never
dialog: lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and
dialog: saved and scrimped. My life hangs
dialog: upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives
dialog: you anything. You have to buy
dialog: everything and pay cash for it. I
dialog: wanted to pay for my last days with
dialog: that money. Every hour costs money.
dialog: I've nothing -- nothing but that
dialog: pocketbook.
text: (he crawls along the
text: floor on his hands
text: and knees talking to
dialog: the carpet as he
dialog: looks)
dialog: I must have it back.
dialog: (he pauses breathless --
text: like an animal along
text: the wall -- looking
dialog: up at the men)
text: The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action
text: in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it
dialog: is not a long speech:
text: The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he bites
text: his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a
dialog: thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped
dialog: him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity
dialog: for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the
text: time the Doctor watches.
text: The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting
dialog: conscience.
text: Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during
text: rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but
dialog: piercing, says:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He must find his money, Baron.
dialog: (next time)
dialog: Mr. Kringelein should find his
dialog: pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?
text: These are two interjections.
text: And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little
text: sack of pain, his head down.
text: The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking
text: for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and
text: turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his
text: voice as he says:
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Here -- here it is. Here's your
dialog: pocketbook, Kringelein.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (his head coming up)
dialog: Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found
dialog: it -- you found it for me, Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Goodnight, Kringelein.
text: (he moves towards the
dialog: door.)
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: No -- no please -- oh, don't go --
dialog: don't go -- don't leave me alone,
dialog: Baron.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Come, get up -- come let me help
dialog: you.
dialog: NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up --
text: If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: You're all right now -- it's very
dialog: late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
text: Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in the
text: play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR'S VOICE
dialog: Goodnight, Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Goodnight.
text: (his hand presses on
dialog: Kringelein's shoulder --
dialog: he exits)
scene_heading: CUT OUT INTO:
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of
text: the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In
text: his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience
dialog: feel his problem with him.
dialog: This man who has lived and whistled and love through the
text: play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron
text: has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his
dialog: hair back.
text: Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle.
text: He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of
text: Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The
text: Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically.
text: He walks down the corridor.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Flaemmchen, what are you doing here
text: in the middle of the night.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Looking for my room -- one sixty-
dialog: six.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: You live here?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: For tonight.
dialog: (she points to door --
text: she looks at him a
dialog: long time)
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Oh!
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Yes -- oh!
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: And Baron, thanks so much for
dialog: everything.
text: They both go into their respective rooms.
dialog: Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh
text: Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of
text: funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about
text: themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically
dialog: for the want of a little money.
scene_heading: FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM
text: Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp
text: burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining
text: door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts
text: down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his
text: door. She peeps through.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM
text: from her angle.
text: Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and
text: on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's
text: picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake
text: because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his
dialog: hand.
scene_heading: FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN
text: An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and
dialog: he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes
text: the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and
text: takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress,
text: lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts
text: at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off.
scene_heading: SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR
text: The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the
text: adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room
text: the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he
text: is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks
text: hoarsely, quietly.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Flaemmchen!
dialog: (he seizes her to him)
text: She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair.
text: She is passive -- cold.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (breathlessly)
dialog: You are late. I've been waiting for
dialog: you -- waiting.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I had to arrange about the trip.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You're sweet.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: You think so?
text: He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately
text: avoids his kiss.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: Come here.
text: (he sits heavily on
text: the bed, sitting on
dialog: her night dress.)
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Here, hold up!
text: Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under
dialog: him.
text: He draws her to him.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Call me -- do you know -- would you --
dialog: would you like to call me by my first
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
text: (pulling away, glad
dialog: of an excuse for
dialog: conversation)
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: I couldn't do that, you're a stranger
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: You're a funny little creature,
dialog: Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: It's not funny at all. One can't get
dialog: intimate just off hand. I could go
dialog: to England with you and everything
dialog: like that -- supposing I met you
dialog: next year and I said: 'How do you
dialog: do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:
dialog: (she imitates him)
dialog: 'That was the young lady who was my
dialog: secretary in Manchester'.
text: Preysing laughs. She laughs.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: That's all quite proper.
text: (she is happy again.
dialog: She would rather
dialog: talk than be squeezed)
dialog: But supposing I met you when you
dialog: were with your wife and I called
dialog: out: "Hello you big baby -- remember
dialog: Manchester?' And you with your wife,
dialog: how would you like that?
text: There is a pause for a moment.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my
dialog: wife out of this.
text: Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: All right. I'll get undressed -- get
dialog: out.
text: He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his
text: fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto
dialog: the balcony.
text: Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the
text: street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a
text: shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled.
text: Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves
text: forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French
text: window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively
text: searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar
text: is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet.
text: He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face
text: watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward,
text: pulling the window after him. The two men face each other.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: I must have made a mistake.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Made a mistake -- remarkable. We
dialog: shall soon see if you made a mistake.
dialog: (the Baron starts to
dialog: leave.)
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: Stay here... Give me that money.
text: The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: So that's how we stand, Baron.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Look here, sir -- I'm completely at
dialog: your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's
dialog: a matter of life or death -- I had
dialog: to get some money -- tonight.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Indeed you must, Baron -- you must.
dialog: Humm -- humm, but you must go to
dialog: jail, Baron, you're a thief.
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Be quiet.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I'm going to call the police. I'm
dialog: going to watch you play the great
dialog: Baron with the police. Aristocrat!
dialog: Aristocrat!
dialog: (he picks up the
dialog: telephone)
text: The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room,
text: pulls at the knob.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
text: The door is locked, Baron.
text: The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at
text: his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone,
text: (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and
text: one hand holding the Baron.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (into telephone)
dialog: Hello! Hello! --
speaker_heading: BARON
dialog: Don't do that.
dialog: (he tries to snatch
dialog: the telephone from
dialog: Preysing.)
text: Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron.
text: The action excites him.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: Strike me, would you? Attack me would
dialog: you? Attack me --
text: With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down
text: upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book).
text: In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I'll strike you -- I'll strike you --
dialog: I'll strike you -- Strike me!
text: By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing
text: come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: I strike you --
dialog: (with telephone
dialog: foolishly in his
text: hand, he looks down
dialog: at what he has done.)
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: DOWNSTAIRS TELEPHONE ROOM
text: Sharp sound of buzzing.
text: Dozing night girl plugs in, lazily.
speaker_heading: NIGHT GIRL
dialog: Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator --
dialog: (she listens -- says
dialog: to herself)
dialog: They are having a nice little game
text: up there with the telephone.
text: With nonchalance she flicks plug out again, as she does so:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: PREYSING'S ROOM
text: New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the
text: receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He
text: is terrified.
text: Door opens behind him.
text: Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing,
text: crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing
text: seizes her.
text: Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we
text: think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She
dialog: is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can
text: hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the
text: traffic below.
text: Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident,
dialog: it is the first time we have been conscious of it.
text: With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door.
text: It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own
text: room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from
text: her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears
text: through her own room.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that.
text: After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running
text: across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a
text: Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What
dialog: the hell is this -- what is it." The impulse naturally is to
text: scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks
text: around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She
text: will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly.
text: Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: KRINGELEIN'S ROOM
text: It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows.
text: The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor
text: had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers
dialog: and shirt.
text: Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes
text: hanging to her, crosses.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (hoarse whisper)
dialog: Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein --
dialog: where are you?
text: She sweeps to bed. She shakes him. Kringelein starts up.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh -- what -- what --
text: (he is looking up at
dialog: what seems to be a
dialog: ghost.)
text: She pulls on the light by the bed, it flames up on their
dialog: faces.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Quick -- something awful -- awful
dialog: has happened. Go -- go at once, --
dialog: Mr. Preysing --
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Preysing?
text: It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must
text: have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a
dialog: strength.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful --
dialog: it's awful.
text: She slides down to the floor, by the side of the bed.
text: Kringelein climbs out of bed, tries to help her up.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Stay here.
text: She waves him away.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Don't wait now -- go -- Preysing.
text: Kringelein assumes suddenly a strength. He is a man for a
text: crisis -- he forgets that he was ever ill -- he leaves.
text: WE GO WITH HIM. CUT HIM DOWN CORRIDOR QUICKLY. He pauses
text: outside Preysing's door, uncertain of the rooms, then he
dialog: knocks.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Mr. Preysing -- Oh, Mr. Preysing --
text: He feels there must be a mistake -- he steps back, sees
text: Flaemmchen's door open next to it. He enters.
scene_heading: CUT HIM THROUGH:
scene_heading: FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM
text: He enters. Looks around. Looks through bathroom. Goes quickly
dialog: forward.
scene_heading: CUT INTO REVERSE:
scene_heading: PREYSING'S ROOM
text: Preysing is still leaning against the table, his mouth is
text: open, he is gaping -- stunned. The two hundred and four pounds
text: has collapsed and sagged. He is staring, his victim lying --
text: a heap upon the floor, very still and quiet. His eyes come
text: around as Kringelein enters.
text: Kringelein crosses, looks down. Touches the Baron's hand.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: My best friend -- poor, Baron --
dialog: dead -- just like that.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: -- We must do something...
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Yes, the police must be called.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: No -- no -- wait -- the man was a
dialog: burglar -- he was going to steal my
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
speaker_heading: PREYSING
dialog: (suddenly)

text: The general feeling of the beginning of another day.
text: THE CAMERA waits at a distance shooting from door as Preysing,

speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: Man -- that's terrible. He was a
dialog: nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: It seems that he was a thief and an
dialog: imposter.
speaker_heading: SENF
dialog: I don't believe it -- he was a real
dialog: gentleman. I know people... I'm so
dialog: tired I can hardly see out of my
dialog: eyes. No sleep for two nights and so
dialog: many duties and now this killing in
dialog: the hotel -- that means a lot of
dialog: work. But it's too bad about the
dialog: Baron, you always felt better when
dialog: he came along -- always friendly --

dialog: no man ever was.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Perhaps he really was a burglar --
dialog: But they don't kill a man for that.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
text: He was in desperate straits. He'd
dialog: been trying to raise money all day.
dialog: He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a
text: man like Preysing kills him.
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: (naively)
dialog: I didn't like Preysing right off.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Then why did you have anything to do

speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN

dialog: Money!
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Yes, of course, -- money!
speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN

speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Of course I do -- I never knew what

speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor,

speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
dialog: Do you believe that you will have a

speaker_heading: FLAEMMCHEN
dialog: Oh yes, of course.
speaker_heading: KRINGELEIN
