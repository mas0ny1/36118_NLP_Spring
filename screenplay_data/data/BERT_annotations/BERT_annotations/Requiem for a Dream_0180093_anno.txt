speaker_heading: HARRY

text: Then, he throws up his hands, mumbles -
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Eh, screw it.
text: And pushes the set carefully out of the apartment.
text: In the closet, Sara hears the door shut. She mumbles to

speaker_heading: SARA
dialog: It’s not happening. And if it should

dialog: for Marion!
text: But she doesn’t hear him and she keeps walking. He runs
dialog: after them.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JAIL DORMITORY 174
