speaker_heading: AN ASTRONAUT
text: slowly floats into shot, an arm reaching for something we
dialog: can’t see.
text: CLOSE UP ON A WHITE GLOVE
text: fingers outstretched. On the far side of screen the edge of
text: something flat, grey and man-made appears.
speaker_heading: A WIDE REVERSE
text: On the astronaut framed against a GIANT MOON. The astronaut
text: closes on the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. The SPACE SHUTTLE
text: DISCOVERY is docked below.
text: A razor sharp shadow line dropped by the shuttle wing moves
text: across the grey painted aluminium surface towards the
dialog: astronaut.
text: GLOVE FINGERS close around the yellow grab rail on the
scene_heading: DISCOVERY.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Contact.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: We copy. Heart rate 72.
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: In the foot restraints.
speaker_heading: MALE VOICE
dialog: That’s good work up there, Laura.
scene_heading: WE FIND A WOMAN'S FACE
text: This is Mission Specialist LAURA WALLACE (40). It is her
dialog: first space walk, her first NASA mission, but if she’s
text: nervous or intimidated she doesn’t show it. Laura was the
dialog: girl in Junior High who finished calculus tests early, so she
dialog: could go run two miles before track practice.
dialog: To her, life is a series of tasks and she is the tool God
dialog: made to get them done.
text: In the distance, the SUN rises for the sixth time today,
text: golden light moving across the shuttle.
text: THE SCREEN FILLS WITH WHITE LIGHT.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Damn, that’s bright.
text: OUT OF TOTAL WHITE-OUT bleached facial features appear.
speaker_heading: HANK (0.S.)
dialog: You OK?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That's so bright.
text: She blinks as white light moves across her face in a sharp
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sun-bounce off the panel. I’m OK.
text: Ready to swing out.
text: We PULL OUT to find that she has attached herself to the
text: CANADARM of the Space Shuttle Discovery -- a long, folded
text: robotic arm designed to help astronauts do difficult work.
speaker_heading: HANK (0.S.)
dialog: Swing out in five, four, three,
dialog: two, one.
text: The arm begins a SLOW SWING wide, extending to its full one
text: hundred feet, then angles in towards the ISS.
speaker_heading: CHITHRA (0.S.)
dialog: Panel 4 on its way to you now.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Roger that.
text: ANGLE ON THE EARTH
text: below her, a swirling mass of oceans and continents.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Attach t-line.
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: Safety tether attached.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON LAURA
text: focused on the job, her face framed inside her helmet. The
text: suit she’s wearing weighs 250 pounds, but in zero gravity she
dialog: can’t feel the weight. Outside the temperature is -100
text: celcius in the shade, but in direct sun the shuttle can heat
dialog: to 260 degrees.
dialog: oe
text: There is no oxygen in space, just a cold vacuum that would
dialog: boil your body fluids and asphyxiate your brain in minutes if
dialog: you didn’t have the suit, which Laura does -- allowing her to
text: float there waiting as the replacement panel is lifted to her
text: by a long robotic arm.
text: She watches it come, focused on the job, no time to sight-
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: BELOW HER
text: A wall of airborne sand pushes across the Atlantic from the
text: Sahara, as a perfect spiral of Hurricane Daniel off Mexico's
text: Pacific coast throws mile long arcs of lightning from cloud
dialog: to cloud.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AIR LOCK. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - “DAY”

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Not bad, huh?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: What?
dialog: Beat. Is she serious?
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Wallace, you just spent seven hours

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Next time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CREW QUARTERS. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - “NIGHT”
text: Laura and the crew sleep strapped into insulation bags
text: attached to the shuttle walls. In micro G, the unconscious
text: astronauts seem frozen -- arms bent, hair stood out on end.
text: We FIND LAURA, at peace, dreaming zero G dreams. We HEAR a
text: MAN's voice.
speaker_heading: DREW (0.S.)
dialog: That’s right, honey. Mommy’s up in
dialog: space right now.
text: We hear a little boy's voice.
speaker_heading: NEIL (0.S.)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DREW (0.S.)
dialog: Well, she’s -- you remember mommy
dialog: showed you -- how there’s a
dialog: building in space -- a station --
dialog: and the people in it, they need
dialog: food and water. And somebody to fix
dialog: the fridge when it breaks. So we
dialog: send astronauts to fly up there and
dialog: do a job.
speaker_heading: NEIL (0.S.)
dialog: And mommy’s an astronaut.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON LAURA
text: Her eyelids moving as she dreams.
speaker_heading: DREW (0.S.)
dialog: That’s right. It’s all she ever
dialog: wanted to be, and she did it. Yay,
dialog: mommy!
text: A long beat and then we hear a LOW TONE and the song HERE
text: COMES THE SUN by the BEATLES fills the cabin. The lights come
text: up gently. The crew stirs, moving slowly. All except Laura
text: who's EYES SNAP OPEN at the tone. She springs into action.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - “NIGHT”
text: The CREW eats, dressed in branded fleece, getting used to

dialog: You have three, ya?
speaker_heading: LAURA

speaker_heading: MILES

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It’s only a few days. And -- you

text: She tags the intercom.
speaker_heading: LAURA
text: Roger, Houston CMS. Standby.
speaker_heading: MISSION CONTROL (0.S.)
dialog: Discovery crew messages are on

speaker_heading: LAURA
text: Roger Houston. Starting sequence.

text: ANGLE ON THE PLANET EARTH
text: As it is revealed by the retreating door, oceanic, bathed in

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - “NIGHT”
text: Laura, Hank and Cole put finishing touches on the panel she’s

text: Below her, the NEON LIGHTS of the Shanghai night GLOW and
text: PULSE, reflecting off her visor.
speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Okay. Last bolt.
text: He fastens it.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: That's it, folks. Time to pack up
dialog: and go home.

text: The three astronauts process that, the end of the mission.

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: I have the stick. Beginning
dialog: descent.
text: He fires thrusters and begins their break from orbit. We PUSH
text: PAST the PILOT and CO-PILOT and move towards Laura, sitting
text: in back. Her job is done. Around her, the crew is talking,

text: Laura stays focused, a tool without a task. She tries to hang
dialog: on to the feeling, to remember every moment, to slow time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: BOOM BOOM.
text: The loud rumble of the Discovery crew out-running sound

scene_heading: INT. SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY - CONTINUOUS
text: COMMANDER LYNCH, steady hands at the controls, eases the

speaker_heading: HANK
text: There she is.
text: Through the windshield we see CAPE CANAVERAL, Runway 33
text: straight ahead.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Gear down.
text: They make their approach to Cape -- the ground closing in

speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Chutes.
text: A button is pushed.

speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Well done, astronauts.
text: They unbuckle.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s go home.

speaker_heading: CHITHRA
dialog: Ugh. Earth sucks.
dialog: Qo
text: They move out of the cockpit, into the MAIN HOLD and towards

text: Ahead of us, the SHUTTLE DOOR is opened, sunlight pouring in.
text: The cabin around Laura goes dark.
text: From her POV we approach the doorway -- the darkness around

dialog: frame and --
text: EXITS THE SHUTTLE onto the --
scene_heading: EXT. RUNWAY 33. CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY
text: Now in full daylight, we realize we’re still in the shrunken
text: aspect ratio -- as if back on Earth Laura’s life is smaller
text: somehow, more claustrophobic.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON LAURA
text: as she blinks against the sunlight.
text: ANGLE ON THE RUNWAY
text: A LARGE CROWD is gathered on bleachers, NASA personnel,
dialog: families and the general public.
text: HANK waves to the crowd, as do the other astronauts. They are
dialog: celebrities for a day, American heroes.
text: ANGLE ON THE CROWD
text: We see DREW WALLACE (40s) and the kids. Drew is a NASA public
text: relations executive. He’s a handsome guy with a good smile,

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (points)
text: There she is. There’s mommy.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP ON LAURA
text: She looks a little stunned at the change of focus -- from

dialog: Earth.
text: She works up a smile, waves.
text: NASA boiler suited WORKERS approach and help the crew to a

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Thank you, Cape Canaveral!

text: Thunderous applause. The crew can’t help but smile.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: This bird was in the best shape of
dialog: any I’ve flown. We did it. We’1l do
dialog: it again. Darn it, we’re gonna be
dialog: doing it for a heck of a long time.
text: The crowd goes nuts. Laura deals with gravity, squints.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Also -- to the crew and family of
dialog: the Columbia -- we miss you every
dialog: day -- let’s have a moment of
dialog: silence.
text: Everyone on the stage and in the crowd goes silent, bows

text: HANK looks up.
speaker_heading: HANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. We’1ll go say hi to our
dialog: own families now. Y’all have a

text: The ceremony ends. Laura makes her way off the stage a little
text: shakily. Below on the runway, her family awaits.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: There’s my girl.
text: Laura’s daughter RUTH (15) is a few paces away. Laura’s
text: twins, NEIL and ED (6), hold foil “Welcome Home” balloons.
dialog: They see her, and --
speaker_heading: NEIL AND ED
dialog: MOM!!!
text: -- come running for her, arms outstretched, their BALLOONS

dialog: mother at full speed--
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: -- Oof.
text: Laura bundles them into her arms. Kisses every smiling face.
text: Drew puts his arms around Laura. She leans into him.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: We missed you so much.

text: prototype ENTERPRISE, posing with SALLY RIDE, JOHN GLENN etc.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: So. How do you feel?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Walking’s more of a pain in the ass
dialog: than I remember.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: Get’s easier. How was it?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Mission accomplished, sir.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: That’s not what I asked.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Best two weeks of my life.
text: Paxton smiles up from his paperwork. For all his work he’s
dialog: never been to space. This is as close as he’ll ever get.
speaker_heading: LAURA (CONT'D)
text: Boat ran like a clock. Systems held
dialog: up. Crew were top class.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: There'll be a routine psych follow
dialog: up at 3 days, 14 and 30 to 45 —
dialog: just to go over lessons learned in
dialog: hindsight and help you adjust to
dialog: your new role on the ground.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It’s not necessary.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: Well, it’s regulation, so -- any
dialog: confusion up there? Panic?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I'll admit, first time you step out
dialog: of that bay -- it’s not nothing.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: Did you feel any immediate danger?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: We all took the same risk.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: You know what I mean.
text: Laura considers, wanting to give an honest answer.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Sir, I never felt so alive.
text: Paxton smiles. He sits back from his desk.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: I’1l be honest, I don’t know how
dialog: many more of these launches we’re
dialog: gonna do.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That’s a mistake.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: I know, but -- a lotta suits in
dialog: Washington think our budget’d be
dialog: better spent elsewhere. Bombs
dialog: maybe. But in the meantime,
dialog: Atlantis is around the corner for
dialog: us --
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: -- Two years to blastoff, sir.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: And we'll need a Mission
dialog: Specialist. Would you be willing to
dialog: return?

speaker_heading: MARK

speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: An honour to serve. How was it?
text: He points up and whistles an ascending note. Laura laughs.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Amazing.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Amazing.
text: He stares at her. No sale. She’s wrong footed. The moment

speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)
dialog: Ok, there it is.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Yeah. Wow.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Sorry. There what is?
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: Plain as day.
speaker_heading: PAXTON
dialog: Commander Goodwin has a “theory” he
dialog: can tell who’s been to space by
text: looking at them.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: More than a theory, chief.
text: Laura is a little thrown. Mark sees her self-consciousness.
speaker_heading: MARK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LAURA

dialog: now?
text: He shrugs re-entering his office.

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, maybe your school was the

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: Separation in three! Two --
text: There’s a lurch forward as Discovery’s solid rocket boosters
