speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: During one of the early campaigns,
dialog: I started opening my speeches with

dialog: my signature...
scene_heading: 2 EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT
text: In street clothes, trying to corral an angry mob on City
text: Hall's steps, Harvey lifts a bullhorn.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Hello, I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm

scene_heading: 3 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT

scene_heading: 4 INT. UNION HALL - NIGHT
text: Harvey is in a plain, ill fitting brown suit making a
text: CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I know, I know, I'm not what you

scene_heading: 5 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
text: RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I fully realize that a person who
dialog: stands for what I stand for - an
dialog: activist, a gay activist - becomes
dialog: the target or potential target for
dialog: a person who is insecure,
text: terrified, afraid or very disturbed
dialog: themselves...
scene_heading: 6 INT. CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY
text: POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City
text: Hall, their walkie-talkies squawking. Something terrible has
text: happened. It's chaos.
text: A STRETCHER IS WHEELED OUT OF AN OFFICE. On it, a FILLED BODY
text: BAG with a WHITE SHEET draped over it.
text: The press rush to get a shot. The police officers quickly

scene_heading: 9 EXT. S.F. CITY HALL / FRONT STEPS - DAY
text: A shell shocked DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 45, wades into a throng of

scene_heading: 10 INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

text: She sits by him. A weight hangs. He can't make eye contact.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: Something has happened.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
text: She puts her arm around him, feels a gun at his side. She

scene_heading: 11 INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
text: RETURN TO: Harvey speaking into his tape recorder...
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Knowing that I could be assassinated
dialog: at any moment, I feel it's important
dialog: that some people should understand
dialog: my thoughts. I think that--
dialog: (pauses, not sure what to say)
dialog: I wish I had time to explain
dialog: everything I did. Almost everything
dialog: that was done was done with an eye
dialog: on the gay movement.

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Hey. I'm Harvey.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: (so what?)
dialog: Okay, Harvey...
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Today's my birthday.
dialog: (Scott laughs)
dialog: No, today is actually my birthday.
dialog: Well, tonight. At midnight.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: And, believe it or not, I don't
dialog: have any plans. People took me out
dialog: after work...
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: (looking him over)
dialog: Work? So, that would be... Let me
dialog: guess. Ma Bell or AT&amp;T.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: The Great American Insurance
dialog: Company. I'm part of the big,
dialog: evil, corporate establishment that,
dialog: let me guess, you think is the
dialog: cause of every evil thing in the
dialog: world from Vietnam to diaper rash.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: You left out bad breath.
text: Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They
text: both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.
text: A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: So... You're not going to let me
dialog: celebrate my birthday all by myself
dialog: are you?
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: (gently teasing)
dialog: Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute
dialog: for a suit... But I don't do guys
dialog: over forty.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Well then, I'm in luck.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Because I'm still thirty-nine...
dialog: (showing Scott his watch)
text: And it's only eleven-fifteen.
scene_heading: 14 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: IN A TIGHT TWO-SHOT, Scott is pressed against a wall with

scene_heading: 15 INT. HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of
text: FOOD that rests on the bed between them. Ice cream, cookies,
text: milk, berries... It's over the top and adorable.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Where are you from?
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Jackson, Mississippi.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Well, this isn't Jackson, but you
dialog: still can't respond to every
dialog: strange man you meet on a subway
dialog: platform. It's too dangerous.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Now you tell me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: There's nothing tougher than a New
dialog: York City cop. They're arrogant,
dialog: and they're everywhere. I'll show
dialog: you the cruising spots, if you
dialog: want, if you promise you'll be
dialog: careful... little Scottie-san.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Are you on uppers or what?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: No. This is just... plain old me.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: You're afraid of the cops?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I'm just discreet. I know a lot of
dialog: people here. If they found out, I
dialog: could lose my job.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: (meaning a closet case)
dialog: Oh. You're one of "those."
dialog: (examines Harvey's eyes)
dialog: I think you need a change of
text: scenery. New friends.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I need a change.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: (looks at the clock)
dialog: You're forty now.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (just the truth)
dialog: Forty years old and I haven't done
dialog: a thing I'm proud of.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: (re: the desert tray)
dialog: You keep eating like this and
dialog: you'll be a fat ass by fifty.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (laughs it off)
dialog: No. Don't you worry. I won't make
dialog: it to fifty.
text: Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding,
text: he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.
text: Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his
text: young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting
text: everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: (an idea, half-jokingly,
speaker_heading: HALF-SERIOUSLY)
dialog: Why don't we run away together?
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Where to?
scene_heading: 16 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
text: RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout
text: the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is
dialog: telling us things no one else knows.)
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: In those days, San Francisco was
dialog: the place where everyone wanted to
dialog: go... To drop out... To fall in
dialog: love...

text: through the redwoods, over the Golden Gate Bridge, and into
dialog: San Francisco.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
dialog: But by 1972, The Haight was boarded
text: up. Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The
dialog: new place for us refugees was this
dialog: run down Irish Catholic
dialog: neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six
text: blocks square... The Castro.
scene_heading: 17 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY
text: Harvey lifts a Nikon camera and starts SNAPPING PHOTOS of
dialog: Castro Street.
text: WE SEE WHAT HARVEY SEES THROUGH THE LENS: A HARDWARE STORE,
text: a LIQUOR STORE, empty buildings, boarded windows...
text: Harvey points the camera toward The MARQUEE of the Castro
text: Theater, big letters spelling out... "C A S T R O..."
text: Harvey points his camera across the street at the gray-
text: haired, OWNER of a liquor store. Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his
text: face, an expression of distrust.
text: Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:
scene_heading: "EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY."
text: Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS
text: WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's
text: eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling.
text: Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT
text: SIGN hanging out front.
scene_heading: 19 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY
text: The place is FILLED with OPERA MUSIC from a record player.
text: Harvey is loading a roll of film into his camera.
text: Scott is getting high, lying in the sun that pours through
text: the large, empty windows.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: I cashed my last unemployment check
dialog: yesterday...
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Well, I hope you did something
dialog: useful with it.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: I bought an ounce of pot. I was
dialog: just wondering if you had any
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH (CONT'D)
dialog: plans, or thoughts... About us
dialog: doing something to, you know, bring
dialog: in an income.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Don't move.
text: Harvey straddles Scott. He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: I suppose I can wait tables.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: No way. I want you right here with
dialog: me... Did you see place downstairs
dialog: is for rent?
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I was thinking we could open a shop
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: What kind of shop?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
text: One with very little overhead. Not
dialog: too much work... A little one, just
dialog: like Morris and Minnie Milk of
dialog: Woodmere, New York...
scene_heading: 20 EXT. CASTRO STREET CAMERA SHOP - DAY (1973)
text: Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA
text: STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).
text: Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside
text: the store's large window hanging a sign: "CASTRO CAMERA."
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Just a little to the left...
text: The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses
text: the street to watch. Harvey gives him a warm welcome:
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello there. I'm Harvey Milk.
speaker_heading: MCCONNELLY
dialog: You're the new renters?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Yes. Welcome to Castro Camera.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: Harvey extends his hand. McConnelly shakes, but is wary.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to join the, um... What is
dialog: it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's
dialog: Association. I want to help in any
dialog: way possible. I'm no interloper.
dialog: A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll
dialog: forgive that.
text: McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.
speaker_heading: MCCONNELLY
dialog: I don't think your application will
dialog: be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a
dialog: family neighborhood. Your kind are
dialog: far more welcome on Haight street.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (trying to keep it friendly)
dialog: What "kind" do you mean, sir?
speaker_heading: MCCONNELLY
dialog: (not playing along)
dialog: The Merchant's Association will
dialog: have the police pull your license
dialog: if you open your doors.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Based on what law?
speaker_heading: MCCONNELLY
dialog: There's man's law and there's God's
dialog: law in this neighborhood and in this
dialog: City. The San Francisco Police
dialog: force is happy to enforce either.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
text: (to McConnelly as he walks away)
dialog: Thanks for the warm welcome to the
dialog: neighborhood!
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: We pay taxes you know!
text: Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from
text: pouncing. It's not the time for them to bite yet.
scene_heading: 21 INT. HARVEY AND SCOTT'S APARTMENT ABOVE THE STORE -- DAY
text: Scott is sitting on the bed, while Harvey is TALKING A MILE A
text: MINUTE FROM THE KITCHEN, totally energized.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: We'll form our own business
dialog: association! Start with the gay-
dialog: owned businesses... We'll take down
dialog: the addresses of every customer that
dialog: comes in for a roll of film. We'll
dialog: ask them what they want to see done
dialog: here... what they want changed...
dialog: We'll get money rolling into this
dialog: neighborhood. Revitalize it...
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Can I come in now?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (O.S.)
dialog: One more minute!
dialog: (back to his new scheme)
dialog: I'll go to the neighborhood banks.
dialog: They must have some gay customers.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Harvey. What's with all this
dialog: political activist crap? I thought
dialog: you were a goddamn Republican.
text: Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of
text: food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still
text: rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I'm a businessman, Scott. I think
dialog: businesses ought to treat their
dialog: customers right. Even their gay
dialog: customers. For God's sake, this is
dialog: San Francisco!
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Harvey. It's just like every other
dialog: city in this country. People hate
dialog: us. Big surprise.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: We should have at least one block
dialog: in one city right? Start there and
text: take over the neighborhood.
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: Okay, you can come in now!
text: Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a
text: home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Wow. This is--
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Happy birthday!
text: Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear
text: some of the CREAM PIE onto him.
scene_heading: 22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY
text: The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street
text: Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate
text: outside Toad Hall bar.
text: ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about,
text: eyeing the scene skeptically.
text: Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.
text: MAN ON THE STREET
dialog: Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Thanks for joining the Castro
dialog: Village Association!
text: Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the
text: Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them,
text: into the store, leaving Scott outside.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me gentleman... ladies.
dialog: (finding the shop owner)
dialog: Hello! Mr. McConnelly!
text: McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new
dialog: business.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wanted to stop in and see
dialog: how business was doing.
speaker_heading: MCCONNELLY
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: So you don't mind all these
dialog: homosexuals in here, do you?
text: McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is
text: curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly
dialog: here loves our kind. Spend away!
dialog: (to McConnelly)
dialog: Tell your wife Hello for me.
text: Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,
text: KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step
text: back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.
text: Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him
text: through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new
dialog: neighborhood.
scene_heading: 23 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: And people started hanging around
dialog: our store. Not customers.
dialog: Activists, kids, folks who needed a
dialog: home away from home...
scene_heading: 26 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - INTERCUT
text: A NEW sign goes in the window: "We are VERY open."
scene_heading: 27 INT. CASTRO CAMERA SHOP - DAY
text: A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings
text: of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a
text: clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the
dialog: arts, and checking out the cute ones.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
dialog: There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute
dialog: art student who I'd picked up at
dialog: Toad Hall. Turns out he was also
dialog: good at running the Camera Shop...
dialog: something Scott and I found we had
dialog: surprising little interest in...
text: ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.
speaker_heading: DANNY NICCOLETTA
dialog: Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about
dialog: street theater, now.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: What you're not getting is the
dialog: spectacle of it, the bigger than
dialog: life emotions...
text: Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of
text: an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great
dialog: wit. A Harvard graduate, which
dialog: nobody cared about, in those days,
dialog: in the Castro... including himself.
text: JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that
text: sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for
text: something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young
text: man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And somewhere along the line Jim
dialog: picked up a protege, a cute
dialog: political kid from Wisconsin... Dick
dialog: Pabich... And of course there was
dialog: Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular
dialog: business with the new kids...
text: DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And on occasion we actually had a
dialog: real customer. But only occasionally.
text: ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of
text: place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Harvey... This guy wants to talk to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (approaches Allan)
dialog: Welcome. What can we do for you?
speaker_heading: ALLAN BAIRD
dialog: Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters
dialog: representative, and Director of the
dialog: Coors beer boycott in California.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's
dialog: a very big deal, so behave
dialog: yourselves.
speaker_heading: ALLAN BAIRD
dialog: I was told you were like the Mayor
dialog: of the Castro, said you organized
dialog: the CVA, you might know some people
text: in the bars.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I do have friends in awfully low
dialog: places, but just so you know, it's
dialog: not official yet.
speaker_heading: ALLAN BAIRD
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: The Mayor part. I've considered
text: gathering an army of queers to
text: march up to City Hall and secede,
dialog: but so far the young gays seem more
text: interested in jeeps and jeans. But
dialog: if I could be of any use, I'm all
dialog: ears!
speaker_heading: ALLAN BAIRD
dialog: We can't get Coors to go union.
dialog: These guys are like me, they can't
dialog: be out of work too long.
text: Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his
text: nerves. It's Harvey at his best.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I'm just curious. Are we your first
dialog: stop or your last?
speaker_heading: ALLAN BAIRD
dialog: (clearly his last)
dialog: It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Well, you seem to have noticed that
dialog: my kind of people drink a lot of
dialog: beer. If we're going to fast for
dialog: your sake, I think we should get to
dialog: deliver some of it when you win
dialog: this fight, don't you?
speaker_heading: ALLAN BAIRD
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: Is that what you really want?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: And allies. I'll have Coors out of
dialog: every bar in the Castro by the end
dialog: of the week. Deal?
speaker_heading: ALLAN BAIRD
dialog: (nods, sincere)
dialog: Thank you Mr. Milk.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
text: JUMP TO: Allan is on his way out. Harvey walks back behind
text: the counter to Scott.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: No more Coors beer. It's gotta come
text: out of every bar. Gay and straight.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: What's he giving you?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Nothing for me. That's a convert.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: A convert to what?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: The cause.
scene_heading: 27A INT. VARIOUS SAN FRANCISCO BARS - PHOTO MONTAGE
text: A STILL PHOTO MONTAGE: Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny get bar
text: owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps,
text: throw out their Coors stock, put on "Boycott Coors" buttons
text: and tape up "Dump Coors" posters.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (V.O.)
dialog: I got "my people" to get Coors out
dialog: of all the Gay Bars. 30 million
dialog: bottles worth in San Francisco
text: alone. Coors beer immediately fell
dialog: from number 1. They caved. One week
dialog: later, union man Allan Baird hired
dialog: the first ever openly gay union
dialog: boys to drive Teamsters trucks...
dialog: We weren't just a group of pansies
dialog: anymore. We had a neighborhood. We
dialog: had the unions. And for the first
dialog: time, we had a little bit of power.
scene_heading: 27B INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Maybe that was the day someone
dialog: first called me the "Mayor" of
dialog: Castro Street.
dialog: (a knowing grin)
dialog: Or perhaps I invented it myself.
scene_heading: 28 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Harvey, Jim &amp; Dick, Scott, Danny and Dennis debate the merits
dialog: of working within "the system" versus dropping out. Everyone
text: is talking over each other...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
text: A YOUNG GAY MAN runs into the store.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GAY MAN
dialog: The fucking cops, man, they're up on
dialog: Castro Street! Toad Hall.
text: Harvey and the guys race out of the store.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY
text: Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one
text: of the Castro GAY BARS where POLICE ARE GETTING OUT OF SQUAD
text: CARS AND APPROACHING CUSTOMERS crowding around the entrance.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Clear the sidewalk!
text: Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: Because I have so much experience

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Politics is theater. It doesn't

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Harvey, you do that every time you
text: cross the street.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
text: Coors looks like it might cave. The

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Fun?
text: Harvey starts kissing him all over.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: We'll make it a spectacle.
scene_heading: 31 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY
text: Harvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, shakes,

text: MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart.
text: Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It
text: reads, âSoap Box.â Harvey steps onto it. A crowd forms.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: A week ago, Police officers came

dialog: Cleve... Jones.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Well Mr. Jones, we should walk up
dialog: to my camera shop and register you.
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: Fuck that. Elections of any kind
dialog: are a bourgeois affectation.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Is that right? Do you trick up on
dialog: Polk Street?
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: (only half-joking)
dialog: If I need the cash... But I'm
dialog: selective about my clients.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Tell me one thing before you get
dialog: back to work then. What was it like
dialog: to be a little queer in Phoenix?
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: I faked a lung disease to get out
dialog: of PE. So what? What are you, some
dialog: kind of street shrink?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Sometimes. But what I'm saying is,
dialog: Phoenix can change. But we have to
dialog: start with our street: rent control,
dialog: police abuse, pot, parks, seniors.
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: (turns to go)
dialog: Well, good luck with all that.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: You know what I think, Cleve Jones?
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: That you're gonna get somewhere if
dialog: you keep talking?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: No. That you need to do what you're

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Just the "trick." Jerry Taylor.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK

dialog: Could be just the push we need.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: You think this is funny?

text: Reluctantly, Harvey takes the letter from Scott.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Don't do that.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: If you put it away, hide it in a
dialog: drawer, it'll just get bigger and
dialog: scarier. Now it's there. We'll
dialog: see it every day. It can't get us.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: All this energy... to make yourself

dialog: when I decided to do something. So
dialog: I bought The Advocate. And I use

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Endorsing straight candidates is
dialog: what you think is best to help us?
speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: Yes, if they're friendly to our
dialog: cause.
speaker_heading: RICK STOKES
speaker_heading: (DEFENSIVE)
dialog: Politics is complicated in San
dialog: Francisco, and Supervisor is a
dialog: citywide office. Political alliances
dialog: need to be built. You can't simply
dialog: move here from across the country
dialog: and run for office.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: But I am running for office. I'm on
dialog: the ballot. I have the union rank
dialog: and file, the seniors, and I could
dialog: use your magazine's endorsement.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: Harvey, we're like the Catholic
dialog: church. We welcome converts, but we
dialog: don't make them Pope the same day.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: And why haven't you run?
speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: It's too early for a gay candidate
dialog: for Supervisor. Especially one
dialog: from the Castro. It's bad for the
dialog: community's image.
text: Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table, naked and
text: sopping wet.
speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: What's wrong with the Castro?
speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: Nobody works there. It's all sex
dialog: and drugs and more sex and no one
dialog: taking responsibility for their own
dialog: problems.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: The cops come into our neighborhood
dialog: and beat us. They turn a blind eye
dialog: if one of us is murdered.
speaker_heading: RICK STOKES
dialog: Then we file a lawsuit against the
dialog: city. We go to our political allies
dialog: in City Hall...
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: There are no real gay allies. Yes,
dialog: our friends may sense our struggle,
dialog: but they can't feel it. It's not
dialog: life or death for them. We need our
dialog: own in office.
speaker_heading: RICK STOKES
dialog: You can't demand acceptance overnight.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Why not? How can we ask them to
dialog: respect us if we don't show
dialog: ourselves some self respect, David.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: The more âoutâ you make us, the
dialog: more you incite them. Step back and
dialog: quiet down.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Go back into the closet? Is that
dialog: what you're saying? Because I know
dialog: the closet. I lived in it for more
dialog: years than I care to remember.
dialog: (rising to go)
dialog: I don't need your endorsement. I'm
dialog: not asking anyone for acceptance.
dialog: I don't have time to ask.
speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: For you, politics is a game, a
dialog: lark. Like putting on a rock
dialog: festival or staging a "love-in."
dialog: You're too old to be a hippie,
dialog: Harvey Milk!
text: Harvey turns around, ready for a fight.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I'm not a candidate, I'm part of a

text: Art smiles. Chuckles flutter through the audience.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: You're right, Art. And many are

speaker_heading: JACK LIRA

speaker_heading: CHANNEL 5 REPORTER
dialog: Does this mean, as many straights
dialog: are concerned, maybe the gays are
dialog: taking over San Francisco? Are you
dialog: going to be a Supervisor for all
dialog: the people?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I have to be. That's what I was
dialog: elected for. I have to be there to
dialog: open up the dialogue for the

text: featuring new Supervisors, Harvey Milk and Dan White.
speaker_heading: HOST (ON TV)
dialog: This will be the first time in many
dialog: years that we've seen so many new
text: faces on the Board of Supervisors.
dialog: Do you think such diversity will
dialog: cripple the Board?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
dialog: The name of the game on the Board
dialog: is six votes to get anything
dialog: passed. So, like it or not, Dan
dialog: and I are now in bed together...
dialog: politically speaking.
text: THE CAMERA REVEALS SCOTT watching the program. He's been up
dialog: all night.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE (ON TV)
dialog: I've assured Harvey here that my
dialog: brochure's comments about "social

scene_heading: 80 INT. TELEVISION STATION - MOMENTS LATER
text: The segment over, sound assistants help Harvey and Dan remove
text: their microphones. Harvey tries to draw Dan in:
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: How long were you a fireman, Dan?
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: A couple of years.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: And before that... You were a
dialog: police officer?
text: Dan studies Harvey suspiciously... What's his point?
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: You have something against cops?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: No. They tend to have something

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: (seeing Dan react uncomfortably)
dialog: But firefighters. Now those are true
dialog: heroes... They supported me in the
dialog: last campaign. I support them fully.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: I appreciate it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I meant what I said. I'd like to
dialog: work together.

speaker_heading: DAN WHITE

dialog: I'll see you at the office, Mr.
dialog: Milk.
scene_heading: 81 INT. CITY HALL - DAY
text: Harvey goes through the metal detectors at the entrance and

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: What do you think of my new
dialog: theater?
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
text: A bit over the top.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: What's with the suit?
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: I got it from a friend.
text: Harvey leads Cleve from the elevator to the grand staircase.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: When you come here, I want you to

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: all that. It bugs the hell out of

text: They arrive at his Lead Aide's desk: it's Anne Kronenberg.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: Morning Annie, let's set Cleve up
dialog: on mail.
speaker_heading: ANNE KRONENBERG

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Come into my office...
scene_heading: 83 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Harvey walks in. Michael and Jim are in a strategy session.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: The first order of business that
dialog: will come out of this office is a
dialog: city wide Gay Rights Ordinance.
dialog: Just like the one Anita shot down
dialog: in Dade County. What do you think,
dialog: Lotus Blossom?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL WONG
dialog: I think it's good. Not great.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Then make it brilliant. I want
dialog: Anita's attention here. In San
dialog: Francisco. I want her to bring her
dialog: fight to US... This Bill needs a
dialog: unanimous vote. We need headlines.
speaker_heading: JIM RIVALDO
dialog: Dan White won't vote for this.
text: Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,
text: indicating Dan is down there. Harvey whispers:
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
text: Dan's fine. He's just uneducated.
dialog: We can teach him.
text: Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
text: Harvey, committee meets at 9:30.

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I'll be there.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: Great!
text: All smiles, Dan leaves. Cleve mocks him. OFF Mike Wong's
text: expression: THAT WAS BIZARRE.
speaker_heading: ANNE KRONENBERG
dialog: Are you going?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Hey. I'll let him christen me, if
dialog: he'll vote for my Gay Rights
dialog: Ordinance. We need allies. We need
dialog: everyone.
scene_heading: 84 EXT. THE CASTRO - TWILIGHT
text: The neighborhood is booming. Storefronts and sidewalks

text: for a lovely, romantic dinner.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Jack?
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're
dialog: hungry. I only know how to cook one
dialog: thing, but I make it good.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Did you... break in?
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: I asked the boy downstairs to let
dialog: me in...
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: Danny?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: He wouldn't let me in. So I came in
dialog: this way. Your friends aren't very
dialog: nice to me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY
dialog: (avoiding the fight)
dialog: I have a Town Hall meeting tonight,
dialog: Jack.
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: You work too hard. I'm sorry about
dialog: your window. I'll fix it tomorrow.
dialog: (turning on the charm)
dialog: Are you surprised?!
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Jack, I have to go. I have an
dialog: invitation to a party tomorrow.
dialog: Lots of rich people, politicians.
dialog: We could get all dressed up...
text: Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him
text: through a simple dance.
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: So I could be the first lady?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: I watched TV here today. All day. I
dialog: saw All My Children. They killed
dialog: Margo. I knew it was going to
dialog: happen. They try and trick you but
dialog: it never works.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (enjoying this)
dialog: You always see it coming?
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: What? Killing the blonde? Every
dialog: time. I'm good with that.
dialog: (gets slow, sensual)
dialog: I think now the old lady is going
dialog: to have an affair. Then she'll get
dialog: killed or married. Always one or
dialog: the other. Dead or married.
text: Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: If I make you a key, you won't
dialog: break my windows again, right?
speaker_heading: JACK LIRA
dialog: That's right.
dialog: The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be
dialog: going back to work tonight.
scene_heading: 86 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY
text: Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard
dialog: to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the
text: only gay man at Dan's child's baptism.
text: Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves.
scene_heading: 87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER
text: Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I'm proposing a citywide ordinance.
dialog: It ensures that a person who
dialog: already has a job can't be fired
dialog: for their orientation.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: I'm not sure my constituents would
dialog: favor that.
text: Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Is anyone else here from the Board?
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: You're the only one who showed up I
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Were you christened here?
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My
dialog: grandma immigrated here when this
dialog: was an Irish Catholic city. The
dialog: City of St. Francis... A lot's
dialog: changed here since then.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: You're more like one of us now...
text: an outsider.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: You're not like most homosexuals,
dialog: are you, Harvey?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Do you know a lot of "homosexuals?"
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: (smiles, then)
dialog: Say, where do you stand on the
dialog: Psychiatric Center the City's been
dialog: pushing into my district?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Well, I'd have to study it...
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: Getting it out of my district was a
dialog: key piece of my platform. It only
text: attracts arsonist, rapists, all
dialog: that, you know.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Sure, sure. A campaign promise.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: A big one.
speaker_heading: (QUIET)
dialog: What do you say we watch out for each
dialog: other's interests? I'd like that.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I'd like that, too, Dan.
text: Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as
text: if she's walked in on something intimate.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: The Gay Rights Ordinance. My fault.
scene_heading: MARY ANN WHITE
dialog: Seems an inappropriate subject in
dialog: here don't you think?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Hey, don't knock it till you've
dialog: tried it.
text: His attempt to break the tension goes down in flames. She

scene_heading: 88 INT. HARVEY'S CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY
dialog: Harvey is under pressure from his own advisors (Michael,
text: Dick, Cleve) to vote against Dan's bill.
speaker_heading: DICK PABICH
dialog: Supervisors Silver and Lau are
dialog: asking you to vote to keep this
dialog: Psychiatric Center in Dan's
dialog: district. It'll go down 6 to 5 if
dialog: you vote to get rid of it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL WONG
dialog: It's a Youth Campus, Harvey. These
dialog: are kids that would be displaced
dialog: from their families if it's moved.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: I can't just dump Dan. The guy's
dialog: got nothing going for him. No
dialog: friends...
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: Here we go, Harvey to the rescue.
dialog: Isn't it enough we have to put up
dialog: with Jack?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Lay off. He registered 120 voters
dialog: last week.
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: So do any of your volunteers, but
dialog: you don't make them all first lady.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL WONG
dialog: What does Dan White do for you?
dialog: Really? Politically?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: He intrigues me... I think he may
dialog: be one of us.
text: Everyone groans. Cleve camps it up:
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: Dear God, say it ain't so!
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: It's just a theory...
speaker_heading: DICK PABICH
dialog: You just think he's cute.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: No... I know what it's like to
dialog: live that life. That lie. You can
text: see it in Dan's eyes... The fear,
dialog: the pressure...
text: Anne Kronenberg walks in. She's got that look in her eyes.
dialog: Something's up.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: Good or Bad?
speaker_heading: ANNE KRONENBERG
dialog: Not great. State Senator John
dialog: Briggs is Anita Bryant's go-to guy
dialog: in California for sure. He's filed
dialog: his petition for a statewide
dialog: referendum to fire all gay teachers
dialog: and anyone who supports them.
text: A pall falls over the room. This is worse than expected.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: How many signatures will he need to
dialog: qualify for the ballot?
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: Whatever. He can get them in two
text: Sundays at church in Orange County.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (instead of fear,
dialog: excitement bubbles up)
dialog: This means the fight's coming here,
dialog: where we can do something about it!
dialog: Wichita's one thing, Kansas City.
dialog: But Anita's heading for San
dialog: Francisco! She's not going to know

speaker_heading: TOM AMMIANO
dialog: And how are you going to determine
dialog: who's a homosexual?
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: Sir, my bill outlines procedures
dialog: for identifying homosexuals.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER PROTESTER
dialog: How? Will you be sucking them off?
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: Sir, you can argue with me, but you
dialog: cannot argue with God.
text: It's getting ugly fast. Briggs is whisked away by TWO

scene_heading: 90 INT. DAN WHITE'S HOME - DAY
text: Dan's house is filled with RELATIVES for a birthday

speaker_heading: RICK STOKES
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
text: The Latino, he's locked himself in

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK

speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN

speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: (condescending to Cleve)
dialog: So it's important we not deceive
dialog: people into thinking we can beat
dialog: this, or we'll have riots and only
dialog: increase this backlash.
speaker_heading: HARVEY JONES
dialog: Good point, David. Let's just roll
dialog: right over. Make it easier for

text: Rick and David are horrified. Phil Burton rises above it,
text: passing out copies of his new Anti-Briggs Initiative flier.
speaker_heading: PHIL BURTON
dialog: We're taking this very seriously in
dialog: my office. We want to send one of
dialog: these to every home in California.

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (reading the flier)
dialog: "Proposition Six is an affront to
dialog: Human Rights. An invasion of the

dialog: (points to the pictures)
dialog: Does it even say the word gay on
dialog: this thing? Anywhere?
speaker_heading: DAVID GOODSTEIN
dialog: No Harvey, purposefully not.
speaker_heading: PHIL BURTON
dialog: With the heat bearing down on your
dialog: movement right now, we think it's
dialog: best to dodge the "gay" bullet. Go
dialog: for the human rights angle.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: People need to know who's affected.
dialog: This flier needs at least one old
dialog: queen on it.
dialog: (a dig, to Goodstein)
dialog: Why don't you volunteer for that,

speaker_heading: RICK STOKES

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: I had to listen to your phone calls

dialog: You're asking them to lose their

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: If their families won't love them

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)
dialog: My name is Harvey Milk, and I want
dialog: to recruit you. I want to recruit
dialog: you for the fight to preserve your
dialog: democracy. Brothers and sisters, you
dialog: must come out. Come out to your
dialog: parents. I know that it is hard and
dialog: will hurt them but think about how
dialog: they will hurt you in the voting
dialog: booth! Come out to your friends, if
dialog: they indeed are your friends. Come
dialog: out to your neighbors, to your
dialog: fellow workers. Once and for all,
dialog: break down the myths, destroy the
dialog: lies and distortions. For your sake.
dialog: For their sake. For the sake of the
text: youngsters who are becoming scared
dialog: by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On
dialog: the Statue of Liberty it says "Give
dialog: me your tired, your poor, your
dialog: huddled masses yearning to be free."
dialog: In the Declaration of Independence
dialog: it is written "All men are created
dialog: equal and are endowed with certain
dialog: inalienable rights." For Mr. Briggs
dialog: and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots
dialog: out there, no matter how hard you
dialog: try, you cannot erase those words
dialog: from the Declaration of
dialog: Independence. No matter how hard you
dialog: try, you cannot chip those words
text: from off the base of the Statue of
dialog: Liberty. That is what America is.
dialog: Love it or leave it.
text: Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A
text: bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs him.
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
text: The Mayor says Briggs is on his way

text: It's a showdown... HIGH NOON.
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor.
speaker_heading: MAYOR MOSCONE
dialog: I'm afraid it's not in the interest
dialog: of your safety, or my public's
dialog: safety to let you into that parade
dialog: grounds.
text: Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for
text: the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an
dialog: honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to
dialog: fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: No sir. I would love to have a
dialog: public debate. I'm very interested
dialog: in the details of your argument.
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: You know the details. As do the
dialog: people. Look at the votes across this
dialog: nation. The "public" is with me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Yes sir, today they are. But with my

dialog: He was about accepting people and

speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: Not in my mind they haven't--
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: That's it. In your mind they
dialog: haven't, and I'm wondering why--
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who
dialog: believe in practicing bestiality to
dialog: teach our children, and the reason
dialog: we don't is because it is illegal.
dialog: But it's not illegal to be a
dialog: homosexual in California.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: And your law goes even further. Any
dialog: school employee who even supports a
dialog: gay person will be fired--
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: True. But, gay people don't have
dialog: children of their own. If they
dialog: don't recruit our children, they'd
dialog: all die away. That's why they want
dialog: to be teachers, to encourage our
text: children to join them.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK (ON TV)
dialog: How do you teach homosexuality?
dialog: Like French? I was born of
dialog: heterosexual parents, I was taught
dialog: by heterosexual teachers in a

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: We were really genuinely frightened

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: We're still losing, 60 to 30. We

text: Harvey lifts a Briggs flier.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: If in your statements here you say
dialog: that child molestation is not an
dialog: issue, why do you put out literature
dialog: that hammers it home, why do you play
dialog: on that myth and fear?
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: Same thing with VD Harvey, we put
dialog: out publications about VD so you
dialog: can avoid it.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (with a grin)

text: Boos from the conservative audience.
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS
dialog: We are not talking about homos...
dialog: child molestation, the fact is, at

dialog: out, you know what--
scene_heading: JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK
dialog: --we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--

speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: That's what you just said.
speaker_heading: JOHN BRIGGS

speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES
dialog: Milk, you're a decent politician, a

dialog: (Harvey knows what he's
dialog: getting at)
dialog: Take some time off. Fifty's right
text: around the corner.
dialog: (a devilish grin)
dialog: Nobody will want you after that...
dialog: I can handle D.C.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (smiles, incredulous)
dialog: The people voted for us, Cleve Jones.
speaker_heading: CLEVE JONES

scene_heading: 135 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - DAY
text: Harvey walks down the hallway to his office, a spring in his

text: He comes face to face with Dan White.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Morning, Dan.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE
dialog: I just resigned. Congratulations.
dialog: I'm sure you're pleased.

speaker_heading: DAN WHITE (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll be the next President of the
dialog: Board.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK

speaker_heading: OFFICER

speaker_heading: OFFICER

text: Something bittersweet lingers. He walks in.
text: HARVEY'S POV: On City Hall's lawn, Dan is with the press. He

text: They make eye contact. It bears all the awkwardness of a
dialog: relationship lost.
scene_heading: 139 EXT. CITY HALL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Something's snapped. With adolescent frustration in evidence,
text: Dan is with his wife, the press and a few supporters.
speaker_heading: DAN WHITE

scene_heading: 140 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Harvey is firm, his hands planted on the Mayor's desk.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
text: He gets dragged into a closed door
dialog: meeting with the Police Officers

dialog: demanding his job back? What do you
dialog: think they promised him? Or worse,
dialog: how did they threaten him?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: MAYOR MOSCONE
dialog: A man has the right to change his
dialog: mind. Give me some peace.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: How many of our propositions has
dialog: Dan shut down? We could finally
dialog: settle this police desegregation
dialog: nonsense. Cement rent control. It's
dialog: his vote on this Board that stands
dialog: in our way.
speaker_heading: MAYOR MOSCONE
dialog: I get it, Harvey. I've been lobbied
dialog: all week. Enough.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Let me just remind you that you're
dialog: up for re-election. If you re-
dialog: appoint Dan, you lose the gay vote.
dialog: They listen to me. You won't get
text: elected dog catcher.
speaker_heading: MAYOR MOSCONE
dialog: (stern, silent, a beat, then:)
dialog: I'll make my decision on Monday.
text: (as Harvey's on his way out,
dialog: with a wry grin)
dialog: You know what you sounded like just
dialog: now? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: (returns the smile)
dialog: A "homosexual" with a bit of
dialog: power... rather scary isn't it, Mr.
dialog: Mayor?
dialog: OFF Harvey. He's come a long way.

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Bidu Sayao herself. She was in the

dialog: went wild. It was like I was young

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: If you go to the opera again, you
dialog: should call me.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Really?

speaker_heading: SCOTT SMITH
dialog: Yes. I'd go with you.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK

scene_heading: 147 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER
text: With Dianne, Harvey is thrilled, rubbing it in.
speaker_heading: HARVEY MILK
dialog: Who's it gonna be? Is he replacing

speaker_heading: DIANNE FEINSTEIN
dialog: All I know is that we're getting a

speaker_heading: MAYOR MOSCONE
