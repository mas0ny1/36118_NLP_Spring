dialog: ‘Dear little swallow’ said the

scene_heading: EXT. PARIS 1900. NIGHT. 2
text: Heavy rain. Blurred dreamlike images appear through it. A
text: group laughing round a table. Feet dashing across wet
text: cobbles. A drenched Child begging by a Morris Column. The
text: black silhouette of a carriage and horses splashing past him.
text: A street materialises - seen through a sheet of rain pouring
text: down the awning of a cafe. People are huddled comfortably
text: inside watching the down pour.
speaker_heading: MAN V.O.
dialog: So the swallow flew over the great
dialog: city, and saw the rich making merry
text: in their beautiful houses, while in
text: the dark lanes, the white faces of
dialog: starving children looked out
text: listlessly at the black streets.
text: At a table sat a broken man, an
text: empty tumbler by his side with a
dialog: bunch of withered violets. He was a

text: A blotchy elephantine vagrant sits alone in a ring of empty

text: Dead watery eyes. It is OSCAR WILDE
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: It’s a dream!
text: He drains the glass, rummages for money, rises with

scene_heading: EXT. BOULEVARD ST GERMAIN. PARIS. NIGHT. 4

text: The rain stops. OSCAR weaves through the crowds with his

text: A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN flanked by TWO MEN in SHINY TOP HATS
text: comes onto the street from a restaurant. They are talking
text: loudly in English.
text: Collision. The WOMAN and OSCAR briefly lock eyes, but he
text: moves quickly on.
text: The TRIO continue, arm in arm. The two MEN chat amiably as

speaker_heading: TOP HAT ONE

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I think I left my fan.

speaker_heading: OSCAR

text: Sounds of a squabble as a door opens and shuts.
text: He drags himself up by the banister. He stops to catch his

text: M. DUPOIRIER, the HOTEL manager is coming down the stairs
text: with a TRAY.

speaker_heading: OSCAR

speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: (bursting into fresh

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: All I’m saying is it could be
dialog: better for everyone. You'll be
dialog: safe and I wont always be

speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: But we’re brothers. We should be
dialog: together.
text: LEON puts his head in his hands and cries. JEAN sighs and
text: looks at OSCAR for help.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Well, this is too frightful! But
dialog: I too have news. A sudden
dialog: windfall enables me to offer you
dialog: both at least absinthe and

scene_heading: INT. SQUALID HOTEL BEDROOM. NIGHT. 13
text: OSCAR lies on a filthy bed in a squalid room. Noises of

text: panther with his trousers down, sprinkles powder into
text: cotton wool balls, puts one in the side of his mouth and
text: gives another to OSCAR.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: You know I don’t think I’ve ever

text: from the street.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What light?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: It carves you in marble, dear
dialog: boy! We are lost in our own
text: world. Shrouded in a symphony of
dialog: adjacent copulation. It’s really
dialog: quite good!
text: He counts out notes on the bed. JEAN looks at him with
text: obvious affection.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you love me, Johnny, even
dialog: though our purple hours are

dialog: can one do?

speaker_heading: OSCAR V.O.
dialog: The swallow flew back and told

text: Chaos. MEN in TALL HATS, TARTS and PIMPS. Banquettes

text: A stringy WOMAN sings on a stage at one end of the hall.
text: She is dressed for a beggars ball and harshly lit by

text: A MAN with a TART watches them in disgust.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Revolting pig! Returning to your

speaker_heading: MAURICE

speaker_heading: MAN

speaker_heading: OSCAR

text: Tremendous applause as the song ends.
text: OSCAR is bleeding from the ear. His eyes bulge and he is

speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I congratulate you on the success

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Robbie! I met Christ in prison.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What was she in for?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Don’t joke Reggie. In the cell
dialog: there is only God and Man. After
dialog: three days in hell Jesus rose
text: from the dead. Discarded his
dialog: cerements, broke open the tomb
dialog: and took his place forever in the
dialog: heart of man. After seven hundred
dialog: days of hard labour my tomb has
dialog: opened, I have tiptoed to the
dialog: boat train and I am born again.
text: Through him with him and in
dialog: France.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Very good Oscar. We’ll make a

speaker_heading: REGGIE

dialog: Oh Good. All I am saying, dear
dialog: Reggie, is that I lived in the

dialog: it is not. We shall see. At any

text: Alone, OSCAR unpacks. Framed pictures of CONSTANCE and HIS

speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: I hear from your so called
dialog: friends that you no longer wish
dialog: to see me! Can it be that you
dialog: have forgotten all you said
dialog: before you went to prison?
dialog: Nothing but my love sustained you
dialog: then, your soul clung to my soul.
dialog: Now you no longer wish to know
dialog: me. God knows I have suffered too
dialog: during these two years. There is
dialog: prison without prison, but I will
dialog: tell you this. Never, for one
dialog: moment has the intensity of my
dialog: love for you faltered. I feel as
dialog: I felt the day I met you. I have
dialog: waited for this day for two
dialog: years. I am now half crazed with
dialog: grief. When this letter reaches
dialog: you I might be dead!
text: OSCAR laughs bitterly and sweeps the torn pages off the

text: Seagulls fade into the noise of children playing.

speaker_heading: OSCAR V.O.
dialog: My desire to live, dearest

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SANDWICH DINING ROOM. NIGHT. 33

text: YOUNG POETS and STUDENTS who have come from Paris to
text: welcome OSCAR into exile. They are eccentrically dressed
text: and extremely rowdy.
text: OSCAR captivates the table with tales of prison. Other

text: OSCAR, banging the table.
speaker_heading: OSCAR V.O.

scene_heading: EXT HOTEL SANDWICH BEACH. DAY. 34

speaker_heading: REGGIE

text: OSCAR, REGGIE and ROBBIE quicken their pace. The chase is
dialog: on.
text: They duck down an alleyway.
text: THE UNDERGRADUATES stampede round the corner, baying and
text: yelping like hounds. They are intensely amused. One has
text: picked up a branch and is banging it against dust bins and
text: doorways.
text: OSCAR ROBBIE and REGGIE are running now. Across a

text: THE UNDERGRADUATES are getting closer. Jumping over the

speaker_heading: OSCAR

dialog: With no warning, I was transferred

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: You wrote harsh letters to us
dialog: all. We were trying our best.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I know. Its hard to describe the

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Then you will never see Constance
dialog: again. You seem to forget that
dialog: despite everything you have put
dialog: her through she still allows you
dialog: four pounds a week. That four

speaker_heading: OSCAR V.O.
dialog: It takes all of three minutes to

text: AN OLD BENT PRIEST comes in and shuffles towards the alter,

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Or Mr Wilde from the influence of

scene_heading: LADY QUEENSBURY
dialog: Indeed? Hardly. I was revolted by
text: him on sight. An oily indolent

dialog: help him. Oscar did. A Lawyer was
dialog: found. Money was paid - by Wilde -
dialog: never repaid. The problem was
text: resolved and put on a ship bound
dialog: for Australia. Later on, it was
dialog: your son who introduced Oscar to
text: the alleys and lanes of
dialog: Whitechapel, and the nighttime
dialog: markets of living flesh. Just as it

scene_heading: INT. VILLA GUIDICE. NIGHT. 96

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Where is my son?
speaker_heading: FELICE
dialog: What are you doing here?

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Shame on you. Look at her! Your

dialog: here.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: And what might that be, Madam?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Where are the harlots, the loose

dialog: hell? Show them to me. I will
text: drag them onto the street by the

speaker_heading: WOMAN (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: What on earth is going on?
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: One can run up a bill for
dialog: everything in this swamp except

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: There is never credit where love
dialog: is concerned, Bosie. You should
dialog: know that. Felice, Caro, believe

dialog: take that?
text: OSCAR takes the bottle from FELICE’S hand,

text: OSCAR gives FELICE a silver framed photograph of CONSTANCE
speaker_heading: and the TWO BOYS
speaker_heading: FELICE
dialog: Thank you, Signor Melmoth. You

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Well spotted. So clever of you to
dialog: notice!
speaker_heading: FELICE
dialog: He does not know the value of
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Nor the price, unfortunately. Now
dialog: lets find your coat. Your wife
dialog: will be getting worried.
text: OSCAR ushers him out of the room. BOSIE, pulling up his
text: trousers, loses his balance and crashes to the floor.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: What the hell did you give him
dialog: that for?
text: OSCAR comes back into the room.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: A foolish question, I know, but
dialog: why didn’t you just pay him?
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: With what?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: With money.

speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: My mother has stopped my

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: What? When did this happen? Oh
dialog: Christ!
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: I was waiting for the right
dialog: moment to tell you.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: But in the mean time you imagined
dialog: that wretched boy would fuck you
dialog: for fun.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: And why not?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Your vanity is extraordinary. The
dialog: only person who ever fucked you
dialog: for fun was me! And look where it
dialog: got me. The dock! So that’s it
dialog: then. We appear to have come to
dialog: the end of the road. We’re
text: penniless.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Well, not exactly.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: You could have two hundred pounds
dialog: and I could keep my allowance.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: If?
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Well, what Mama and the family
dialog: really can’t stomach is the fact
dialog: that we live together. She says
dialog: that if we agree to separate she
dialog: will reinstate my allowance and,
dialog: very generously, I think, give
dialog: you this substantial....
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Tip! For services rendered. To
dialog: the Family. Would I get a good
dialog: reference? Can I keep my cottage?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 3/11/16
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: God, you all make me sick. Your
dialog: sanctimonious mother thinks that
dialog: I can be brought off for two
dialog: hundred pounds. Your family has
dialog: destroyed me, stripped me of
dialog: everything, not least my genius.
dialog: And all for two hundred pounds!
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Genius! You destroyed yourself,
dialog: Oscar, because underneath the
dialog: pose there was NO SUBSTANCE. One
dialog: good comedy, three pot boiling
dialog: melodramas and those ridiculous
dialog: fairy stories. That’s all you
dialog: find if you scrape away the
dialog: powder and the pancake. Your
dialog: success was interesting. Your
dialog: hunger for it perversely
dialog: fascinating. But you, my dear,
dialog: never were!
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: You found me interesting enough
dialog: when you were faced with
dialog: blackmail.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: You were in your element. You saw
text: the green baize door swing open
dialog: and you scuttled through it.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: You are talking drivel. My
dialog: father...
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Was a drunken groper with dirty
dialog: fingernails just like his son.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Whereas YOUR father is an
dialog: assassin at large!
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Oh, come on, Oscar, you’re still
dialog: alive.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Barely.
text: OSCAR collapses to a chair gasping for breath and clutching

scene_heading: INT. STATION NAPLES. NIGHT. 103
text: A PORTER loads BOSIE’S luggage on to the train. BOSIE leans

speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: I'll write to you when I get to
dialog: Rome. Where will you be?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I've really no idea. I suppose I
dialog: may as well stay here until the
dialog: lease runs out. Then I shall
dialog: probably go to Paris. Who knows?
dialog: At any rate we’ll be in touch.
dialog: Dear boy, do you mind awfully if
dialog: I don’t wait? I’m not really made
dialog: for waving pocket handkerchiefs
text: at parting trains.
text: He turns and lumbers away down the platform waving as he
dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm too big!
text: BOSIE watches OSCAR disappear into the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. VILLA GUIDICE. NIGHT. 104

text: The door opens and CONSTANCE appears.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Hello Oscar.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Constance? Is it...
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Constance, we never meant to ...
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I loved you so much. Always. Odd,

speaker_heading: BOSIE

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Thank you, Bosie. Quite well.
dialog: Oscar, We shall be at home this

speaker_heading: BOSIE

dialog: thought.
text: A YOUNG MAN, (JEAN) comes into the bar with a wicker basket
text: half full of bunches of snowdrops. He is ragged and frozen.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: A bunch of flowers sir. Two for a
dialog: centime.
text: OSCAR wakes from his reverie and gazes at the YOUNG MAN.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
text: Ah! Snowdrops. The frozen tears
dialog: of God. I’1l have them all. What
dialog: is your name, dear boy?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Jean, sir
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Jean, sit with me. Have a drink
dialog: to warm you up.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Not here, Sir. But you can buy me

dialog: Oh, yes! When was that?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: You don’t believe me but it’s

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What for?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: The dear miners had invited me to
dialog: dinner.
text: JEAN is uneasy. OSCAR laughs. Two more glasses arrive on
text: the table. OSCAR puts one arm around JEAN. With the other
text: he pours water onto sugar cubes in the two glasses of
text: Absinthe. He is a deft seducer.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, indeed. I traveled the
dialog: length and breadth of the
dialog: Americas. My own train. The
text: interior, upholstered in green
dialog: morocco. Your very good health!
text: They clink glasses and drink. OSCAR’S fleshy bejeweled hand
text: begins to crawl along JEAN’S leg. His face moves in close,
text: his voice is melodious and intimate. JEAN is mesmerized.
speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I civilised America. It took
dialog: quite a long time, but I think it
dialog: was worth it. In the rocky
dialog: mountains is a town called
dialog: Leadville. I spoke to the young
dialog: miners of Leadville on the need
dialog: for beauty.
text: OSCAR'S hand has arrived at JEAN’S crotch and squeezes. His
text: eyes widen.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You're mad!
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Yes, I am. Quite mad. Now, ona

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Extremely glad to know you,

speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Give me some money.
text: JEAN slaps LEON over the head.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oi! Behave.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: And I‘'1l cook him an egg!
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: How kind. Now where is my pocket

speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm afraid last night is rather a

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Was.

speaker_heading: OSCAR

text: at a table and nurses the remains of a drink.
text: Later, he is talking to an ENGLISH VICAR and HIS FRIEND,
text: holding forth, as the bill arrives. OSCAR beams as they pay

dialog: 3/11/16
dialog: 63
text: Suddenly the awning in front of the bar is cranked back, A
text: huge deluge of water falls on OSCAR. The WAITERS laugh.
text: A very drunk OSCAR sits in the pouring rain. His hat is

text: ROBBIE ROSS walks by. OSCAR sees him
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Robbie! Stop a moment. Please!

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: OSCAR

dialog: How long have you been here?
dialog: (to waiter)
dialog: How much do we owe you?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Twelve francs.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: It seems as though I am always
dialog: asking for it, but do I have your
dialog: forgiveness?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Forgiveness is for amateurs, and
dialog: you, dear Oscar, are a
dialog: professional masochist. Come on,
dialog: I’1l take you home
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Oh, dear boy so cruel!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Anyway, to be pardoned would mean
dialog: nothing to you. You always want
dialog: to serve the full sentence. Can
dialog: you forgive yourself?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Oh, Robbie, what an
text: uncompromising curtain raiser.
dialog: The ruined woman hardly knows how
dialog: to react. Should I leave the

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Lost in the mist, dear boy.
dialog: I am a vampire. I lurk in the

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Most successful. Most brilliant.
dialog: Most promising. Most ambitious.
dialog: Most cruel. Most sorrowful. Most

dialog: Words! Words! Words are
dialog: irrelevant. Do you think I’m
dialog: going mad?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No, Oscar, but I don’t believe a
dialog: ‘word’ you say.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: No. I am going mad. I shall never
dialog: write again, Bobbie. I don’t need
dialog: to. A life of squalor has been
dialog: revealed to me. I embrace it.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Oscar. You do not live in
text: squalor. There is light and
dialog: water...
dialog: 3/11/16
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: And linoleum and indescribable
dialog: wallpaper. But let us not
text: squabble like two disgruntled
dialog: housemaids. Let us rather black
text: our grates with a light heart and
dialog: chatter about our betters. Bosie,
dialog: we hear, has come into twenty
text: thousand pounds. He arrives next
dialog: week. I thought I might touch him
dialog: for a tiny pour boire when I dine
dialog: with him. What do you say?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Well, he has brought a stud
dialog: outside Paris.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Typical. He knows absolutely
dialog: nothing about horses and yet he
dialog: always manages to back the loser.
dialog: (suddenly coy)
dialog: Will you come up, Robbie?
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: No, Oscar. Lets forget all that.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Did I hurt you terribly?
text: THE TWO MEN look at each other. Finally.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE

dialog: Good night, Oscar.

speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: I am joining my mother in Menton on

dialog: 3/11/16

speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: More paraffin injections? How
dialog: lovely. You should take Oscar. He
text: looks like a rotten egg in aspic.
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I was poisoned by a moule last

dialog: had mysterious skin ever since.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Oh, leprosy I expect.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Thank you, my dear. But let us

dialog: Your fathers death, for example.
dialog: How did it go?
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Without a hitch for the most
dialog: part. In and out of
dialog: consciousness.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: As in life!
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: My brother Percy went to see him

text: opened his eyes and spat at him.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Queensbury rules until the end!
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Well I, at least, have outlived
dialog: my nemesis, although I am more or
text: less starving at the moment.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
text: Shovelling down Lobster Newberg!
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: A magnificent treat. And at the
dialog: moment, sadly all too rare. Bosie
dialog: dear, this brings me rather
dialog: neatly to an awkward point...
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Oscar! Do not ask me for money! I
dialog: have absolutely none to spare.
dialog: 3/11/16
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: But dear boy, you have just
dialog: inherited twenty thousand pounds,
dialog: have you not? Surely you do not
dialog: wish to see me on the street?
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: As you are behaving like an old

text: OSCAR shrugs his shoulders and keeps eating.
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: For Gods sake, Bosie...
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: This has nothing to do with you,
dialog: Robbie. Keep out of it! Garcon!
speaker_heading: ROBBIE
dialog: Unfortunately it has. Since Oscar
dialog: threw in his lot with you at
text: Naples, he been cut adrift by
text: everyone. Constance has died. His
dialog: sons have been taken away from
dialog: him. His so called friends have
dialog: deserted him. And now you, who
dialog: owe him everything, turn your
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: I am sick and tired of being
dialog: blamed for the self inflicted
dialog: wounds of a gluttonous snob. I am

text: A WAITER wheels a trolley towards the table.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Ah. The Pudding trolley.
dialog: (to the YOUNG MAN)
dialog: I see your little eyes light up.
dialog: What shall we have? Robbie, dear,

speaker_heading: BOSIE
dialog: Do you suppose I care. I asked

dialog: does it. So I am supposed to keep
dialog: you in luxury while you stumble
text: about the boulevard begging for

speaker_heading: ROBBIE

speaker_heading: DR. TUCKER

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I shall never see you again. I know

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Oscar, you old fraud. You look
dialog: perfectly well.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I know. Can you believe it? One
dialog: poisonous moule four months ago and
dialog: I’ve been in and out of bed ever
dialog: since. Dear boy, behind the commode
dialog: you will find a bottle of
text: champagne. Open it, and lets drink
dialog: to your arrival.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: We shouldn’t really.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Of course we shouldn’t. You have
dialog: crossed the water for a treasured

dialog: bed.
text: REGGIE opens the champagne. OSCAR clutches at his stomach and
text: groans as he tries to sit up.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: Poor darling! But I hear you are
text: doing a new play.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: (uneasy)

speaker_heading: OSCAR (CONT'D)
dialog: I have sold the play to three

dialog: haven't written a single word.
dialog: Rather clever, don’t you think?
dialog: There is nothing like an Irish

dialog: stride.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: But what will you do when the time
dialog: comes to deliver it?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Die! I am paralysed by dark
dialog: thoughts. Sometimes I wonder. Is it
dialog: a moule? It could be something
dialog: else. Oh God!
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What?
text: OSCAR is overwhelmed, and puts his hand on his ear.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Why did Constance die? Why have I
dialog: become so mad? Reggie, my brain has
dialog: crashed and shattered. Is this...
text: OSCAR is trembling. REGGIE takes his hand.
speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What, Oscar?
text: From OSCAR'S point of view the room is suddenly enormous.
text: CONSTANCE appears in the distance. She walks towards the bed
text: singing. She is young and beautiful and regards OSCAR
text: lovingly.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Syphilis.
text: She disappears and the room contracts. OSCAR is rigid with
text: fear. REGGIE watches, concerned.
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Do you see the hell in which I

speaker_heading: REGGIE

speaker_heading: REGGIE
dialog: What? Why do you ask?
speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: I was driving through the park, one
dialog: Sunday, years ago, and close by
dialog: Marble Arch there stood a little
text: crowd of shabby looking people
text: listening to some vulgar street
dialog: preacher. As I passed by, I heard
dialog: the man yelling out that question
dialog: to his audience. It struck me as

text: Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a

text: faces under a broken roof of
dialog: dripping umbrellas, anda
text: wonderful phrase flung into the air

speaker_heading: OSCAR
dialog: Isn't it extraordinary. I can’t
