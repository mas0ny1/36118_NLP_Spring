dialog: Duncan, are you asleep?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON - DAY 1
text: CLOSE ON DUNCAN, staring off, lost in thought. Some
text: SUITCASES and COOLERS flank him. It’s a little cramped.
text: PULL BACK to reveal he’s sitting in that ill-conceived back
text: bench seat that faces out the rear of a vintage 1971 Buick
dialog: Estate station wagon.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: «+. Duncan?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON REARVIEW MIRROR. TRENT RAMSEY (MAN’S VOICE) glances
dialog: back at Duncan.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Duncan, are you sleeping?
dialog: Clearly, Duncan wishes he was.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No.
text: DUNCAN'S POV of a SUV of TEENAGERS passing by. They gawk,
dialog: flip him off.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Let me ask you something. Ona
dialog: scale from one to ten, what do you
dialog: think you are?
dialog: Beat. No response.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Duncan? I’m asking you how you see
dialog: yourself. On a scale from one to
dialog: ten.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What? You need to speak up, buddy.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (louder)
dialog: I don’t know.
text: DUNCAN'S POV of a BILLBOARD on the opposite side of the
dialog: highway. It reads, “Turn around! You missed it! Water Wizz
dialog: Waterpark! Two miles back!”
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What don’t you know? How you see
dialog: yourself? You don’t have an
dialog: opinion?
text: Duncan doesn’t respond.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just curious. Pick any number
dialog: on a scale...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: A six.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: A six!
dialog: Trent takes this in.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I think you’re a three.
dialog: Damn. Duncan definitely doesn’t know how to respond.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know why I think you’re a
dialog: three? Do you know what would make
dialog: me say that?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Duncan...?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You don’t know why? You have no
dialog: idea?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You’ve got to speak up.
text: Duncan turns all the way around, making eye contact with
text: Trent in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (louder)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Well, from what I’ve observed, I
dialog: can’t say I see you putting
dialog: yourself out there, buddy.
text: From this vantage point, Duncan surveys the landscape. In
text: the back seat, comfortably stretched out, asleep, and
text: listening to her iPod, is STEPH...
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Meeting kids your own age. And,
dialog: from what your mom tells me, you
dialog: seem content just to hang around
dialog: her apartment.
text: .-. And, riding shotgun, his mom, PAM. She’s asleep as well.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that a fair assessment? That
dialog: you're happy to just... Not do
dialog: anything? Because, see, that’s a
dialog: “three” to me.
text: Duncan glances back at Trent in the mirror.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: But, the good news is I can tell
dialog: you that there’s going to be plenty
dialog: of kids, and plenty of
dialog: opportunities at the beach for you
dialog: to take advantage of this summer.
dialog: And, it’s a big summer for all of
dialog: us, really. See if we can make
dialog: this work... You and your Mom, me
dialog: and Steph... All making it work
dialog: together. As a family.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, what do you say? Let’s try to
dialog: improve that score. Aim higher
dialog: than a three?
text: Duncan sits back down, facing out the back. Grabs his iPod.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: That sound good?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You up for that, buddy?
text: He puts his earphones in, as we... BEGIN MAIN TITLES
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 2
text: The station wagon, in all its glory. Mint condition.
text: Strapped to the top, more BAGS. As for the rest of the cars
text: on the highway, very much 2012. The station wagon pulls off
text: the EXIT RAMP. Another BILLBOARD reads, “This is it! This is
dialog: the exit! Water Wizz Waterpark!”
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY 3
text: The station wagon drives along the main street. A quaint
text: beach town. Dated. TOURISTS/LOCALS, flood the sidewalks.
text: The station wagon arrives at a...
text: STOP SIGN. A CONVERTIBLE pulls up behind. The DRIVER is
text: wearing classic Vaurnet sunglasses. Although retro, they
text: work for him. The Driver looks right at Duncan, enjoying the
text: awkwardness. Duncan doesn’t know where else to look. The
text: Driver nods, smiles. The station wagon continues straight,
text: as the convertible turns off to the left, screeching away.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY 4
text: The station wagon pulls into the DRIVEWAY. Beach front.
text: Prime real estate. The house, a very masculine vibe.
speaker_heading: END MAIN TITLES
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 5
text: Trent unpacks. Duncan takes in his “home” for the summer.
text: Pam steps up behind him, puts her hand on his shoulder. This
text: is our first good view of Pam, wearing a stylish HEAD SCARF.
dialog: In fact, her whole look is unique. Her own. Duncan and Pam
text: notice the “name” of the house over the DOORWAY. “Riptide.”
text: Suddenly, BETTY, pops out, a Greyhound cocktail in hand. Her
dialog: house’s name: “Booze Cruizin’.”
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Yoohoo!
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Are you kidding? We just got here.
text: Betty descends the stairs.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Thank God! One more night of
dialog: drinking alone and I was going to
dialog: kill myself!
dialog: (then, re: cocktail)
dialog: Yes, I’m off the wagon again.
dialog: Accept it and move on.
dialog: (then, re: station wagon)
dialog: Nice ride, Trent. Does the eight
dialog: track still work?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: What? This is exactly the car my
dialog: dad used to drive us in.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Huh. Old and shitty.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You know how much I paid for this?
text: It’s in cherry condition.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: A car salesman with bad taste.
dialog: Shocker.
text: Betty turns to Pam, invading her space.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D) PAM
dialog: Hi. I’m Betty. Hi,... Pam...
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D) PAM
dialog: Trent’s probably already No, um... We were just...
dialog: talked shit about me. It’s
dialog: okay if he has. Has he?
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: BETTY PAM
dialog: (off scarf) Oh, thank you...
dialog: I’m loving this. I couldn't
dialog: pull it off. My hair seems
dialog: to hate me.
speaker_heading: BETTY PAM
dialog: (to Trent) (giving up)
dialog: I like her. ..+. Okay.
text: Pam goes to pull a suitcase out of the car.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What’s not to like?
text: Pam catches Trent, ogling. Embarrassed, she looks at Betty.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, honey. Get it where you can.
dialog: I'd be on my back after a line like
dialog: that.
text: Just then, we hear a SCREEN DOOR CLOSE. Betty looks up to
text: find SUSANNA THOMPSON, her daughter, standing on their deck.
text: She's quite cute. A very “mature beyond her years” look.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Susanna, Trent’s here. And this is
dialog: his girlfriend, Pam. Say, “Hi.”
text: Duncan, curious, peeks over the top of the car.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Hi.
text: Beat. Susanna stays put. Betty waits for more.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Yeah, but don’t come down.
dialog: (to Pam/Trent, sotto)
text: Just stand there, brooding.
dialog: (then, noticing Duncan)
dialog: Oh. You’ve brought me a man. How
dialog: thoughtful. Who is this in all his
dialog: “awkward stage” glory?
text: Duncan embarrassed, peers over the top of the station wagon,
dialog: seeing if Susanna heard that.
text: DUNCAN'S POV of Susanna going back inside.
text: Pam puts her arm around Duncan, pulls him in.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: This is my son, Duncan.
text: She brushes the hair out of his eyes.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh my God. I was going to name my
dialog: youngest “Duncan,” but my ex-
dialog: husband thought it was nerdy. So,
dialog: we went with “Peter.” Which,
dialog: personally, I think is worse. But,
dialog: it fits my son, so...
dialog: (then, to Duncan)
dialog: Don’t worry, you wear the name
dialog: well. Trent, where’s Steph?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Well, we’ve been here all of two
dialog: minutes, so probably changing for
dialog: the beach.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (to Pam)
dialog: She's just like me. Screw cancer.
dialog: I want to be an even golden brown.
dialog: Everywhere.
text: Trent, Pam, and Duncan start lugging stuff inside. There’s
text: plenty to grab, but Betty doesn’t notice.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, everybody's back this year.
dialog: The Gales. The Hutchisons. The
dialog: Campbells, sans Ben because of the
dialog: trial.
dialog: (then, to Pam)
dialog: Insider trading.
dialog: (then)
dialog: The Smythes. Oh, and the Keegans,
dialog: who I’m not talking to, but you can
dialog: if you want, but just know that
dialog: most of us aren’t.
text: Pam passes the mailbox, glances at it.
text: CLOSE ON mailbox. The side reads, “The Ramseys.”
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: So, do you think you will? Pam?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Do I think I will, what?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Talk to the Keegans.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. I don’t even
dialog: know them.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, do if you want to, but know
dialog: that I’m mad at them. I don’t even
dialog: want to get into why. They called
dialog: me a C-U-N-T.
dialog: (then, excited)
dialog: You're going to love it here!
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 6
text: Duncan sits on a bench. Betty plants herself on a stool and
text: helps herself to a bag of POTATO CHIPS. Trent makes a Mount
text: Gay and tonic. Pam, unfamiliar with the kitchen, attempts to
dialog: put away groceries. It’s a “trial by fire” project.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: So, how was your winter?
text: Pam starts to respond, but...
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Because our year was a challenge.
dialog: My niece was raped in October...
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh my goodness...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I know. Not even food courts are
dialog: safe. Oh, and well, Bob, that’s my
dialog: ex-husband, finally came out of the
dialog: closet. Not a shock. Let’s just
dialog: say that, in bed, his favorite view
dialog: was the back of my head. Now, my
dialog: oldest, Charlie, is still into the
dialog: drugs and psychedelic music. The
dialog: drugs I get. But, come on, Gary
dialog: Garcia’s dead! Let it go, already!
text: Betty laughs. Pam glances at Trent, mouthing the word
dialog: “Gary?” Trent waves it off.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: Don’t do drugs, Declan...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: ++. Duncan...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (not hearing)
dialog: «+. They’re just terrible. Oh, and
dialog: Susanna. Well, you saw. She’s a
dialog: walking mood. Going through an “I
dialog: hate my mother phase.” Taking her
dialog: father’s side, as usual.
text: Steph enters, wearing the tiniest of tiny bikinis.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Steph, sweetie, don’t you look
dialog: great.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: That's exactly the kind of suit
dialog: that got me pregnant the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: That’s what I’m hoping for.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey,...
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: (rolling her eyes)
dialog: I'm kidding!
text: Steph grabs a beer from the six-pack on the counter. Thrown,
text: Pam glances at Trent, who seems oblivious. Pam takes her
text: look to Betty, who commiserates.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I know. I can’t drink beer
dialog: anymore, either.
dialog: (then, grabbing her sides)
dialog: Look at these muffin tops. Oh, and
dialog: my youngest, Peter... He had
dialog: surgery to fix his lazy eye. Now,
dialog: it’s even worse. I try to get him
dialog: to wear the eye patch, so people
dialog: don’t feel uncomfortable. But, what
dialog: are you going to do?
text: Steph shoves a couple more beers into her beach bag.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I’m outta here.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Oh, hey, take Duncan with you.
text: Trent makes a point to look at Duncan, encouraging.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Fuck that noise. I told you I’m
dialog: not baby-sitting him all summer.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You're taking Duncan with you,
dialog: young lady.
dialog: Duncan looks at his Mom. “Do I not get a say?”
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (off Duncan)
dialog: Go to the beach, sweetie.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll have fun. We’re just going
text: to be unpacking here.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (suggestive, playful)
dialog: Well,...
text: Trent caresses Pam’s ass, pulls her in and kisses her. She
text: placates, but is definitely blushing.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: That’s our cue, kids.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oh. Now, I am still having our
dialog: annual Fourth of July Clambake even
dialog: though Bob’s not here this year.
dialog: He’s probably sucking off our
dialog: gardener right now. Okay well,
dialog: let's have a fun summer!
text: Betty exits, taking the potato chips with her. Duncan
text: glances at his mom, hoping to be saved. But, she’s lost in
dialog: Trent.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: «+. You coming or what?
text: Steph leaves. Duncan shuffles out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - WOODEN PATH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 7
text: Steph strides along. Duncan, still in jeans and a T-shirt,
text: lags behind.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Keep your distance. And, just
dialog: don’t die. I don’t need that shit
dialog: over my head.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 8
text: Steph sits in the sand with her friends, KATY and LAURA.
text: Susanna is there as well, reading. Although the same age as
dialog: Steph, Susanna has a maturity level that is leaps and bounds
text: beyond the rest of the girls. Steph’s boyfriend (or “summer
text: friend”), CHAD, is playing football with some GUYS nearby.
text: Seated off to the side, Duncan.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh hey, just so you guys know, my
dialog: house is out this year for
dialog: partying.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: STEPH/KATY
dialog: What?! Are you kidding?/I’m hating
dialog: you right now! I’m serious.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: My grandmother came up with us.
dialog: So, my mom’s like, “This could be
dialog: her last summer alive.” And I’m,
dialog: like, “Yeah, well, I’m currently
dialog: living, so...”
speaker_heading: KATY
dialog: What a selfish bitch.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I know. This is, like, my summer.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Well, we can absolutely party at my
dialog: place. My dad only gets to see me,
dialog: twice a year, so he totally just
dialog: wants me to be happy.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That’s exactly the type of parent
dialog: I’m going to be.
speaker_heading: STEPH/KATY
dialog: It just makes sense./I’m gonna do
dialog: drugs with my kids.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Oh my God. I forgot. Willem broke
dialog: up with Jessica.
speaker_heading: STEPH/KATY
dialog: Are you serious?/Good. I don’t get
dialog: her face.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Susanna, you have to get on that
dialog: this summer.
text: Steph hops up.
speaker_heading: STEPH (CONT'D)
dialog: (calling off)
dialog: Chad!
text: ANGLE ON Chad, preoccupied with his friends.
speaker_heading: STEPH (CONT'D)
dialog: Chad!
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I want to go in the water!
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Then, go!
text: Steph just takes the moment in stride, brushes off. She
text: notices Duncan staring at them.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: What are you staring at, perv?
text: Steph walks off with Katy and Laura...
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Where is that kid from, anyway?
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Albany. He and his mom. They live
dialog: in, like, a one bedroom apartment.
speaker_heading: LAURA/KATY
dialog: Eww! /Tragic.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Uh, Susanna. We’re all swimming!
text: Duncan watches Susanna reluctantly jump up, join them.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - WOODEN PATH - DAY - A LITTLE LATER
text: Duncan heads back toward the houses. From the opposite
text: direction, Betty and her son, PETER. Clearly, Betty has
text: transferred her cocktail to a Solo cup.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Duncan, we were just coming to find
dialog: you. This is Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, Duncan.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Hey.
text: Betty wasn’t kidding. Peter’s eye goes in every direction.
dialog: Duncan doesn’t know where to look.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Oh, just stare at the bridge of his
dialog: nose. That’s what I do.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Mom. Are you shitting me?
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, if you wore the patch, I
dialog: wouldn't have to keep telling
dialog: people that, would I?! Duncan, I
dialog: was thinking that you and Peter
dialog: should hang out this summer. Lord
dialog: knows he brought enough of his Star
dialog: Wars dolls. You could have fun
dialog: with those.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: They're action figures! And
dialog: they’re classics!
dialog: (then, to Duncan)
dialog: I’ve got a rare wookie and the C-
text: 3P0 with detachable arms. They
dialog: lose value if I take them out of
dialog: the boxes, but we can still have
dialog: awesome battles with them.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: He needs human contact. He’s
dialog: having too many conversations with
dialog: those dolls.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I'm not!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I’ve heard you, Peter! You called
dialog: that “Baby Foot,” or whatever, your
dialog: best friend.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (not worth the effort)
dialog: Boba Fett...
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (ignoring, to Duncan)
dialog: So, should we set up a time for you
dialog: two to get together tomorrow?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Uh, I should check with my mom.
text: Duncan starts off.
dialog: 10
dialog: 11
dialog: 12
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: Okay, well, don’t stand us up
dialog: because we know where you live!
dialog: (then, to Peter)
dialog: See, I told you. Your eye makes
dialog: people uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You're the worst parent.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. BEACH HOUSE (FRONT) - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 10
text: Duncan enters. From upstairs, PLAYFUL LAUGHING. Pam and
text: Trent are clearly fooling around. With that, Duncan turns
text: right around, and heads back out.
scene_heading: EXT. STATION WAGON - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 11
text: Duncan is lying on top of the roof, eyes closed, listening to
text: his iPod. Unfortunately, he’s listening to REO Speedwagon’s
dialog: “Can't Fight This Feeling.” AND, he’s singing out loud.
text: He opens his eyes to see...
text: Susanna standing beside the car, watching. Clearly, she’s
text: back from the beach. Duncan fumbles with the iPod, drops it.
text: The earphones stay in, the console falls to the ground.
text: Embarrassed, he looks over, only to see that...
dialog: 
dialog: «+. She’s heading into her house.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - DAY - LATE 12
speaker_heading: AFTERNOON
text: Duncan comes down the stairs. Pam is setting the dining room
text: table for dinner. Trent, making drinks at the BAR. With
text: them, KIP and JOAN, Trent’s friends. “KYRIE,” by MR. MISTER
text: blares on the stereo. (We hope.) They’re all trying to sing
text: along, but clearly don’t know the words. Joan is dancing,
text: occasionally tugging on Kip and Trent to join her. But, to
text: no avail. The song gets to the CHORUS. This part, Trent,
dialog: Kip, and even Pam know well. However,...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (singing the chorus)
dialog: “Carry a laser down the road that I
dialog: must travel. Carry a laser through
dialog: the darkness of the night...”
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: KIP
text: aughing, shouting over
dialog: laughing houting
dialog: the music)
dialog: Whoa, whoa. Are you singing,
dialog: “Carry a laser?”
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: That’s what it is.
text: Trent, Pam, and Kip laugh.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: Why would anyone in their right
dialog: mind write a song called, “Carry A
dialog: Laser?”
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (laughing, shrugging)
dialog: Because they love outer space.
text: She goes back to singing and dancing. Finally...
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (noticing Duncan)
dialog: Uh-oh. You just walked in at the
dialog: wrong time, stranger.
text: Before Duncan can even protest, Joan is coaxing him onto her
dialog: “dance floor.”
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: This is Duncan. My son. These are
text: Trent’s friends, Kip and Joan.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: I’m the one not grinding up on you.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: I’m not grinding up on him.
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: Come on, I can’t get anyone to
dialog: dance with me.
text: Duncan looks to Pam for rescuing.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (smirking)
dialog: Oh. I’11 make it worse.
text: Pam joins in. Duncan halfheartedly gives in. A lot of
text: awkward movement. At this point, everyone embraces the lyric
text: “Carry a laser.” Full on singing.
dialog: 16.
text: Save for Trent, who puts on a good face, but is clearly over
text: the moment. Steph descends the stairs.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I’m out of here.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh, wait. I made dinner.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Oh, shoot. I have plans.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Steph, check out his moves.
text: Steph watches for a short beat...
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: Enjoy therapy.
text: She grabs beers off the bar and goes.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Alright, we did that...
text: Trent turns down the music. Duncan, self-conscious, stops
text: dancing. Pam grabs a PLATTER of HOR D’OURVES and BOX OF
text: CRACKERS, places them on the COFFEE TABLE.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, buddy, any chance you were on
dialog: top of my car?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: «+. No.
text: Without even being prompted, Duncan helps Pam, opening the
speaker_heading: CRACKERS.
speaker_heading: TRENT
text: Cause there was a dent in the roof.
dialog: It popped back up. So, it’s okay.
dialog: I’m just wondering if you knew
dialog: anything about that?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (innocent)
dialog: Well, we did have bags up there,
dialog: honey.
dialog: Not the one he wanted to hear from, but...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: That’s true. We did. Fair enough.
dialog: 17.
text: Trent smiles for Pam’s benefit.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: (pointed, to Duncan)
dialog: So, that’s probably it.
text: He winks at Duncan.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Can I help you with this, too, Pam?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh. No. Thank you.
dialog: (then, smiling at Duncan)
dialog: We've kind of got a system.
text: Trent puts his arm around, Pam.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We've got a good team, here.
text: He kisses her cheek. He seems proud. Duncan steps away,
dialog: stops helping.
scene_heading: 13 INT. BEACH HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 13
text: Post dinner. Joan, holding court. Duncan pushes remnants of
text: food around on his plate.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No, I can tell you exactly where I
text: was. Passed out in the dunes.
text: The guys laugh. Pam is out of the loop, but puts ona
text: gracious face.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: That's right!
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Because, you left me there!
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: No, now wait! Kip wanted to go out
dialog: on his boat. He said you’d be fine
dialog: by the fire.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You never came back!
speaker_heading: KIP

dialog: The next day I did.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: KIP (CONT'D)
dialog: I poked you with a stick to wake
dialog: you. It was real romantic.
dialog: The guys laugh.
speaker_heading: PAM JOAN
dialog: You know, I once went to this (to Trent)
dialog: horrible luau-themed party... Now, was it last summer...?
speaker_heading: PAM JOAN
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry... (faux sincere)
dialog: No. Go. Please.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: No, please. You were talking...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Tell your story, babe.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: Yeah. Enough of us, reminiscing...
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: It’s dumb...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Well, now we have to hear it.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: One time I went to this luau and
text: passed out in the dunes, too.
dialog: That's basically it.
text: Dead air. A flop of a story. But, everyone feigns enjoyment
dialog: to ease the awkwardness for Pam.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (passively)
dialog: .-. Oh, how funny.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: It was just... A similar thing
dialog: to...
text: Trent pulls in Pam close. He’s very attracted to this side
text: of her. Kip starts piling more food onto his plate.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: Okay, I just have to point out that
dialog: I'm loading up for the third time.
dialog: Pam, absolutely incredible.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: No, thank you.
dialog: (re: Trent)
dialog: Sorry this asshole sprung us on
dialog: you, last minute.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: It’s fine. I’ma caterer. I love
dialog: cooking for people.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: You cater? That makes sense.
text: Joan takes a sip of her wine, smiles.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: One of her many talents.
text: Trent kisses her. Pam smiles, graciously. She’s not used to
text: being put on a pedestal. It shows.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: She's also got some ideas for
dialog: fixing up the place...
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: You mean,...
dialog: (playing it up)
dialog: +. the “Riptide?”
text: Trent laughs, deflects. He takes a lot of shit for this.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (clarifying)
dialog: I mentioned rearranging a few
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey. Put your stamp on it. I’m
dialog: not set in my ways.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Tell that to Christine.
text: Kip lightly nudges Joan. A little awkward silence, then...
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (moving on)
dialog: Okay. I’m sorry, I have to put my
dialog: son out of his misery.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 14
dialog: Al4
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: You're free to go.
text: With that, Duncan jumps up from the table. Finally, relief.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: But, take your plate, buddy. We
dialog: clean up after ourselves in this
dialog: house.
text: Duncan complies, as Trent pours Pam some more wine. She
text: watches her son head off to the KITCHEN, as...
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Okay. My story now. Trent, was it
dialog: last summer that you and I got
dialog: stuck out on our boat?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (pointing to Kip)
dialog: Yes, cause this bastard buys gas,
dialog: three dollars at a time!
text: They all laugh, and continue to reminisce.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 14
text: Duncan looks around aimlessly for anything to pass the time.
dialog: - Surveys the BOOKCASES. Slim pickings. Mostly Louis
dialog: L’Amour-type novels.
dialog: - Checks out a PLAQUE. It’s engraved. “Trent Ramsey, Car
dialog: Salesman of the Year.”
text: - Looks at FRAMED PHOTOS. One catches his eye. A GROUP
text: SHOT. Among them, Trent, Kip, Joan, and Betty. AND, there’s
text: one WOMAN of interest. While everyone else is looking at the
text: CAMERA, she’s looking at Trent. But, she’s turned at such an
dialog: angle that we can’t see much of her face, if any at all.
text: Hanging onto her, Steph, smiling at the CAMERA.
text: - Opens a CABINET. Practically empty, save for one old,
text: ratty edition of CANDYLAND and a 500 PIECE PUZZLE (Something
text: lame, like kittens in a basket.)
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - DUNCAN’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT Al4
text: Duncan sits on the FLOOR. In front of him, the almost
text: completed PUZZLE. Just two pieces left to put in. He looks
text: around. Shakes the box. No pieces to be found. Sighs and
text: just starts taking it apart.
dialog: 15
dialog: 21.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - BACK DECK - LATER THAT NIGHT 15
text: Duncan walks out, looks out over the dunes.
speaker_heading: BETTY (0.S.)
dialog: Susanna, close the screen door!
dialog: I’m getting eaten alive by
dialog: mosquitos!
text: Duncan looks over at the adjacent deck, noticing Susanna,
text: sitting in a lounge chair. She gets up, slams the screen
dialog: door shut.
speaker_heading: BETTY (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t like the way you’re acting,
dialog: young lady! You wouldn’t be this
dialog: way if your dad was here!
text: Feeling Duncan’s stare, Susanna looks over. Caught, he looks
dialog: away quickly. Beat. Checks back to see if... Yep.
text: Susanna’s still looking at him.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: «.. Hey.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry about... I didn’t mean to...
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Oh, I don’t care. It’s not like we
dialog: were using our inside voices.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: That’s cool. That’s cool.
dialog: Beat. An eternity.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: So,... You’re a big fan of REO
dialog: Speedwagon?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: ... What?
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: “Can't Fight This Feeling?”
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh, no. My mom must have put that
dialog: on there.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Oh, and you just got to it and
dialog: thought, “What the hell. I’m going
dialog: to sing the shit out of it,
dialog: anyway?”
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (trying to play it off)
dialog: Something like that.
text: We hear LOUD LAUGHTER from inside Trent’s house.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Sucks here, huh?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: It’s okay.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: It sucks.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Yeah, no. Totally. Big time.
text: Beat. Susanna waits for more, then...
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Alright, well...
text: She starts back inside.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Feels like it’s going to be a hot
dialog: summer.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Oh. I thought we were done.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh,... I was thinking about that
dialog: earlier... That hot thing... And,
dialog: it just came to me again.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Okay. Well, if something else
dialog: comes to you,... Again. I’11 be
dialog: inside.
dialog: 16

scene_heading: EXT. DUNES - DAWN 16
text: The sun is just coming over the horizon.
speaker_heading: OMITTED 17
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 18
text: Duncan enters. It’s a mess. Everything left out from the
text: night before. Clearly, not everyone cleans up after
text: themselves. Steph is there, scavenging the fridge.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: They drank all the beer.
text: She slams the fridge door, storms out. Duncan finds a $20
text: BILL on the COUNTER. Next to it, a NOTE. It reads, “Up
dialog: late. Sleeping in. Love you, Mom.”
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE (FRONT) - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 19
text: Duncan walks down the stairs.
speaker_heading: BETTY (0.S.)
dialog: Peter, don’t get mad at me. I
dialog: don’t know where you’re looking!
text: Duncan stops in his tracks. Shit.
text: ANGLE ON Betty and Peter, at the base of their front STAIRS.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Forget it! It’s gone!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, next time you say, “Look at
dialog: the seagull,” you have to remember
dialog: to point!
text: Duncan quickly runs around the side of the STORAGE SHED,
text: opens it. A BIKE leans against the back wall, but we can’t
dialog: quite make it out.
dialog: 20
dialog: 21
dialog: 22
dialog: 24.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 20
text: Duncan rides the bike. A girl’s PINK CRUISER, complete with
dialog: front basket and tassels. But, he doesn’t care. For the
text: first time, he seems content.
scene_heading: EXT. MARC ANTHONY’S - DAY - LATER 21
text: It’s a PIZZA JOINT. A cool, old school vibe. Duncan leans
text: the BIKE against the wall. Parked at the CURB, the
dialog: Convertible we saw earlier.
scene_heading: INT. MARC ANTHONY’S - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 22
text: Duncan is at the COUNTER, buying a SOFT DRINK. Behind him, a
text: table of rowdy GUYS, all in BLUE SHIRTS, eating pizza. We
text: hear the familiar MUSIC of a PAC MAN GAME starting. Duncan’s
dialog: attention is drawn to the...
text: BACK GAME ROOM. Another BLUE-SHIRTED GUY is playing Pac Man.
text: EXCEPT for the classic PAC MAN upright, the rest of the video
text: games are very 2012. Duncan approaches, standing right
text: behind the Guy, watching.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Do you mind standing to the side?
dialog: I’m getting your reflection in the
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: «+. Sorry.
text: Duncan steps to the side. As he does, we get our first good
dialog: look at the guy. It is, in fact, the DRIVER of the
dialog: convertible.
text: CLOSE ON LOGO. It reads, “Water Wizz.”
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: I wouldn’t normally care, but I’m
dialog: having the game of my life. I’m on
dialog: the cherry level.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: But, that’s the first level.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Yeah, and I still have one man
dialog: left. So, like I said, it’s the
dialog: game of my life.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (smirks )
dialog: You like Pac Man?
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: What? It’s a classic!
dialog: (re: other games)
dialog: Not into all the bells and
dialog: whistles, my man. Too much going
dialog: on.
text: CLOSE ON Pac Man screen. Pac Man chases a “blinking ghost”,
text: barely devouring it before it changes back.
speaker_heading: GUY (CONT'D)
dialog: See, my mistake is that I get
dialog: greedy. Going for all the ghosts
dialog: and fruit instead of just clearing
dialog: pellets.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You know, there’s a pattern.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Oh, don’t tell me you’re one of
dialog: those guys. That takes all the
dialog: challenge out of it. Anybody can
dialog: learn a pattern.
text: Just then, the blue-shirted GUYS start to get up, putting up
speaker_heading: their TRAYS.
speaker_heading: BLUE-SHIRTED GUY
dialog: Owen, we gotta go!
text: We hear the familiar sound of PAC MAN DYING.
speaker_heading: OWEN (GUY)
dialog: Well, so much for the game of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You still have another man left.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Naw, I’ve yet to see the second
dialog: board. Gives me something to look
dialog: forward to.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh, the board’s always the same.
dialog: 23
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Well, there’s that. Thank you.
dialog: Now, I can die. Here. You play
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No, I...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Go, go. It’s all you.
dialog: Duncan plays.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: But, it’s still my quarter. So, if
dialog: you end up getting a high score, I
dialog: don’t want to see... What’s your
dialog: name?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: --- Duncan.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Okay, well, I don’t want to see
text: that up on the screen.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh, they only let you use three
dialog: letters.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Wow. Nothing’s left to the
dialog: imagination with you, huh?
text: Owen starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh and hey, no pattern on my
dialog: quarter, man. Cut your own path.
text: Duncan watches him leave. Suddenly, we hear PAC MAN DYING
dialog: again.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY - LATER 23
text: Duncan pulls up on his bike. Pam and Trent are loading a
text: large COOLER into the station wagon. Steph, leaning against
text: the car, putting on suntan lotion.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: There you are. We were just about
dialog: to leave without you. Where did
dialog: you run off to?
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Nowhere.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Well, let’s leave notes, okay?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Your mom was worried.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Now, go put on your swim trunks.
dialog: Kip and Joan invited us out on
dialog: their boat. And, we’re running
dialog: late.
text: Duncan heads toward the house.
speaker_heading: TRENT (0.S.)
dialog: Head’s up, buddy.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS - DAY - LATER
text: CLOSE ON DUNCAN, catching a life vest.
text: PULL BACK to see Duncan standing on the dock.
text: the back, the boat’s name, “BARELY A WAKE.”
text: the edge of the boat.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You need to wear that.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: Oh, I think he’s cool without it.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: No, Duncan can’t swim.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (trying to make it better,
dialog: clarifying)
dialog: Trent, he’s just not a comfortable
dialog: swimmer.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: I really think he’1ll be fine.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: No, let's wear it, buddy. So,
dialog: people don’t have to worry about
dialog: you, right?
dialog: Everyone is
text: loading stuff onto a large motor boat, all tricked out.
dialog: Trent stands on
dialog: 24
dialog: On
dialog: 25
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: BETTY (0.S.)
dialog: Yoo hoo!
text: Betty walks down the dock, followed by Peter, who’s carrying
text: a BUCKET, and Susanna.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yes, we invited ourselves. Accept
dialog: it and move on. Peter has to stay
text: down below. His eye throws off his
dialog: equilibrium and he’1l get sick
dialog: everywhere.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, I won’t, mom!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Tell that to the bucket we have to
dialog: bring!
text: Duncan, reluctantly, puts on the vest.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (sotto, to Pam)
dialog: Why do I have to wear this? No one
dialog: else does.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: He just wants you to be safe.
text: Susanna walks by, lifting an eyebrow, as Pam tightens the
text: straps on his vest.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that snug enough?
dialog: Off Duncan’s look...
scene_heading: EXT. BOAT - DAY - LATER 25
text: CLOSE ON Duncan, sitting. He’s miserable. The life vest is
text: three sizes too big for him. It comes halfway up his face.
text: The adults sit around the STERN of the boat. Steph and
text: Susanna sunbathe on the BOW.
text: CLOSE ON a beat up COOLER. Pam opens, revealing her “work.”
text: Impeccable food. It outclasses the container for sure.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Basically, he was relentless. And,
dialog: don’t get me wrong. I was looking.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I had been divorced well over a
dialog: year. It just...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: It just took a little persistence
dialog: on my end.
text: Pam smiles, caresses Trent’s cheek. Pam sets out
text: creating a spread on a table. Kip starts helping
text: instantly to the annoyance of Joan.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Well, I wasn’t sure about you.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I met her when she was catering
dialog: some Halloween party in Albany...
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: He went as a sexy cop.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (laughing, defending)
dialog: No, I was a 70s, bad ass cop.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: He followed me around all night,
dialog: saying that he was there to
dialog: “protect and serve” me.
dialog: 29.
dialog: her dishes,
dialog: himself
text: Trent, playfully, tries to put his hand over Pam’s mouth, but
text: she pulls away.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: That about ended it right there for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (sotto, to adults)
dialog: Sadly, I would have been working
text: his bag by that point.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (to Pam)
dialog: Now, you did let me help you load
dialog: up your van at the end of the
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Yes, I did.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: But, it still took three months to
dialog: even get her to go out with me.
dialog: 
text: He pulls Pam in.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Three months? I didn’t know you
dialog: had that kind of stamina.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: She definitely made me work for it.
dialog: But, it was worth it.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: There may be hope for you, yet.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: (to Pam)
dialog: What finally changed your mind?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: He told me that we were already in
dialog: this together, so I might as well.
dialog: It’s been almost a year now.
text: They kiss. Joan finishes her wine. Trent, Kip, and Betty
text: start to make plates for themselves. Pam notices Duncan,
text: sulking.
text: ANGLE ON DUNCAN. He glances over at Steph and Susanna.
text: Steph catches him. She nudges Susanna, whispers. They both
text: laugh. Duncan fumes.
text: Pam approaches.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (light, jokingly)
dialog: Could you look a little more
dialog: miserable?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Could he be even more of a dick?
text: Pam’s smile instantly fades.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Hey. He’s making an effort.
text: Duncan looks away.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: He wants this to work. He wants us
dialog: to be a family.
dialog: 26
dialog: 27
speaker_heading: A27
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: He says that, but that’s not what
dialog: he does.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Look, I know it’s not easy, but...
dialog: You promised, remember? That you'd
dialog: give it a try.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I don’t know why I can’t just go to
dialog: dad’s for the summer.
text: Pam puts on a good face, moving through...
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: .+. Because you’re with me.
text: Duncan just looks off, checks out. He doesn’t “feel” like
text: he’s with her. Eventually, Pam returns to the group.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS - DAY - LATE AFTERNOON 26
text: Everyone is unloading. Trent is helping the women off the
text: boat offering them a hand as they step down. Duncan jumps
text: onto the dock, throws off his life preserver.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey, buddy, the cooler’s not going
dialog: to get to the car by itself.
text: Joan steps up to the side of the boat. It’s her turn to step
text: down. Trent offers his hand. She makes a point to reject
text: it, getting down on her own.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 27
text: Duncan stands among the remnants of a “destroyed” table.
text: Half-eaten rolls, corn cobs, opened bottles of wine.
text: Clearly, the party had moved to the house.
text: From OUTSIDE, we hear muffled LAUGHING/TALKING. Duncan looks
text: out the WINDOW. The adults stumble along the dunes, singing

speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Good morning, sweetie.
dialog: Duncan gives her nothing.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want any breakfast...?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (short)
dialog: No. I’m good.

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - STORAGE SHED - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 30

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 31
text: Duncan rides the bike, peddling furiously. He’s doesn’t know
dialog: where he’s going. He just knows he wants to be somewhere

scene_heading: WATER WIZZ WATERPARK.
text: TRACKING SHOT of Duncan riding up to the park.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 32
text: Duncan enters through an open GATE. An EMPLOYEE enters
text: behind him, carrying a BOX, shuts the gate door. Duncan
text: already seems overwhelmed and out of place. CHILDREN run
text: amok. TEENS congregate around the lounge chairs. EMPLOYEES
text: congregate around the MAIN OFFICE.
dialog: 33
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: OWEN (0.S.)
dialog: How'd we do?
text: Duncan finds... Owen, standing on a SMALL DECK over the MAIN
text: OFFICE. He’s in a ratty BATHROBE, eating breakfast.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Nothing less than highest score I
dialog: hope. I’ve got a reputation to
dialog: protect.
text: CAITLIN, a fellow coworker, emerges from the MAIN OFFICE
dialog: below. Cute. No nonsense. Sardonic. She pretty much runs
dialog: the place.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: (to Owen)
dialog: Hey, whenever’s convenient for you,
dialog: we are open for business.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: See? I’m held in high regard.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Caitlin, I’m going on break.
text: Caitlin rolls her eyes, heads back into the office.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: See what I did?
speaker_heading: CAITLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah. It was clever as shit.
text: As Owen goes into the apartment, Duncan finds an empty PICNIC
text: TABLE near the front entrance, sits. Dressed in jeans and a
text: T-shirt, Duncan should stand-out among the scantily clad
text: patrons, but somehow he disappears. As he watches life in
dialog: the waterpark continue around him, we...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - PARKING LOT - DAY - LATE AFTERNOON 33

scene_heading: EXT. BETTY THOMPSON’S HOUSE/STREET (FRONT) - DAY - A LITTLB4
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Duncan rides up.
speaker_heading: GIRL'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Sweet ride.
text: Duncan finds Susanna, on her front steps. In her hands, a
text: CELLPHONE. Duncan seems to be holding onto a little
text: resentment from the boat incident. He doesn’t even get off
text: his bike. Just circles around and around in the street.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh, it’s not mine.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Yeah, I figured.
text: Susanna walks down to the street, smiles. But, she can’t
text: help but register Duncan’s aloofness. She tries another
dialog: tactic.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA (CONT’D)
dialog: You were right, by the way. It is
dialog: a hot summer.
text: Duncan stops, reluctantly smiles.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Yeah, I just call it like I see it.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (holding up phone)
dialog: I’m waiting for my Dad to call me
dialog: back. I don’t want to be inside
dialog: because my mom will just stare at
dialog: me while I’m on the phone. She's
dialog: all freaked out that I’m gonna want
dialog: to live with him, or whatever.
text: Duncan finally stops riding, connecting with Susanna.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: My mom’s the same way.

speaker_heading: PAM (0.S.)
dialog: I'll see if he’s out front.
text: Just as Pam opens the screen door, Duncan pops back against
text: the shed wall. Pam checks her watch. Duncan waits until
text: it’s safe, then sneaks off toward the ocean.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DUNES - THAT NIGHT 36
text: Duncan sits at the edge, looking out onto the beach/ocean.

text: ANGLE ON Trent, sitting in a chair, eating a sandwich.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: My mom and I do.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You worried her. Again. I told
dialog: her I'd wait up for you.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Well. I’m here.
text: He starts up the stairs.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey, Duncan?
text: Duncan stops. Beat.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not interested in talking to
dialog: the back of your head, so...
text: Duncan turns around, full of 14 year old attitude.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: If we’re going to make this work,
dialog: and it is “we,” then there needs to
dialog: be trust. And, respect. Am I
dialog: right? I think that’s something we
dialog: both want.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: -.. Fine.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: There you go, buddy.
text: Duncan turns, and heads upstairs.
scene_heading: 38 EXT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - THE NEXT DAY 38
text: Duncan is back on the edge of the same PICNIC TABLE, still
text: sporting the jeans and T-shirt look.
speaker_heading: OWEN (0.S.)
dialog: I'm afraid I’m going to have to ask
dialog: you to leave.
text: Duncan looks back over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: -.. What?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Yeah, you're going to have to take
dialog: off. I’m getting complaints.
dialog: You're having too much fun. It’s
dialog: making everyone uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh. ... Okay.
text: Duncan actually gets up, starts out. Owen is genuinely
text: thrown by Duncan’s reaction... Stifles a laugh.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Whoa. Wait...
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: I’m sorry. I shouldn’t be... I
dialog: didn’t think you would actually...
dialog: 39
dialog: 37.
text: Duncan’s not sure what’s going on. Owen gathers himself. He
dialog: found that very endearing and funny.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: (gesturing him to follow)
dialog: Come on...
text: Duncan seems reticent. More confused, really.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Look, I can tell you’re in complete
dialog: awe of that picnic table. It is
dialog: one-of-a-kind except for the 200
dialog: exactly like it around here. But,
text: there is more park to be seen.
text: Finally, Duncan complies, follows.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: First things first. As much as I’m
dialog: a fan of Tuff Skins, we’ve got to
dialog: get you a swimsuit. Seriously,
dialog: when’s the last time you bought
dialog: jeans?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh, my mom buys my jeans...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Good. Always take things
dialog: literally. How’s that working out
dialog: for you? You getting laid?
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - RENTAL BOOTH - DAY 39
text: Owen and Duncan approach LEWIS, working behind the counter.
dialog: He’s quite a curmudgeon, pale as can be, and his Water Wizz

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Lewis, hook up my man, Duncan, here
dialog: with one of our finest rentals.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
text: Some kid threw up near Crazy Tubes.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Whoa, let’s try not to impress him
dialog: all at once.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: That will not be a challenge.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Lewis is kind of over this place.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I told you. I’m not long for here.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: No, I remember that conversation.
dialog: In 2003, 5, 11, April, two days
dialog: ago...
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I’ve just got things I want to do.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Prove it. Without thinking, rattle
dialog: off three. Go.
text: Owen smiles at Duncan. He loves goading Lewis.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (complying)
dialog: I don’t know. See New Mexico. Take
dialog: Invent something. Become a storm
dialog: chaser...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: You had me until number three. I
dialog: think you have to go to school for
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: “Hey, look. There’s a storm.”
dialog: “Where?” “Over there.” “Cool.
dialog: Let’s go get it.” “Got it.”
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Wait. Are you chasing them or
dialog: capturing...?
text: Lewis waves him off, pulls out a pair of ragged-looking swim
text: trunks from below the counter, hands them to Duncan.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: These don’t have any mesh, so
dialog: you're basically going “commando.”
dialog: Watch sitting. You’re junk will
dialog: fall out.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: And like that, you're impressed.
dialog: And, grossed out.

text: We STEADY CAM as Owen leads Duncan, now wearing the ill-
dialog: fitting swim suit, on a “tour of the park.” This is our
text: first real glimpse of Water Wizz in all its glory. Clearly,
dialog: built in the 80’s and from the looks of it, hasn’t changed a
dialog: bit.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Water Wizz Waterpark. Built in the
dialog: summer of ‘83, it’s the last
dialog: bastion of everything that time
dialog: period stood for. In fact, it was
dialog: decreed by its creator that this
dialog: place shall never age. On his
dialog: death bed, he said “I don’t want
dialog: this place re-painted or updated. I
dialog: don’t even want it brought up to
dialog: code. And the minute someone
dialog: tries, it needs to be destroyed.”
text: Duncan doesn’t even bat an eye to this. Owen takes that in.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: We actually have a nuclear bomb for
dialog: just such an occasion.
text: Duncan still doesn’t get the joke.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Bought it off the Russians.
dialog: Still nothing.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Really? Still good with all that?
dialog: Even the Russian thing? That’s
dialog: Cold War. Kind of dated.
text: Duncan’s still blank.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Hi, Duncan.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Also, I need you to reorder more T-

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Did it.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Finish the work schedule for next

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Did it.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Change all of the filters...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: You know, I’m going to check.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Oh. Then, in that case, I didn’t

speaker_heading: CAITLIN

scene_heading: PAN DOWN from SIGN. “DEVIL'S PEAK.” Owen and Duncan approach

speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)

text: make their way up the RAMP, past the long line of SLIDERS.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Owen, settle a debate for us.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Hello, boys. Duncan, this is

speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Actually, Ming Lee’s right. I was
dialog: here when it happened.
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Then how'd he do it.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: It happened inside the tube. So,
dialog: no one knows. Only the kid and the
dialog: person he passed,... And, well,
dialog: Jesus. But, he’s hard to get a
dialog: hold of.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Be serious!

speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Bullshit. We’1ll just ask the kid
dialog: how he did it.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Be my guest. If you can find him.
dialog: Last I heard, he went into a deep
dialog: depression. The fame was too much.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: He turned to cocaine to escape the
dialog: limelight. And eventually, to a

speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, no. Wait. There he is.

speaker_heading: OWEN

speaker_heading: BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

speaker_heading: OWEN

dialog: surface of the water.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: And, uh... Looks like you lost

speaker_heading: OWEN

speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Thanks for the ride.

speaker_heading: OWEN

speaker_heading: DUNCAN

speaker_heading: SUSANNA (CONT’D)
dialog: Is your dad seeing anybody?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Yeah, she’s a lot younger.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Classic.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: They're just getting situated in
dialog: San Diego. You know? New place.
dialog: So, he says it’s not a great time
dialog: right now. But,... I’m going to
dialog: visit him when he gets settled and
dialog: stuff. It’s supposed to be awesome
dialog: out there.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: California. That’s cool.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Yeah.
text: Beat. Duncan just looks out at the water. Susanna watches
text: him. Just then, Peter runs by, chasing a crab.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Susanna, look! The crab grabbed
dialog: the light saber! He’s got Luke’s
dialog: light saber! This is the battle of
dialog: all battles!
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: How are you only a year older than
dialog: him?
scene_heading: EXT. BETTY THOMPSON’S HOUSE - DUNES - THAT NIGHT - A LITTLBE1
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Susanna and Duncan walk up the DUNES. Peter runs by, his
text: arms outstretched as if he’s flying.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: So, where is it you go?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Go where?
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: On your sexy, pink cruiser?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh. Nowhere.
text: Susanna smiles.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Oh. I see...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No, I just...
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: It's okay. Let it be yours.
text: She smiles. They approach...
text: BETTY’S BACK DECK.
text: Duncan glances over at the DUNES behind TRENT’S HOUSE.
text: DUNCAN'S POV of Pam, Betty, and a group of women still
text: sitting around the fire. They are all clearly high, drunk,
dialog: all of it.
text: Susanna watches Duncan watch his mom.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA (CONT’D)
dialog: «++ Good night.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (coming to)
dialog: Yeah, good night.
text: Susanna head up the stairs. Duncan continues into Trent’s
text: YARD. Suddenly, MUFFLED ARGUING from the side of the house
dialog: draws his attention to...
text: «+. the side of TRENT’S HOUSE. Duncan peeks around. Joan,
text: clearly drunk, is leaning into Trent. She runs her hand up
text: his stomach and chest. Trent removes her hand, but she leans
text: in, kisses him. Although Trent doesn’t “kiss back,” he
text: doesn’t pull away immediately. Thinking better of it, he
text: finally turns his head away.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Oh, I see. Just not this summer.
dialog: 52
dialog: 56.
text: Pissed, she waves him off. Trent starts walking toward
text: Duncan, who throws himself against the side of the house.
text: Trent walks by, not seeing him. In his hand, a bag of
text: MARSHMALLOWS. Trent approaches Pam and the rest.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: You were gone that long and you
dialog: only brought the marshmallows?
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Joan has the rest.
text: Trent joins Kip and Charlie who are clearly smoking pot.
text: Duncan watches as Pam looks over her shoulder in the
text: direction of where Trent came from, just as Joan is rounding
text: the corner, fixing her hair. Joan joins them at the fire,
text: handing a box of GRAHAM CRACKERS and CHOCOLATE BARS to Pam
text: without even looking at her. Pam glances over, noticing
text: Duncan. She takes a moment, then...
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (to Group, upbeat)
dialog: Who wants a S’more?
text: Duncan just shakes his head, and walks off.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - RENTAL BOOTH - THE NEXT MORNING 52
text: Duncan rounds the corner of the booth, a little out of sorts
text: from the night before. But, at least he’s in his OWN
text: swimsuit. Owen is there with Lewis.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: You're late!
text: Duncan looks like a deer in headlights.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you planning on making this a
dialog: habit? If so, we’re done here.
dialog: You know what? I’m tired of your
dialog: sass. You're fired.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: But,... I just...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: You make a valid point. Welcome
dialog: back. With benefits.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: You waste an exorbitant amount of
dialog: time.
dialog: 53
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Suit up.
text: Owen throws him a blue shirt. Duncan doesn’t emote much
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Come on, get pumped! This is a
dialog: place where dreams are made. Or,
dialog: destroyed. Depends on how you feel
text: about working at a waterpark.
text: Duncan puts the blue shirt on over his T-shirt. Caitlin
dialog: approaches.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Um, we have a situation over at
dialog: Harpoon Lagoon.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: Is it a homicide?
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: (dry)
dialog: Yes. It’s a homicide. That’s why
dialog: I’m so calm.
dialog: Owen starts off...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (dramatic whisper)
dialog: I knew this day would come.
text: Caitlin and Duncan follow.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - HARPOON LAGOON - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 53
text: A small crowd of waterpark PATRONS have circled up, watching
text: some BREAKDANCERS going to town on a large piece of
scene_heading: CARDBOARD. HIP-HOP BLARING from a BOOM BOX. (NOTE: Our
dialog: “Breakdancers” are just TEENS who were at the waterpark. Not
dialog: a “crew.” They would be dressed for the waterpark.)
text: ANGLE ON SNACK SHACK. Roddy and a few other EMPLOYEES are
text: watching. Owen, Caitlin, and Duncan approach, joining.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh. There’s no blood.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: (very matter-of-fact)
dialog: They grabbed some cardboard from
dialog: the snack shack and just started
dialog: going to town. Mostly b-boying.
dialog: Power, Abstract, Blowup, Flavor...
dialog: Mad moves though. Applejacks,
dialog: Coindrops, Turtles, Jackhammers,
dialog: 1990s...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Any Jookin? Buckin?
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: (scoffing)
dialog: Not this far from Memphis...
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: (over it)
dialog: Someone needs to take away their
dialog: cardboard. It’s getting too
text: congested.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: You heard the lady.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: --- Oh, I don’t.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: No. Owen. You need to do this.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Naw, he’s got it.
text: Duncan looks over, nervous.
scene_heading: DUNCAN'S POV of the BREAKDANCING CIRCLE. A BREAKDANCING GUY
text: moves center stage, holding court. He’s quite an imposing
dialog: fellow.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (meek)
dialog: But,... It’s my first day...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (off shirt)
dialog: Hey. You're official now. You got
dialog: this.
text: Duncan takes a deep breath, walks off...
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: (off Caitlin’s glare)
dialog: I’m right here. I’11 step in.
text: ANGLE ON Duncan, slowly approaching. He stops just outside
text: the circle, looks back at Owen, who gives him a thumbs up.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (soft)
dialog: .-- Excuse me.
text: No one hears him over the music. They’re lost in their dance
dialog: circle.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, uh, guys...?
text: Nothing. Duncan shuffles over to the boom box, turns it off.
text: A smattering of disappointment from the Patrons. “Boo.”
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCERS
dialog: Hey!/What the hell?!
text: They all turn and look right at Duncan.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I’m gonna... need to take your
dialog: cardboard.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY
dialog: Whoa, whoa.
text: Our imposing fellow steps forward. Duncan’s eyes only come
text: up to his chest.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: What, now?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Um,.. I was told to take your
dialog: cardboard.
text: The Breakdancing Guy takes a moment, but eventually steps to
text: the side. Duncan makes his way through the very intimidating
text: crowd. He reaches down, grabs the edge of the cardboard. A
text: foot SLAMS down onto it. It’s Breakdancing Guy, again.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY
dialog: Show us your moves.
text: Duncan looks at him, confused.
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: Show us your moves. Then, you can
dialog: take it.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Oh,... I don’t... I can’t, um,
dialog: crunk or any of that.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY
dialog: Then, you can’t take the cardboard.
text: He takes a moment, then starts to “pop ‘n lock” horribly.
text: It's awkward, and jerky. This moment seems to go on for an
text: eternity. Finally, he stops. No one reacts. They all just
text: stare at him, blankly. Beat.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY (CONT’D)
dialog: (nodding head)
dialog: Okay. Okay.
text: He seems to be signing off. Duncan, relieved, goes to
dialog: retrieve the cardboard.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Whoa. We’re not done.
text: ANGLE ON a BEAUTIFUL BREAKDANCER emerging from the crowd.
text: She turns the BOOM BOX back on. Grabs Duncan’s hand, leading
text: him to the center of the cardboard.
speaker_heading: BEAUTIFUL BREAKDANCER
dialog: Just mirror me.
text: The Beautiful Breakdancer does a move, throws it to Duncan.
text: He tries to replicate it. Terrible. More moves. More
text: mirroring. More butchering. The Patrons start to get into
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY
dialog: Spin on your head!
text: Just then, two big BREAKDANCERS pick Duncan up from behind,
text: flip him over. Duncan is now in a headstand. The
text: Breakdancers start manually spinning Duncan by his legs,
text: faster and faster, handing him off like a Tetherball.
text: CLOSE ON Duncan's face, beaming.
text: DUNCAN'S POV as he spins around and around.
text: Suddenly, the guys let go. Duncan tumbles to the ground.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCERS
dialog: Stick it! Stick it!
dialog: 54
dialog: 55
dialog: 61.
text: Duncan awkwardly makes a “pose.” The Patrons go crazy.
text: Breakdancing Guy helps Duncan up. Everyone claps/cheers,
dialog: including Owen, and Roddy. Even Caitlin is not immune to the
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: BREAKDANCING GUY
dialog: Nice moves, Pop ‘n Lock.
text: The Beautiful Breakdancer hands Duncan the cardboard.
text: ANGLE ON Owen/Caitlin. He gives her a “See?” look.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: You got lucky.
text: Owen puts his arm around her waist, but she removes it.
text: ANGLE ON Duncan, carrying the CARDBOARD back over, grinning.
text: He’s also DIZZY AS HELL. He can barely walk a straight line.
text: In fact, as he tumbles off to the side...
speaker_heading: BEGIN MONTAGE
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 54
text: Duncan rides up, barely stopping to hop off of it. He’s too
text: excited. He heads up the stairs, then realizes... He’s still
text: wearing the blue shirt. He pulls it off, and hides it under
text: his T-shirt.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 55
text: Duncan enters, excited. Pam, Trent, Joan, and Kip are there,
dialog: having drinks.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Hey. Where have you been?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Nowhere.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: That’s a long time to be nowhere.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Well, that’s where I was.
text: With that, he heads up the STAIRS.
dialog: 56
dialog: 57
dialog: 58
dialog: 59
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAY 56
text: Duncan sits at the mouth of the TUBE. Beside him, Roddy,
text: showing him how to run the line. Like Roddy earlier, Duncan
text: is spacing out the SLIDERS. Just then, a BEAUTIFUL TEEN
text: steps up. Duncan instructs her to “hold.” Roddy motions for
text: Duncan to check her out. He complies, staring at her behind,
text: but can’t help but blush. Suddenly, a CLEARING OF A THROAT.
text: ANGLE ON the teen’s MOTHER, glaring.
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: (mock scolding)
dialog: Inappropriate, Duncan.
dialog: Inappropriate.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/BACK DECK - LATE AFTERNOON 57
text: Duncan enters. Trent, Kip, Joan and Pam are sitting on the
text: BACK DECK. Joan, holding court. Pam, collecting everyone’s
text: drinks to “refill.” Without even breaking from her “story,”
text: Joan hands Pam her glass. Pam watches through the window as
text: Duncan passes by, never connecting with her.
scene_heading: INT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - DAY 58
text: The whole staff is gathered. Owen, passing out PAYCHECKS.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Roddy.
text: He hands Roddy his check.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Lewis.
text: Owen reaches over the back of him to Lewis.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Pop ‘N Lock!
text: Duncan works his way through the crowd as they laugh,
text: cheering.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 59
text: CLOSE ON DUNCAN, woofing down some cereal, chugging orange
text: juice. He’s hellbent to get on with his day. A different
dialog: air to this “Duncan.” Very tan, healthy-looking. His hair,
dialog: shaggy.
dialog: 60
dialog: 61
dialog: 62
dialog: 63.
text: PULL BACK to reveal STEPH just staring at him. Not sure who
text: the hell this is. Duncan looks over, winks.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAY 60
text: Duncan is now on his own at “Peak Command.” He’s wearing
text: classic Vaurnets a la Owen, spacing SLIDERS out with the
text: greatest of ease, confident. Among the kids, Kyle, Jason and
dialog: Neil.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - BOTTOM OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: A variety of SLIDERS come shooting out of the tube one after
text: the other. Suddenly, the flow of people stops. Beat. No
text: activity. All of the sudden, three MATS come out of the
text: tube. But, no Sliders. We hear a LOUD WHISTLE.
speaker_heading: END OF MONTAGE
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 62
text: Owen and Roddy run up. Duncan has the whistle in his hand.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: Sorry. They rushed me. They said
dialog: it was for the good of science.
text: Owen, Duncan, and Roddy look down the tube.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (yelling down tube)
dialog: Guys, are you okay?!
speaker_heading: KYLE (0.S.)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: No, we’re not okay, dumbass. We’re
dialog: stuck!
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (to Duncan/Roddy)
dialog: Huh. Not sure how I’m the dumbass
dialog: in this scenario.
speaker_heading: A62
dialog: 63
dialog: 64.
scene_heading: INT. TUBE - DAY - CONTINUOUS A62
text: Kyle, Neil, and Jason are, in fact, stuck. They’re arms,
text: legs, everything - tangled. Kyle, facing one way. Neil and
text: Jason, the other. Water, rushing all around them.
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: I told you we shouldn’t all go at
dialog: the same time!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I thought it would work!
speaker_heading: KYLE
dialog: Shut up, Neil! Shut. Up. Neil!
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 63
text: Owen hops up on the railing, addresses the sea of kids
text: waiting on the ramp.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Okay, listen up. I need a hero.
dialog: I’m holding out for a hero ‘til the
dialog: end of the night. He’s gotta be
dialog: strong. And he’s gotta be fast.
dialog: And he’s gotta be fresh from the
dialog: fight.
dialog: (then, off the kids’ blank
dialog: stares)
dialog: No? Footloose? Bonnie Tyler song?
text: Kevin Bacon drives a tractor ina
dialog: game of “Chicken?”
text: Still blank stares.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: (giving up)
dialog: I need someone to throw himself
dialog: down the tube and knock some kids
dialog: loose.
text: A HAND rises from the CROWD.
speaker_heading: KID'S VOICE
dialog: I'll do it.
text: The “volunteer” makes his way through the crowd. It’s a KID
dialog: alright. A quite obese one.
dialog: 64
dialog: 65
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - TOP OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 64
text: Duncan, Owen, and Roddy are now joined by MALCOLM (KID).
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: Malcolm.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: You're probably going to want to
dialog: get some momentum, Mack.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (confident)
dialog: I got this.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Owen, I don’t know if that’s a good
dialog: idea. What if we just turn off the
dialog: water? They could get their
dialog: footing.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Let’s call that “Plan B.”
dialog: (then, yelling into tube)
dialog: I’m not going to lie to you. This
dialog: is probably going to hurt.
speaker_heading: KYLE (0.S.)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: What’s going to hurt who?
text: Malcolm steps into the entrance of the tube. He grabs the
text: sides and starts rocking back and forth. Finally, throwing
text: himself down the tube.
scene_heading: INT. TUBE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 65
text: CLOSE ON Kyle, Jason and Neil, as they feel the tube ROCK and
text: they hear RUMBLING.
speaker_heading: NEIL/JASON
dialog: What’s happening?!/I can’t see!
text: KYLE'S POV of Malcolm coming at them, full speed.
text: Kyle screams.
speaker_heading: NEIL/JASON (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you screaming?!
dialog: 66
dialog: 66.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - BOTTOM OF DEVIL’S PEAK - DAY - CONTINUOUS 66
text: Kyle, Neil, Jason, and Malcolm come shooting out of the tube
text: in one big ball. Owen, Duncan, and Roddy run up. Owen jumps
text: in to help the guys to their feet.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (faux concern)
dialog: Oh my God. Ming Lee, Ismael,
dialog: Vladimir. I thought I lost you.
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: That was awesome!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Let’s do it again!
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: (to Kid)
dialog: Will you knock us loose?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Sure!
text: Caitlin approaches, intercepts. Pissed.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Whoa. Whoa. We’re done with that.
dialog: Thank you.
text: The boys looks disappointed.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Owen)
dialog: What do think you're doing!
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: It’s all good. No one got hurt.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Don’t just wave it off! Places get
dialog: shut down because of stunts like
dialog: this!
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (to boys)
dialog: Is it just me, or is she very sexy
dialog: right now?
speaker_heading: MALCOLM
dialog: (checking her out)
dialog: She's certainly got my attention.
dialog: 67
dialog: 68
dialog: 69
dialog: 67.
text: Caitlin takes a breath, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Why do you always put me in this
dialog: position? I hate being this
dialog: person. This is why,...
dialog: (then, indicates herself
dialog: and him)
dialog: «+. This doesn’t happen. It’s not
dialog: fun anymore.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I wish this wasn’t just a job.
text: With that, she walks off. Duncan looks to Owen, whose
text: clearly affected. Beat.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Sorry, I didn’t mean to...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: No. It’s my fault.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - THE NEXT DAY 67
text: It’s pouring rain. The place is locked up. The parking lot,
dialog: empty.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY - SAME TIME 68
dialog: No activity here, either. The only difference is that the
text: station wagon is covered with a tarp. Clearly, Trent doesn’t
dialog: like it getting wet.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS 69
text: Duncan stares out the window. Miserable. Trent sits on the
text: couch, looking through the newspaper. Steph is painting her
text: toe nails. Pam enters from kitchen.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: The soup needs a little longer.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: There’s a 1:15 and a 3:30. We
dialog: could see one of those.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: No, let’s stay in. Do something we
dialog: can all do together. As a family.
dialog: 70
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: We can see a movie as a family. We
dialog: could grab Kip and Joan and make an
dialog: evening of it.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: I don’t feel like hanging out with
dialog: Kip and Joan. I feel like hanging
dialog: out with all of you.
text: Pam holds her stare on Trent. She means it.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 70
text: CLOSE ON CANDYLAND BOX. Faded, on it’s last legs.
text: PULL BACK to reveal. The “family” sitting on the floor
text: around the table. Pam, the only one smiling, trying to sell
text: them on her idea. She displays the box top.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: It’s appropriate for people four to
dialog: eight. So, we’re good.
text: Tough sell. Steph studies the top of the box, and reads it.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: “Home Sweet Home.”
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Okay, let’s not hate it right away.
dialog: (then, holding up game
dialog: pieces)
dialog: What color gingerbread character do
dialog: you want to be, Trent?
text: Trent doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I have to be yellow!
text: She grabs a pawn.
dialog: LATER...
text: CLOSE ON a “Gingerbread Character” moving from space to
text: space. It gets to an area called “Gumdrop Pass.”
text: PULL BACK to reveal Duncan. It’s his turn.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh, look, you can take the shortcut
dialog: there.
dialog: There is, in fact, a “bridge” that allows you to jump ahead.
text: Duncan moves his “character” over the “bridge.”
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Whoa. No, he can’t do that.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Yes, he can. He crosses the
dialog: bridge.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: This is so stupid.
text: Duncan moves back and past the “bridge.”
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: No, you’re at the shortcut. So,
dialog: take it.
text: Trent picks up the DIRECTIONS.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (reading, pointedly)
dialog: “If your Gingerbread Character pawn
dialog: lands, by exact count, on the
text: yellow space below the Gumdrop
dialog: Pass, you can take the shortcut.”
dialog: (then)
dialog: “Exact count.” He picked a card
text: with a blue square on it, so he has
dialog: to go to a blue square.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Well, I don’t think it matters.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: If it didn’t matter, they wouldn’t
dialog: put it in the directions.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: We can fudge the rule.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: “Fudge.” That’s good.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (good-natured)
dialog: Well then, I might as well go
text: directly to the top of Candy
dialog: Mountain with that argument.
text: Trent moves his pawn.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: No rules? There we go. I win.
text: Pam moves his pawn back.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Fine. We'll play the way you're
dialog: supposed to play.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Duncan, move to the correct place.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I already did.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Great.
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Now, take my turn for me. I’m
text: going to set the table for lunch.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Wait, what? No, you need to do it.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Duncan can move for me.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: No, you’re the one who wanted to
dialog: play. So, play your turn.
text: Pam takes a moment, then comes back to turn a card and slam
dialog: it down.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Purple.
text: Pam moves her pawn toward a purple square with force. Then,
text: turns to go to the dining room.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: (cautiously)
dialog: It’s two. You need to move two
dialog: purple squares.
dialog: (off Pam’s look)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 71
dialog: 72
dialog: 73
dialog: 71.
text: Pam takes a moment to collect herself, and then comes to
dialog: move her pawn.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: There. And, I’ve landed...
dialog: (for Trent's benefit)
dialog: ... By exact count, at the
dialog: shortcut, so, I'll be taking the
dialog: “Rainbow Trail.”
dialog: She does.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: See? You’re way ahead now.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: It’s Candyland, Trent.
text: With that, she walks to the DINING ROOM, starts setting the
text: table. Trent gives Duncan and Steph a “What’s with her
dialog: look?” But, they don’t commiserate.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: It’s your turn, Steph.
text: Long beat of silence. The only sounds are those of “game
text: play.” A Gingerbread pawn being moved across the board.
text: Suddenly, Pam slams down a PLATE.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (in tears)
dialog: It’s fucking Candyland!
text: She storms off.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING 71
text: The sun is out. Remnants of the rain are still evident,
text: puddles on the ground. The station wagon, now uncovered.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - STORAGE SHED - DAY 72
text: Duncan boards his bike. As he rides off, Susanna comes out
text: from behind her house, with her own bike.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - PARKING LOT - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 73
text: Duncan locks up his bike. Susanna watches from afar. She
text: turns around and heads back the way they came.
dialog: 74
dialog: 75
dialog: 72.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 74
text: Duncan enters, surprised to find... OWEN, opening up. He
text: looks a little more put together than usual, professional.
text: He’s wiping down all the lounge chairs.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: It’s your day off. Why are you
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I figured we lost yesterday, so I
dialog: thought I’d make it up.
dialog: (then, knowingly)
dialog: Why are you?
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Thought I’d open the place. See
dialog: what all the fuss is about.
text: Duncan smiles. Just then, Caitlin walks up to the front
text: gate, her KEYS out. She seems genuinely surprised to find
text: the place already open AND to see Owen working. He beams.
text: She strides past him, bemused but it’s not going to be that
dialog: easy.
speaker_heading: CAITLIN
dialog: Your shirt’s inside out.
text: Owen looks. It, in fact, is.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - RENTAL BOOTH - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 75
text: Duncan is stacking MATS.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA (0.S.)
dialog: So, this is where you run off to?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: I followed you earlier. Then, went
dialog: to grab my stuff.
text: She holds up her BEACH BAG. Duncan smiles.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: What happened to “let it be yours?”
dialog: Suddenly,
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Does your mom know that you work
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: «+. Nice.
text: over the LOUD SPEAKER...
speaker_heading: OWEN (0.S.)
dialog: Duncan, to the Administrative
dialog: Offices International.
text: Duncan looks over his shoulder. Owen, Roddy, and Lewis are
text: standing very nearby.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: (into PA)
dialog: Duncan, please report to the
dialog: Administrative Offices
dialog: International. I have to announce
dialog: this over the PA as my voice won't
dialog: carry that far. My throat suffered
dialog: major damage during an intense make-
dialog: out session with Lewis’ mom. She
dialog: has a forked tongue...
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I don’t have a mom. I have two
dialog: dads. In your face.
text: Duncan looks back at Susanna.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: .-. Hold on a sec...
text: Duncan walks over to the guys...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (goading)
dialog: Who’s that, big guy?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Just a girl.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Just a girl? A girl who makes you
dialog: blush?
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Susanna.
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: You pussy hound.
text: Duncan looks down at the ground, shuffling his feet.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I don’t know. She’s... older than
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: Then, why are you here talking to
dialog: us and not over there, sealing the
dialog: deal with that cougar?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Well,... Maybe if you guys hadn't
dialog: called me over.
text: Owen and Roddy react to Duncan’s hint of bravado. Duncan
text: smiles and AS he walks off...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (into the PA system)
text: Duncan, back to his lady friend.
dialog: Duncan, to his lady friend. Please
dialog: let her know that our conversation
dialog: was entirely about her. In other
dialog: news, this is extremely awkward for
dialog: you.
scene_heading: 76 EXT. WATERPARK - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 76
dialog: Duncan is giving Susanna the tour, a la the one he got from
dialog: Owen.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: Okay. Water Wizz Waterpark. It
dialog: was built in the summer of ‘83.
dialog: The creator never wanted the place
text: to change. So, on his death bed,
dialog: he said “The minute someone tries
dialog: to repaint or update the waterpark,
dialog: it needs to be destroyed.”
text: Susanna laughs. Beat.
dialog: 77
dialog: 78
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (off laugh)
dialog: Huh. I didn’t get that joke as
dialog: fast.
text: They pass the SUNBATHING GIRLS on their lounge chairs.
speaker_heading: SUNBATHING GIRL
dialog: (flirty)
dialog: Hey, Pop ‘N Lock.
dialog: They giggle.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (off Susanna)
dialog: Don’t worry about it.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - DAY 77
speaker_heading: A SERIES OF VIGNETTES:
text: - MUSSEL BEACH. Duncan and Susanna lounge by the giant wave
dialog: pool.
text: - LOCKERS. Susanna watches Duncan clean out wet clothes from
text: a abandoned locker.
text: - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE. Duncan and Susanna have lunch at one of
dialog: the picnic tables.
text: - It’s end of day. Park empty. Duncan and Susanna walk
text: around the edge of the RIVER.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE (FRONT) - DAY - LATE AFTERNOON 78
text: Duncan and Susanna are walking their bikes up the driveway.
dialog: (NOTE: The station wagon is NOT in the driveway.)
speaker_heading: STEPH (0.S.)
dialog: Thanks a lot for ditching me,
dialog: bitch.
text: They both look up. Steph is sitting on the front steps.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Oh. I wasn’t aware we had plans.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I wasn’t aware you two had plans.
dialog: 79
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: Sorry, we just...
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: I’ve got a ton of stuff going on in
dialog: my life right now. So, it would
dialog: have been nice to have a friend.
text: Just then, Pam comes out of the screen door. Expectant,
text: hoping to see someone who isn’t there. Realizing it’s just
dialog: the kids...
text: Duncan glances over in the direction Pam had.
text: DUNCAN'S POV of the missing station wagon.
speaker_heading: PAM
text: Dinner’s almost ready.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 79
text: Pam, Duncan and Steph are seated at the dining room table. A
text: whole spread of food, untouched. Duncan looks over at the
text: wall clock. 8:30 PM.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: No use in waiting. Let’s just eat.
text: More silence. Just the sound of UTENSILS CLINKING against
dialog: the plates. Beat.
speaker_heading: PAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (trying to push through)
dialog: So,... How’s Chad, Steph?
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: We broke up.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Oh. I’m sorry.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: (off food)
dialog: This is really good.
text: They continue eating in silence.
dialog: 80
dialog: 81
dialog: 82
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT 80
text: Pam, cleans dishes. Duncan wraps up the uneaten food. Steph
text: approaches Pam, carrying plates. Pam motions for her to set
text: them down. Steph nudges her away, takes over cleaning.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - DUNCAN’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 81
text: Duncan wakes up in bed. Something has stirred him. From
text: DOWNSTAIRS, he hears the front door OPEN. Duncan looks over
text: at the alarm clock. 2:40 AM.
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - STAIRWELL/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS 82
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Duncan descends, softly. Peers around the wall.
text: DUNCAN'S POV of Pam, sitting in a chair, arms crossed.
text: Before her, standing, Trent.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Look, I’m sorry. I was out with
dialog: Kip on his boat all day. And, we
dialog: lost track of time. I would have
dialog: called, but then it was late and I
dialog: didn’t want to wake you.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Just tell me...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ... If there’s something I should
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: What are you talking about...?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Don’t make me feel crazy. I’ve
dialog: been through this. And, I...
text: Trent kneels in front of her. He puts his hand on her face,
text: gently caressing it.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I'm right here. You have me. You
dialog: always have.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We're in this together. Remember?
dialog: 83
dialog: 78.
text: With that, he puts his head in her lap. Duncan heads back up
dialog: the stairs.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Duncan descends the STAIRS, finding Pam placing a large
text: platter of PANCAKES on the table. She seems happy.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (bright)
dialog: Good morning. I’ve already made
dialog: too many pancakes, so I hope you’re
dialog: hungry...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Where was he?
text: Pam pauses. Then, smiles a desperate smile and attends to
dialog: the table.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: He was with Kip. But, he’s here
dialog: now.
text: She exits into the KITCHEN. Duncan turns as Trent, comes
speaker_heading: down the STAIRS.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: (chipper)
dialog: Morning, buddy.
text: Duncan breezes past him.
speaker_heading: TRENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. We don’t say, “Good
dialog: morning?”
text: Duncan locks eyes with him...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Welcome home.
text: .-. And heads outside. Trent hesitates, heads into the
dialog: dining room.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 84
dialog: 79.
scene_heading: EXT. JOAN AND KIP’S HOUSE - NIGHT 84
text: Another party. Full swing. People are dancing. A giant
text: bonfire. Tables, set up in the sand. At one, Trent, Pam,
text: and Steph are eating. Duncan sits at the end of the table,
text: brooding. Betty joins, carrying a PLATE.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: How about this spread, huh? Where
dialog: did Joan find the time to order
dialog: take-out?
text: Betty winks, Pam smiles.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: And if there’s one thing that
dialog: travels really well, it’s fried
dialog: food.
text: Pam and Betty laugh. Trent knows better than to chime in.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: I must get Joan's recipe for Big
dialog: Daddy’s menu.
text: They laugh even harder, toasting Pam. Joan approaches, a
text: little tipsy AND oddly donning a HEAD SCARF a la Pam. Pam’s
text: smile fades.
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: Is everyone having a good time? Oh
dialog: good, you got some food. Pam, I
dialog: don’t know what I was thinking. I
dialog: should of had you cater my party.
text: Pam gives her best pleasant smile, takes a swig of wine.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, at least this way, you’re
dialog: going to have lots of leftovers.
text: Joan gives a forced smile. Betty returns the favor.
speaker_heading: BETTY (CONT'D)
dialog: New look?
speaker_heading: JOAN
dialog: No. Just bad hair day.
text: Then, turning her attention to Trent...
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, Mr. Ramsey, you've been
dialog: avoiding me all night. And, I
dialog: won’t have it. Not tonight.
text: Joan grabs Trent’s arm, playfully trying to pull him up.
speaker_heading: JOAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I said I'd get you on that dance
dialog: floor!
text: Trent resists, but not enough. They head over toward the
dialog: bonfire.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: And, they called me a C-U-N-T.
speaker_heading: STEPH
dialog: You don’t have to keep spelling it.
text: Just then, Kip joins the table, carrying a plate of food.
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: (jokingly)
dialog: Joan found herself a victim, huh?
text: Kip chuckles. That sits like a lead balloon with the group.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Kip, I expect to be inviting myself
dialog: out onto your boat again. When
dialog: should I plan to do that?
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: Ah, the motor’s out of commission.
dialog: It has been all week. And will
dialog: probably be longer until they get
dialog: the parts.
text: Duncan looks right at Pam, as she looks over at Trent and
text: Joan, dancing. Pam’s eyes well up. She stands, her face
text: drained of life, white.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: I think I’m going to grab a
dialog: sweater. Excuse me.
text: She turns and starts to walk away. Duncan stands.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: How much more do you need?
text: Pam stops, but doesn’t turn around.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do something, mom. You know what's
text: happening. He’s sleeping with her.
dialog: Do something about it!
text: The table, silent. Duncan has the attention of the whole
text: party. Trent and Joan, stop dancing.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Duncan,...
text: She starts to walk away again.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Yeah, that’s it! Walk away! It’s
dialog: easier! It’s right in front of
dialog: your face, mom!
text: Trent comes over, grabs Duncan’s arm.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Hey, buddy...
text: Duncan whips around, pulls free of Trent’s grasp.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Let go of me! I’m not talking to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Well, I’m talking to you.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (pointing at Joan)
dialog: Just go screw her, asshole! I
dialog: mean, you have already.
dialog: (points to Pam)
dialog: And, she's certainly not going to
dialog: stop you! Are you, Mom?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: You don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Everybody knows what I’m talking
dialog: about!
text: Trent grabs Duncan by the arms. He breaks free, and pushes
dialog: Trent back. There’s some force there. Trent is definitely
text: thrown off balance, but gets his footing, goes for Duncan
text: again. Just then, Kip steps in between them.
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: KIP
dialog: Whoa, whoa. Trent. Take it easy.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Enough! Both of you! Stop!
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Fine. You don’t want to do
dialog: anything about it? It’s your life,
dialog: but it’s not mine.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I want to be with dad!
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Duncan,...
text: Trent scoffs. Duncan looks at him.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I’m going to live with my father!
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: Your father? Good luck with
dialog: that...
text: Duncan looks a little thrown, confused.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: Trent, don’t...
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: He doesn’t want you, kid.
text: Duncan stricken, looks at Pam.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (pained)
dialog: Duncan...
text: Duncan takes off toward the beach, passing Susanna.
dialog: 82.
dialog: Kip
text: turns to Joan. She sips her wine, and looks right at him.
scene_heading: EXT. JOAN AND KIP’S HOUSE/BEACH - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 85
text: Duncan sits in the sand. Susanna approaches, sits.
text: checks in with him, but his gaze is set on the water.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA
dialog: I told you this place sucks.
dialog: She
dialog: 86
text: Susanna smiles, hoping to break the ice. No luck.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA (CONT’D)
dialog: I talked to my dad today. I told
dialog: him that we had chased ghost crabs.
dialog: It made him very happy. Felt like
dialog: he was here. “Did you tell him
dialog: about the eyes?! You’ve got to
dialog: tell him about their eyes!” He
dialog: gets so excited...
text: Still nothing from Duncan. She pushes on.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA (CONT’D)
dialog: See, their eyes can rotate 360
dialog: degrees. They can see everything
dialog: around them. But, they can’t look
dialog: straight up. Which, makes it easy
dialog: for birds to attack them. So, they
dialog: have to gather food at night for
dialog: safety.
dialog: (then, shrugging)
dialog: I don’t know. My dad finds it
dialog: cool. He’s a dork.
dialog: 83.
text: Finally, Duncan looks at Susanna, who smiles. Impulsively,
text: he leans in, tries to kiss her. Caught off guard, she pulls
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh,...
text: Beat. He tries again.
speaker_heading: SUSANNA (CONT’D)
dialog: Duncan, wait.
text: Duncan jumps up.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: I just wanted... Sorry.
text: He walks off.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH HOUSE - BACK DECK - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 86
text: Duncan rushes toward the STORAGE SHED. On the PORCH, Trent
text: and Pam. Duncan slips under the porch, out of sight.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN'S POV through the SLATS...
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: TRENT
dialog: I’m an asshole. You deserve
dialog: better. But, I can be that. I
dialog: have to be that. Come on, I need
dialog: you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We need each other.
text: He reaches for her hand. She makes a fist. Unwelcome.
dialog: That said, she doesn’t walk away. Duncan’s seen enough. He
text: scurries under the house, bumping into...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Where are you going?
text: Duncan, startled, jumps. Peter is there, holding some action
dialog: figures.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: ... Shut up, Peter...
text: ANGLE ON Pam/Trent, looking in their direction.
speaker_heading: PAM
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: --. Duncan?
text: She starts to move toward the SIDE OF THE DECK.
text: ANGLE ON Duncan and Peter, moving along underneath.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Take me with you.
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No. I...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: Please!
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: PAM (0.S.)
dialog: Duncan...
text: Duncan hears Pam’s footsteps above them, approaching.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’l1l scream.
dialog: 87
dialog: 88
dialog: 89
dialog: 85.
text: Duncan grapples, then...
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER 87
text: Duncan rides his bike. Peter, sits on the handlebars,
text: smiling ear to ear.
scene_heading: EXT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - NIGHT - LATER 88
text: Duncan and Peter approach. Duncan’s surprised to see a few
text: CARS in the parking lot. There are lights on in the Employee
text: Lounge. MUSIC from inside. Duncan and Peter scale the
text: fence. Roddy and a group of GIRLS walk up, carrying cases of
text: beer. He opens one side of the gate.
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: Or, you could just try opening the
dialog: gate.
dialog: Off Duncan’s look,...
scene_heading: EXT./INT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LAT#R
text: Roddy enters, followed by Duncan/Peter, surveying the party.
text: The boys definitely stick out as the rest of the room is
dialog: certainly of age. As for the decorations, minimal. Some
text: strung up LIGHTS. FURNITURE has been pushed to the sides to
dialog: make room for a dance floor.
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: (to Room)
dialog: Be cool. Our boss is here and his
dialog: pirate friend.
text: ANGLE ON Owen with Partygoers. He heads over.
text: Peter noticing a COOLER. Grabs a couple BEERS.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hell, yeah. I could use a
dialog: cleansing ale.
text: Just then, Owen intercepts, taking the beers.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Or, check them out from afar.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’ve thrown a few back before.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Yeah, and I’ve spent a night in
dialog: jail before. There’s a limit for
dialog: everything.
dialog: (to Duncan)
dialog: What’s your friend’s name?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Peter.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Nice eye patch.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: You don’t sound too cool with it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: My mom makes me wear it. She says
dialog: my eye confuses people.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Oh, well now you have to show me.
text: Peter takes it off.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Wait, she wants you to hide that?
dialog: Is she insane? I’d kill to have
dialog: that eye.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You’re full of shit.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Seriously. You know how many bits
dialog: I could do with it? Daring people
dialog: to look me straight in the eye?
dialog: That thing’s awesome.
text: Peter beams. Then, something catches his attention...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (way too excited)
dialog: No way! Pizza and chicken wings!
dialog: (ALT: Mind if I mingle?)
text: He takes off. Owen checks in with Duncan, who seems out of
dialog: sorts.
dialog: 90
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: So... What’s up, my man?
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: You're having a party?
text: There’s an air of disappointment in Duncan’s voice. Owen
dialog: senses it.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: It’s a farewell for Lewis. Guess
dialog: he was serious this time.
text: Duncan nods. Beat.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT’D)
dialog: «+. Did you need to talk to me?
dialog: Duncan considers, but...
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: Nah. Just wanted to hang out.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (considers, then)
dialog: How about we say you hang out for a
dialog: little bit? Okay? I’m sure you’1l
dialog: be wanted home at some point.
text: Duncan nods. Owen can tell he’s not himself. He puts his
text: hand on Duncan’s shoulder, walks him over to the rest of the
speaker_heading: GANG.
scene_heading: INT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER 90
text: PARTYGOERS/EMPLOYEES are dancing. Duncan grabs three pieces
text: of pizza off a TABLE. We STEADY CAM as he shuffles through
text: the “dance floor,” passing Peter, who’s thrashing around.
text: Peter has quite a bit of CHICKEN WING sauce on his face.
text: Peter tries to “grind” up on Caitlin. She politely pushes
dialog: him away.
text: We continue to STEADY CAM over to Lewis, opening GIFTS.
text: Duncan hands pieces of pizza to Owen and Roddy. Lewis holds
text: up a POOL LEAF SKIMMER with a giant BOW tied around it.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Owen, you shouldn’t have.
speaker_heading: A90
speaker_heading: B90
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: Hey. I went to three different
dialog: places in the waterpark to find
dialog: that. You can use it to catch
dialog: thunder clouds.
text: Peter dances by, BEER in hand. Without missing a beat, Owen
text: takes that one from him, too. Duncan plants himself down
dialog: between Roddy and Owen. He’s one of the guys.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER A90
text: Duncan, Owen, Caitlin, and Roddy lounge on the COUCHES.
text: Caitlin, a little tipsy, starts making up a song about “Water
text: Wizz.” Roddy goads, encouraging her.
text: ANGLE ON OWEN/DUNCAN. Duncan glances at Owen, who’s enjoying
text: the fact that Caitlin is center stage and having fun again.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WATERPARK - EMPLOYEE LOUNGE - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER B90
text: Owen stands up on his desk.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (to Room)
dialog: Alright, I think we need to hear a
dialog: few parting words from our guest of
dialog: honor...
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: No, no...
text: The crowd goads. Owen glances at Roddy, conspiratorially.
text: Roddy, taking the cue, nudges Duncan.
speaker_heading: RODDY
dialog: (to Duncan, conspicuously)
dialog: You want to be part of a tradition?
text: Duncan nods. They cross off.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: (to Owen)
dialog: I’m not opening myself up to some
dialog: bit.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: No, no. You've been a good friend.
dialog: We're going to miss you. Plain and
dialog: simple. That’s no bit.
text: Lewis takes a moment.
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: Well,... I won’t say that I won’t
dialog: totally miss some aspects of this
dialog: place. It wasn’t completely void
dialog: of decent times. I remember a
dialog: couple of days that stick out as
dialog: almost memorable.
dialog: (beat, then genuine)
dialog: I guess if there’s one thing I will
dialog: miss dearly, it’s...
text: Just then, a very powerful STREAM OF WATER nails Lewis right
text: in the face.
text: ANGLE ON DUNCAN, armed with a major POWER SOAKER water gun.
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: (disbelief)
dialog: Duncan,...?!
speaker_heading: DUNCAN
dialog: (deer in headlights)
dialog: It’s... part of a tradition...
speaker_heading: OWEN
dialog: What kind of warped tradition is
dialog: that?!
text: Duncan glances over at Roddy, catching him grinning.
dialog: Duncan’s been duped.
speaker_heading: OWEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lewis was pouring his heart out...
speaker_heading: LEWIS
dialog: I was going to say “people.” I’11
dialog: miss the people...
text: Suddenly, Lewis is nailed again in the face.
text: ANGLE ON RODDY, now armed with a SOAKER as well.
speaker_heading: LEWIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously! My doctor said not to
dialog: get water on my face...!
text: He’s nailed AGAIN.
dialog: c90
dialog: 90.
text: ANGLE ON CAITLIN, now armed herself. Lewis, fed up, goes for
dialog: Caitlin’s soaker. She relents. And, with that... A free for
