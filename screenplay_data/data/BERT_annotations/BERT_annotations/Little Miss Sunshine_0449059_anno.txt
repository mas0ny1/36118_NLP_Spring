speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Olive)
dialog: So what do you think your chances are?
text: Olive takes the question like a pro.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: I think I can win. ‘Cause a lot of
dialog: the new girls -- they don’t have
dialog: the experience.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, good luck.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It’s not about luck. Luck is the
dialog: name that losers give to their own
dialog: failings. It’s about wanting to
dialog: win. Willing yourself to win. You
dialog: got to want it badder than anyone.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: I do!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Do you? Really?
dialog: (a beat; she nods)
dialog: Then you’re gonna be a winner!

speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Yeah. Did you hear what it was?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Actually, it was something about
dialog: Little Miss Sunshine.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: What? Little Miss Sunshine? What?!

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY

text: BEEEP. Over the above, Olive reacts with involuntary spasms
text: of shock, disbelief, and then pure, unadulterated euphoria.

speaker_heading: OLIVE
text: Aaahhhhhhh!!! Aaahhhhhhhhhhhhh! !!

speaker_heading: OLIVE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m finished!
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Apparently, the girl who won

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: When are they?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: I’m calling Jeff right... Jeff!

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, I guess we can’t go then! I

speaker_heading: GRANDPA

speaker_heading: GRANDPA

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: What am I, an idiot?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Me?! I’m old! You get to be my
dialog: age -- you’re crazy not to do it.
text: Frank looks at Sheryl -- You're letting this happen?
text: waves her hands, exasperated.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: We’ve tried, believe me! He's
dialog: worse than a two year old. The
dialog: intervention was a fiasco.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Can we please talk about something
dialog: else now?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So I take it you didn’t like it at
dialog: Sunset Village?
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Are you kidding? Fucking paradise
dialog: there! They cook for you. Clean
dialog: for you. You got golf. A pool.
dialog: Now I’m stuck with Mr. Happy here,

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Aren’t there other places?
speaker_heading: SHERYL

speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Motherfuckers,

dialog: Hey, listen: I know you’re a homo, but...
dialog: You go to one of these places? There’s
dialog: four women for every guy. What does that
dialog: say to you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You must’ve been pretty busy.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Oh, man. They were knockin’ on my door
dialog: day and night! It was almost too much!
dialog: If I didn’t have those little fuckin’ blue
dialog: pills... Forget about it!
text: Olive sees Frank grinning at Grandpa. She takes off her
text: headphones and’ turns around.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: What are you guys talking about?
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Politics.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Oh.
text: A beat. She puts her headphones back on.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: (to Dwayne)
dialog: Fuck a lot of women, kid. I got no
dialog: reason to lie to you. Not just one
dialog: woman. A lot of women.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - pay

speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Mom, how much can we spend?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: I'd say four dollars. Anything

text: Olive nods. A WAITRESS arrives.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Hi, you ready?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah. Number five. And coffee.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Number seven, over easy. And
text: grapefruit juice.
speaker_heading: PRANK

speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: The Lumberjack. Coffee. Extra

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Dad...
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard, don’t start...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: He’s gonna kill himself...!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: It‘s his life.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Thank you, Sheryl.
text: She shrugs. Dwayne holds up his note pad.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Garden salad? And you?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Um... Sorry! I’m sorry!
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Take your time...!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don’t apologize, Olive. It’s a
text: sign of weakness.
text: Frank rolls his eyes. Olive sees something.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Oh, oh! I want waffles. And...
dialog: what does “A la mod-ee” mean?
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: It means it comes with ice-cream,
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Okay! A la mod-ee!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Olive. For breakfast?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: You said, “Four dollars”!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Okay, fine. You’re right.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okay! Be right back!
text: She departs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Actually, Olive...? “A la mode” in French
text: translates literally as “in the fashion”.
dialog: A...la...mode. Mode is derived from the
dialog: Latin “modus”, meaning due or proper
dialog: measure. ‘There's kind of a funny story
dialog: about...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: Frank...? Shut up.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard...!
text: Frank waves Sheryl off: don’t bother. Richard turns to Olive.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Olive, can I tell you something
dialog: about ice-cream?
dialog: (she nods)
dialog: Ice cream is made from cream, which
dialog: comes from cow’s milk. And cream
dialog: has a lot of fat in it...
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What? “She’s gonna find out
dialog: anyway.” Right?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Find out what?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, when you eat ice-cream, the
text: fat in the ice-cream becomes fat on
dialog: your body...
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard, I swear to God...!
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: What? What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Nothing, honey. Nothing’s wrong.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So if you eat lots of ice-cream,
dialog: you’re gonna become big and fat.
dialog: But if you don’t, you'll probably
dialog: stay nice and skinny.
text: Sheryl puts her head in her hands.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Olive, Richard’s an idiot. I like
text: a woman with meat on her bones.
text: Olive is confused.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: I don‘t... Mom! Why is everyone
dialog: so upset?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: I’m not upset, honey. I just want
dialog: you to understand: It’s okay to be
dialog: skinny, and it’s okay to be fat, if
dialog: that’s how you want to be.
dialog: Whatever you want -- it’s okay.
text: Richard rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, but, Olive, let me ask you: the
dialog: women in Miss America...? Are they
dialog: skinny, or are they fat?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Well... They're skinny, I guess.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay! So they probably don’t eat a
dialog: lot of ice-cream. Do they?
text: Just then, the waitress arrives with a tray.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okay: Coffee, coffee, grapefruit,
dialog: chamomile. And here’s your ice-
dialog: cream. A la mod-ee, right? I'll
dialog: have your waffles in a sec!
text: She departs. Olive stares at the ice-cream. Finally:
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Does anyone want my ice-cream?
text: Sheryl just closes her eyes. Grandpa jumps in.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: Yeah, I'll have a bite. You mind?
dialog: Dwayne? Frank? Olive’s giving
dialog: away her ice-cream here.
text: Dwayne and Frank quickly snap to.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You mind if I have a little?
text: Olive shakes her head. Frank and Dwayne dig in. Even Sheryl
text: gets in on the act. Richard is not amused.
speaker_heading: GRANDPA
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: Boy, this is good ice-cream! I
dialog: feel sorry for the people at this
dialog: table who aren’t enjoying delicious
text: ice-cream early in the morning.
dialog: Olive, you're not givin’ away all
dialog: your ice-cream? What about your
dialog: waffles? You can’t eat waffles
dialog: without the ice-cream! You'll have
dialog: lonely waffles in your stomach!
dialog: C'mon, have a bite.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Wait. Don’t take it all! Stop!
text: Olive picks up her spoon, fights them off. She takes a bite.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Olive...
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard. ..!
text: She glares at him, ferocious. Richard shuts up.
dialog: D4.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Stan! Richard! Look, I know you’re
dialog: busy, but we’re dying to hear what
dialog: kind of numbers you came up with in
dialog: Atlanta. Call when you can.
text: He clicks off as Sheryl, Olive and the others exit the diner.
text: They trudge across the parking lot to the VW van.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: You get him?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I can't get a signal out.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: How long ‘til we get there?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: A long time.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: I know, but...how, long?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We're doing six hundred miles
dialog: today, and two hundred tomorrow.
dialog: It's a lot of driving.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Honey, I‘1ll drive a while.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, it’s okay...
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, you're right. I gotta learn to
dialog: do this. I mean, you’re doing it.
dialog: How hard can it be?
scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - PARKED - DAY
text: Sheryl is trying to back up the bus. She’s grinding gears.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Push the stick down hard!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: I‘m pushing hard!
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Put the clutch in all the way!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: It's on the floor!
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
text: Richard tries. He keeps grinding gears as well. It’sa
text: horrible sound.
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE STATION GARAGE ~ DAY
text: Richard and Sheryl talk to a MECHANIC.
text: Behind them, Olive and Grandpa are playing that game where
dialog: you try to slap the other person’s wrists. When Grandpa gets
text: hit, he reacts with cries of pain -- much to Olive’s delight.
text: In the background, across the lot, Dwayne and Frank sit on a
text: cinderblock wall, waiting for the situation to resolve itself.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Well, you got a problem. Your
text: clutch is shot.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Can we get a new one?
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Well, I tell you what: These old
dialog: buses? We’d have to order it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How long’d that take?
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Well, it’s the weekend, so...
dialog: Maybe Thursday?
text: Richard and Sheryl react.
scene_heading: EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY
text: Frank and Dwayne sit silently. Dwayne watches bitterly --
text: this is just one more fiasco he’s been dragged into.
text: Frank looks on wistfully as Sheryl -- thirty yards away --
text: glances worriedly between Richard and the Mechanic. Frank
text: notices Dwayne’s stare. He speaks without looking at Dwayne.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t know if you know this, but
dialog: growing up?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Your Mom was the cool one. She
dialog: turned me on to Proust. She
dialog: could’ve done anything.
text: Dwayne looks at Frank -~- he can’t quite believe this. He
text: takes out his pad, half-smirking, and writes:
dialog: “What happened?”
text: Frank looks at the pad, then at Dwayne.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: She had you, Dwayne.
text: He pats Dwayne on the leg, gets up, and walks back towards
text: Richard and Sheryl. Dwayne is left alone, taking this in.
scene_heading: INT. SERVICE STATION GARAGE - DAY
text: Frank wanders in as Richard presses the Mechanic. Grandpa
text: and Olive stop their game and join the conversation.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, look: we’ve come two hundred
dialog: miles... Is there a dealership
dialog: around here?
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Well, you could call over to
dialog: Clarksville, but they’re probably
dialog: closed. Y’know, it’s the weekend.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yes, we're all aware of that.
text: Silence. The Mechanic feels bad for them. Dwayne re-enters.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Well, I tell you what: these old
dialog: buses? You don’t need a clutch to
dialog: shift from third to fourth. You
dialog: just ease up on the gas. You only
dialog: really need the clutch for first
dialog: and second.
text: Richard doesn’t understand what he’s getting at.
speaker_heading: MECHANIC (cont’d)
dialog: What I’m sayin’ is: as long as you
dialog: keep parkin’ on a hill, you get
dialog: yourself goin’ fifteen, twenty
dialog: miles an hour, and you just start
dialog: up in third. Then you shift
dialog: between third and fourth.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: And you can drive like that?
speaker_heading: MECHANIC
dialog: Oh, yeah. The problem's just
dialog: getting up that speed up. As long
dialog: as you keep parkin’ it on a hill,
dialog: you're fine. My brother and I once
dialog: drove from here to Canada...
speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: No one bought it. Now, I know the
dialog: market. It’s time to move on.
dialog: You’re not gonna win this one.
text: Richard stares at Stan, absorbing this. Then he speaks with
text: a strained nonchalance, nodding and smiling.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay...! Good! I’m glad. You
dialog: know why? This is what the Nine
dialog: Steps are all about...
dialog: *
speaker_heading: STAN GROSSMAN
dialog: Richard! Jesus...!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Vou blew ie, stan. = Vouc out.
text: Richard turns and walks off. Stan can’t believe it. He
text: watches Richard, shakes his head and re-enters the hotel.
text: Richard strides to the moped, looks both ways, climbs on and
text: pedals furiously. The moped sputters to life.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Richard, grim, rides his borrowed moped along the breakdown
text: lane as cars and trucks ROAR past him.
text: This is -- hands down -- the worst moment of his life.
text: Then there’s a FLASH of lightning and a CLAP of thunder. It
text: starts to rain. Richard keeps riding.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
text: A darkened motel room. We hear the WHINE of the moped as it
text: pulls into the parking lot and up to the door.
text: The door opens and Richard -- dazed, soaking wet -- steps in.
text: He closes the door behind him, walks over, lies on the bed --
text: fully clothed -- and stares up at the ceiling.
text: Sheryl, sleeping, wakes up and sees Richard.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Y’ okay?
text: He nods. Sheryl rubs his arm, rolls over, goes back to
text: sleep. Richard stares up at the ceiling.
scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK
speaker_heading: OLIVE (V.0O.)
dialog: Dad...?
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN
text: Richard opens his eyes. Olive is standing next to the bed.
text: The blue light of dawn is coming through the windows.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What is it, hon...?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Grandpa won't wake up.
dialog: 30.
text: Richard takes this in.
scene_heading: EXT. AMBULANCE ROOF - DAY
text: We are behind the lights of an ambulance as it speeds down a
text: commercial strip. The LIGHTS FLASH and SIREN BLARES.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Everyone sits silently in a waiting room, waiting for news.
text: Olive, bored, goes through a rack of medical flyers. She
dialog: takes one
dialog: She takes
text: and approaches Dwayne.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: You want to take an eye test?
dialog: (Dwayne shakes his head)
dialog: Uncle Frank? You want to take an
dialog: eye test?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Olive, come here. Put that away.
dialog: We're gonna have a family meeting.
dialog: Dwayne? Family meeting.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What? Now?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard...! Let's just do it.
text: a breath. She turns to the kids.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont‘d)
dialog: First of all, the doctors are doing
dialog: everything they can to help Grandpa right
dialog: now. He’s had a long...
dialog: (searches for words)
dialog: .. eventful life, and I know he
dialog: loves both of you very much. But
dialog: if God wants to take him, we have
dialog: to be ready to accept that, okay?
dialog: (they nod)
dialog: Now, I think you guys know we’ve been
dialog: having money problems lately, with
dialog: Richard’s venture and everything...
dialog: iThings haven’t really gone the way we
dialog: hoped. So it looks like when we get home
dialog: we might have to make some changes in the
dialog: way we live. We might have to move out of
dialog: our house. We might have to declare
dialog: bankruptcy. I don’t know. TI have to talk
dialog: to a lawyer about all that.
text: She looks at Richard, the kids. Her voice becomes shaky.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont'd)
dialog: But whatever happens -- we’re a
dialog: family. What’s important is that
dialog: we love each other. I love you
dialog: guys so, so, so much...
text: She turns away, starts to cry. Frank puts his hand on her
text: shoulder. Sheryl grasps it. Olive and Dwayne watch Sheryl.
text: Dwayne writes a note, shows it to Olive. It reads:
dialog: “Go hug Mom!”
text: Olive goes and hugs Sheryl. Sheryl, crying, picks up Olive
text: and holds her in her lap, hugging her. Dwayne gets up, goes
text: across the waiting room and stares out the window.
text: OUT THE WINDOW
text: A second floor view. It’s a banal suburban landscape. Cars
text: go busily back and forth on a distant road.
text: Dwayne just stares out the window with a blank face. Behind
text: him, a DOCTOR enters the waiting area.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Are you the family of Edwin Harvey?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Everyone is gathered in a smaller room. The Doctor closes
text: the door behind him. He turns to face them.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: I'm sorry. We did everything we
dialog: could. He was... It was too much.
dialog: He probably fell asleep and never
dialog: woke up. I’11 have someone come
dialog: talk about handling the remains.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thank you. Appreciate it.
text: The Doctor opens the door and calls down the hall.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Linda,..!
text: He gestures, then departs. Silence.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Is Grandpa dead?
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Yeah, honey. He’s passed away.
text: Olive nods, says nothing.
text: A hospital administrator, LINDA, comes in with a sheaf of
text: papers. She is overburdened and all business.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm your bereavement liaison, Linda. My
dialog: consolations for your loss.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thank you, Linda.
text: Linda hands Richard her sheaf of paperwork.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (fast, indifferent)
dialog: Okay. These are the forms you need
dialog: to fill out -- death certificate,
dialog: report of death and the M.E. pink
dialog: slip. Try and be as detailed as
dialog: possible. This is a brochure for
dialog: our Grief Recovery Support Group
dialog: that meets Tuesdays. If you’d
dialog: like, I can refer you at this time
dialog: to a funeral home so you can begin
dialog: making arrangements.
text: Richard and Sheryl glance at each other.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Um, actually, pre-arrangements have
dialog: been made with a home in Maryland.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: In Maryland...?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Yeah, we’re passing through. Y'see, we're
dialog: trying to get to Boca Raton...
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Okay -- if the body is crossing
dialog: state lines? You’re gonna need a
dialog: Burial Transit Permit from the
dialog: County Registrar...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, fine, but here’s the thing --
dialog: we're trying to get to Boca Raton
dialog: by three o’clock this afternoon...
dialog: Dy.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Three o’clock? Today?
dialog: (checks her watch)
dialog: That ain’t gonna happen.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It's for my daughter. This is
dialog: really important.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: It may be important, but you still
dialog: have to fill out this paperwork.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, I know this is unusual... Is there
dialog: a way we can go and come back? I mean,
dialog: can we do paperwork later?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You can’t abandon the body...
speaker_heading: RICHARD LINDA
dialog: I'm not gonna abandon the ...Otherwise the hospital
dialog: body. I just want to go and becomes responsible... Sir,
dialog: come back.
dialog: We just need to there’s a way these things
dialog: get to Boca and then we’1l need to be done. Sir?
dialog: come back!
dialog: Silence.
dialog: We'll come back! Sir...? Sir!!!
speaker_heading: LINDA (cont’d)
dialog: Sir, this may surprise you, but you’re not
dialog: the only one who’s had someone die here
dialog: today, all right?! Now we have a way of
dialog: doing things around here, and I‘m gonna
dialog: ask you to respect our rules and
dialog: procedures!
text: Richard stares at the floor, seething. A pause.
text: Richard speaks with great restraint.
dialog: She leads
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Could you...? Is there a way we could
dialog: view the remains?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (nods, also restrained)
dialog: I’1l show you, yes. We haven’t had
dialog: a chance to move him downstairs.
dialog: them out.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Linda stops in front of an intensive care room.
dialog: a a ae
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He’s in here. Now someone may come
dialog: by in a few minutes to take him to
dialog: the basement, but just tell them
dialog: who you are. They’1l wait.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: When you’re done with the paperwork
dialog: I'll be in the nurse’s station.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay. Great. Thank you, Linda.
text: She departs.
scene_heading: INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM - DAY
text: They enter. It’s quiet. There’s a body under a sheet.
text: Richard walks over and peers under it, then puts it down.
text: He turns away and faces the wall. He starts hyperventilating
text: -- choking down the emotion. He doesn’t want to lose
text: control, and he’s not comfortable showing his feelings.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Goddam it, Dad. Goddamn it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Stupid, stupid, stupid...!!!
text: He shakes his head and takes a few sharp breaths, getting
text: himself under control -- still facing the wall.
text: Sheryl hugs Olive, stroking her hair. Olive is dry-eyed --
text: this is all new to her. Sheryl bends down and whispers:
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: We'll do Little Miss Sunshine next
dialog: year. Okay, honey? Next year.
text: Olive nods. No one says anything. Finally, Richard turns
text: around. He is very determined.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No. We’ve come seven hundred miles. I/’11
dialog: be dammed if I’m not making that contest.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Honey... We can’t leave him!
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We’re not going to leave him.
text: Richard dumps the paperwork in a wastebasket. He opens the
text: door, glances into the hallway. He closes the door.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont’d)
dialog: Fuck. ..!
text: He looks desperately around the room. He sees the window.
text: He goes to the window, opens it up.
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Richard peers out the window. He’s at the back side of the
text: building, seven or eight feet above a near-empty parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM - DAY
text: Richard ducks back in. He tosses his car keys to Dwayne.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Dwayne. Go around outside.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard... What are you thinking?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We'll take him with us.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, Richard. No. That’s not going
dialog: to happen. *
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: He’s better off with us than with these
dialog: people!
dialog: (to Dwayne)
dialog: Go under the window. Frank, you go with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Dwayne, don’t you dare!
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: Look: you stay here. We’1ll take
dialog: Olive. Frank’1l drive!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We’1l be there in two hours! I/‘1l
dialog: have a funeral home meet us as soon
dialog: as we arrive!
dialog: {never say die:)
dialog: Listen, everyone.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: oz.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: If there’s one thing Grandpa
dialog: would've wanted, it’s to have Olive
dialog: perform at the Little Miss Sunshine
dialog: pageant. I believe we’d be doing a
dialog: grave disservice to his memory if
dialog: we gave up now. There’s two kinds
dialog: of people in the world: winners and
dialog: losers. And what’s the difference?
dialog: Winners don’t give up. So what are
dialog: we here? Are we winners? Or
dialog: losers?
speaker_heading: CcuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: Richard peeks out the window.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, ready?
text: Frank, Dwayne, Sheryl and Olive stand under the window,
text: trying to look inconspicuous. Frank gestures -- Wait.
text: Across the lot, two NURSES stroll toward the hospital.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not yet... Not yet...
text: The Nurses pass out of sight.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: Okay -- go, go, go!
text: Richard disappears for a second, then reappears with a big
text: bundle wrapped in a sheet. He hoists it into the window.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Careful... Careful...
text: He edges the bundle off the window ledge. Frank and Dwayne
text: gently lower the bundle to the ground. They glance around.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay! Here we go! One, two...
text: Frank, Dwayne, Sheryl and Olive lift the bundle together and
text: scuttle across the parking lot to the VW bus fifty feet away.
text: An ELDERLY COUPLE walking fifty yards away observes them.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: Be cool. Be cool. Almost there.
text: They arrive at the bus.
dialog: 63.
text: Dwayne whips open the VW’s back door (a hatchback that hides
text: your luggage) and they hoist the bundle in. Frank slams the
text: door closed. Richard comes sprinting into the parking lot.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay Vetus roll You ready.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Any time, Rich!
text: Richard starts up the bus, gets out and helps them push.
text: They get the bus rolling. The lot is at a slight incline,
text: which helps. Finally, Richard jumps behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, I’m putting it into gear...!
text: Sheryl and Olive jump in the side door.
text: Frank and Dwayne run behind the bus, pushing like crazy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Did I mention I’m the pre-eminent
dialog: Proust scholar in the US?
text: Richard REVS the engine and puts it in third. The bus begins
text: picking up speed. Dwayne and Frank sprint along side.
text: This time, Dwayne is prepared to push Frank up along-side the
text: bus. Frank lunges in. Dwayne jumps in after him.
scene_heading: INT. VW BUS ~ DAY
text: Dwayne slides the door shut. They’re giddy and breathless
text: from the escape. They quickly sober up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, what time is it?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: (checks her watch)
text: It’s 11:30. How much further...?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I dunno. ‘Two hundred miles...?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And when does registration end?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
text: Three o'clock.
dialog: They do the math.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's gonna be close.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No, we'll make it. We just can’t
dialog: stop. No one has to pee, right?
text: Olive is thinking.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Dad? What’s gonna happen to Grandpa?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Honey, aS soon as we get to
dialog: Florida, I’m gonna call a funeral
dialog: home in Maryland and they’1l take
dialog: care of everything. Your Grandpa
dialog: was smart and planned ahead. Okay?
text: Olive nods. That’s not really what she was asking about.
text: Sheryl sees this.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Honey, Grandpa’s soul is in Heaven
dialog: now. He’s with God. Okay?
text: Olive nods. She turns and looks out the window.
text: OUT THE WINDOW
text: . The passing landscape of the road leading back to the

text: The dialogue below plays over the following shots.
text: The family drives in silence, each looking out the window.
text: Richard drives -- stoic, determined.
text: Sheryl is pensive. She sneaks glances at Richard.
text: Frank, subdued, watches Sheryl. He rubs Olive on the head.
text: Olive, headphones around her neck, stares out the window.
text: Dwayne lies across the back seat, staring up.
text: DWAYNE’S POV -- Passing power lines undulate against the sky.
text: From the back, we see the highway passing as each person is
text: lost in a reverie.
text: Sheryl, in the front, looks at Richard, reaches over and rubs
text: Richard's neck. Richard glances at her, keeps driving.
speaker_heading: OLIVE (0.S.)
dialog: Uncle Frank? Does everyone get to
dialog: go to Heaven?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: That’s an excellent question,
dialog: Olive. Actually, the Hindus
dialog: believe that you get as many lives
dialog: as you want. Buddhists believe
dialog: that you live many lives but at a
dialog: certain point you reach Nirvana and
text: cross the finish line. Christians
dialog: believe you only get one life --
dialog: they don’t believe in do-overs.
speaker_heading: OLIVE (0.S.)
dialog: What do you believe?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: I dunno. I haven’t made my mind
dialog: up. What about you?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: I think everyone goes to Heaven.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY

speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Sixty one miles. What time is it?
text: Frank checks his watch.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Five of two...!

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We'll make it! Don’t worry!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: We’re cutting it close...
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It’s not even close! We'll be...
text: A car cuts in front of him. He brakes.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont'd)
dialog: Look out! Asshole!
text: He HONKS the horn loudly at the guy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: He cut me off!
text: The horn keeps HONKING intermittently.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Okay. You can stop now.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It’s not me! This thing is stuck.
text: He tries to pull the horn button up. Instead, he gets a long
text: continuous HOOOONK. He lets go. It stops.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Okay, just leave it...!
text: Silence. Then a HONK. Another silence. HONK, HONK.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont’d)
dialog: Maybe if you pull it from...

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Just leave it, okay? We‘ll fix it
dialog: when we get to Boca!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Okay, fine!
text: Silence. HONK! Silence. HONK! HONK! Silence. Dwayne
text: puts his head in his hands. He can’t stand it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How many days ‘til you enlist?
text: Dwayne pulls out his pad and writes. He shows it:
dialog: 623”
text: Frank contemplates this.
speaker_heading: . FRANK (cont ‘d)
dialog: Maybe I can adopt you.

scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The van, its horn BLARING, cruises past a State Trooper

scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY
text: Richard sees the lights in the rear-view mirror.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Oh, Jesus! I’m being pulled over!
dialog: Everybody: act normal, okay?. Like
dialog: everything is normal. Here we go...
text: He pulls onto the breakdown lane and stops. The HORN
text: continues HONKING intermittently. The Trooper, a 50-ish good
text: ol’ boy, gets out and approaches.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: How’re you folks doin’ today?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Fine! Doin’ fine!
speaker_heading: (HONK)
dialog: Sorry!

speaker_heading: RICHARD

speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Would you step out of your vehicle?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY ~ DAY
text: The Trooper gestures towards
text: Reluctantly, Richard gets out.
text: the back of the van.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Would you step this way?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No...1
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Don't...!
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Don’t what?
text: Richard shuts up. The Trooper sees him glance at the trunk.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: You have something in your trunk?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: No! Nothing! There’s nothing. It’s
dialog: just... Don’t open it.
text: The Trooper is incredulous.
dialog: oy.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Sir, you realize you’ve just given
dialog: me probable cause to search your
dialog: trunk? Put your hands on top of
dialog: your vehicle. Now don’t move.
text: He shakes his head and walks back towards the trunk.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Please! It’s not illegal, it’s...
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Sir, I’d advise you to keep your

scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - DAY
text: Everyone surreptitiously watches the Trooper.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Oh no, what’s he doing?!
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: Richard watches the Trooper walk around the back of the bus

text: The Trooper opens the trunk.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Whoa! Goddamn!!!
text: Richard opens his eyes, shakes his head -- this is the end.
speaker_heading: TROOPER
dialog: Six, would you come here?
text: Richard walks back. The Trooper bends down behind the bus.
text: Rounding the corner, Richard sees the Trooper picking up
text: Grandpa’s porn magazines, which have spilled onto the road.
text: The bundled sheet sits in plain sight. The Trooper,
text: distracted, gathers the magazines and stands. He grins.
speaker_heading: TROOPER (cont'd)
dialog: Don’t worry, I ain’t gonna bust you.
text: He looks in the bus, smiles and waves at Sheryl and Olive.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - DAY
text: Everyone in the bus -- minds blown -- waves back.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY ~ DAY
text: The Trooper tidies the magazines and, grinning, shuffles
text: through them with a connoisseur’s eye -- Swank, High Society,
text: Black Tail. The next magazine: Honcho.
text: A beefy, moustached stud gazes smolderingly from the cover.
text: The Trooper stops grinning. He looks at Richard. Richard
text: shrugs and laughs nervously.
scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - DAY
text: As the Trooper’s cruiser pulls back onto the highway,
text: Richard walks to the front, climbs in, slams the door.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: What happened?!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (steely)
dialog: I’1l1 tell you when I regain
dialog: consciousness.
dialog: (starts the car)
dialog: Frank. Dwayne. Get out and push.
scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD ~ DAY
text: They are cruising. The horn HONKS in occasional spurts.
text: Everyone ignores it. Olive plays with an eye chart she got
text: at the hospital. She points at a diminishing set of “E”s
text: Dwayne is in the back seat, holding a hand over one eye and
text: pointing his finger up, down, or Sideways to correspond to
text: the rotation of the “EB”, Dwayne makes it through the chart.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: 20/20 vision! Mom, Dwayne has
dialog: 20/20 vision!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: I bet he does.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Okay, further back!

speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Boca Raton! Forty six!

text: Frank checks his watch.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: hes coor |
text: Sheryl looks at Richard, who steps on the gas.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We'll make it, okay?! Maybe a few
text: minutes late.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, Richard...! They said three
dialog: o‘clock sharp! -They were very
dialog: explicit. You don’t want to fuck
dialog: with these people. Trust me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know where it is?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: The Holiday Inn. She said it’s just off
dialog: the highway. You can’t miss it.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: She better be right.
text: In the back, Olive pulls out a new flyer.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Okay, now I’m gonna test if you’re
dialog: colorblind. What letter is in the
dialog: circle?
text: She holds up a chart with a green circle. Inside the circle,
text: in a mosaic pattern, is a bright red letter “A”. Dwayne
text: makes a gesture, “There's nothing there.”
speaker_heading: OLIVE (cont’d)
dialog: No, inside the circle! Right there!
text: Dwayne shakes his head again. Olive glances at Frank.
speaker_heading: OLIVE (cont’d)
dialog: It’s an “A”! Can’t you see it?!
dialog: It’s red! See? Right there!
text: Dwayne takes the chart and stares at it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You can’t see the “A”? It’s bright
dialog: red. Can you see the difference
dialog: between the green and the red?
text: Dwayne shakes his head helplessly. Frank turns away.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont‘d)
dialog: Oh, man.
text: Dwayne looks at him. He pulls out his pad and writes:
dialog: “What?”
text: Frank doesn’t say anything. Dwayne points violently at the
text: pad. Frank looks at him. Quietly:
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
dialog: Dwayne. I think you’re colorblind.
text: Dwayne doesn’t understand. He points at the pad again.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: You can’t fly jets in the Navy if
dialog: you're colorblind.
text: Dwayne does nothing. Then he seems to implode in on himself,
text: curling up in a ball. Frank shouts towards the front.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: Rich, pull over!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We have an emergency back here!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just pull over!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What’s the emergency?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sheryl, will you make him pull over?!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard...!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We’re gonna be late if...
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard!!!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I'm pulling over, okay?! I’m
dialog: pulling over!
dialog: 73.
text: He puts on the clicker.
scene_heading: EXT, SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE - DAY
text: The bus pulls into the break-down lane beside the highway.
text: The door slides open and Dwayne gets out onto the grassy
text: slope by the side of the road. He walks off with his head in
text: his hands. This is the first time we’ve heard his voice.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Fuck!!!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fuck!!!
text: The others get out of the car and watch him.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: He's colorblind. He can’t fly.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Oh, Jesus. Oh, no.
text: Thirty yards away Dwayne falls to his knees, buries his hands
text: and face in the grass, and SHRIEKS like a wild animal.
text: There’s an out-of-control quality to his behavior that is
text: scary and disturbing. Finally, Dwayne rolls to a sitting
text: position, his hands covering his face.
text: He sits there crying. The others don’t know what to do.
text: Richard glances at Sheryl. He points at his watch and shrugs.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont’d)
dialog: Let’s give him a second.
text: In the background, the VW keeps HONKING like some demonic
text: beast -- mocking Dwayne’s helplessness.
text: Finally, Sheryl approaches Dwayne.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont’d)
dialog: Dwayne? Honey? I’m sorry.
text: He says nothing. She sighs.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Dwayne... Come on, we gotta go.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: I’m not going.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Dwayne...
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: I’m not! I don’t care! I’m not
dialog: getting in that bus again!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Dwayne... For better or worse:
dialog: we're your family...
text: Dwayne stands up and screams at them.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: You’re not my family! I don’t want
dialog: to be your family! I hate you
dialog: fucking people! I hate you!
dialog: (he points at them)
dialog: Divorce! Bankrupt! Suicide!
dialog: You're losers! You’re fucking
dialog: losers!
text: Everyone is stunned by this outburst. Dwayne puts his hands
text: over his eyes and sits down again.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE (cont'd)
dialog: Just leave me, Mom. Please? Just
dialog: leave me here.
text: Sheryl gets up and walks back to the others.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: I don’t know what to do.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We're gonna be late. Can we leave
dialog: somebody here with him?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I‘ll stay.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, we’re not doing that.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Olive, you want to talk to him?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, Richard. There’s nothing to
dialog: say. We just have to wait.
text: A beat. Then Olive walks over and sits down next to Dwayne.
text: Dwayne’s face is red and snot is dribbling from his nose. He
text: has a piece of straw and he’s poking some ants in the grass.
dialog: Uc
text: She puts her arm on his shoulder and watches him poke. The
text: ants climb busily over the grass. They sit quietly.
text: Then Dwayne stands up.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Okay, let’s go.
text: He walks back to the others. His voice is automatic.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE (contd)
dialog: I apologize for the things I said.
dialog: I was upset. I didn’t really mean
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (mock~tender)
dialog: Dwayne... We know you did.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Frank...
dialog: (to Dwayne)
dialog: It’s okay. Let’s just go.
text: They all start pushing the bus.
scene_heading: INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY
text: Richard is weaving through traffic -- the engine’s REVVING
text: VERY HIGH. Richard, Sheryl, Olive, and Frank are looking
text: ahead intently. Dwayne is slouched in the back, staring at
text: “nothing. The horn has tapered off to an occasional HONK.
text: Frank checks his watch.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: oe!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We're gonna make it! Olive, don’t
dialog: worry! We'll be on time!
speaker_heading: JUMP TO:
text: The same. Frank checks his watch.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: 251
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Just look for the exit! It’s
dialog: coming up!
speaker_heading: JUMP TO:
dialog: 76.
text: The same. Frank checks his watch again.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: 2:58!
text: No one says anything. Then Richard points.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: There! That’s it! Can anyone see
dialog: a Holiday Inn?
text: A beat. Olive points.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: There! Little Miss Sunshine!
text: As they ride up the exit ramp, the sign in front of the
text: Holiday Inn reads, “Little Miss Sunshine.”
text: Richard comes off the ramp onto a four lane commercial road.
text: There’s a maze of service roads and parking lots between him
text: and the Holiday Inn. Richard is baffled.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: How the fuck do you get over there?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Turn here! Turn here!
text: Richard takes a right into a service road.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont’d)
dialog: Will you slow down?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Pecanyt l= fem an third gear!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: 2:59PM!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Does anyone see a turn-off? How
dialog: the fuck do you get over there?
text: They drive past the Holiday Inn -- a few hundred yards away.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Dad! You drove past it!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: There’s no place to turn in!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Turn around! You gotta turn around!
speaker_heading: Wc
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, hold on, everybody.
text: The VW screeches around in a wide arc across four lanes of
text: (luckily empty) traffic. Richard guns the under-revving
text: engine. They again drive past the distant Holiday Inn.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont’d)
dialog: Can anyone see a way in?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Go over there, then cut across!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay, hold on!
text: The VW squeals around a left turn onto another service road.
speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont’d)
dialog: There’s no way in! What the fuck?!
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Dad! You're driving past it!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: There! Into the parking lot!
text: She points. Richard turns into an enormous empty parking
text: lot. He drives towards the Holiday Inn in the distance.
text: There's still no clear path on how to get there.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It’s a dead end!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, go over there!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It’s the same! There’s no way...!
text: He turns the wheel and they begin tracing a wide loop --
text: bombing around the parking lot at 35mph in a holding pattern.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Three o’clock!
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Dad...!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Go back out!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We tried that! There’s no way in!
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: So we just keep going in circles?
text: Richard says nothing. Finally:
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay: Hold on, everybody! Olive,
dialog: put your seat belt on.
text: He comes out of a wide arc and heads straight for the median
text: strips separating him from the Holiday Im.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Oh, my God!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Hold on, everyone!
text: He guns it. As soon as he hits the first median, the HORN
text: goes off and doesn’t stop. They’re in a new parking lot.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Look out!
text: Richard goes SCREECHING past several parked cars. They’re
text: one median strip away from the Holiday Inn parking lot.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: One more! Here we go! Hold on!
text: They hit the median hard. A big ‘pump. They've made it into
text: the Holiday Inn parking lot. The whole van sags to the rear.
text: Frank looks out the rear window.
text: A tire is wheeling off across the parking lot by itself.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We lost a tire, Rich!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We'll get it later! Here we go!
text: They come gliding into a parking space, HORN BLARING.
text: Frank yanks open the sliding door. It slides back, slams
text: into the end of the track and derails. The whole door falls
text: off the side of the van and into the parking lot.
text: Frank doesn’t even look back. He sprints across the lot
text: towards a distant banner marked “Little Miss Sunshine.”
text: All the others -~ except Dwayne -- sprint after him.
dialog: Ue)s
scene_heading: INT. REGISTRATION HALL ~ DAY
text: A big carpeted hotel lobby.
text: The doors open and Frank comes in, breathless. He stops.
text: The place is crawling with tiny blond girls and their
text: stressed mothers. The girls are dressed, coiffed and made-up
text: to within an inch of their life.
text: Nearby, a CONTEST OFFICIAL is packing up her things behind a
text: table with a “Registration” banner.
text: Frank sprints up to her. The others catch up and stand,
text: looking on -- desperate, disshevelled, breathing hard.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hi, we’re here to register!
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: I’m sorry, we're closed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But we have an entrant. Right

speaker_heading: OFFICIAL

text: She tries to leave. Richard stops her.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Wait, wait, wait! How can we make
dialog: this work?
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Everyone else was here before three. I’d
dialog: be giving unfair advantage...
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We’re not asking for an advantage!
dialog: We just want to compete!
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Don’t yell at me, sir. I didn’t make you
dialog: late. We've settled on the schedule of

text: computers. Now the show starts in twenty
dialog: minutes, I have a hair check to do, I'm
dialog: sorry you’re late, but I can’t help you.

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Please! You don’t know what we've
dialog: been through...!
speaker_heading: SOUND GUY (0.S.)
dialog: Uh, Ms. Jenkins...?
text: They all turn. There’s a SOUND GUY -- a very portly young

speaker_heading: SOUND GUY (cont’d)
dialog: I can put ‘em in the system.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Oh, Kirby, you don’t have to!
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: No, it’s okay. It’s five minutes.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Well... It’s your time. ‘Scuse me.
text: She pushes past them. Frank leaps up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hello! Everyone?! We've just
dialog: witnessed a great act of compassion
dialog: and human kindness! Exhibit A:
dialog: we’‘ve got Eva Braun here -- making
dialog: the trains run on time, and B:
dialog: Kirby! My man! Currently the
dialog: greatest human being on the planet!
dialog: Applause, please!
text: He leads the others in applause. Everyone else in the lobby
text: ignores them, Kirby smiles, flips on the computer, They
text: crowd around.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Thank you so much! You don’t know
dialog: what this means...
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Please. It’s five minutes.
text: He glances in the direction of the Official, who has

dialog: again. These people are crazy.
dialog: (to Olive)
dialog: So, what’s your name?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Olive.
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: Olive. That’s a nice name,

speaker_heading: OLIVE (cont'd)
dialog: Mom! It’s Miss Florida! Look!
dialog: It’s really her!
speaker_heading: SHERYL

speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont’d)
dialog: Come on, she looks nice. We'll
dialog: just say hi.
dialog: (to Richard)
dialog: You got this?
dialog: rr T’ll take care of it.
text: Sheryl drags Olive to the back of the line -- a half a dozen
text: girls and their mothers. The GIRL pos eecee ore turns and
text: stares at Olive -- sizing up the competition. Olive smiles.
dialog: 82.
text: Olive takes this in stride. Frank and Dwayne approach,
text: carrying the family’s luggage and a Sunday NY Times.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey. I’m getting a room. We’1l
text: set up a base camp.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Okay, we'll come find you.
text: Frank and Dwayne walk off. Olive watches them go, then turns
text: and looks at the other girls.
text: Again, they’re all miniature Barbies with expensive clothes
text: and hair. All of them are several inches shorter than Olive,
text: who is still dressed in her traveling clothes -- denim cut-
text: offs and black Converse high-tops. She stands out.
text: Two TWIN GIRLS are chasing each other around, giggling.
text: Olive watches. Eventually, the Twins see Olive watching them.
text: They whisper to each other and giggle. Olive gives them a
text: friendly half-smile. Finally, the Twin Girls approach Olive.
speaker_heading: TWIN GIRL ONE
dialog: Are you on a diet?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TWIN GIRL ONE
dialog: Are you on a diet?
speaker_heading: OLIVE

scene_heading: INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM - DAY
text: A quiet, empty room.
text: Frank and Dwayne enter, dropping the luggage on the floor.
text: Dwayne immediately walks to a bed in the corner of the room
text: and lies facing the wall. Frank surveys the room with a
text: jaundiced eye. He walks over, peers out the window.
text: Frank turns, looks at Dwayne lying on the bed. He walks
text: over, settles into a chair, pulls out his NY Times.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, you know, facing the wall like
dialog: that...? There’s no way you gonna
dialog: stop me from killing myself. No

speaker_heading: RICHARD (cont’d)
dialog: Olive... I know you and Grandpa
dialog: worked on this together. I know
dialog: how much it meant to him. We drove

dialog: We have twenty five contestants
dialog: from all over the State of Florida.
text: At the end of the evening, one of
dialog: these girls will be crowned Little

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
text: A glorious, sunny day. The ocean stretches out to infinity.
text: Dwayne and Frank, in swim trunks, are ata surfboard rental
text: shop on the beach. The ocean’s dead calm. Frank is handing
text: money to a DUDE at the shop. Dwayne looks out at the water.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: There’s no waves, Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We don’t need waves. We'll just
text: paddie out.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: The MC is up on the stage. Another DRUMROLL.
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: ...Let’s hear a big round of
dialog: applause for the evening wear!
text: MUSIC. Big APPLAUSE. The same girls -- in precocious
dialog: evening-wear -- come out in the same order and do the same
text: little loop around the stage. Olive’s on the end again.
text: Richard, in the crowd, applauds -- a little less heartily.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE WATER - DAY
text: Frank and Dwayne paddle straight out into the ocean. It’s
text: calm, but the shore is a long way away. Dwayne looks back.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: How far are we?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I dunno. Quarter mile?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: You wanna stop?
text: Frank shrugs. They stop. Frank looks down into the water.
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey. Think you can touch bottom?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: How far is it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Must be ten, twelve feet. Come on!
dialog: Y’ready? On your mark, get set...
text: They dive down into the water.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
text: It’s about fifteen feet to the white sand on the bottom.
text: Dwayne swims all the way down to the bottom.
text: Frank swims down more slowly. He finally makes it.
text: He comically mimes that he’s drowning.
text: Then he and Dwayne come back up.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE WATER ~ DAY
text: They resurface.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Victory! Yes!
text: They rest on their surfboards, breathing hard.
text: Then, without waiting, Dwayne dives down in the water again.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY - MONTAGE
text: Shots of Frank and Dwayne swimming in the blue water with
text: white sand and shafts of sunlight.
dialog: It’s beautiful.
text: They do flips, twists, spins.

text: Then he swims back up to the surface.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: The MC is up on stage. Another DRUMROLL.
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: And now! The moment you’ve been waiting
dialog: for! The talent competition! Ladies and
dialog: gentleman, please welcome Amber Tiffany

dialog: Broadway show, “Annie.” Amber...!
text: A little girl walks out -- very stagy -- and begins to sing:
speaker_heading: AMBER
dialog: “The sun’1l1 come out...tomorrow...”
text: Richard sits in the audience. He’s growing uneasy.
scene_heading: EXT. ON THE WATER - DAY
text: They sit on their boards and look out to sea.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Man, it’s beautiful out here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t know if I believe in God, but the
dialog: ocean -- it’s always here for you:
dialog: infinitely bigger than you are, and
dialog: completely indifferent. So... My
dialog: version of God.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Frank. ..?
dialog: (Frank looks over)
dialog: What‘d it feel like when you cut
dialog: your wrists?
text: Frank takes a breath.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know, I wish I could tell you I
dialog: felt bad. But I didn’t. I was...
dialog: Outside the world, y’know? It was
dialog: very peaceful.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But, I’m feeling that way now, too, so...
text: He shrugs. Dwayne nods. He looks out to sea.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Sometimes I wish I could just go to
dialog: sleep until I was eighteen. Just
dialog: skip all this crap -- high school
dialog: and everything. Just skip it...
text: He shakes his head.
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Y’ever hear of Marcel Proust?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: He’s the guy you teach?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. French writer. Total loser.
dialog: Never had a real job. Unrequited
dialog: love affairs. Gay. Spent twenty
dialog: years writing a book almost no one
dialog: reads. But...he was also probably
dialog: the greatest writer since
dialog: Shakespeare. Anyway, he gets down
text: to the end of his life, he looks
text: back and he decides that all the
dialog: years he suffered -- those were the
dialog: best years of his life. Because
dialog: they made him who he was. They
dialog: forced him to think and grow, and
dialog: to feel very deeply. And the years
dialog: he was happy? Total waste. Didn't
dialog: learn anything.
text: Dwayne grins.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: So, if you sleep til you're
dialog: eighteen...
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: ...Think of the suffering you’d
dialog: miss! High school’s your prime
dialog: suffering years. You don’t get
dialog: better suffering than that! Unless
dialog: you go into academia, but that’s a
dialog: different story.
text: They share a smile. Dwayne gazes out to sea. A beat.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: You know what...?
dialog: (Frank looks over)
dialog: Fuck beauty contests. It’s like
dialog: life is one fucking beauty contest
dialog: after another these days. School,
dialog: then college, then work. Fuck it.
dialog: Fuck the Naval Academy. Fuck the
dialog: MacArthur Foundation. If I want to
dialog: fly, I‘1ll find a way to fly. You
dialog: do what you love and fuck the rest.
text: Frank stares at Dwayne, impressed. Dwayne glances at Frank,
text: who tries to play it cool.
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m glad you‘re talking again,
dialog: Dwayne. You’re not nearly as
dialog: stupid as you look.
text: Dwayne smiles. Frank looks around.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont’d)
dialog: So now what do we do?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: You got me, Frank. Maybe we can
dialog: stay out here forever.
text: A beat. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE (cont’d)
dialog: We should go.
text: They begin paddling back to shore.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: A tiny girl in a COWGIRL outfit -- smiling like crazy -- taps
text: her way through a tap-dance routine. She’s fantastic.
text: Richard’s smile is fading. He’s really starting to worry.
scene_heading: EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY
text: Frank exits a T-shirt shop and throws a shirt Dwayne.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I can’t believe we found these. I
dialog: hope they fit.
text: As they stride up the boardwalk, he strips off his shirt and
text: puts on his new T-shirt. In big block letters, it says:
speaker_heading: “LOSER”
text: Dwayne puts on his. It’s the same. Frank looks at him.
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont‘d)
dialog: You're every mother’s dream,
dialog: Dwayne. Come on.
text: They head off.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Another TINY BLONDE GIRL sings while flouncing and prancing
text: across the stage, blowing kisses and twirling a parasol.
text: She skips around the MC, flirting and batting her eyes.
dialog: 96.
text: The audience -- charmed -- starts clapping along. As she
text: finishes, the audience rises as one in a standing ovation.
text: Richard is the only one to remain seated. His face sinks as
text: reality finally hits him -- there’s no way Olive will win.
text: He gets up and departs.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - DAY
text: Frank and Dwayne enter and stride towards the doors of the
text: auditorium. A pant-suited GRANDMA is sneaking a smoke.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is it over?
speaker_heading: GRANDMA
dialog: Not yet.
text: They open the door and walk into a BLAST of syrupy singing.
text: The door shuts. The door reopens. Frank and Dwayne stagger
text: out. They look at each other.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: I’m going backstage.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Right. See ya.
text: Dwayne heads off as Frank leans against a wall, recovering.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY
text: Dwayne strides through the backstage, looking for Sheryl and
text: Olive. With his wet Mohawk and LOSER t-shirt, he stands out.
text: A PAGEANT OFFICER tries to stop him.
speaker_heading: PAGEANT OFFICER
dialog: Excuse me? You authorized to be
dialog: backstage?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: No.
text: He continues walking. Everywhere there are little blond girls
text: crying, whining, or lolling about. All the mothers are over-
text: dressed, over-coiffed, and over-stressed. It’s depressing.
text: He stops, turns to a little PRINCESS slouched on a sofa.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE (cont’d)
dialog: Hey. Where are the dressing rooms?
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS
dialog: Are you allowed to be here?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Just tell me where the dressing
dialog: rooms are.
speaker_heading: PRINCESS
dialog: (yelling off-screen)
dialog: Security! Security!!! Help!!!
text: Dwayne rolls his eyes, moves on,
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE, DRESSING ROOMS - DAY
text: Richard wanders through the backstage. He spots Sheryl and
text: Olive in a small dressing room in the back. He approaches.
text: Olive is sitting in a make-up chair, wearing gold hot pants
text: and a red top. It’s a slightly bizarre ensemble, given her
text: girlish plumpness. Richard hesitates. Sheryl sees him.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Hey. What're you doing?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I came to wish Olive good luck.
dialog: {to Olive)
dialog: How're you doin’?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: (sotto voce)
dialog: Nervous.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You're gonna do great! I know it!
dialog: (to Sheryl)
dialog: Can I talk to you a sec?
text: She nods. They wander a few steps out of Olive’s hearing
text: range. Richard is agitated, troubled.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: I don’t want Olive to go on.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: (can’t believe it)
dialog: Are you kidding...?!!!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We're not in Maryland anymore, all right?
dialog: She’s out of her league here.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: So...?
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Sheryl...! She's not gonna win.
dialog: There’s no fucking way.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: It doesn’t matter...!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It dees matter!
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: It doesn’t matter!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: It does!!!
text: Suddenly, all Richard's emotions rush to the surface.
speaker_heading: RICHARD .
dialog: I don’t want her to lose. I know
dialog: what that feels like. It’s not
dialog: good. We can’t let that happen.
text: She stares at him. It’s the first time he’s admitted to any
text: kind of vulnerability or weakness. She takes his hand.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Richard...
text: They look at each other. This is the first honest moment
dialog: we've seen between them.
text: Unfortunately, they are interrupted by Dwayne, who enters --
text: a determined look on his face. Sheryl sees him coming.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Hey. How're you feeling?!
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Better. Where’s Olive?
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: In the dressing room. What’s up?
dialog: 99,
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: rr sotto)
dialog: Io don’t want Olive doing this.
speaker_heading: SHERYL

speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Mom, look around! This Place is

dialog: judging Olive! Fuck them!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Exactly! Fuck them!
text: Dwayne glances at Richard, unnerved by his agreement.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: No, Dwayne, It’s too late...
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: It’s not too late! You're the Mom!
dialog: You're Supposed to protect her!
text: Sheryl stares at him. a clipboard-wielding, head-set wearing
text: ASSISTANT passes by and calls out.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Olive Harvey! Two minutes.
text: He walks on, They watch him go. Dwayne and Sheryl face off,
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: She’s not a beauty queen, Mom...
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Olive stands near the doorway, listening, Her face betrays
text: nothing. Dwayne’s VOICE is faint but clear.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE (0.S.)
dialog: +. She’s just not.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE -— NIGHT
text: Sheryl and Dwayne stare at each other,
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Listen to me.

dialog: Olive is who she is. This is what she’s
dialog: chosen to do...
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Olive turns, walks mechanically back to her chair and sits.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (0.S.)
dialog: ...She’s worked hard, she’s poured
dialog: herself into it...
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
text: Sheryl puts a hand on Dwayne’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: ...We can’t take it away from her.
dialog: We just can’t.
text: Dwayne closes his eyes, hangs his head. Sheryl hugs him.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont'd)
dialog: I know you want to protect her,
dialog: but... We gotta let Olive be
dialog: Olive. For better or worse...
text: The clipboard-wielding ASSISTANT returns.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Olive Harvey? Are you the Harveys?
text: They nod and return -- en masse -- to the dressing room.
text: Olive is seated in her chair, staring dumbly at: the floor.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Olive? Time to go.
text: Olive doesn’t move. Sheryl goes to her.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Olive...? Honey, are you okay?
text: Olive won't look at her. Sheryl glances at Richard.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Um... We need to go.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Hang on.
dialog: (to Olive)
dialog: Honey...? Olive, look at me.
dialog: (Olive looks)
dialog: You don’t have to do this if you
dialog: don’t want. If you want to sit
dialog: this one out, that’s fine. We're
dialog: proud of you anyway, okay?
text: A beat. The Assistant checks his watch.
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: It's time.
dialog: Silence.
text: Olive stands up. She walks to the Assistant.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT (cont’d)
dialog: Okay. Let’s go.
text: He takes her hand. They stride off.
text: Dwayne, Sheryl, and Richard stand together and watch -- mutually
text: powerless -- as Olive is lead off.
text: TRACKING BACKWARDS with Olive. She’s got her game face on --
text: a mask of fear and determination. Sheryl calls after her.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Good luck, honey!
text: Olive keeps walking, not looking back.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - DAY
text: Frank re-enters. Dwayne and Sheryl are coming the other way.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is she going on?
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
text: She's going on.
text: They enter the auditorium together.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM ~ NIGHT
text: Yet another LITTLE BLOND GIRL is onstage, taking her bows to
text: polite APPLAUSE. Richard leads Sheryl, Dwayne, and Frank to
text: their seats. The MC comes on stage.
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: Very nice. Thank you. Okay, you’ve been
dialog: a patient audience tonight...
speaker_heading: IN THE WINGS
text: Olive stands next to the edge of the curtain watching the MC.
speaker_heading: MC (cont’d)
dialog: ...We have one more contestant and then
dialog: we'll be crowning the winner. So please
dialog: welcome, from the Fort Myers district,
dialog: Olive Harvey!
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: APPLAUSE.
text: WE FOLLOW Olive out onto the stage.
text: The LIGHTS are blinding.
text: The AUDIENCE is hidden in darkness.
text: There’s a crowd MURMUR because of her hot-pants get-up.
text: Dwayne, Frank, Sheryl, and Richard applaud nervously.
text: Richard takes Sheryl’s hand, squeezes it. They share a look.
text: Olive waves over the MC. He walks over to her and holds the
text: mic down for her to speak. She takes a breath.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: I'd like to dedicate this to my
dialog: Grandpa, who helped me do this
dialog: routine.
speaker_heading: MC
dialog: That’s sweet! Is he here? Where’s
dialog: your Grandpa right now?
speaker_heading: OLIVE
text: He’s in the trunk of our car.
text: The MC doesn’t know how to react.
dialog: Mc
dialog: Okay! Well! Take it away, Olive!
text: He retreats. She is alone on stage. Some 12 YEAR OLD BOYS
text: in the audience decide to be cruel. One of them “moos”.
speaker_heading: BOY ONE
dialog: Moooo!
text: GIGGLES and SHUSHES. Another boy chimes in.
speaker_heading: BOY TWO
dialog: Arf! Arf! Arf!
text: More GIGGLES and SHUSHES. Miss Florida, at the judges table
text: by the stage, looks around sternly. She feels bad for Olive.
text: Olive is confused. She doesn’t understand these noises.
text: Dwayne hangs his head. Frank looks around.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where are those fuckers?! I'll
dialog: kill ‘em!
dialog: 103.
text: Then Olive finds what she’s looking for:
text: Kirby, in the sound booth.
text: He nods at her. She nods at him.
text: Then Olive turns around, her back to the audience.
text: Kirby turns a VOLUME knob up to “6”. He hits “play”.
dialog: {The music clearly depends on the rights. For specificity,
dialog: we’ll use “Peach” by Prince.]
text: A BLAST of hard rock 12 bar blues comes out of the speakers.
text: Everyone is surprised.
text: The music is hard-driving and nasty. It is completely
dialog: different from the other pageant music we’ve heard so far.
dialog: For the first four measures, with Prince saying, “Here she
text: comes,” and “She got them gold hot-pants on again,” Olive
text: barely moves, rocking her shoulders and hips to the beat.
text: Dwayne, Frank, Sheryl, and Richard all glance at each other.
dialog: This is not what they expected.
text: No one knows what to make of Olive rocking, her back turned.
text: However, when the first verse begins, Olive turns and strides
text: up the stage -- hands on hips, shoulders swinging -- with an
text: absolute and spectacular physical self-confidence.
text: She rocks out, busting crazy moves this stage has never seen:
text: shakes, shimmies, twirls, dips, undulations ~- a melange of MIV
text: rump-shakin’, Solid Gold Dancers re-runs, and out-of-left-field
text: inventions of her own. Other moves are clearly drawn from
dialog: Grandpa’s sixty-year career of strip-bar patronage.
text: She dances with a total command -- an exuberant, even witty
text: mastery of her body, the music, the moves, everything.
text: Most of all, she’s doing it for herself -- for her own sense
text: of fun -- and the judges are instantly irrelevant.
text: The audience is stunned. No one moves, Mouths hang open.
text: Sheryl, Frank, and Dwayne gape. Richard is baffled.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: What’s she doing? What the hell is
dialog: she doing?!
dialog: 104.
text: When the first verse ends, Olive punctuates the 12-bar vamp
text: with a series of violent pelvic thrusts.
text: Everyone is totally shocked. No one knows how to react.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Oh, my God...!
text: Abruptly, Frank starts laughing in disbelief.
text: He stands and begins cheering Olive, pumping his fist and
text: grooving to the music.
text: Richard stares at Frank. Cautiously encouraged, he stands
text: and cheers along with Frank -- tentative at first, then more
text: and more unselfconsciously.
text: Sheryl and Dwayne join in, relieved and amazed.
dialog: Grandpa was right -- she’s blowing them out of the water.
text: As the second verse ends and the guitar solo begins, Olive
text: punctuates the vamp with another series of thrusts.
dialog: This is too much for the contest Official from the
text: registration desk, who sits near the stage at the table of
text: contest JUDGES, including Miss Florida. She looks around and
text: spots Sheryl, Richard, Frank, et al, standing and cheering.
text: The Official gets up, walks up the aisle and yells at Sheryl.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: What is your daughter doing?!
text: Sheryl ~-- taken aback -- shrugs. Richard leans in.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: She's kicking ass, is what she’s
dialog: doing!
text: The others smile and nod. The Official is incensed. She
text: turns and walks back to the sound booth. She yells at Kirby.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Turn it off!
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Turn the music off!!!
speaker_heading: KIRBY
dialog: (fake deaf)
dialog: What...?!
dialog: 105.
text: He smiles and cranks the music up to “8”. Mothers and
text: children in the audience clap their hands over their ears.
text: The audience polarizes -- some (the Grizzled Biker; Miss
text: Florida) stand and cheer while others sit dumbfound or frown
text: disapprovingly, shaking their heads. Still others flee for
text: the exit, heads down, hands over their ears.
text: The Official, furious, leaves Kirby and stalks down the aisle
text: to the stage. Sheryl watches with growing worry.
speaker_heading: SHERYL (cont'd)
dialog: What's she doing? Look...!
text: She shakes Richard, points.
text: The Official goes to the MC -- at the side of the stage --
text: waves to him. He bends down, listens. He nods.
text: The MC walks onstage and tries to stop Olive from dancing,
text: grabbing her arms.
text: Olive doesn’t know what he’s doing, but she won’t let him
text: break her routine. She wiggles away and keeps dancing.
text: Richard -- outraged -- races to the front of the auditorium,
text: leaps on the stage, jumps on the MC’s back and rides him --
text: piggy-back -- into the wings. They crash to the ground.
text: Olive stops dancing, turns and looks at Richard.
text: Richard, grappling with the MC, waves her on.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Keep dancing, Honey! Just dance!
text: Olive turns and stares at the audience.
text: Dwayne, Frank and Sheryl are gesturing -- “Keep going!”
text: Olive -- hearing the music, seeing Sheryl, Frank, and Dwayne
text: cheering her -- starts to dance again, fluid and relaxed.
text: Richard disentangles himself from the pissed-off MC as
text: STAGEHANDS step in and pull them apart. Richard shrugs off
text: their restraining hands, then turns to watch Olive dance.
text: The Contest Official steps forward and angrily confronts him.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: Get your daughter off stage now!
text: Richard -- taken aback -- hesitates. She presses him.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL (cont'd)
dialog: If you don’t stop her, she’ll be
dialog: disqualified!
text: Richard stares at her. Then he nods.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Okay.
text: He turns and walks out on stage.
text: Olive, seeing him, is confused. He steps up behind her.
text: Then Richard starts dancing.
text: They dance together: Olive in front, Richard backing her up.
text: Richard looks at the Official with a defiant, fuck-you smile.
text: Sheryl, Frank and Dwayne, watching, can’t believe it.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Holy shit...!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to Sheryl)
dialog: You married that guy?
text: Sheryl shakes her head -- she can’t believe it either.
text: Frank runs down the aisle, jumps on stage, and dances next to
text: Richard -- a surprisingly competent set of butt-wagging,
text: party-music moves. Dwayne follows Frank up on stage.
text: Sheryl pauses a moment and watches her family.
text: Richard waves to Sheryl to join them.
text: A beat. Then Sheryl walks, then runs, and jumps up on stage.
text: Richard helps her up, and they dance together.
text: Kirby cranks it to “10”. MUSIC is overpowering everything.
text: As the songs winds up, Sheryl lines up next to Olive for a
text: unified series of thrusts.
text: As the final cymbal crashes, Olive pulls up her shirt to
text: reveal “Peach” is written on her tummy with magic marker.
text: Audience MEMBERS respond with a standing ovation.
text: Frank and Dwayne strut around with their arms in the air,
text: like victorious professional wrestlers.
dialog: 107.
text: Richard picks up Olive, swings her in the air. Sheryl walks
text: over and hugs Richard and Olive.
text: FADE TO BLACK AND SILENCE
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Richard, Sheryl, Olive, Frank, and Dwayne sit -- dazed -- in a drab
text: office. They’re all handcuffed together, except Olive.
text: Nothing’s happening. Flourescent lights HUM.
text: Frank and Dwayne are still wearing their “LOSER” T-shirts.
text: Boxes of pageant materials -- trophies, sashes, tiaras -- are
text: stacked around them.
text: Sheryl quietly eyes Richard, slouched next to her, and smiles
text: to herself. Her eyes drift to a nearby carton of tiaras.
text: A door OPENS. They all look over.
text: A COP appears, starts taking off their handcuffs.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Okay. You’re out.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: We‘re free?
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: They're dropping charges. On the
dialog: condition that you don’t enter your

dialog: State of Florida ever again.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: I think we can live with that.
scene_heading: INT. HOLIDAY INN LOBBY ~- NIGHT
text: Richard, Sheryl, Olive, Frank, and Dwayne step into the
dialog: lobby.
text: It’s deserted. Decorations and banners litter the floor.
text: They wander out, dazed, rubbing their wrists.
text: Sheryl approaches Richard, takes a tiara from behind her
text: back, places it on his head. Richard accepts it wryly.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Great. Thank you very much.
dialog: 108.
text: She smiles. Richard turns to Olive with the tiara.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Here. I think this is for you.
speaker_heading: OLIVE
dialog: Dad...!
text: She struggles to articulate something. Finally, she shrugs.
speaker_heading: OLIVE (cont‘d)
dialog: I just like dancing.:.!
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Well, you were great.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You were beyond great.
speaker_heading: DWAYNE
