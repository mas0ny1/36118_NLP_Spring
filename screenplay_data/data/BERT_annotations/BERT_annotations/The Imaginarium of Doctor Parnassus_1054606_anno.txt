scene_heading: 1 EXT NIGHT URBAN TERRACE 1
text: A row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all
text: the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked
text: vehicles glistening in the rain.
text: A front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts
text: in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big
text: horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the
text: street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses
text: are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver.
text: It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off
text: this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where
text: light from a TV flickers.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Carol!... Carol!
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.O.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Come here! Quick!
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.O.)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: Quick!
speaker_heading: CAROL (V.O.)
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I'm trying to watch this! It's the
dialog: last episode!
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Come here!!!
text: CAROL appears in the doorway.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What is it?
text: But the wagon and horses have gone.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: It's gone!

speaker_heading: 1 CONTINUED: 1
text: CAROL, disgusted, swats him on the head with the flat of her
text: hand and goes back inside.
scene_heading: 2 EXT/INT NIGHT PARKED CAR IN STREET 2
text: A YOUNG COUPLE are snogging in the back of a parked car.
text: Music is playing on the radio.
text: They are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying
text: sight of the huge looming horse-drawn box as it trundles
dialog: past.
scene_heading: 3 EXT NIGHT THE TOWN HALL CLOCK 3
text: The clock shows and strikes 2am.
scene_heading: 4 EXT NIGHT A DINGY BACK STREET 4
text: The wagon has stopped. The back begins to open, top, bottom
text: and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals.
text: Shadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise
text: the roof.
text: While this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a
text: garishly lit club across the street.
text: A group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering,
text: laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing
text: up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having "a great
dialog: time".
text: They see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What the...!
text: We now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a
text: stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby
text: travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a
text: clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the
text: words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS.
text: PERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as
text: a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man
text: (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the
text: stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with
text: wings on his helmet and sandals.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: 4 CONTINUED: 4
speaker_heading: ANTON/MERCURY
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up!
dialog: Step up!... I, Mercury, the
dialog: messenger of the gods, invite
dialog: you... tonight, for one night
dialog: only... at this very venue... to
dialog: enter the mind, the very great
dialog: mind, of Doctor Parnassus!
text: PERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind
text: ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears
text: to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white
text: make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of
text: yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a
text: loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating
text: several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass
text: plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze
text: tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.
speaker_heading: ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
dialog: Doctor Parnassus... as old as
dialog: time... yes, ladies and gentlemen,
dialog: more than a thousand years old ...
dialog: he has the power to empower your
dialog: mind. A secret learned in the
dialog: mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus
dialog: open your imagination. Let him
dialog: guide and transport you to worlds
dialog: and possibilities you never dreamt
dialog: of... If you dare. But... Beware...
dialog: there are dangers. You will have to
dialog: choose. Will your soul fly?... Or
dialog: will it be dashed on the rocks of
dialog: darkness? The choice is yours and
dialog: yours alone. Transcend the heights
text: on Beauty's wing.
text: A young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair
text: and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips
text: and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length
text: mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a
text: forest... This is `Beauty'. She turns and steps forward.
text: ANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps
text: together. They look enchanting and enchanted.
speaker_heading: ANTON/MERCURY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the audience)
dialog: Or, if you must...
text: Now PERCY, in demon costume, leaps from behind the scenery .

dialog: the stage.
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Take a ticket and join the queue!
dialog: Only five quid a go! There's no
dialog: greater bargain on planet earth!
text: A beer bottle lands on the stage
text: The DRUNKEN YOUTHS cheer.
speaker_heading: ANTON/MERCURY
dialog: You choose... Fulfilment, grace and
dialog: light or... Waste, filth and
dialog: darkness.
dialog: (under his breath,
text: watching the drunk,
dialog: MARTIN, with contempt)
dialog: No prizes for guessing what you'll
dialog: do.
text: MARTIN has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage.
text: His MATES laugh and shout encouragement.
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (not in character.. he
dialog: stutters)
dialog: No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed.
dialog: You have to t-take a t-ticket
dialog: first.
text: ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But
text: MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the `audience'.
text: MARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud.
text: MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who
text: is still in a trance.
text: PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the
text: stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash.
text: More laughter from the MOB.

speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: (drunkenly to PARNASSUS)
dialog: Hey you...I wanna audition. I
dialog: wan... I wanna be a star... I
dialog: wanna...
text: MARTIN is on the verge of tweaking DOCTOR PARNASSUS' nose or
text: pulling his beard when VALENTINA diverts him.
speaker_heading: VALENTINA
dialog: Stop! Get off the stage!
text: MARTIN turns his bleary focus to VALENTINA.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Thas a nice pair of jugs.
text: MARTIN'S mates roar their approval.
speaker_heading: VALENTINA
dialog: Get off the stage!
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: No. I wan you... I wan you...
text: MARTIN lunges at `Beauty' who retreats up stage.
text: MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues `Beauty' who
text: stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out
dialog: tree.
text: ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues
text: to chase `Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through
text: the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down
text: the middle). MARTIN crashes after her.
text: ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR
text: PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide
dialog: not to but it's a difficult decision.
scene_heading: 5 INT/EXT MAGICAL FOREST 5
text: The stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now
text: seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees.
text: `Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as
text: MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical
text: forest. Beauty's costume has been transformed into something
dialog: wonderful. (A rainbow studded with diamonds?)
text: VALENTINA comes into view. MARTIN is in hot pursuit.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: 5 CONTINUED: 5
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Come here you little sexpot!
text: VALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist
text: hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a
text: moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before
text: striding off.
text: MARTIN staggers to his feet.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Come back! You bitch!
text: He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3
text: dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground.
text: Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark,
text: terrible, and very REAL forest. `Beauty' has vanished.
scene_heading: 6 EXT THE STAGE NIGHT 6
text: VALENTINA, `Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror.
text: Her costume has reverted to its original state. She examines
text: her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin.
text: ANTON looks at her. She shrugs. DR. PARNASSUS is still in a
text: trance, his lips moving soundlessly. ANTON watches DOCTOR
text: PARNASSUS in awe. `Beauty' sighs. She's had enough.
scene_heading: 7 INT/EXT MAGICAL FOREST 7
text: MARTIN is lost and terrified in the dark forest.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Mum...Mum!...
text: His voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are
text: interrupted by another sound...a Tarzan-like howl.
text: MARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines
text: through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look
text: like HANDS... with little heads and arms where the wrists
text: should be. They are all howling and jabbering.
text: From behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by
text: the collar, hoisting him high into the air.
text: Clearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are
text: many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES
text: swinging on "vines".
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: 7 CONTINUED: 7
text: But, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles...
text: dangling from enormous, luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float
text: through the dark, frightening, sky.
text: From some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just
text: out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: MARTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Please... I'll never...! Never
dialog: again!. Honest!... From now on... I
dialog: swear!.. Not a drop!
text: With a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops
text: jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar.
text: Down he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good
text: as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going
text: SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple
text: somersaults and lands on his feet.
text: He can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears
text: music. Beautiful, ethereal music.
text: In the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising
text: above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long
text: stairway winding up to the summit.
text: The HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the "thumbs up",
text: and points encouragingly toward the stairway.
text: Reformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the stairs. But on
text: reaching them he discovers that each one is 6 feet high. The
text: stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult. Letters are
text: carved into the first stair..."THE 12X12 STEP PROGRAM...GOOD
dialog: LUCK". This is going to be tough.
text: The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him
text: the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon
text: lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink
text: before the long climb. He heads for the club.
text: The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground
text: figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a
text: bowler hat and a red waistcoat.
speaker_heading: MR NICK
dialog: Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you
dialog: could use a drink.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: 7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
text: MARTIN, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside.
text: The door closes followed by the sound from within of much
text: gaiety and laughter.
text: THE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A
text: BALL OF FLAME.
scene_heading: 8 EXT DINGY BACK STREET 8
text: The sound of police sirens. We are back outside in front of
dialog: the theatre.
text: DR. PARNASSUS rises unsteadily, coming out of his arduous
text: trance.... `Beauty" moves to support him as, exhausted, he
text: loses his balance and snaps out of his trance.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR PARNASSUS

speaker_heading: DOCTOR PARNASSUS

dialog: Martin!... Martin!...
text: She sees `Beauty'.
speaker_heading: DRUNKEN GIRL (CONT'D)
dialog: He went with that cow! I'll scratch
dialog: her eyes out!
text: A POLICEWOMAN grabs the DRUNKEN GIRL and drags her,

text: MARTIN'S FRIENDS are searching for him around the stage.
scene_heading: FRIEND OF MARTIN
dialog: Marty!? Marty, where are you?
text: (a POLICEMAN grabs him))
dialog: Oi! Leave off..it's them..they've
dialog: got our mate back there.

text: The POLICEMAN looks and frowns.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (to the POLICEMAN
dialog: condescendingly)
dialog: Don't worry if you don't understand

text: PERCY, wisely, decides to head off conflict. He steers DOCTOR

speaker_heading: PERCY
speaker_heading: (to POLICEMAN)
dialog: He's doing his bit to save the
dialog: human race. He thinks it's got a
dialog: future. Quaint, eh? I keep telling
dialog: him to get a proper job.
dialog: (shaking his empty
dialog: collection cup)
dialog: Check it out.. another night with
text: nothing in the kitty.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: I want you freaks out of here. Now.
dialog: If I ever see you in this parish
dialog: again I'll do you.
text: DOCTOR PARNASSUS bows exaggeratedly, with a hint of mockery.
text: The POLICE OFFICER suspects that DOCTOR PARNASSUS is taking
text: the piss, but decides not to press it. Instead, he knees
text: MARTIN'S struggling friend to the ground.
scene_heading: 9 EXT BACK STREETS DAWN 9
text: The sky is grey with the first light of dawn. The wagon rolls

dialog: only! The Imaginarium of Dr.
dialog: Parnassus! Not to be missed!

dialog: Pssst!

scene_heading: 12 INT/EXT MAGICAL LANDSCAPE 12
text: ANTON, recovering, struggles out from between giant blocks of
text: stone. The world has gone dark.
text: He hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to
text: clamber over the shattered monoliths..
text: Reaching the top, ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant
text: rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. There are
text: what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on
text: either side of the pinnacle.
text: CUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror. Is he
text: lost inside a video game he can't control? He presses the
text: buttons on his gaming device - to no avail.
text: One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under
text: way... all very video-game-like. Thrilling aggressive music
text: blares forth.
text: MR NICK appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but
text: this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a

dialog: Great fun. Pow! Pow! Pow!
text: As he speaks bullets fly. Each time MR.NICK gets shot and is
text: knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel.
text: The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano
text: keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. The piano key bridge
text: descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL
text: PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing
text: the same tune - the tune DR. PARNASSUS is humming, but with
text: stern, demanding, PIANO TEACHERS in attendance.
speaker_heading: PIANO TEACHERS
dialog: No, no, start again! Again! From
dialog: the top! Again! Practice! Practice!
text: DIEGO doesn't know what to do.
text: Behind him rises a strange Mongolfier balloon. DR.

text: circumference. ANTON'S in the basket.

dialog: Attaboy, sonny. Join the men.
dialog: Nothing to it. Hup two, hup two...
text: He hesitates...the music from the pianos seems to have an
text: effect on him. He comes to a decision. He drops his gaming
text: device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly
text: piano keys.
text: The CUT-OUT shooting target MR NICK isn't happy.
speaker_heading: MR NICK (CONT'D)
dialog: No, wait! That's the wrong choice!
dialog: That bridge leads to failure and

speaker_heading: VALENTINA (CONT'D)

scene_heading: 53 EXT BOND STREET EVENING 53
text: Close up on Parnassus's glass plinth..now open-topped and
text: sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's
text: savings. A sign proclaims "Please Take Generously"
text: Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the
text: continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy
text: playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one
text: hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's
text: blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He
text: sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money.
text: The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and
text: white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable
text: street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN
dialog: anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth
text: glide past.
text: New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium -
dialog: More Exclusive than ever'.
text: The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been
text: chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other
dialog: white.
text: On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast
text: quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is,

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: 53 CONTINUED: 53

text: On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a
text: stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the
text: tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as
text: Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty.
text: She gracefully combs her hair.
text: Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth".
text: DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly

text: TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his
text: `romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy
text: pose on the edge of the white side of the stage.
text: Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd.

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (retrieving the money)
dialog: Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we

dialog: (he indicates the

dialog: What about the dreams of the less

dialog: have time for their dreams? Or are
dialog: you like I once was...do you just
dialog: despair? Despair at all that is
dialog: wrong in the world..
dialog: (getting to his feet)
dialog: ...despair at your inability to do
dialog: anything to change it.. to make it
dialog: better...I despaired so much at the
dialog: powerlessness of my own existence
dialog: that I took the easy way out...the
dialog: coward's way...I committed suicide!
dialog: Yes, that's right, I killed myself.
dialog: Can you understand my despair? But
dialog: I was saved...saved by a
dialog: miracle...The Imaginarium...and
dialog: Doctor Parnassus. He brought me
dialog: back from the dead. He gave me a

dialog: given me power to dream again... to
dialog: dream of a better world.
text: During his speech, more and more people have gathered. Some

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: (thinking fast)

text: cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and
text: glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe.
text: Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is

text: On being spotted, he takes off up a hill.
text: The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a solid
text: wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid stride.
text: Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up another
text: hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall rises
text: up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY
text: frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up..
text: surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS.
text: There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they
text: start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it
text: down. It won't budge.
text: While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been
text: somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits
text: quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers.
text: Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground.
text: GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and
text: exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS
text: gape at him... then barrel out the door.
text: Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with
text: white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud
text: is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person
text: climbing upwards.
text: The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a

text: THE LADDER COMPLETELY SEPARATES IN TWO.
text: Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages
text: to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung. Then, as
text: if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away.
text: The RUSSIANS chase after him but, his giant strides leave
text: them far behind. Smugly, TONY looks back just as one of the
text: legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log. He loses his

text: From nowhere, ANTON (still dressed as a fat woman) appears..
text: running to catch the plummeting TONY. He does and Whomp!!..

text: Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and
text: have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to

text: He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when...
text: ... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet
text: rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves -
text: revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath.
text: The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a
text: welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling
text: policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in..
text: The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope.
text: TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe
text: flies out of his mouth.
text: Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads
text: "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of
text: LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear -
text: high-kicking a snappy song and dance number.

text: Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Are you going to believe them
dialog: before you believe me?
speaker_heading: PERCY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Because they're irredeemably bad
dialog: people, and I'm essentially good. I
dialog: know that sounds terribly prim and
dialog: arrogant and self righteous, but
dialog: I'm trying to be honest. Look, the
dialog: truth is... in order to get my
dialog: charity off the ground I needed
dialog: capital.
text: ANTON looks askance.
speaker_heading: TONY (CONT'D)
dialog: (in response to Anton)
dialog: Yes, I know, and you're right, but
dialog: that's the way the grown-up..the
dialog: real world works. You can't make
dialog: omelettes without soiling your
dialog: hands. Or should that be the other
dialog: way round? Anyway, I - with
dialog: hindsight very foolishly - accepted
dialog: a loan from people who seemed to
dialog: me, at the time, to be very decent
dialog: and sincere. There was absolutely
dialog: no way I could have known that they
dialog: were part of a ruthless organised
dialog: crime syndicate and that they
dialog: wanted to use my charity to launder
dialog: money. I made a mistake. And I have
dialog: to live with that. I'm sorry. What

speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANTON
dialog: (answering his own
dialog: question)
dialog: The first time they hung you from
dialog: the b-bridge... right?... B-because
dialog: you stole their money.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Stop saying that! I didn't steal
dialog: it! I didn't have it. I'd had to
dialog: invest in infrastructure. I needed
dialog: more time. When you run a charity
dialog: you have to give lots of money
dialog: away. You wouldn't believe the red
dialog: tape. The Charity Commission are a
dialog: bunch of fascists. It's incredible.
dialog: I mean... c'mon give me a break...I
dialog: almost died today.. and I said I'm
