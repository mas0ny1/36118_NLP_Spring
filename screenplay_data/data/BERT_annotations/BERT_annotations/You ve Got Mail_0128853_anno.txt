speaker_heading: 1 CYBERSPACE 1
dialog: We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
dialog: sky that's just beginning to get light. There are a few
text: stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
dialog: computer sun starts to rise.
dialog: We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
text: over a computer version of the New York City skyline. We
dialog: move over Central Park. It's fall and the leaves are glorious
dialog: reds and yellows.
dialog: We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
dialog: Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and
text: turn onto a street in the West 80s.
text: Hold in front of a New York brownstone.
text: At the bottom of the screen a small rectangle appears and
dialog: the words:
speaker_heading: ADDING ART
text: As the rectangle starts to fill with color, we see a
dialog: percentage increase from 0% to 100%. When it hits 100% the
dialog: image pops and we are in real life.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - DAY 2
text: Early morning in New York. A couple of runners pass on their
dialog: way to Riverside Drive Park.
dialog: We go through the brownstone window into:
scene_heading: 3 INT. KATHLEEN KELLY'S APARTMENT - DAY 3
text: KATHLEEN KELLY is asleep. Kathleen, 30, is as pretty and
text: fresh as a spring day. Her bedroom's cozy, has a queen-sized
text: bed and a desk with a computer on it. Bookshelves line every
text: inch of wall space and overflow with books. Framed on the
dialog: wall: the cover of the children's classic, Madeleine.
text: As Kathleen wakes up, her boyfriend FRANK NAVASKY walks into
text: the room. He wears blue jeans and a workshirt. He's carrying
dialog: the New York Times.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Good morning.

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: Listen to this -- the entire work

text: Kathleen gets out of bed and goes to brush her teeth in the
dialog: bathroom, and we stay with Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: -- because they hadn't done any work
dialog: in six weeks.
text: Kathleen comes out of the bathroom in her robe.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Aren't you late?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know what this is, you know what

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: This is so sad.
text: She tosses him his jacket.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN (O.S.)
dialog: I'll see you tonight.
speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: p. 3
text: Frank goes out the door. It closes.
text: Kathleen tiptoes into the hall and looks through the fish-
text: eye peephole watching as he goes down the stairs, disappearing
dialog: from sight. She walks into:
scene_heading: 5 INT. KATHLEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY 5
text: And looks out the front window as Frank walks out onto the
text: street and turns toward Broadway.
dialog: He's gone. Good.
text: She sits down at her computer. An expression of anticipation
text: and guilty pleasure as she clicks the mouse.
scene_heading: 6 INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY 6
dialog: As we see the logo for America On Line come up and Kathleen's
dialog: code name: Shopgirl. She logs on and the computer makes all
text: its little modem noises as the computer dials the access
dialog: number and connects and we hear the machine:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Welcome.
dialog: And we see Kathleen, listening for the words she's waiting
dialog: to hear:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: You've got mail.
dialog: And Kathleen smiles as her mail page comes up:
scene_heading: 7 INT. COMPUTER SCREEN - DAY 7
speaker_heading: WE SEE A LIST OF LETTERS:

dialog: You can turn $20 into $20,000 THIS REALLY WORKS U CAN DO IT:
dialog: Maximize your selling ability nowwwww!!! NY152 Brinkley
dialog: Kathleen hits the "delete" key and the first three letters --
dialog: all of them junk-mail -- are deleted and drop offscreen.
dialog: Then she selects the "Read Mail" key for "NY 152 Brinkley".
speaker_heading: AND THE LETTER COMES UP:

dialog: Kathleen starts to read the letter aloud:
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Brinkley is my dog. He loves the
dialog: streets of New York as much as I do --
dialog: And now we hear Kathleen's voice replaced by the voice of NY
dialog: 152, a man named JOE FOX --
speaker_heading: JOE (V.O.)
dialog: -- although he likes to eat bits of
dialog: pizza and bagel off the sidewalk,
dialog: and I prefer to buy them. Brinkley
dialog: is a great catcher and was offered a

scene_heading: 8 INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - DAY 8
text: A dog is sitting on a large green pillow on the floor. This
text: is BRINKLEY. The pillow has "Brinkley" embroidered on it.
dialog: Brinkley's master, JOE FOX, a great-looking guy, full of
text: charm and irony, comes into the kitchen and pours himself
text: some orange juice. He's half-dressed.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: -- but he chose to stay with me so
dialog: that he could spend 18 hours a day
text: sleeping on a large green pillow the
dialog: size of an inner tube. Don't you
dialog: love New York in the fall? It makes
dialog: me want to buy school supplies. I
dialog: would send you a bouquet of newly-
dialog: sharpened pencils if I knew your
dialog: name and address. On the other hand,
dialog: this not knowing has its charms.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Darling --
speaker_heading: JOE
speaker_heading: Mmmmmhmmm --
dialog: Joe's girlfriend PATRICIA EDEN, in Armani head to toe, comes
text: into the kitchen and turns on the $2000 espresso machine,

dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA

dialog: espresso as a second
dialog: starts to come out
dialog: of the machine)
dialog: Vince got a great review. He'll be
dialog: insufferable. Tonight, PEN dinner --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Am I going?
speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: You promised.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can't I just give them money? That's
dialog: the cause? Free Albanian writers?
dialog: I'm for that.
text: Patricia drains another cup of espresso, looks at him.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, I'll go. You're late.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA

speaker_heading: JOE & THE COMPUTER (TOGETHER)
dialog: Welcome... You've got mail.
dialog: And as he starts to read his letter, we hear:
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN (V.O.)
dialog: I like to start my notes to you as

scene_heading: 11 EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY 11
text: As Joe comes out of his building.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: I go on line, and my breath catches

dialog: And the camera now pans from 152 Riverside uptown to:
scene_heading: 12 EXT. NEW YORK BROWNSTONE - MORNING 12
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: I hear nothing, not even a sound on

dialog: From you.
scene_heading: 13 EXT. BROADWAY - MORNING 13
text: As Kathleen comes onto Broadway at the corner of 83rd Street
dialog: and starts downtown.
text: Through a long lens we can see Joe, walking blocks behind
dialog: her.
dialog: As Kathleen and Joe make their way down Broadway we see the
dialog: West Side of Manhattan in the morning. Mothers and fathers
dialog: taking their kids to school, people on their way to work,
dialog: dogs being walked. School buses picking up kids, bakery
text: trucks dropping off brown bags of bread in the doorframes of
dialog: unopened restaurants.
dialog: Kathleen stops at a newsstand, says good morning to the

text: There are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large stuffed
dialog: animals reading children's books: Madeleine, Good Night Moon,
dialog: Where the Wild Things Are. A teddy bear in a pinafore is
dialog: reading The Stupids Step Out. Waiting for Kathleen in front
dialog: is one of her employees, CHRISTINA.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Hello, Christina. It's a beautiful
dialog: day. Isn't it the most beautiful
dialog: day?
text: Christina looks up at the sky as if seeing it for the first
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: I guess. Yeah, sure.
text: Kathleen unlocks the shop and cranks the grate, which rises,
text: making a horrible noise. Two cabs almost collide in front
text: of the store, with a screech, and one cabdriver starts yelling
text: obscenities at the other. Kathleen unlocks the door to the
dialog: store.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN

scene_heading: 18 INT. SHOP AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS 18
text: Kathleen turns the CLOSED sign on the door over to read "OPEN"

dialog: and we see a small but charming children's bookstore, with
text: wooden shelves, a tiny area where kids can sit and read,
dialog: some charming posters and a glass case full of first editions
dialog: of the Oz books and Alice In Wonderland, etc. There's a
text: playful display of witches, lit with twinkle lights covered
dialog: with orange pumpkin globes and a sign reading "The Ten Best
dialog: Witch List" and a collection of witch books -- "The Lion,
dialog: The Witch and the Wardrobe," "The Witches," "The Wizard of
dialog: Oz."
text: On the counter is a glass jar full of sugar-free lollipops.

text: Christina looks at her.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: What's going on with you?
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Well, don't do it. The minute you
dialog: do, they lose all respect for you.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: It's not like that. We just E-mail.
dialog: It's really nothing, on top of which
dialog: I'm definitely thinking of stopping
dialog: because it's getting --
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Out of hand?
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Confusing. But not really. Because
dialog: it's nothing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Where did you meet him?
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: I can't even remember.
dialog: (off Christina's look)
dialog: The day I turned thirty I wandered
dialog: into the Over Thirty Room for a joke,
dialog: sort of and he was there, and we
dialog: started chatting.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Books. Music. How much we both

dialog: We don't talk about anything personal.
dialog: We made a rule about that. I don't
dialog: know his name, what he does or exactly
dialog: where he lives, so it will be really

speaker_heading: CHRISTINA

speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Are you On Line?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: As far as I'm concerned, the Internet

speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: A handkerchief. Oh my, do children
dialog: not even know what handkerchiefs
dialog: are? A handkerchief is a Kleenex
dialog: you don't throw away. My mother
dialog: embroidered it for me -- you see?
dialog: My initials and a daisy, because
dialog: daisies are my favorite flower.
speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Orchids are my favorite flower.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: (to Joe)

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Kathleen Kelly. I own this store.
dialog: And you are?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Joe. Just call me Joe.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: We'll take these books.
dialog: He gets the one Matt is reading. And the two other Kathleen
dialog: has gotten for Annabel.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: These are wonderful books. As Annabel
dialog: gets older the characters in the
dialog: books do, too.
dialog: (to Annabel)

speaker_heading: ANNABEL
dialog: Foxbooks! My Daddy --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (gently putting his
dialog: hand over her mouth)
dialog: -- likes to buy at discount. Don't

dialog: nothing to be proud of --
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (spelling)
speaker_heading: F-O-X.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: That's amazing. You can spell fox.
dialog: Can you spell dog?
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: F-O-X.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Matt, look at this dinosaur book.
dialog: Wouldn't you like a dinosaur book?
dialog: Annabel, maybe you could read this
dialog: to Matt while I wrap things up here.
dialog: (moves them to a
dialog: corner, to them
dialog: quickly)
dialog: Sit down, read, and don't listen to
dialog: anything I say.
dialog: Returns to counter and gives Kathleen some cash.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: And the dinosaur book too.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: The world is not driven by discounts,

dialog: I used to watch her, and it wasn't
dialog: that she was selling books, it was
dialog: that she was helping people become
dialog: whoever they were going to turn out
dialog: to be. When you read a book as a
dialog: child it becomes part of your identity
dialog: in a way that no other reading in
dialog: your life does.
dialog: (stops herself)
dialog: I guess I've gotten carried away.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You have, and you've made me feel...
text: He can't finish the sentence. He looks at her and sees,
text: behind her on the shelf, a picture of a woman who is
text: unmistakably Kathleen's mother, with a young Kathleen.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT'D)
dialog: Enchanting, your mother was
dialog: enchanting.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: She was. How did you know that?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Lucky guess.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Anyway. She left the store to me,
dialog: and I'm going to leave it to my
dialog: daughter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How old is your daughter now?
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Oh, I'm not married. But eventually.

speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: And now, the book you've all been

speaker_heading: PATRICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: -- and I'm happy to report it is
dialog: just crammed with tragedy.
dialog: (she laughs gaily)
dialog: Just kidding, but seriously, it's

dialog: We see pictures of Veronica at eight with her sharecropper
dialog: family, Veronica at 14 with her first child, Veronica with a
dialog: series of husbands, Veronica in a wheelchair, etc.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: -- her third husband beat her up,

speaker_heading: PATRICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: This book is fabulous. And even if

dialog: to death on every talk show in
dialog: America. This book...
text: Patricia bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: PATRICIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't talk about it
dialog: without crying. Veronica and I have
dialog: so much in common -- well, not all
dialog: the sad parts -- but we were both
dialog: famous by the time we were 29 and,
dialog: believe me, that's rough.
dialog: (wipes her nose with
dialog: a Kleenex, pulling
dialog: herself together)
dialog: Anyway, I just want to say that I'm
dialog: especially thrilled to be publishing
dialog: it. Veronica lives in my building
dialog: and we met in the elevator. By the
dialog: time we had traveled from the eighth
dialog: floor to the first, we had a deal.

dialog: I actually knew what I wanted to say
dialog: and I said it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I think you have a gift for it. It
dialog: was a splendid mixture of poetry and
dialog: meanness.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Meanness? Let me tell you --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't misunderstand me, I'm just
dialog: paying you a compliment.
text: He lifts the book off the table. Kathleen grabs for it.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Why are you doing this?
text: She manages to get the book, leaving Joe with the rose.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: p. 85
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What have we have? A red, no, crimson
text: rose, tucked into the pages.
dialog: Something you read about in a book,
dialog: no doubt. One of those books with a
dialog: lady in a nightgown on the cover
text: about to throw herself off a cliff.
text: She holds her hand out for it.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Give it to me.
text: Joe puts it between his mouth and his nose like a mustache.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's a joke to you, isn't it?
dialog: Everything's a joke to you.
text: She grabs the rose. Puts it back in the book.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Please leave. I beg you.
text: He stands up, walks from the table, sits down at the very
text: next table, with his back to her.
text: The door to the restaurant opens. Kathleen looks at it
dialog: hopefully. A pleasant looking man, who's immediately joined
dialog: by a pleasant looking woman.
text: For a moment, Kathleen looks just a little droopy, as if the
text: wind has just gone out of her sails. She takes out her
text: compact, looks into her mirror. She slides it over to look
text: behind her, at him, just as he's looking sideways at her.
text: He turns away suddenly.
text: Then she blots her lipstick with her handkerchief.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You know what the handkerchief reminds
dialog: me of? The first day I met you --
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: The first day you lied to me --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I didn't lie to you --
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: You did too --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I did not --

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: I thought all that Fox stuff was so
dialog: charming. F-O-X.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I never lied about it --
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: "Joe. Just call me Joe." As if you
dialog: were one of those stupid 22-year-old
dialog: girls with no last name. "Hi, I'm
dialog: Kimberley." "Hi, I'm Janice." What's
dialog: wrong with them? Don't they know
dialog: you're supposed to have last names?
dialog: It's like they're a whole generation
dialog: of cocktail waitresses.
dialog: She stops herself -- it's a tangent she never meant to go
text: off on. But Joe has stood up and seated himself back at her
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I am not a stupid 22-year-old girl --
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: That's not what I meant --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And when I said the thing about the
dialog: Price Club and cans of olive oil,
dialog: that wasn't what I meant either --
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: Oh, you poor sad multimillionaire.
dialog: I feel so sorry for you.
text: The door opens and a large and very attractive TRANSVESTITE
text: in a boa comes in the door.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I am going to take a wild guess that
dialog: this isn't him, either. Who is he,
dialog: I wonder. Not, I gather, the world's
dialog: greatest living expert on Julius and
dialog: Ethel Rosenberg, but someone else
dialog: entirely. Will you be you be mean
dialog: to him too? Will you start out sweet
dialog: as sugar candy and then suddenly,
dialog: miraculously, like a bolt from the
dialog: blue, find that sharp little tongue
dialog: of yours?

scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: No, I won't. Because the man who's

dialog: here is kind and funny -- he has the
dialog: most wonderful sense of humor --
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But he's not here.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN
dialog: If he's not here, he has a reason,
dialog: because there is not a cruel or
dialog: careless bone in his body. I can't
dialog: expect you to know anything about a
dialog: person like that. You've nothing
dialog: but a suit.

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN

speaker_heading: KATHLEEN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Not possible.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN

speaker_heading: CHRISTINA
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: KATHLEEN

speaker_heading: CHRISTINA

dialog: Dead silence.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GEORGE

dialog: but what if it did? No matter what
dialog: he's done to me, there's no excuse
dialog: for my behavior. Anyway, you are my
dialog: dear friend, and I so wanted to talk
dialog: to you. I hope you have a good reason
dialog: for not being there last night, but
dialog: if you don't, and if we never really

dialog: But I'm absolutely sure that whatever
dialog: you said last night was provoked,

speaker_heading: JOE
