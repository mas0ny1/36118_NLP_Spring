speaker_heading: ELWOOD - Yes.

speaker_heading: ELWOOD - From what?
speaker_heading: SANDERSON - Uh - trauma - spelled

speaker_heading: SANDERSON - Exactly.
dialog: ELWOOD - Uh - but I wouldn't want Veta to

dialog: and wants to stay here.
dialog: SANDERSON - Well, if this were an ordinary

dialog: But this - this is more serious. It stands
dialog: to reason nobody has ever seen a white

dialog: ELWOOD - Well, not very often, Doctor.
dialog: SANDERSON - So she must be committed here
