dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"
text: ... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.
text: The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.
text: The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is
dialog: fighting.
text: In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.
text: The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA. He is thirty years old.
text: His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black
text: hair shines and hangs in his eyes. Rocky fights in a
text: plodding, machine-like style. The BLACK FIGHTER dances and
text: bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.
text: But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins
text: at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.
text: The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for
text: blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.
text: In the thick smoke they resemble spectres. Everyone is
text: hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.
text: A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.
text: The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...
text: Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.
text: The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers
text: across the ring at Rocky.
speaker_heading: BLACK FIGHTER
dialog: (to cornerman)
dialog: ... I'm gonna bust his head
dialog: wide open!
text: In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,
text: balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He
text: works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: CORNERMAN
dialog: (lackluster)
dialog: ... Ya waltzin' -- Give the
text: suckers some action.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Hey --
speaker_heading: CORNERMAN
dialog: (overriding)
dialog: Ya movin' like a bum -- Want
dialog: some advice --
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... Just gimme the water.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with
text: yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.
speaker_heading: FAN
dialog: Should I bet the fight don't
dialog: go the distance -- Ya feel
dialog: strong?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: CORNERMAN
dialog: ... Ya want some good advice?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... I just want the mouthpiece.
text: The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross. The
text: fighters engage in battle. The other fighter grabs Rocky in
text: a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding
text: cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.
text: Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into
text: the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the
text: fighter is out for the night. The fans throw rubbish into
text: the ring. Rocky ignores it.
text: The fans loudly go about collecting bets. The referee does
text: not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under
text: the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher. Two new
text: fighters enter the ring. Rocky slips on a tattered robe.
text: Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER
dialog: Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a
dialog: six rounder between local
dialog: lightweights.
text: Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a
text: cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher
text: passes behind him. He watches for a moment and continues up
text: the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the
text: BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky
text: fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.
scene_heading: THE TITLE CREDITS END:
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his
text: locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other
text: fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER #1
dialog: ... Tomorrow me an' my woman
dialog: are gonna tip on down to
dialog: Atlantic City, man.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER #2
dialog: ... It's cold, Bro'.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER #1
dialog: ... That's right, I got the
dialog: city to myself...
text: Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and
text: spit nervously on the floor.
text: A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO
text: that is BLASTING MUSIC.
text: The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer
text: and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters
text: are smoking. The room is cloudy.
text: A short man of fifty enters. He is dressed in a sweater
text: buttoned over a t-shirt.
speaker_heading: PROMOTER
dialog: ...Balboa!?
text: Rocky raises his head. The promoter steps over.
speaker_heading: PROMOTER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... Twenty bucks for the
dialog: locker an' cornerman -- Two
dialog: bucks for the towel an'
dialog: shower, seven for tax -- The
dialog: house owes ya, sixty-one
dialog: dollars.
text: The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his
text: locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT
text: Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The
text: trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The
text: black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes
text: self-conscious.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (almost apologetic)
dialog: I'm a fighter.
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (tired)
dialog: ... Yo' iz an accident.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves
text: at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.
text: Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty
text: bookstore. Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.
text: Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the
text: "ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and
text: sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window. He mumbles to
text: the dog and continues to the corner.
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located
text: in the most deprived section of South Philly. He kicks away
text: the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and
text: enters.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: The narrow hallway is painted olive brown. A single light
text: bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Rocky enters. The one-room apartment is drab, with a
text: curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...
text: Nailed against the far wall is a mattress. The mattress is
text: used as a punching bag. Stuffing spills out of the center.
text: Rocky drops his coat on the floor. He puts on a pair of
text: glasses. He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the
dialog: creatures.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ...Look who's home.
text: Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then
text: places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph. The
text: record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."
text: ... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his
text: hairbrush. Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the
text: record. He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning
text: to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a
text: bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.
text: The water boils. Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
scene_heading: EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN
text: We SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering
text: figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it
text: sits majestically above City Hall...
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING
text: Rocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid
text: over one eye. He looks at the rugged stevedores going about
text: their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool
text: jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.
text: Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked
text: car. These men look like blood drinkers.
speaker_heading: MAFIA #1
dialog: Yo, Rock -- How's your Boss?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Real good.
speaker_heading: MAFIA #2
dialog: Fightin' again?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yeah, here an' there.
speaker_heading: MAFIA #1
dialog: Mebbe we make sum money
dialog: togather soon... Give ya boss
dialog: my best.
text: Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working
text: the crane. The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the
text: crane and hurries into the ship's hole. Rocky dashes up the
dialog: gangplank.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP - DAY
text: The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked
text: crates and coffee beans.
text: Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by
text: the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (terror-filled)
dialog: Don't hit the face! Not the
dialog: face!!
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Mr. Gazzo wants the two
dialog: hundred now!
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Honest to God I'm broke --
dialog: Gimme a break.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Mr. Gazzo says I should get
dialog: two hundred or break the thumb.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Please, I need my hands to
dialog: work -- Christ, don't bust my
dialog: thumbs.
text: At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by
text: stevedores. Rocky remains cool.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Goin' fishin'?
text: The man drops the hook.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: What's ya name again?
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Bob.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance,
dialog: ya gotta pay the band -- If ya
dialog: borrow, ya gotta pay the man...
dialog: Me, I ain't emotionally
dialog: involved.
text: Rocky's determined expression strikes home. The fat man
text: quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small
dialog: wad of bills.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing; counting)
dialog: A hundred an' thirty.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: That's it, I'm broke.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: That's it? -- Completely?
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: What about for food an' stuff?
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: You have my food in ya hand.
text: Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's
text: flushed expression.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... The juice is climbin'
dialog: every week.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: I know the juice is climbin' --
dialog: I been workin' six months just
dialog: to pay the damn interest.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Ya still light seventy.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't
dialog: have to break nothin' -- Here,
dialog: take my coat, it's worth
dialog: fifty-sixty dollars. It's
dialog: yours.
text: The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's
dialog: don't have to know nuthin'.
dialog: I'll go tape up the hand like
dialog: ya broke my thumb. Gazzo
dialog: won't be wise to nothin' -- Be
dialog: a smart guy, keep the coat,
dialog: we'll fake like ya broke the
dialog: hand.
text: The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the
text: man's thumb and bends him to his knees.
speaker_heading: FATS
dialog: (almost a whisper)
dialog: No - no - no - Please -
dialog: Please - Please don't...
text: Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock. The
dialog: thumb is fine.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ...That's what coulda happened.
dialog: (walks off.)
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in
text: South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking. In
text: the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed
dialog: Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.
text: He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies. He taps the
text: window and whistles. He SEES a girl behind the counter and
text: presses his face against the window and does his impression
text: of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The girl nervously looks
dialog: away.
text: The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN. She is not
text: very attractive, but pleasant-looking. Thirty years old.
text: Brown hair pulled back. Light skinned. She wears glasses.
text: Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so
text: painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.
scene_heading: INT. PET SHOP - DAY
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: ... Could you take the puppy
dialog: out --
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: It can breathe.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Please -
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Please, nothin' - I paid for
dialog: this dog and can do whatever I
dialog: want with it - I can throw it
dialog: through the window if I want -
dialog: Now give me my two dollars
dialog: back before I do throw it
text: through the window.
text: Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches
text: the bag out of her hand. He removes the puppy and hands it
dialog: to Adrian.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Get away from me - Give me that!
text: Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it
text: to the lady... She nervously exits.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... How's the turtle food this
dialog: week?
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: ... Fine.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: ... I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Ain't your fault - Here's the
dialog: problem.
text: Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: The last food I got here had
dialog: more moths than flies -- An'
dialog: the moths get caught in my
dialog: turtle's throat -- That makes
dialog: them cough --
text: The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and
text: waves at Rocky.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin'
dialog: about the turtle food -- Like
dialog: I was sayin', the moths get
text: caught in the turtle's throat
dialog: an' makes 'em cough...
dialog: (coughs)
dialog: A little cough an' I gotta
dialog: smack 'em on the shell -- An'
dialog: whatta think they get?
text: Adrian shrugs.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I smack 'em hard on the shell
dialog: an' they get... What?
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: ... I don't know.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Shell-shocked!
text: Both the Owner and Adrian smile.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Startin' with the bad jokes
dialog: early today, huh.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
text: Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop...
text: Inside is a huge dog.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How's Butkus this mornin'?
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Ain't had time to check 'em.
text: Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks
dialog: very happy.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yo, Butkus -- Dead. Play dead.
text: The dog plays dead.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ...What kinda dog is this again?
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: Bullmastiff.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: The owner was suppose to pick
dialog: him up three weeks ago.
speaker_heading: OWNER
dialog: We're not responsible for
dialog: animals left over thirty
dialog: days - We board it ain't a
dialog: animal shelter, Y'know.
dialog: ...Adrian, I want you to clean
dialog: all those cat cages downstairs,
dialog: they're a mess.
dialog: (Adrian nods.)
text: Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.
scene_heading: EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAY
text: Gazzo picks up Rocky.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAY
text: MR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat...
text: Rocky is in the back seat.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: He only had a hundred an'
dialog: thirty. -- I think he's good
dialog: for the rest next week, Mr.
dialog: Gazzo.
speaker_heading: GAZZO
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for

speaker_heading: GAZZO
dialog: Tomorrow collect from Del
dialog: Rio -- He's late three weeks.
dialog: How'd you do last night?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... Fine.
text: Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the
text: mirror and smiles.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: Did ya get the license number?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Of wa?
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: ... Of the truck that run over
dialog: your face.
text: Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky.
speaker_heading: GAZZO
dialog: Yo Rock. Did I give you a job
dialog: this mornin? How come ya
dialog: didn't break this guy's thumb
dialog: like I asked ya? When ya
dialog: don't do what ya are told, it
dialog: makes me look bad, kid.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I figure if I break the thumb
dialog: this guy gets thrown outta his
dialog: job and can't pay nothin no
dialog: more.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: GAZZO
dialog: It don't matter. It's my
dialog: reputation. These guys think
dialog: they can get off light. It's
dialog: bad for my reputation -- It's
dialog: bad for business. See ya
dialog: killer.
text: Gazzo gets into his car.
speaker_heading: GAZZO
dialog: (to Bodyguard)
dialog: ... The Rock's a good kid.
speaker_heading: BODYGUARD
dialog: (emotionless)
dialog: ... A meatbag.
text: They pull away.
scene_heading: EXT. GYM - DAY
text: Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to
text: Goldmill's Gym. On the way he passes several familiar
text: people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman
text: who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY. It is
text: apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind
dialog: and mentally defective.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: ...See the fight last night?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nah, I was fightin' myself.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: Apollo Creed beat the bum to
dialog: pieces.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. GYM - DAY
text: Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy
text: spoons. Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive
text: among themselves. Two winos lean against the entrance.
text: Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full. The
text: MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes
text: the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of
text: machinery. Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers
text: BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of
text: the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the
text: THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
text: The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five
dialog: percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.
text: As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to
text: wave and yell greetings.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER #1
dialog: Hey, hear ya knocked Spider
dialog: Rice out in the sixth?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: The third -- Shoulda seen it.
text: Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER #2
dialog: (removes glove)
dialog: Hey, Rock, touch my hand.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: How come?
speaker_heading: FIGHTER #2
dialog: C'mon, it's important.
text: Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER #2
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Can ya tell I just whacked-off?
text: Rocky smiles and moves away.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
text: The dressing room is lined with dented lockers. Wooden
text: benches stretch across the room. On the wall is a sign that
text: reads, "NO KISSING."
text: Rocky goes to his locker. He tries to open it but fails.
text: He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.
text: Still it does not open. He shakes the lock forcefully, no
text: luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the
dialog: situation.
text: After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the
text: bench and smashes open the lock. Opening the door Rocky is
text: taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (mumbling)
dialog: ... These ain't my clothes.
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
text: He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside
text: of the door.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ... These ain't my pictures.
text: A short powerful man of thirty-five enters. His hair looks
text: like it has been shaped with hedge clippers. His name is
dialog: MIKE.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yo, Mike -- What's happenin'
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It ain't your locker no more.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Whatta ya talkin' about it
dialog: ain't my locker no more?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Listen, I'm with you -- But ya
dialog: gotta talk to Mickey -- I put
dialog: ya stuff in the bag over there.
text: Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping
text: bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head
text: into the shower room. Two Latin fighters are lathering up.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER
dialog: ...Hey, Peanut, gimme some
dialog: soap, Man.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (irate)
dialog: Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
dialog: Nobody -- You don't call me
dialog: Peanut.
speaker_heading: FIGHTER
dialog: Peanut, gimme some soap.
text: The fighters laugh. Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap
text: from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter. It
text: hits just above the man's head. The fighters are shocked
text: into silence.
text: Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them
text: loudly in Spanish.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. GYM - DAY
text: Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their
dialog: training routines.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: You were ready to bite that
text: guy's face.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah -- See the fight last
dialog: night? Apollo Creed beat that
dialog: English guy bad.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Creed's great.
text: Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to
dialog: another chore...
scene_heading: INT. GYM - DAY
text: The Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance. He
text: wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies.
text: Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I don't care what nobody says,
dialog: this bum Creed woulda never
dialog: made it in the Thirties --
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (monotoned)
dialog: ... What?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I said, how ya feelin'?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (dryly)
dialog: Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (low)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (spitting)
dialog: Then stand there an' wait till
dialog: I'm done -- Creed's good,
dialog: yeah, he's real fine but I
dialog: gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I was talkin' with ya man,
dialog: Mike. -- Hey, how come I been
dialog: put outta my locker?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Dipper needed it.
text: Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a
text: young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Dipper's a climber -- You're a
dialog: tomato.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... Tomato?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Facts is facts. I run a
dialog: business here -- I'm cleanin'
dialog: house --
text: Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his
text: trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM."
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How old are ya?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ...What?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: How old?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Come July, twenty-five.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: More like thirty.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Twenty-five, thirty -- What's
dialog: the difference? -- It took me
dialog: two months to learn the
dialog: combination of that locker.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: The legs must be goin'.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yeah, they're goin', -- that's
dialog: nature... That was my locker
dialog: for six years.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: ... Did ya fight last night?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yeah --
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Did ya win?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yeah, Kayo.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: ... Who'd ya fight?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Spider Rice.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: Rice is a bum.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: You think everybody I fight is
text: a bum.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Ain't they?
text: Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a
text: rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ya want the truth -- Ya got
dialog: heart, but ya fight like an
dialog: ape -- The only thing special
dialog: about you is ya never got ya
dialog: nose broke -- keep ya nose
dialog: pretty -- what's left of ya
dialog: brain an' retire.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Listen, I'm gonna take a
dialog: steam -- Did good last night --
dialog: Shoulda seen it.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Hey, ever think about retirin'?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ...No.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Think about it.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yeah, sure.
text: Shrugging, Rocky moves away.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: ...I think I'm gonna take a
dialog: steam -- Shoulda seen me
dialog: fight -- Did good, y'know.
text: Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (gesturing
dialog: towards Rocky)
dialog: Known him since he was

speaker_heading: TRAINER

scene_heading: EXT. PET SHOP - DUSK

scene_heading: INT. PET SHOP - DUSK

speaker_heading: ROCKY

speaker_heading: ROCKY

dialog: Ah -- I came in here for

scene_heading: EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Catch pneumonia out there --

text: Andy casually nods towards the men's room.
text: Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on

scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT
text: Rocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with
text: years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall.
text: PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only
text: remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his
text: early thirties. He is medium height. Brown hair. Square
dialog: shouldered. He has a foul personality... A classic
dialog: misanthrope.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yo, Paulie.
speaker_heading: PAULIE

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yeah, like I was a plate of

speaker_heading: PAULIE

dialog: Ya caught me in a bad mood.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Ya always in a bad mood --
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: ... Adrian ain't sharp.
text: The restroom stench is overwhelming... Rocky covers his nose
text: with the neckline of his t-shirt.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: She's a loser -- She don't
dialog: enjoy life -- She reads --
dialog: Brainy -- Pushin' thirty

scene_heading: INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: The girl's dryin' up! She's

dialog: body dries up!! You're a pal,
dialog: Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... Sure.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Tomorrow you come for some
dialog: bird, right?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Absolutely...
text: Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth... Rocky steps
text: to the bar. Andy leans over to him.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That was alotta crap to go
dialog: through for a dinner invite.
text: Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a
text: suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.
text: The SPORTS COMMENTATOR is at the airport and about to
dialog: interview the heavyweight champion of the world, APOLLO
text: CREED. Creed is twenty-eight years old. He is a tall,
text: smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee-
dialog: colored face...
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR

speaker_heading: APOLLO

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR
dialog: Any quick advice for young
dialog: boxing hopefuls?
speaker_heading: APOLLO
dialog: (looks straight
dialog: into the camera)
dialog: ... Stay in school an' use

dialog: leather briefcase an' forget
dialog: about sports!! Sports can
dialog: only make ya grunt an' smell --
dialog: Be a thinker not a stinker!!
text: Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR
dialog: Jerry Simpson at Kennedy
dialog: Airport with the Champion,
dialog: Apollo Creed.
text: The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at
text: the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking
text: the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Nobody cares what's happenin'
dialog: in the world of sports
dialog: nomore -- Downhill. Baseball,
dialog: downhill -- Basketball,

dialog: use to be America's best
dialog: sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Clown.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: He took his best shot an'

dialog: you ever take?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with
dialog: yourself? Fine. But me, I
dialog: gotta business here -- I don't
dialog: need to take no shot.
text: Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie
text: slumped unconscious in the booth.
text: Rocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (continuing; boldly)
dialog: Take a shot, he says! -- Sure,
dialog: I'll take a shot!
text: Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot.
scene_heading: EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT
text: Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window
text: hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are
text: several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN. They are much too young to be
text: out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to
dialog: Rocky.
speaker_heading: CHIPPED TOOTH
dialog: (aggressively)
dialog: Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... No wine -- Bad for ya'

dialog: 'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme
dialog: a dollar.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: No dollar.
speaker_heading: CHIPPED TOOTH
dialog: Hey, give Rocky a dime.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN #2
dialog: ... How come?
speaker_heading: CHIPPED TOOTH
dialog: So he can call all his friends.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (mildly embarrassed)
dialog: ... That's an old one.
speaker_heading: CHIPPED TOOTH
dialog: Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
text: Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who
text: is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya
dialog: brother know you're hangin'
dialog: out so late?
text: The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting
text: to impress her friends.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: ... Screw you.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (awed)
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: ... Screw you, yoyo.
text: The gang laughs. Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Did these guys teach you to
dialog: talk dirty? Huh?
dialog:

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Hey --
speaker_heading: ROCKY

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Stuff it, man!
speaker_heading: ROCKY

dialog: -- You guys talk like that in
dialog: front of a little girl -- You
dialog: guys are scum.
speaker_heading: CHIPPED TOOTH
dialog: This is our place, dig!
text: The gang reluctantly backs up a step.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Don't ya never come round this
dialog: girl -- Go home.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN #2
dialog: This is our corner, man! You
dialog: go, chump!
text: Rocky moves forward and they scatter... They quickly move off.
speaker_heading: CHIPPED TOOTH

dialog: We'll kill you, man -- We
dialog: gotta gun.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent
dialog: ya face!
text: Rocky leads the girl away.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Rocky is walking the young girl home... They are presently
text: cutting through a dark public school yard. They pass
text: through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights
text: located at the top of the school building. The atmosphere
text: is somewhat eerie.
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: How come ya wanna hang out
dialog: with those guys? They teach
dialog: ya bad things.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I like 'em. If you don't you
dialog: can f--
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Hey! When I was your age,
dialog: there was only one girl who
dialog: talked like that in the whole
dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (bored)
dialog: ... Yeah.
text: She attempts to light a cigarette... Rocky nonchalantly
text: tosses it to the ground.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Make your teeth yella --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I like yella teeth.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Makes your breath like garbage.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Maybe I like garbage.
text: Rocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Nobody likes garbage --
dialog: Anyway, this girl with the
dialog: dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
dialog: but the guys wouldn't take her
dialog: out for any serious datin'.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: 'Cause that's the way guys
dialog: are -- They laugh when ya talk
dialog: dirty. They think ya cute for
dialog: a while, but then ya getta
dialog: reputation an' watch out.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: ROCKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody's ever gonna take ya
dialog: serious. Ya get no respect...
dialog: I gotta use a bad word --
dialog: Whore. You'll end up maybe
dialog: becomin' a whore.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: That doesn't matter -- You
dialog: don't really have to be a
dialog: whore, just act like one an'
dialog: that's it.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
dialog: years from now people will say
dialog: 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
dialog: who was she?' 'She was that
dialog: little whore who hung out at
dialog: the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
dialog: now I remember!'... See, they
dialog: don't remember you, they
dialog: remember the rep.
text: Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the
text: shadows of the building are three young muggers. The light
text: from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.
text: The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them
text: down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the
text: three. The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of
text: twenty yards. Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his
text: nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders...
text: The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander
dialog: away.
text: Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (points down
dialog: the block)
dialog: ... That's your house, ain't it?
text: Marie nods.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Listen, I hope ya don't --

dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: What was I gonna say?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Ya hope I don't keep acting
dialog: like a whore or I'll turn into
dialog: one, right?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Ya, somethin' like that.
text: They exchange smiles and Marie moves away. Rocky has made
dialog: an impact on her life.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Goodnight, Rocky.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: 'Night, Marie.
text: She takes a few more steps and pauses again.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: ... Fuck you, Creepo!!!
text: The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (walks off)
dialog: ... Yeah, who're you to give

speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: -- And has made contractual

speaker_heading: JERGENS

dialog: Perhaps you're right, and no

speaker_heading: APOLLO

speaker_heading: TRAINER

speaker_heading: CLEANER

speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: ... It is just hard for me to

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Ya gotta be a little soft to
dialog: wanna be a pug... It's a

dialog: guaranteed to end up a bum.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: I don't think you're a bum.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... I'm at least half a bum.
dialog: Yeah, fightin' is a crazy

speaker_heading: ADRIAN

speaker_heading: ROCKY

dialog: Did you hear what I said?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Sure, an' I'm smart enough to

dialog: dinner.

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR
dialog: A Bicentennial Fight --
dialog: January first. It will be the
dialog: first sporting event on our
dialog: two hundredth birthday and is
dialog: already being called by many
dialog: the greatest farce in sports
dialog: history. If this man lasts
dialog: more than a minute I would say
text: he's on borrowed time.
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: It's matches like this with
dialog: their exorbitant prices that
dialog: give sports a bad name -- Not

speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Without havin' good people

text: Adrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude.
text: She faces him.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Einstein flunked out of

speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: That so.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN

text: Rocky stands in Adrian's doorway. He kisses her.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: See ya tomorrow.
text: Rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he
text: converses with Adrian who remains upstairs. His VOICE
text: ECHOES up the stairwell.
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How'd ya like hearin' ya name
dialog: on TV?
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: I don't know -- I was shocked.
dialog: Why did you do that?
speaker_heading: ROCKY

speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Absolutely -- What time should
dialog: I expect you?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: 'Bout seven.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: I'll be waiting.
text: Rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the
text: top floor landing.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Y'know how I said that stuff
dialog: on television didn't bother me?
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: It did.

text: Gazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front.

speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: A few bucks.
text: Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills.
speaker_heading: GAZZO
dialog: Here's five hundred -- Put it
dialog: in your glove.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Do I have to pay juice?
text: Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to
dialog: imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?"
text: Gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at

scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Rocky returns home and enters his apartment. After turning
text: on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER. He now feeds
dialog: the turtles.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Look who's home!
text: Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold. He
text: approaches them with a sense of awe. He opens and reads one.
text: Settling on the bed, he reads the other.
text: A KNOCK is HEARD. Rocky opens the door. Mickey Goldmill,
text: the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (stiffly)
dialog: I seen the light. I figure
dialog: somebody was home.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'
dialog: here? Here, sit down.
text: Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Best seat in the house -- Hey,
dialog: Mick, this is too much.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
dialog: but seein' ya here, in my
dialog: house, it's kinda outta joint.
text: By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious
text: something important is preying on his mind.
text: Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at
text: having outsiders see how he lives.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Listen, Rock, you're a very
dialog: lucky guy.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: What's happened is freak luck.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Freak luck for sure.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Look at all them other fighters.
dialog: Real good boys. Good records.
dialog: Colorful. Fight their hearts
dialog: out for peanuts -- But who
dialog: cared? Nobody. They got it
text: shoved in their back door.
dialog: Nobody ever give them a shot
dialog: at the title...
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: Freak luck is a strange thing.
text: Mickey does not hear. His attention is drawn to the turtles.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Whatta' those?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Turtles -- domestic turtles.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (businesslike)
dialog: I'm here tellin' ya to be very
dialog: smart with this shot. Like
dialog: the Bible sez, ya don't get no
dialog: second chance.
text: Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ya need a manager. An advisor.
dialog: I been in the racket fifty
dialog: years. I done it all, there
dialog: ain't nothin' about the world
dialog: of pugilism that ain't livin'
dialog: up here.
text: He lights a half-smoked cigar.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (at a loss)
dialog: Fifty years, huh.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (stronger)
dialog: Fifty years. The rep is known
dialog: around Philly, an' a good rep
dialog: can't be bought, but I don't
dialog: have to tell you that.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: How 'bout a glass of water?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (uneasy)
dialog: ... What?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (driving each
dialog: word hard)
dialog: I done it all. I've done an'
dialog: seen everything'. Believe
dialog: what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya
dialog: shoulda seen the night in
dialog: Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny'
dialog: Russo outta the ring, September
dialog: 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo
dialog: knocked Dempsey outta the ring.
dialog: But who got the Press? He did.
dialog: He had a manager -- September
dialog: 14, 1923.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Ya got a good mind for dates.
text: Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Look at this face -- twenty-
text: one stitches over the left
dialog: eye, thirty-four over the
dialog: right -- my nose was busted
dialog: seventeen times, the last
dialog: being the Sailor Mike fight
dialog: New Year's Eve, 1940, in
dialog: Camden, New Jersey -- What a
dialog: professional pastin' I give
dialog: him. Here, read about it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: MICKEY (CONT'D)
dialog: (shows a tiny
dialog: press clipping;
dialog: points to
dialog: cauliflower ear)
dialog: An' he give me the vegetable
dialog: on the ear. I got pain an'
dialog: experience... an' you got
dialog: heart -- kinda remind me of
dialog: Marciano, ya do.
text: Rocky points to his most prized possession.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Nobody ever said that --
dialog: There's his picture.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Yeah, ya kinda remind me of
dialog: the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
text: Mickey has rung the bell. Nothing could please Rocky more
text: than being compared to his idol.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Really think so?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Ya got heart.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Heart, but I ain't got no
dialog: Tocker.
text: Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a
text: crouch.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Christ, I know this business.
dialog: Rocky, when I was fightin' it
dialog: was the dirtiest racket goin',
dialog: see. Pugs like me was treated
dialog: like fightin' dogs -- throw ya
dialog: in the pit an' for ten bucks
dialog: ya try to kill each other. We
dialog: had no management...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MICKEY (CONT'D)
dialog: fought in boxcars, in
dialog: whorehouse basements, any
dialog: joint with a floor -- October
dialog: 1931 I fought a bum who put a
text: tack in the thumb of his glove
dialog: an' punched so many holes in
dialog: my face I had spit shootin'
dialog: outta my cheeks -- I never had
dialog: no manager watchin' out for
dialog: me -- See that picture outside
dialog: the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,'
dialog: that's me in my prime. I had
dialog: all the tools. I coulda
dialog: starched any lightweight husky
dialog: on the East Coast -- But I had
dialog: no management. Nobody ever
dialog: got to know how slick I was,
dialog: but I had a head for business
dialog: an' stashed a few bucks an'
dialog: opened the gym -- It's a dirt
dialog: hole, I know it, but that an'
dialog: a lotta scars is what I got to
dialog: show for fifty years in the
dialog: business, kid -- now you come
dialog: along with this shot an' I
dialog: feel like it's me gettin' the
dialog: shot I never got... Yeah, we
dialog: was treated like dogs -- like
dialog: them Dago's, no offense, in
dialog: the Colosseum in Rome there --
dialog: An' now I got all this
dialog: knowledge, I wanna give it to
dialog: ya so I can protect ya an'
dialog: make sure ya get the best deal
dialog: ya can!
text: Rocky rises and opens a window.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Respect, I always dished ya
dialog: respect.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... Ya gave Dipper my locker.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (almost begging)
dialog: I'm sorry, I -- I made a
dialog: mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man
dialog: to man. I wanna be ya manager.
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: The fight's set -- I don't
dialog: need a manager.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Look, you can't buy what I
dialog: know. Ya can't. I've seen it
dialog: all! I got pain an' I got
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I got pain an' experience too.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Please, kid.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: Whatever I got, I always got
dialog: on the slide. This shot's no
dialog: different. I didn't earn
dialog: nothin' -- I got it on the
dialog: slide... I needed ya help
dialog: about ten years ago when I was
dialog: startin', but ya never helped
dialog: me none.
text: Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He
text: remains on one knee.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: If ya was wantin' my help, why
dialog: didn't ya ask? Just ask.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I asked, but ya never helped
dialog: nothin'! -- Like the Bible
dialog: sez, ya don't get no second
dialog: chance.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (yells)
dialog: Rocky, I'm seventy-six years
dialog: old. Maybe you can be the
dialog: winner I never was -- your
dialog: shot is my last shot!
text: Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the
dialog: door.
text: Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.
text: Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself
text: into bed. Springing up a second later, he runs outside.
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form
text: of Mickey. Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old
text: man beneath a street lamp. He places an arm around his
dialog: shoulder.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
text: The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at
text: exactly four A.M. Not accustomed to rising this early, with
text: great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to
text: the bathroom. He turns the light on and roaches scatter.
text: At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams. Rocky fills
text: the basin and submerges his face in cold water.
text: Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs. He
text: cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one
text: swill... his body quivers.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
text: Rocky steps outside. He is dressed in a well-worn sweat
text: suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers. It is pitch dark and
text: his steaming breath attests to the cold.
text: He begins running down the center of the deserted street.
text: He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the
text: street lamps.
text: Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.
scene_heading: EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN
text: Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight
text: of stairs. He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear
text: into the morning gray. Taking a deep breath, he starts up.
text: From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his
text: legs give way. Standing, he brushes off and descends the
dialog: stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN
text: Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river. He pauses,
text: heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths. He throws several
text: lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his
text: aching sides. Men delivering the morning papers observe
dialog: with amusement.
text: Rocky forces himself to begin running again.
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWN
text: Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an
text: elevated train station. The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to
text: blend perfectly with his muscular running style.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS - DAWN
text: The sky is beginning to lighten. The fighter now runs along
text: the piers and past anchored freighters.
scene_heading: EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN
text: It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform
text: belonging to Eastern Packing Company. Alongside the loading
text: platform come several boxcars.
text: Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door. It soon
text: opens and Paulie guides him inside. Paulie is drunk.
scene_heading: INT. SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: How ya feelin'?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (panting)
dialog: ... Tight.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: I got whiskey here.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... No.
text: Rocky notices TWO PUERTO RICANS lounging alongside theshipping office.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: This is the guy who's fightin'
dialog: Apollo Creed.
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: (heavy accent)
dialog: Good luck -- Kill him, man.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (as though
dialog: rehearsed badly)
dialog: Hip -- Hip -- Hooray! C'mon --
dialog: Hip -- Hip --
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: (walks away)
dialog: Hooray, man.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Rock'll be comin' by every
dialog: mornin' to pick up some
dialog: Prime -- can't train on that
dialog: store crap.
text: Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to
text: the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.
scene_heading: INT. FREEZER - DAY
text: They enter. The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber...
text: row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the
text: darkness to the far end of the refrigerator. The blower
text: overhead causes the men to speak loudly.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
dialog: up hangin' on the hook, right?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Gazzo's a good man.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: How 'bout you talk to 'em
dialog: about me?
dialog: (tightly)
dialog: Please do me that favor.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Keep this job, ya eat better.
text: Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat. He
text: swills whiskey from a pint bottle.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Y'know, d'ya think you an' my
dialog: sister -- Ah, doin' good
dialog: together?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Whatta you think?
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Ain't sure, what's the story?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: The story -- what's happenin'?
text: Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for
dialog: quite a while.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ya really like her?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Sure I like her.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (nervous laughter)
dialog: What's the attraction? I
dialog: don't see it?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I dunno -- she fills gaps.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: What gaps?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (shrugs and
dialog: takes meat)
dialog: She got gaps. I got gaps --
dialog: together we fill the gaps.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: You ballin' her?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (turns around)
dialog: Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
dialog: sister.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (tersely)
dialog: C'mon, ya screwin' her?
text: From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: That's why I can't put ya
dialog: together with Gazzo, cause ya
dialog: talk too much -- big mouth.
text: Paulie reddens. He steps forward and slams his fists in a
dialog: hanging beef.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
text: The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky
dialog: responds.
text: Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.
text: The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging
text: corpse. Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.
text: Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as
text: though he were locked in total battle.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: Hit the rump. The rump!
dialog: Ya'll break the ribs!
text: Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of
text: beef. Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every
text: punch, like he were receiving it. Rocky moves into the dark
text: recess of the refrigerator. Only the dull SOUNDS of his
text: POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.
text: Rocky works his way to Paulie again. Every hanging beef
text: swings and appears surrealistically alive.
speaker_heading: PAULIE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We do that to Creed an'
dialog: they'll take us to jail for
dialog: murder.
text: Rocky looks at his hands. They are drenched in red up to
text: the elbows with beef blood.
text: Paulie hands him a package of beef.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
dialog: sister.
text: Rocky takes the package and runs out. Paulie's bleary eyes
text: reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.
scene_heading: INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY
text: The gym is filled to capacity. The NOISE is DEAFENING.
text: Rocky pounds a heavy bag.
text: Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his
dialog: pocket.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (passionate)
dialog: Stop! Stop! I can't stand it!
dialog: It's clumsy. You're off
dialog: balance.
text: He motions to his bullish helper, Mike. He hands him the
dialog: string.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Tie it to both ankles -- Leave
text: two feet slack.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: I never had good footwork.
text: Mike completes the task.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Forget the footwork -- You're
text: off balance. The legs are
dialog: sticking everywhere. Marciano
dialog: had the same problem, an' the
dialog: string cured it. When you can
dialog: hit and move without breakin'
dialog: the string you'll have balance.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You'll be a very dangerous
dialog: person.
text: Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Rocky, could we have your
dialog: autograph?
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... Sure.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (irate)
dialog: Don't you boys ever interrupt
dialog: when I'm conductin' business,
dialog: or I'll kill you both -- Go
dialog: away.
text: The boys depart.
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Autographs! Ya wanna be a
dialog: writer or a fighter? Let's
dialog: work.
text: Mike looks off across the gym.

text: and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room
text: is silent except for Dipper's moaning.

text: apprehension... He leaves.
dialog: 
dialog: 81.

text: Rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym.
text: Rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the

text: looks down at the ring, reflects for a moment, then enters
dialog: the office.
scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: After turning on the lights, he quickly cleans the cluttered

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
text: The office clock indicates it is several hours later. Rocky

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

text: Rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it
text: was a priceless painting... He backs off and begins writing
text: on a note pad.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAWN
text: The first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy
text: windows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he
dialog: has lost interest in watching the movies.
text: The film has completed its run through the projector and
text: lazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs
text: his reddened eyes.
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: The door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men
text: stare at each other for a long moment. Mickey studies
text: Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the
dialog: fighter's mind.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: ... I know what you're
dialog: thinkin'm kid -- At least ya
dialog: gotta shot -- All ya can do is

scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

speaker_heading: ROCKY

dialog: The only thing I wanna do is
dialog: go the distance -- That's all.
dialog: Nobody's ever gone fifteen

text: except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the
dialog: arena.
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING
text: SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room.
text: Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand.
text: Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the
text: adhesive tape.
scene_heading: INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Apollo's other hand is being wrapped. Dead silence except
text: for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING.
scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

text: SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN.
scene_heading: INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase

scene_heading: INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom.
text: Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying. Completing his silent
text: prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
text: Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that
text: in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge
dialog: of his life.
text: Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans
text: in and nods that it is time. He leaves... Rocky steps out.
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: ... It's time, kid.
text: Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: ... I'll wait for you here.
text: Rocky nods and she kisses him. The fighter leaves with his

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

text: Rocky puts on the robe... Embroidered across the back in
dialog: flaming letters is:
scene_heading: "THE ITALIAN STALLION"
dialog: *Pennzoil*

speaker_heading: MICKEY

dialog: welcome an old friend, and co-
dialog: commentator for this evening's
dialog: event -- Jimmy Michaels.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: Thank you, Bob. The
dialog: electricity is everywhere
dialog: tonight. Rocky Balboa, a
dialog: fifty-to-one underdog, is
dialog: living a Cinderella story
dialog: which has captured peoples'
dialog: imaginations all over the
dialog: world -- to quote a popular
dialog: sports magazine, 'The fighting
dialog: style should be 'The Caveman
dialog: Against the Cavalier.' From
dialog: the increase in sound it
dialog: appears the challenger is now
text: approaching the ring... His
dialog: record is forty-four wins,
dialog: twenty losses and thirty-eight
dialog: knockouts.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: I only wonder if this man has
dialog: the skill to go past three
dialog: rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
text: Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl
text: insults. From the expression on Mickey's face it is also
text: the greatest night of his life. In the audience are familiar
text: faces from the gym. From the back of the arena a ROAR goes
text: up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George
text: Washington. He throws silver dollars. The NOISE builds to
text: DEAFENING proportions. Creed's trainer holds the rope and
text: Creed bounds into the ring. He tears off the Washington
text: outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in
text: an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,
text: white and blue sequined top hat. The robe is sequined red,
text: white and blue. His boxing trunks are red, white and blue
text: silk with stars around the waistband. The boxing shoes
text: match the trunks. On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam
dialog: beard.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: You could go deaf with the
dialog: noise -- it undoubtedly means
dialog: Champion Apollo Creed is
text: heading towards the ring --
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: Am I seeing right? Creed is
text: approaching the ring in a boat.
dialog: Is he supposed to be George
dialog: Washington? Obviously so.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: It's been confirmed that it is
text: definitely an impersonation of
dialog: George Washington -- a great
dialog: way to start 1976 off.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: I agree.
text: Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.
text: He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.
speaker_heading: APOLLO
dialog: I want you! I want you!
text: The crowd loves the taunting. Apollo Creed floats back to
dialog: his corner.
speaker_heading: MICKEY

text: The ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men

text: FRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring. The CROWD CHEERS.

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the

text: Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The

dialog: communicated.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: ... Now come out fighting.

dialog: out a triple combination that
text: backs Balboa into a corner --
dialog: oh, a solid hook by Creed, a
dialog: master of fist-men.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
text: The Champion is smiling and
text: toying with the man -- trying

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast
text: and furious. Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a
text: goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that

text: his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles
text: ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks.
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: If you had asked anyone who

dialog: away -- there goes the bell.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Round three... Apollo comes out dancing. He skips and side-
text: steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks. An expert ring general,

dialog: the heart.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
text: Apollo almost sprints out of
text: his corner -- feints and
text: throws a pair of left-right
dialog: combinations. Balboa drops
text: beneath a left upper cut and
text: lands a very solid shot on
dialog: Creed's temple -- not much
dialog: movement from Balboa, duck a
text: left, a right, another left
text: and explodes with a right hook
dialog: to the temple -- I mean
text: explodes. The Champ backs off.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: There's no way Apollo expected
dialog: this kind of hitting power.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
dialog: No way -- but the brilliant
dialog: ability of the Champion to
dialog: master situations like this is
dialog: one of his most outstanding

speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to

text: GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.
scene_heading: INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT
text: Stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.
text: The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up. She opens the door

text: Rocky is game but losing.
text: At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from
dialog: his seat.
text: Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.

scene_heading: INT. ARENA - NIGHT
text: The men are fighting with appalling tenacity. Rocky rips
text: and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless
text: stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously
text: outclassed.
speaker_heading: APOLLO
dialog: C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!
text: Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork. He
text: sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross
text: to Rocky's already broken nose. Blood sprays from the wound
text: and red droplets drip from his chin...
text: Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a
text: torrent of combinations. Rocky's eyes are closed. But
text: Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: This fight should have been
dialog: stopped rounds ago but Rocky
dialog: Balboa refuses to fall --
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #2
dialog: Not only has he refused to
text: fall, but he has beaten the
dialog: Champion's body without mercy
dialog: and the bout has become a

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Apollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely

speaker_heading: APOLLO
dialog: My side.
speaker_heading: TRAINER

dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Open my eyes -- Please, open
dialog: my eyes!
text: Mickey nods to Benny. He secretly places a small ring knife
text: between his index and middle finger. In one smooth movement
text: he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers
text: the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no
dialog: one is ever aware of the operation.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: At the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.
text: She is caught up in the heat of the battle.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The BELL RINGS for round fourteen. Rocky bores in close,
text: but Apollo still has spring in his legs. He seems determined
text: to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the
text: jaw. Rocky is staggered. Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose
text: with pure savagery. Rocky is driven against the ropes and
text: receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is
dialog: dropped.
text: Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything
text: is a distortion. He looks for familiar faces as though to
text: ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him
dialog: to stay down.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: Six -- Seven -- Eight --
text: Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy. He
text: is like a wounded wild animal. The tide suddenly turns.
text: Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific
text: body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his
text: throat... A CRACK is HEARD. A glaze of pain covers Apollo's
dialog: eyes. It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion
text: upright... Apollo is badly hurt. He is bent over.
text: Rocky moves towards Apollo. Apollo flicks dread jabs into
text: Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem
text: to bulge out Apollo's back. Creed takes the punishment like
text: a stoic.
text: Blood is running from Apollo's mouth. In the clinch he
text: leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and
text: shoulders. Apollo shields his wound from the ringside
text: judges and continues to fight.
dialog: 
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The BELL RINGS. Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his
dialog: corner.
speaker_heading: APOLLO

speaker_heading: TRAINER
dialog: Yo' bleedin' inside, man --
dialog: Get that doctor.
speaker_heading: APOLLO
dialog: One more round.
speaker_heading: TRAINER

dialog: stand straight -- you're the
dialog: best, you're the best!
speaker_heading: APOLLO
dialog: ... Thanks.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely
text: been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: How I look out there, Mick?
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: (truly worried)
dialog: Great, kid, great.
text: The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1
text: The fight has slowed down to a
dialog: near stand-still -- Creed
dialog: circles to Rocky's right...
dialog: The spectrum is nearly
dialog: silent -- Neither fighter has
dialog: made a motion to throw... I've
dialog: never seen anything like it in
dialog: the last round of a
dialog: championship fight... Apollo
text: spits blood on the canvas. It
text: appears he is protecting his
text: right side. His ribs were
text: probably injured at the end of
dialog: round fourteen.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
dialog: It's confirmed, unofficially,

text: Apollo fakes a left and throws
dialog: a big tired right -- Balboa's
dialog: mouthpiece is out! Creed
dialog: attacks with one hand!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it. The Champion unleashes
text: a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's
text: mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the
text: ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to
dialog: their feet.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to
text: come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a
text: weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.

dialog: blow.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Gimme ya best!!!!
text: Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Gimme ya best!!!
text: Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside
text: photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.
text: The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit

text: midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other
text: with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched
text: gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.
text: As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step
text: towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's
dialog: ear.
speaker_heading: APOLLO
dialog: ... Ain't gonna be no rematch.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: ... Don't want one.
text: Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to

speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: I don't care what they say,
dialog: you're a winner.
speaker_heading: ROCKY
dialog: Yo, can I have my locker back?
text: Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin. Mickey hugs
text: Rocky like a son. Mickey raises Rocky's hand again. Rocky
text: turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's
text: shoulder... Benny smiles wearily. Rocky stares across the
text: ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face
text: and body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that
dialog: reflect admiration.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward
text: screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-

speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: They shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed.
text: Creed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but
text: they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.
text: Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried
text: along by a legion of fans.
dialog: 
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: On the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same
text: overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be
text: frightened by it, like Apollo. Mickey tries his best to
text: control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing
text: clamor. The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to
dialog: their shoulders.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Rocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against
dialog: each other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'
text: Rocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he
text: starts swinging.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Both Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the
text: crowd. They are being passed overhead and remain helpless

text: The CHANTING IS DEAFENING.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move
text: forward. Running headlong into the crowd, she angles
text: through the mass to get to Rocky.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,
text: but she keeps her feet... She sees him. In the distance,
text: Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall
text: and waits for the procession to pass.
text: The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's
text: unbelievably battered but smiling face. He appears to be
dialog: king of the world.
text: The procession approaches and passes Adrian. She jumps on
text: her toes and waves frantically but is not seen. She screams
text: Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through
text: the racket and reaches Rocky.
text: Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages
text: to see Adrian jumping up and down waving. The crowd is
text: carrying him away. He attempts to lower himself but the
dialog: crowd won't permit it.
dialog: 
dialog: 121.
text: Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's
text: heads and shoulders. He resembles a man trying to go up a
text: down escalator. People are jammed so tightly together Rocky
text: manages to crawl across them to Adrian.
text: Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up
text: and they lock in an embrace.
speaker_heading: ADRIAN
dialog: I love you -- I love you -- I
dialog: love you...
