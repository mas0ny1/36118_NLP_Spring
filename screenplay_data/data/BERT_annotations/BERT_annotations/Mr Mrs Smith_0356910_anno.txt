text: NORTH: JANE is transfixed. With no option, she drops off the

scene_heading: INT. TUNNEL ~ NIGHT
text: Lit with the crackle and flash of downed electricity cables.

text: John looks around. No sign of the figure. Then suddenly... a

text: through the darkness as she attacks like a tiger.
text: A graceful spin and John's down from a reverse spinning
text: roundhouse. He goes for a gun but she hooks his hand between
text: her ankles in mid-air, FLIPPING him, sending the gun flying.
text: John tastes blood, raises his fists. They circle each other.
text: Feints, sudden moves. Black belt vs. Golden Gloves. Testing

text: punch after punch, getting closer. She dodges but can’t stop

text: brick. He gasps in pain and falls to his knees.
dialog: 
text: Moving behind him she executes a neck hold, drags him towards |
text: a ragged steel pole sticking out of a discarded road sign.
text: John is choking. Jane pushes him towards the sharp metal
text: point, inches from his eye. John spets his gun five feet
text: away. Reaches behind and grabs the crotch of Jane’s pants.
dialog: Squeezes. No effect. What?
text: He twists his shoulders and relaxes his arms. They both fall
text: towards the spike but John angles himself, missing it and
text: SLASHING THE BACK OF JANE'S SHOULDER, She gasps in pain.
text: Suddenly free, John crawls towards his gun. He spins and
text: aims. Nothing. He looks around the silent darkness. Turns on
text: his head lamp: something disappears back into the tunnel.
text: He is met by the blinding light of a NIGHT SUN and the wind

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: John~
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Jane, sit down.
text: She sits down, burning. John turns to Hector.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, Hector. Look at me...
text: Hector is looking at Jane. Her legs.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. Look at me, Hector. And answer
dialog: the question: why’d the CIA want
dialog: you dead?
text: Hector looks at John. Defiant. Ever the pain in the ass.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: You kill me, you got nothing.
text: John shakes his head, losing patience.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He’s right, John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Jane... Can I talk to you for a

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He PULLS her away from Hector, leading her INTO THE CORNER.
text: They stand close. Quiet, heated.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know honey, maybe it’s not such
dialog: a good idea to undermine me in
dialog: front of Hector. What? I’m just
text: saying. It sends a mixed message.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Trust me, I don‘t need to
dialog: “undermine” you. You‘re doing a
dialog: good job of that, all on your own.
text: John tightens. He holds out his gun. Think you can do better?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nice, Go ahead.
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I don’t need that.
text: John can't help but smile. She looks at Hector. Her eyes
dialog: narrow. A new tact,
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: All I need to do...is say please.
text: She drops her hair. As it falls dangerously, we CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - SECONDS LATER
text: For the first time, Hector looks a little...nervoug. And we
text: see why: Jane approaches, with her hair down, fingers on her
text: blouse-buttons. Ravishing.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hector. Hector... We don’t want to
dialog: hurt you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (under breath)
dialog: We don’t?
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: And all we want to know is...
text: Her hand lazily on his cheek.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D) L
dialog: Why would the CIA want to kill you?
text: She leans down. Her face close to his ear. She breathes:
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, Hector...
text: Hector swallows hard. He’s struggling to hold tight. John is
text: struggling too. He grips his gun tighter.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: You can tell me...
text: Jane‘s hand is on his shoulder, rubbing softly.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anything...
text: Hector is sweating. Jane is so close he can taste her.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anything you want...
text: Closer, closer. Her lips part. And one word escapes:
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please.
text: Hector opens his mouth. He’s about to crack. But suddenly--
text: CLICKCLACK! ! John stands with his HUGE GUN at Hector’s head.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: JUST ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION,
speaker_heading: HECTOR!
text: jector’s mouth shuts.
speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: John. Put the gun down. And go wait
dialog: outside. Wait outside, John.
text: Hector looks up at him. And cracks a little crooked smile.
speaker_heading: HECTOR
dialog: Yeah, go wait outside. So me and
dialog: the Mrs can have some quality time.
text: That’s it. John SWINGS his pistol. And..,THWACK! Jane GRABS
text: his gun in MID-AIR. John and Jane lock eyes,
speaker_heading: JANE
scene_heading: GO. WAIT. QUTSIDE.
text: A heated beat. John lowers his gun. His eyes angry.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
text: WHAM! John SLAMS the door shut behind him. He looks back, and
text: sees...Jane CLOSING THE CURTAINS. He stands alone a beat.
dialog: Totally alone.
speaker_heading: JANE (0.S.)
dialog: What happened in there?
text: He turns to see Jane. In the doorway. Her hair messed. One
text: more button open on her blouse. John is cold.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You tell me.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You lost your cool.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah well maybe it's not so easy to
dialog: stay cold and professional when
dialog: your wife’s sitting on some guy’s

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

dialog: Wait seriously, do I know your
dialog: name, Jane?
text: She turns to him. Doesn't answer. That’s a “no.”
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hector Danz.
text: She lights up. A drag.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: His name's Hector Danz. He was an
dialog: accountant for the CIA. Ran all the
dialog: books for freelance hitters. They
dialog: were using independents, like us,
dialog: on domestic targets.
text: Another drag. John just stares at her.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: FBI was onto the operation. They
dialog: got Hector's books, convinced him
dialog: to testify...against the man who
dialog: runs our chapter. Name's Mr.
dialog: Horner. And he’s got access to the
dialog: top fifty hitters in the United
dialog: States. Who are all after us now.
text: A beat. John stares at Jane. Dealing.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You were in there for like fifteen
dialog: seconds. How’d you get all that?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I can be very convincing.
text: He shakes his head. Digesting. Jane remains dark.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Great idea.

text: John opens his mouth, Nothing escapes. A beat.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So...Hector,...is...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Worthless.
text: A hard beat. Stinging.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So we've got nothing to trade.
text: Jane takes a long drag. smoke rises.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Except each other. They're not
dialog: going to stop till one of us is
dialog: dead.
text: an impossible beat. Trapped. With insurmountable odds. John
text: searches for a solution. Quiet, resolved. Finally:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well then, I guess we've gotta take
dialog: them out.
text: Jane looks back at him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That’s your answer. You want to
dialog: take out an army of assassins?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: It’s just...it‘s just so typical.

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Always?
speaker_heading: JANE

text: Jane looks at him, A penetrating glance.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I’m not talking about your job. I'm
dialog: talking about you. And you always

text: John roils, emotional.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where is this coming from?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Where is this coming from? How
dialog: about the fact that you fired a

dialog: up cur wagon! You tried to run me
dialog: over with a monster truck!
dialog: {a beat, real)
dialog: All you do is wreck things.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: John. I didn't blow up the one

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So this is my fault?! This is my

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.8.)

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: MR. HORNER
dialog: We always knew she was the better
dialog: hitter. Of course, it took her a
dialog: little longer than usual to clean

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We had a few ideas, but they never

text: There is something different about their bickering now. A

text: money explodes into the air, buying them precious cover.
text: A TELESCOPIC SIGHT SHOT is obecured by the cloud of bills.
text: Mr. Horner steps away, disappearing down the aisle.
text: A fully armed TEAM sit up in the KIDDIE FOAM BALL PIT where
text: they had been hiding. They OPEN FIRE on Jane and John.
text: Jane aims at a man drawing his gun and blows him backwards
text: off his feet. The MAN ON THE TOILET get off one shot at them
text: before John takes him out. John and Jane SMASH through the
text: paint cans, into the massive shelving unit.
text: They roll GRENADES across the floor spewing colored smoke.
text: Another grenade spins further out. As Killers swarm the area,
text: the grenade goes off with a flash, BANG! A percussion
text: grenade. It takes out the four nearest guys.
text: John and Jane, now inside the shelving unit, crouch-run
text: behind the paint cans as shots rain in, SPATTERING them with
text: multi-colored PAINTS. They roll out into the opposite aisle.
text: John skids across the floor on his back, FIRING continuously,
text: DROPPING two agents with rifles. Jane covers the other angle
text: FIRING at multiple targets pouring into her end of the aisle.
text: The aisles are working in their favor, they only have two
text: directions to cover. Back-to-back, they BLAST their way
text: through a chipboard wardrobe into another shelving unit where
text: they fluidly reload under cover as they spin into the next
text: aisle. Swapping directions, they cover opposite angles.
text: Agents pour into each end of the aisle but they have no
text: cover. Jane and John work through them methodically, spewing
text: hot lead, raining brass casings. More and more Agents appear.
text: But Jane and John have found an unstoppable RHYTHM. Like Fred

dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: Covering each other, reloading under shelves, crossing into
text: aisle after aisle, covering each other again and again.
text: The Agents quickly realize they are at a disadvantage on this
text: terrain. They hang back, FIRING more carefully. John and Jane
dialog: have to be more careful now, more observant. Reacting to the
text: smallest movements. They burst out of the warehouse area and
text: into the SHOWROOM.
text: EFerily, John and Jane move through living room mock ups,
text: kitchens, stalking through studies and immaculate bedrooms.
text: Like a MAZE, they encounter Agents round corners, firing at
text: John and Jane from hidden vantage points.
text: Two Agents are dug into a BATHROOM, laying down fire. The
text: cover is more readily available here, the ground broken. John
text: and Jane’s progress is slowed in a mock-up of the ideal
text: suburban LIVING ROOM. They continue to shoot it out.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ammo?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Low. Can’t get stuck here. We need
dialog: to reinforce.
text: Two Agents incoming. Jane gets low, grabbing CHRISTMAS
text: LIGHTS off a pillar, whipping out the lights, SWEEPING the
text: Agents to their feet. As they fall, she snatches their guns.
text: She tosses the reinforcements to John. On the move...
speaker_heading: JANE
text: The other side of that wall,
dialog: through soft furnishings and we’re
dialog: home free.
text: John looks at his wife, fucking impressed. They jump up and
text: lay down a withering FIRE on the bathroom, which gets blown
text: to bits. One agent ICED, the other dives into the BATHTUB.
text: John and Jane run through the final few rooms and into SOFT
text: FURNISHINGS. It seems quiet. Too quiet. Suddenly a SHOT hits
text: John in the leg and he goes down. Jane drops with him.
text: They hit the deck and start CRAWLING through acres of beds in
text: rows. Jane pops up and takes out the shooter through a
text: venetian blind. She looks to John. “You okay?"
text: John nods and they're off, crawling under beds popping up now
dialog: and again to look around.
text: TWELVE AGENTS run into the section. They split up and stalk
text: through the beds.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (6)
text: Suddenly John pops up and takes one out. Just as they react,
text: Jane pops up on the other side twenty feet away and drops
text: another. They attempt to react to Jane, but John pops up,
text: twenty feet further on and HITS again. It’s impossible to
text: tell where John and Jane are. The remaining agents hit the
dialog: deck, adopting the Smiths' technique and...
text: A.game of deadly hide-and-seek ensues in the WORLD'S LARGEST
speaker_heading: BEDROOM.
text: More Agents spill into the room. No one seems to be able to
text: locate where or when the Smiths will pop up next. John and
text: Jane separate. They shoot and fight their way toward the
text: door. Taking guns off fallen enemies for ammo. Their progress
text: seems inexorable. A bloodbath.
text: Then... Silence. Panting, they both listen. No sounds of
text: life. They are the only two people left in the world.
text: John and Jane slowly stand up and walk out. John leans on
text: Jane for support. As they pass Mr. Horner, without looking:
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re the only game left in town.
speaker_heading: JOHN
