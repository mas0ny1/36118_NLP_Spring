scene_heading: EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- NIGHT
text: It is a plain building with a sign that reads Federal Bureau
text: Of Investigations, Dallas Branch. There are only a few cars
text: parked in the parking lot, including an ambulance.
scene_heading: INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
text: A MAN sits in the lobby flipping mindlessly through a
text: paperback book, his face unseen. There is no one else in
text: the lobby except for the OPERATOR behind her desk.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: This is my third double shift this
dialog: month...I know, I know, but the only
dialog: other operator is out sick...I think
dialog: She's on drugs...Well her boyfriend
dialog: is DEA you know...
text: AGENT RANDY HULL comes into the lobby and motions to the
text: man. He gets up and walks toward Hull, stopping at the
text: operator's desk. The operator looks up at him.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: {into phone)
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: (to the man)
dialog: Yes?
text: He puts the paperback on her desk and slides it toward her.
text: She looks at the book and then up at him.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I found it on the seat over there.
dialog: Someone must have left it behind.
text: She nods with a smile, and picks up the book. As he walks
text: off, she looks at the back of it and goes back to ‘her phone
text: call. He walks over to Agent Hull, and they shake hands.
scene_heading: INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Hull stands in the doorway facing the man, but we still don't
text: see the his face.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: You can wait in here. You need

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: No I'm fine. Thanks.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: It shouldn't be long.
text: Hull leaves, shutting the door behind him. The man looks
text: around the small office, noticing all the details: the walls
text: are covered with framed citations, official plaques, and
text: several framed newspaper articles on the capture of various
text: serial killers. There are several gory police photographs
text: from case files taped on the side of a filing cabinet.
text: The man wanders over to the desk which is littered with
text: papers, pens, a few more case file photos, and one framed
text: eight by ten glossy color photograph of a MAN in his twenties
text: standing next to a WOMAN in her late forties with graying
text: brown hair. The man reaches for the photograph.
scene_heading: EXT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- LATER
text: A car pulls into the parking lot, and AGENT WILLIAM DOYLE
text: gets out. He is the man from the photograph except he is
text: older now in his mid-thirties and has a hard, world-weary
text: yet powerful look to him. He looks at the ambulance as he
text: walks up the little concrete path to the building. Thunder
text: rumbles off in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS
text: Doyle walks into the reception area, where the operator is
text: reading the paperback.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What's that ambulance doing out there?
text: The operator glances up from her book, shrugs, and goes back
text: to reading. He frowns at her, and exits into the main office
text: where there are several lines of cubicles that are mostly
text: empty except for one or two. Along the walls of the room
text: are enclosed offices with large glass windows. He strides
text: down the hall. All of the offices are dark except for one.
text: Doyle looks at the lit office window and sees the back of a
text: man's head sitting inside. Hull sits at one of the desk
text: cubicles. He looks up at Doyle from his computer.
speaker_heading: HULL

dialog: I can smell it in the air.
dialog: (nods toward the office)
dialog: That him?
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Yep. Been here about an hour. Said
dialog: he'd only talk to you.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: He asked for me by name?
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Nope. Asked for the agent in charge
dialog: of the God's Hand case.
text: Doyle nods, still staring at the back of the man's head.
speaker_heading: HULL (CONT'D)
dialog: Said he had some important info on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Didn't say what?
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Nope. Said he'd only talk to you.
dialog: Might just be some crackpot but I
dialog: figured I should call you anyway.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: With six murders and no substantial
dialog: clues, anything's worth a shot at
dialog: this point.
speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Well if anyone can crack this case.
dialog: it's you sir.
speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: HULL
dialog: Yes sir.

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Well, I'd better get to it.
text: Doyle walks off toward the office. Hull goes back to work.
scene_heading: INT. DOYLE'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Doyle comes in. The man, FENTON MEEKS, looks up at him from
text: his chair by the door, but doesn't get up. This is the first
text: time we actually see his face. He is in his late twenties,
text: with an easy smile and bright blue eyes.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: You the agent in charge of the God's
dialog: Hand case?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Agent William Doyle.
text: He extends his hand to Fenton, but Fenton looks down at the
text: framed picture in his hands, ignoring Doyle's gesture.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: (looking at the picture)
dialog: Is this you and your mother?
text: Doyle sees the picture he's holding, the one of him and the
text: woman, and snatches it out of his hands.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
dialog: take things off my desk.
text: Doyle crosses the little office and puts the picture back on
text: his desk facing him.

speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Sorry about that. I've been in here

text: his desk and regains his composure.
speaker_heading: FENTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Quite impressive, the plaques I mean.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I'm good at what I do.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: You must be.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So what can I do for you, Mr...
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Fenton Meeks. I have some information
dialog: for you.
text: Doyle just looks at him, waiting for him to continue.
speaker_heading: FENTON (CONT'D)
dialog: This may sound crazy, but... I know
dialog: who the God's Hand killer is.
dialog: 
text: Doyle stares at him flatly, but he doesn't continue. They
text: stare at each other for a moment.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Alright, I'll bite. Who?
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: You haven't even heard me out yet,
dialog: and already you doubt me. Why?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Because in a case like this no one
dialog: just walks into your office and tells
dialog: you who the killer is. It doesn't
dialog: work that way. .
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Sometimes truth defies reason Agent
dialog: Doyle.

speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: FENTON

scene_heading: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: It is a small frame house. There is a van and a car parked

text: the Valley plays softly from inside the house.
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: ADAM MEEKS, in his late twenties, sits at a small desk in
text: the far corner of the living room with his eyes closed. The
text: song plays on an old record player. He hums along with it.
text: On the desk is an old typewriter, a gun, and two stacks of
text: paper. In one hand Adam holds a half empty bottle of Jim
text: Beam, and in his-other hand is a picture. It is a faded
text: color photograph of a man, DAD, and two boys, FENTON AGE
text: TWELVE and ADAM AGE NINE. He opens his eyes and sings to it

scene_heading: INT. FENTON'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Fenton walks down the hall and looks into the bedroom where

text: opens a drawer and takes out a handgun. He stares at it for
text: a moment, then shuts the drawer, grabs his car keys off the
text: top of the dresser next to the door, and hurries out.
scene_heading: INT. ADAM'S HOUSE -- LATER
text: Adam's corpse is laying half in the chair and half on the
text: floor. Adam's GIRLFRIEND is on her knees, holding onto him,
text: crying. A police officer, HENDERSON, is kneeling beside

speaker_heading: HENDERSON
dialog: (softly)
dialog: C'mon ma'am. He's gone. C'mon now...
speaker_heading: GIRLFRIEND
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Oh Adaaaam...
text: Henderson uncomfortably looks up for help and sees the two
text: paramedics MATT, and HUBERT come in carrying a stretcher.
text: They wait for Henderson to take her away. Matt is clean cut
text: in his mid-twenties. He looks around awkwardly, trying not
text: to look at the woman. Hubert is fat and frumpy in his late
text: thirties, and is staring straight at her. He can see her
text: breasts dangling in her over-sized nightgown perfectly from
text: where he stands.
text: ANGLE ON HER BREASTS
text: The image is broken as Henderson gets her on her feet and
text: leads her to another OFFICER who takes her out to the porch.

speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: WOMAN

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: How about theft, assault,

speaker_heading: WOMAN

dialog: charges. Tell him that will you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: But he stole a corpse!
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Yeah, but it was his brother Agent
dialog: Doyle. We've all done some crazy

speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Why would you go through all that
dialog: trouble and then just walk in here
dialog: and confess it to me?
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: I did it because I promised Adam I
dialog: would. I'm here because I can't

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: And what exactly do you know?
text: Fenton nods to the picture of him and the woman.
speaker_heading: FENTON

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Yes it is.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: I knew it. You can tell by the eyes.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Why are you so interested in my
dialog: picture?
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: Curiosity I guess. It's the only
dialog: personal picture you have in here.
dialog: No family portraits, no snapshots of

dialog: after this picture was taken.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
speaker_heading: DOYLE

dialog: what I wanted to talk to you about.
dialog: I have the first list now.

scene_heading: INSERT: INT. REPAIR GARAGE -- AFTERNOON
text: A car is jacked up with Dad underneath it, working on it.
speaker_heading: FENTON (V.0O.)
text: The angel came to him while he was
dialog: at work.
text: He is working when suddenly blackness washes over everything.
text: The Angel's beautiful face floats in front of him. The
text: Angel's hand reaches out of the darkness and touches his
text: forehead, and then the darkness recedes and everything goes
text: back to normal.
text: He pushes himself out from underneath the car, lifts up,
text: pulls a small notepad and a pen out of his breast pocket,
text: and furiously begins to scribble names on it. He stops and
text: looks at the names he's written. There are seven of them.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE: INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT
text: Fenton just stares at Dad as though he's lost his mind.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: But these are people's names.
speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Yep and they'll look like people
dialog: too, but they're really demons.
text: Fenton looks at him with horror.
speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM -- AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: FENTON (V.0.)
dialog: The dream had finally ended. It was
dialog: all real. My father was insane. He
dialog: was going to murder someone. He had
dialog: never been a violent man. I'd never
dialog: seen him hit anyone, much less me or
text: Adam. He didn't even own a gun.
dialog: But I knew he was going to kill

speaker_heading: FENTON (V.0.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And I had to stop him.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSE GARDEN -- AFTERNOON
text: Fenton lays on the grass, reading the bible.
speaker_heading: FENTON (V.0.)
dialog: The obvious answer was to tell someone
dialog: what he was planning, but I couldn't
dialog: do that. I loved him even if he'd
dialog: gone crazy. I had to save him from
dialog: himself. If he thought it was God
dialog: that told him to do this awful thing
dialog: then I had to prove to him that it
dialog: wasn't God. That it had to be the
dialog: devil. So I studied the bible looking
dialog: for something to fight him with...

speaker_heading: DAD (CONT'D)
dialog: Read line 32.
text: Fenton takes it, finds the line and reads it aloud.
speaker_heading: FENTON

text: Adam turns away from the television and listens to them.
speaker_heading: DAD

text: The end of the world is near and it

speaker_heading: DAD
dialog: Well, before that angel came to me,
dialog: I wasn't so sure I really believed

dialog: exist everyday in my life or at least
dialog: I couldn't see it. I went to church
dialog: more or less out of habit than for
dialog: spiritual reasons. But now I know,
dialog: I really know that God exists. He

speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: What about thou shalt not kill Dad?

dialog: mine. All kinds of gruesome stuff
dialog: going on back then in the name of
dialog: God. The new testament, with the

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm sorry Dad.
speaker_heading: DAD

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: So you didn't tell?
text: Fenton shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: I should have, but I was afraid. I
dialog: loved my father, but I was terrified
dialog: of him. He was a murderer. “How
dialog: could I know how far it went?
text: Doyle looks lost in thought. He glances at the picture of
text: his mother. Fenton studies him carefully.
speaker_heading: FENTON (CONT'D)
dialog: So now do you understand why I think
dialog: my brother is the God's Hand killer?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (rubs his eyes)
dialog: I suppose. But then again what you've
dialog: described happened to you both. So
dialog: it could be you just as much as him.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: But I didn't believe Agent Doyle.
dialog: Adam did. That night I saw my father
text: kill a woman with a hand axe, but
text: Adam saw him destroy a demon. No
dialog: matter what I tried to tell him, he
dialog: still believed Dad. To him we were
dialog: knights of God on a holy mission to
dialog: abolish evil.
text: -Doyle thinks about this for a long moment.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Do you have any physical proof?
speaker_heading: FENTON

speaker_heading: DOYLE

speaker_heading: FENTON

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Well in this case it does. The first
text: victim was found mutilated with a
dialog: note saying that God's hand had taken
text: him. With all the others, only notes
dialog: were found. No bodies.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: How do you know they're dead then?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We don't for sure. But the first
dialog: note told us we wouldn't find any
dialog: bodies from then on. It said he
dialog: wanted to keep them.
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: I've got a pretty good idea where
text: the bodies are.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: The Rose Garden?
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: (nods)
dialog: There were other holes out where I

speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: There's something about you I don't
dialog: trust. Everything you've told me so

dialog: So tell me something. Why did you
dialog: wait so long to come forth?
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: I didn't even know about the case
dialog: until three days ago.
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: That's impossible. It's been all

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You have to admit it's all a pretty

dialog: after you just happen to notice that
text: there is a killer on the loose, who
dialog: you know is your own brother, he
dialog: kills himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FENTON
dialog: I'm telling you the truth. He was
