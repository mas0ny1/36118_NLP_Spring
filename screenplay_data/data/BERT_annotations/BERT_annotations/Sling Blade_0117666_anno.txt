dialog: A Mercury is a good car and that's
dialog: what I was driving that day. I've
dialog: owned a lot of cars. Different
dialog: kinds. Lots of different kinds of
text: cars. She was standing, this girl,
text: on the side of the street where
dialog: there was a chicken stand; not the
dialog: Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
text: a chicken stand, and I pulled the
text: Mercury over and rolled down the
dialog: window by electric power. She was
text: wearing a leather skirt and she had
dialog: a lot of hair on her arms. I like
dialog: that. I like it a lot. It means a
dialog: big bush. I like a big bush. She
dialog: said, "Are you dating?" I said,
dialog: "yes," and she got in the car. We
text: pulled to a remote location, one
dialog: that she and I both felt
dialog: comfortable with and she said, "How
dialog: much can you spend?" I said, "What
dialog: it takes to see your bush. I know
dialog: it's a big one." She said "twenty
dialog: five dollars," which to a working
dialog: man is not chicken feed. I produced
dialog: the money and she put it in her
text: shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
text: before me lay a thin, crooked,
dialog: uncircumcised penis. You can
dialog: imagine how badly I wanted my
dialog: twenty-five dollars back.

speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Hey, you're the one that wanted to

dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Yes sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: I think there must have been a
dialog: little mix up. I told your sponsor
dialog: or teacher or whatever he is, there
dialog: couldn't be any pictures. It's
dialog: s'posed to be just a little story
dialog: or article or something, isn't that
dialog: right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Well, yeah, it's for the school
dialog: newspaper. But it has pictures. I
dialog: mean it's a regular paper, you
dialog: know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: Karl's real sensitive about having

speaker_heading: MARSHA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: There was a young man named John
dialog: Liggit Hunter who was in the
dialog: filling station business and a good
dialog: filling station business. He was
dialog: one of those young men that we run
dialog: across so often in life. I'm sure
dialog: you've run across them, that didn't
dialog: deserve the things he had. One of
dialog: those things was his beautiful
dialog: bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
dialog: Peach. As a matter of fact she
dialog: looked more like the picture I've
dialog: had in my head than any woman I've
dialog: ever seen. I took it upon myself to
dialog: take her away from John Liggit
dialog: Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
dialog: not sure if I mentioned that he was
dialog: a Frenchman who claimed to be an
dialog: Englishman. It took some very
text: strong nylon cord to take her away
dialog: from him. She was a fighter as well
dialog: as a Georgia Peach.

dialog: 
text: The girls look confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: I don't know what to tell you. I'm
dialog: sorry. I made myself pretty clear I
dialog: thought. He probably got busy and
dialog: wasn't thinking. I know how that
dialog: is. I used to teach shop and eighth
dialog: grade science.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Well, what do we do? We drove all
dialog: the way out here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Let's just go, Marsha.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: No, we have to get this story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: I thought you'd be happy to leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Why won't he talk to women?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: He has problems. You know. With all
dialog: that. He won't hardly talk to

text: people. He's very troubled.

scene_heading: INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: (takes a drink of coffee)
dialog: I don't think he's talked to a
dialog: woman in twenty-five or so years.
dialog: That I know of anyway. That's why I
dialog: said to send a man. At least maybe
dialog: he'd answer a question or two for a
dialog: man. I'm all for helping the
dialog: college out, believe me. It might
dialog: be a real good article or story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk
dialog: him into it. I'm a real good

speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: You see, Karl, growing up, only
dialog: knew that sex was wrong and that
dialog: people who did it should be killed
dialog: for it. He couldn't really read
dialog: but, well, neither could his
dialog: mother. But, his father made sure
dialog: that his mother knew what the Bible
dialog: said. And she made sure Karl knew.
dialog: You know he slept in a hole in the
dialog: ground under a toolshed, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
text: I knew he slept in a toolshed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: His mother told him that he was
text: their punishment. Hers and his
dialog: father's; from God, for having sex--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Before they were married?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: I don't think so. Just period, I
dialog: think. She told him... God gave
dialog: them the ugliest creation he could
dialog: think of. Karl has an entire book --
text: a notebook. On every page it says
dialog: "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
dialog: 1." He wrote that a few years ago
dialog: after he'd learned to write. His
dialog: father's name was Franklin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: That's really strange. What does it
dialog: mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: Karl, you know, do you remember
dialog: when I told you about those people
dialog: from that newspaper?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: They want to ask you some questions
dialog: about your release. They think it
dialog: would make an interesting story.
dialog: Will you talk to 'em? Get
dialog: interviewed.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now, they're women. I think it
dialog: might be good for you to. You're
dialog: gonna be seein' all kinds of people
dialog: when you go on the outside. This'll

text: Marsha smiles and looks at Theresa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)

dialog: talk to you. He doesn't want you to
dialog: ask him anything. And you shouldn't
text: stare at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: How am I going to conduct an

dialog: questions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: It's the best you're gonna get. I'm
dialog: sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Can I ask you a question? If he's
dialog: so troubled, why are you letting
dialog: him out? What if he does it again?
dialog: It happens all the time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
text: He's free. His time's up. That's
dialog: the rules. He's been treated and
text: reevaluated. He doesn't show any
text: signs any more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Signs?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna
dialog: change the light in here for Karl.
dialog: I hope you can see to write.
dialog: 
text: Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the
text: overhead lights. He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in.
text: In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions

speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll have to step outside.
dialog: 
text: Theresa starts to protest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please.
dialog: 
text: Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin
text: ushers Theresa outside into the hallway. Karl sits staring at
text: the floor. Rubbing his palms together and breathing
text: strangely, as usual. He sits silent for what seems like
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Theresa stands on one side of the door, Melvin on the other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THERESA
dialog: Can I just sneak in there? I won't
dialog: take any pictures, I promise. I
dialog: just want to listen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELVIN
dialog: No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't.

scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marsha is staring at Karl. Karl, still breathing and rubbing
text: his palms, starts to speak. His voice is low and raspy, but
text: not just low and raspy; strange.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Well, I reckon what you're a
dialog: wanting to know is what I'm doing
dialog: in here. I reckon the reason I'm in
dialog: here is 'cause I killed somebody.
dialog: But I reckon what you was a wanting
dialog: to know is how come me to kill
dialog: somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start
dialog: at the front and tell you.
dialog: (pause, heavy breathing)
dialog: I lived most of my life out behind
dialog: my mother and father's house in a
dialog: little old shed and my daddy'd
dialog: built for me. They didn't too much
dialog: want me up there in the house with
dialog: the rest of 'em. I mostly just set
text: around out there in the shed all
text: the time a lookin' at the ground.
dialog: It didn't have no floor but I had
dialog: me a hole dug out to lay down in
dialog: and a quilt or tow that I put down
dialog: there.
dialog: (pause, more breathing)
dialog: My daddy was a hard workin' man
dialog: most of his life, not that I can
dialog: say the same fer myself. I most
text: just set around the shed and
text: tinkered around with a lawn mower
dialog: or two and went to school off and
dialog: on from time to time but the
dialog: children there made quite a bit of
dialog: sport of me, made fun of me quite a
dialog: bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
dialog: sometimes so mostly I stayed out
dialog: back there in the shed. My daddy
dialog: worked down at the sawmill there,
dialog: down there at the planer mill for
text: an old man named Dixon.
dialog: Old man Dixon was a very cruel
dialog: feller, he didn't treat his
dialog: employees very well, didn't pay 'em
dialog: much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
dialog: much of a wage, just barely enough
dialog: to get by on. But I reckon he got
dialog: by all right, they come out one or
dialog: the other of 'em, usually my
dialog: mother, and fed me pretty regular.
dialog: At least I know he made enough for
dialog: me to have mustard and biscuits
dialog: three or four times a week. Old man
dialog: Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
dialog: Jesse was really more cruel than
dialog: his daddy. He made quite a bit of
dialog: sport of me and takened advantage
dialog: of the little girls around the
dialog: neighborhood quite a bit.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He used to say my mother was a very
dialog: pretty woman. He said it quite a
dialog: bit from time to time, when I was
dialog: at the school house. Well, I reckon
dialog: you want me to get on and tell you
dialog: what happened so I reckon I'll tell
dialog: you. I was settin' out in the shed
dialog: one evenin' not doin' too much,
text: just kindly starin' at the wall and
dialog: a waitin' fer my mother to come out
dialog: and give me my Bible lesson and I
text: heared a commotion up in the house
dialog: there so I got up and run up on the
text: screened-in porch there to see what
dialog: was a goin' on, and I looked in the
dialog: kitchen window and I seen my mother
text: a layin' there on the floor without
dialog: any clothes on.
dialog: (pause, breathing)
dialog: And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on
text: top of her having his way with her.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Well, I just seen red. I picked up
dialog: a kaiser blade that was a layin'
text: there by the screen door, some
dialog: folks calls it a sling blade, I
dialog: call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
text: long handle like a axe handle with
text: a long blade on it that's shaped
dialog: kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
text: edge and dull on the other. It's
dialog: what the highway boys use to cut
dialog: down weeds and whatnot.
dialog: I went in the kitchen there and I
text: hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
dialog: with it and knocked him off my
dialog: mother. I reckon that didn't quite
dialog: satisfy me so I hit him again in
text: the neck with the sharp edge and
text: just plumb near cut his head off.
dialog: Killed him. Well, my mother, she
text: jumped up from there and started
dialog: yellin', "What did you kill Jesse
dialog: fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"
dialog: (pause, intense breathing)
dialog: Well, come to find out my mother
dialog: didn't really mind what Jesse was a
dialog: doin' to her. I reckon that made me
dialog: madder than what Jesse had made me.
dialog: I takened the kaiser blade, some
dialog: folks calls it a sling blade, I
dialog: call it a kaiser blade and hit my
dialog: mother up side the head with it an'
dialog: killed her.
dialog: (long pause, breathing)
dialog: Some folks has asked me if I had it
dialog: to do over again would I do the
dialog: same thing. I don't know, I reckon
dialog: I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
dialog: put me in here and here I've been
dialog: for a great long while. I've
dialog: learned to read some; took me four
dialog: years to read the Bible. I reckon I
dialog: understand a good deal of it. It
dialog: wasn't what I expected in a lot of
dialog: places. I've slept in a good bed
dialog: for a great long while. They've
dialog: seen fit to put me out now. They
dialog: tell me they're a settin' me free
dialog: today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all
dialog: you need to know. If you want any
dialog: more details I reckon I can tell
dialog: 'em to you. I don't know if that's
dialog: enough for your newspaper or not.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARSHA
dialog: Will you ever kill anybody again,
dialog: Karl?
dialog: 
text: This seems to startle the very room itself. Woolridge motions
text: for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still. Very still. He
text: breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. He seems
text: almost at ease. He slowly looks up. From Karl's point of view
text: we barely see Marsha's face in the dim light. Karl is looking
text: straight at Marsha.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: I don't reckon I got no reason to
dialog: kill nobody.

speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE

speaker_heading: MARSHA

speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: As much as anybody else is, I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I want to come back and stay here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: Well, you can't do that. You're a
dialog: free man. You've been let out to do
dialog: as you please.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I reckon I don't care nothin' about
dialog: bein' a free man. I don't know how
dialog: to go about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: Well, you have to learn. It'll take

speaker_heading: KARL

speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't
dialog: know where they expect you to go or
dialog: what they expect you to do. If it
dialog: was up to me, I'd let you stay here
dialog: if that's what you wanted. I'm just
dialog: doin' my job.
text: (they sit in silence for a
dialog: moment)
dialog: You follow me?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: I know, I've seen it myself. Would

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I reckon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: I can't promise he'll hire you.
dialog: I'll have to tell him about your

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I never was no good with history.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOOLRIDGE
dialog: No, I mean your past. About why you

dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'll take you first thing in the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is what I call my secret place
dialog: 'cause I come out here when I feel
dialog: like bein' by myself. I used to
dialog: come here with Karen Cross. She's
dialog: kind of like my girlfriend, or used
text: to be. She says she likes Jerry
dialog: Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her
dialog: back 'cause I love her. We used to
dialog: come here and hold hands and talk
text: and read books to each other with a
dialog: flashlight. She didn't want to have
dialog: anything to do with me in front of
dialog: other people 'cause I don't have
dialog: any money. Well, mama and me, I
dialog: mean. She seemed to like me a whole
dialog: lot when we were out here though.
dialog: She said she loved me, too. Out
dialog: here. Settin' right on that stump
dialog: you're on. See, her daddy's a
dialog: dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry
dialog: Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice
dialog: plant. Was your folks well off?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough
dialog: to scrape by on, I reckon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They still around, your folks?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: My mother's dead. My daddy's
dialog: s'posed to be around still. He
dialog: don't want to have nothin' to do
dialog: with me though.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: He never did want to. I figure he
dialog: ain't changed his mind much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How did your mama die?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: You don't need to know all of that.
dialog: You're just a boy.
dialog: You need to think about good
dialog: thoughts while you're still a boy.
dialog: They'll be plenty of time for the
dialog: other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I've had a lot of bad thoughts
dialog: since my daddy died. Sometimes I
dialog: wish I was still real little and he
dialog: was still here. My mama's real
dialog: good, but I wish I had both of 'em.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: When we went to Memphis one time in
dialog: the car, it was rainin' so hard we
dialog: couldn't see the road. But I wadn't
dialog: scared because I thought as long as
dialog: daddy was drivin' nothin' could
dialog: happen to us. I feel that way about
dialog: mama now.
text: (he looks at the ground
dialog: for a moment)
dialog: Mama has a boyfriend now. His name
dialog: is Doyle Hargraves. He works
dialog: construction so he makes a pretty
dialog: good livin'. He still don't help
dialog: mama out with any money though. He
dialog: ain't no good. He's mean to her. He
dialog: don't like me at all. Mama says
dialog: it's because he's jealous I belong
dialog: to my daddy instead of him. He
dialog: stays with us all night sometimes,
dialog: but he's got his own house.
dialog: Somebody told me it's so he can
dialog: still have other girlfriends. I
dialog: like it on the nights when he ain't
dialog: at our house. I'm not so nervous
dialog: then.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: How come her to keep bein'
dialog: girlfriends and all with him if
dialog: he's mean to her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She says it's for the times when
dialog: he's good to her. She's lonely
dialog: since daddy died. She said
dialog: sometimes she don't know why.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: He threatened to kill her if she
dialog: ever left him. My daddy would kill
dialog: him if he was here and somebody was
dialog: mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real
dialog: good to mama. Vaughan that you met.
text: But he's not able to do anything to
dialog: Doyle, he's funny you know. Not
dialog: funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes
dialog: to go with men instead of women.
dialog: That makes him not to be able to
dialog: fight too good. He sure is nice
dialog: though. He's from St. Louis. People
dialog: who are queer can get along better
dialog: in a big town. He got transferred
dialog: here to work. But mama said the
dialog: real reason he left is 'cause his
dialog: daddy hated him. For bein' the way
dialog: he is. I wish he liked to go with
dialog: women. I'd rather him be mama's
dialog: boyfriend than Doyle.

text: by a train.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me
dialog: that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It ain't the truth. He shot hisself
text: with a shotgun on purpose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Why did he do that, reckon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: 'Cause he didn't have enough money
dialog: to take care of us the way he
dialog: wanted to. That's what the letter
dialog: said. He got laid off from work and
dialog: had to just work odd jobs. I
dialog: thought he took care of us fine.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Karl, did you really kill somebody?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Yeah, I did.

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: KARL

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe they needed it.

speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I growed up and got taught it ain't
dialog: right to kill nobody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's okay if you're lookin' out for

dialog: you here was to talk to you about
dialog: something that is on my mind.
text: (pauses for a response,
text: instead Karl eats french

dialog: table)
dialog: I guess I'll put it right out on
dialog: the table. Where do I start. Linda
dialog: and Frank are very important to me.
dialog: They're like family. My own family
dialog: was never like family. They're
dialog: horrible people. As a matter of
dialog: fact I prayed every night for years
dialog: that my father would die. I finally
dialog: realized through a lot of therapy
dialog: that I was wasting my energy on
dialog: hating him. Now I just don't care.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You see, you and I are a lot alike,
dialog: strange as that may seem. I mean
dialog: not physically or even mentally
dialog: really, just well, maybe
dialog: emotionally or actually the hand
dialog: we've been dealt in life. We're
dialog: different. People see us as being
dialog: different anyway. You're -- well
dialog: you have your affliction or
dialog: whatever and I, well mine's not as
dialog: easy to see. I'm just going to say
dialog: it. I'm gay.
dialog: (watts)
dialog: Does that surprise you?
dialog: (watts)
dialog: That I'm gay. You know what being
dialog: gay is, don't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I reckon not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Well that's a very offensive way to
dialog: put it. You shouldn't say that. You
dialog: were taught that, weren't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I've heard it said that way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Anyway, it's hard to live gay,
dialog: that's the right way to say it, in
dialog: a small town like this. I've wanted
dialog: to leave many times, but my love
dialog: for Linda and Frank and another
dialog: certain person that we won't go
dialog: into have kept me from it. Anyway,
dialog: I'm rambling. If you're going to
dialog: live in the Wheatly garage you need
dialog: to know that it won't be easy.
dialog: Doyle is a monster. Not just a
dialog: closed minded redneck, but a
dialog: monster. A dangerous person. I've
dialog: told Linda that one day that man is
dialog: going to really hurt her or that
dialog: boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I
dialog: see it in his eyes. I'm very in
dialog: tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle
dialog: will make your life hell. You're a
dialog: perfect target. When I first saw
dialog: you I was afraid of you. Not really
dialog: afraid, I guess, just taken aback.
dialog: But also, I felt a real sensitive
dialog: feeling from you. And for some
dialog: reason, Frank has adopted you. Much
dialog: like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I
dialog: didn't mean it like that. In a good
dialog: way. Anyway, I just want you to
dialog: know what you're in for. I have a
dialog: good feeling about you. You're good
dialog: for Frank. Maybe it's that he can
text: have an adult friend on a child's
dialog: level.
dialog: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a
dialog: bad way.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There's one more thing. It's none
dialog: of my business why you were in the
dialog: state hospital. Everyone has
dialog: something in their past, maybe you
dialog: tried suicide, maybe you did
dialog: something -- terrible. But what I
dialog: see before me is a gentle, simple
dialog: man. All I want you to promise me
dialog: is that you're capable of being
dialog: around Linda and Frank. You know.
dialog: You would never hurt them under any
dialog: circumstances, would you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I wouldn't never hurt them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: That's what I thought. I hope I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't know. He just said he'd eat
dialog: out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I just feel sorry for the poor

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Who could eat with him settin'
dialog: there makin' that goddamn racket
text: with his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: He does make some funny noises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I sure like the way he talks. It
text: sounds like a race car motor
dialog: idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm glad of it, honey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What have you got to be nervous
dialog: about? You're a damn kid. You ain't
dialog: got any bills to pay or bidness to
dialog: run or old lady to stay on your ass
dialog: all the time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I get nervous, that's all I know.
dialog: 
text: They eat in silence for a while. Linda and Frank know where

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You know what, by God?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You know what we ought to do
dialog: tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Please Doyle, don't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Have a damn party! Call Morris and
dialog: them and get the band together and
dialog: just party our asses off. I'd like
dialog: to show that fuckin' Karl to the
dialog: guys. They'd get a kick out of
dialog: that. Don't you know they would.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not
dialog: up for it. They always stay till
dialog: mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You don't have to do anything but
dialog: pour some potato chips in a bowl
dialog: and bring beers out when we get
dialog: low.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Last time you got mad and run
dialog: Morris and them off and said to
dialog: stay away from here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: That ain't none of your damn
dialog: bidness. Besides that's the way
dialog: friends do one another. Fuck it,
dialog: I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find
dialog: my guitar, I think it's out there
text: in the garage with that loony tune.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Karl sits on his cot eating from the plate Frank brought him.

text: comes over and stands in front of Karl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Karl, now listen, there's gonna be
dialog: a party tonight here at the house.
dialog: Doyle's invited his music-playin'
text: buddies over to make a bunch of
text: racket out on the patio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They ain't even no good. The only
dialog: one can play is Randy
text: Horsefeathers. He claims he's an
dialog: Indian. His real name's Randy
dialog: Collins and he works at the feed
text: mill. He can at least play guitar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He's no more an Indian than I am
dialog: though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try
dialog: and tease you and be mean to you to
text: show off to his friends. Just like
dialog: he does to Frank and me sometimes.
dialog: You just ignore it. Or stay out
dialog: here away from 'em if he'll let
dialog: you. He's an okay guy till he gets
dialog: drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.
dialog: I guarantee it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He ain't ever okay to me.
dialog: 
text: The garage door opens and Doyle appears. He seems really
dialog: happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Well, it's on! We're gonna rock.
dialog: Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to
dialog: get over here. I'd like him to be
dialog: here. I owe him a good time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to
dialog: come to a party with you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done
dialog: called him. He'll be here.
dialog: (grins)
dialog: Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I
dialog: need you to help me ice down a tub
dialog: of beer, you and Frank.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: White Christmas tree lights are strung above the patio. Karl
text: sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground
text: alongside Vaughan, Frank, and Linda. The "band" is set up on
text: the patio. The band consists of MORRIS, a heavyset guy in a
text: military uniform on tambourine, TERENCE, a skinny guy in a
text: wheelchair on bass, RANDY, a long haired younger guy who's
text: not an Indian on guitar, Doyle on a guitar which he can't
text: play and MONTY "The Johnson " Johnson, a large guy with a ZZ
text: Top beard on drums. A tub of beer is in front of them.
text: They're all hooting and hollering and drinking. They've
text: obviously been at it for a while. Doyle steps forward to
dialog: address the 'crowd.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Okay ladies and gentlemen
dialog: (points to Vaughan)
dialog: or both. It's come to the time in
dialog: our show when we like to introduce
text: the band. Over here on lead guitar
dialog: Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on
dialog: hit a hot lick, Randy.
dialog: (Randy plays a lick)
dialog: Well, come on, y'all are supposed
dialog: to clap now. Come on!
text: (they clap a little except
dialog: for Karl)
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON LINDA
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Karl, you better clap your hands or
dialog: he'll just keep on.
dialog: 
text: Karl claps his hands a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: On the bass, give it up for Terence
dialog: "One Ball" Atkins.
dialog: (more half-assed clapping)
text: On the tambourine and lyrics Morris
dialog: Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the
dialog: group.
dialog: (claps)
text: On drums "The Johnson."
dialog: (claps)
dialog: And last and most importantly,
text: Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar
dialog: and business affairs and the only
text: motherfucker with a truck big
dialog: enough to haul this outfit on the
dialog: next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a
dialog: big hand for these guys. They're
dialog: workin' their asses off here.
dialog: (pauses for a slug of
dialog: beer)
dialog: Okay I'd like to dedicate this next
dialog: one to some very special people in
dialog: our audience tonight. To my lovely
text: female companion Linda, her lovely
dialog: son Frank, our new boarder Karl -
dialog: what's your last name Karl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Childers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Karl Childers just in from the
dialog: state facility. Make one of them
dialog: gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it
dialog: is you do.
dialog: (nothing)
dialog: Oh well, Karl's a little retarded,
dialog: he don't know what the hell I'm
dialog: talkin' about. And to Vaughan who
text: fucks a mortician in the rear
text: entrance right in front of his
dialog: clients. Now that takes balls. Our
dialog: number one tune for the folks,
dialog: boys. Kick it off Johnson!
dialog: 
text: They play "Walk Don't Run" while the audience of four sits in
text: motionless silence. They finish the song and hoot and holler
text: and drink some more and say nasty things to each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You like that Vaughan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Sure. It sounded like a number one
dialog: tune all right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You enjoying yourself, Karl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I reckon.
dialog: 
text: We hear the voice of an OLD MAN NEIGHBOR in the near
dialog: distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I wished you all would lay off for
dialog: tonight. I can't hear myself think
dialog: for that racket. It's nighttime,
dialog: now let folks be! I'll call the
dialog: law!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (hollers back)
dialog: I told you already three times, the
text: laws on my side. I play cards with
text: J.D. Shelnutt, chief' of police.
dialog: Get fucked you old bastard!
dialog: (to the party)
dialog: Okay now, Linda, you and the kid
text: clean up and get a tarpaulin over
dialog: this instruments. Me and the boys
dialog: are goin' to the county line.
dialog: We're out of liquor and beer. Come
dialog: on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin'
dialog: with us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: I'd better go on home now, it's
dialog: late. I have to work tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Come on, don't be a pussy.
dialog: Everybody has to work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: He don't want to Doyle. Don't go
dialog: Vaughan if you don't want to.
dialog: You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (very sincere)
dialog: But honey, I'll be good. I promise.
dialog: I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin'
dialog: to help these two be part of
dialog: things.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOYLE'S TRUCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Doyle is driving, Vaughan in the middle, and Karl by the
text: window. Doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette
text: tape. The first few notes of "Ghost Riders in the Sky" play.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Are you sure you can drive? You've
dialog: really had a lot of alcohol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
dialog: 
text: They take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song
text: goes louder.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the
text: "band" in the back of the truck trying to control Terence's
text: wheelchair as it rolls back and forth.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK - NIGHT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (points to tape player)
dialog: Not that you afflicted sons of
dialog: bitches would know anything about
dialog: it, but this is art.
dialog: 
text: They are stopped by a red traffic light. A police car pulls
text: up beside them and Doyle looks over at the RED-FACED COP on
text: the passenger side and turns down the music.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I
dialog: seen your pitcher in the paper for
dialog: catchin' that big-ass bass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't
dialog: drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: I figured that. Well you better be
dialog: careful with that cripple in the
dialog: back. You'll throw him out. Looks
dialog: like you got a wagonful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We run outta somethin' to drink.
dialog: Goin' to the county line. You want
dialog: to race?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREDDY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: You know better than that. We're on
dialog: duty. Catch me in that Camaro next
dialog: week one night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Catch you later Freddy!
dialog: 
text: Doyle peels out and the music blares again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet you like sittin' between two
dialog: men in a dual wheel truck don't
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Sarcastic right?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You know the boys in the band are
dialog: probably gonna stay over tonight.
dialog: We'd be glad to have you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle.
text: Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who
text: are on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the
text: room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really
text: stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
text: strewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue,
text: which has obviously been going on for awhile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow
dialog: me on those particular points, but
dialog: it's not really important in the
text: smaller picture, which is where
dialog: most people dwell anyway. Not that
dialog: being manager of Ben's Dollar Store
dialog: is insignificant. Or that making it
text: through years of incarceration in a
dialog: state supported facility is any
dialog: small feat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE JOHNSON
dialog: Morris, he's the only one in the
dialog: band that went to college.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I'm in junior college right now
text: over in Westfield.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE JOHNSON
dialog: That ain't no college, that's trade
dialog: school. Auto repair ain't ever made
dialog: a genius out of nobody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Holidays are for campers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What do you know about bein' a
dialog: genius, Johnson. You can't even
dialog: hardly keep a steady beat on that
text: high-price drum set.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERENCE
dialog: I think y'all play really tight
dialog: together, Randy. Y'all shouldn't
text: throw off on one another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Anything that has to be discussed
dialog: can't mean anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You got that shit right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: What exactly do you mean by that? I
dialog: don't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Exactly the point, my young
dialog: levelheaded friend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: I don't get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: I rest my case.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERENCE
dialog: Morris is real smart with
dialog: philosophies and things. That's why
dialog: him and me are the songwriting team
dialog: of our group. I make up good tunes
dialog: or melodies as we call them and
text: Morris is the lyrics.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Not unlike Gary Brooker of the
dialog: Protocol Harum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: We don't ever play any songs that
dialog: y'all wrote. I never even heard one
dialog: of 'em. Y'all just talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE JOHNSON
dialog: We don't even play any songs with
dialog: words at all that I remember. We
dialog: ain't got no fuckin' microphone. Or
text: speaker set up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERENCE
dialog: We wrote one last night standin'
dialog: outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it
text: "Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."
dialog: Then, you know, like on country
dialog: songs in parenthesis it says "There
dialog: is usually someone in the trunk." I
text: came up with a tune just humming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: See Vaughan, you shouldn't question
text: a genius. Morris is a modern day
dialog: poet like in the old days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: Our latest composition is as
dialog: follows: entitled:
dialog: "The Thrill" --
dialog: "I stand on the hill
dialog: Not for a thrill
dialog: but for a breath
dialog: of a fresh kill
dialog: Never mind the man
text: who contemplates
dialog: doing away with license plates
text: He stands alone anyway
text: Baking the cookies of discontent
text: By the heat of a laundrymat vent
dialog: Leaving his soul"
dialog: (Then like in poetry I have dot dot
text: dot then drop down to the next line
dialog: kind of off center.)
dialog: "Leaving his soul parting waters
text: Under the medulla oblongata
dialog: of (then dot dot dot again)
dialog: mankind."
dialog: 
text: Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at
dialog: something other than Morris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERENCE
dialog: I don't think that's right. I
dialog: believe dot dot dot come between
dialog: medulla and oblongata or something
dialog: like that.
dialog: (Morris stares at him)
dialog: Well it did. It wadn't before
dialog: mankind, I know that much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: The dots are where I say they are.
dialog: Melody and tune. That's your trade.
dialog: You're a tunesmith Terence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: I don't really understand the
text: meaning of the words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go
dialog: out of my mind. And plus you're
text: liable to bust a spring in Karl's
text: head. He's already off balance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERENCE
dialog: That wadn't the way you made it up
dialog: before, Morris. That's all I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: We don't need fancy words, we need
dialog: to practice. We don't ever
text: rehearse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE JOHNSON
dialog: We need some payin' gigs instead of
dialog: just messin' around on first one
text: patio and then another'n.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Morris, you should just be the
dialog: manager, you can't play nothin'
dialog: anyway.
dialog: 
text: Doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the
text: window. He has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed
text: madman in a flash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all
dialog: just shut the fuck up! We don't
dialog: need no practicin' or managers
dialog: cause we ain't no fuckin' band!
dialog: Morris ain't no genius and the rest
dialog: of you are just losers. Am I the
dialog: only one sane human bein' around
dialog: here? Just get the hell out of my
dialog: house and don't come back!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: It's not your house, Doyle, it's
dialog: Linda's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot!
dialog: You mind your own business. Now get
dialog: out! Now, before I get too mad to
dialog: turn back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TERENCE
dialog: What about our instruments?
dialog: 
text: Doyle grabs the handles of Terence's wheelchair and pushes
text: him right out the screen door. We hear the chair clatter down
text: the steps and a cry of pain from Terence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Now!
dialog: 
text: They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit
text: frozen on the sofa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE JOHNSON
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: You ain't right Doyle. Somethin's
dialog: wrong with you. Nobody needs your
dialog: shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MORRIS
dialog: (stops at the door)
text: The dots just look good on paper.
dialog: You don't sing 'em anyway. You're
dialog: showing your true Aries colors now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Get out of my goddamn face, you
dialog: fuckin' buzzard!
dialog: 
text: He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the
text: sofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in
text: the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I told everybody to get
dialog: out of my house. That includes
dialog: cocksuckers and retards. Get off
dialog: your asses and go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: This is not your house, Doyle. This
dialog: is my house and I'll say who stays
dialog: and goes. You've got a house, why
dialog: don't you go get one of your
text: girlfriends and go home to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You know better than to talk like
dialog: that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make
dialog: me knock the piss out of you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Doyle, don't you lay one hand on
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: That's funny.
dialog: (to Linda)
dialog: You go to bed and take snot nose
dialog: with you.
dialog: 
text: Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind. Vaughan gets
text: up also. Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You're not stayin' here tonight. Go
dialog: get sober before you come back. I'm
dialog: tired of my child seein' this. Now
dialog: you get yourself straight or I'll
dialog: lock your ass out of my life for
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: You know what I told you, you even
dialog: think of leavin' me, I'll kill you
text: dead as a doornail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That might be better than this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: I'm a witness. I heard you threaten
dialog: her life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I thought I told you to keep out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Don't tell me what to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: (an inch from her face)
dialog: Don't tell me what to do.
dialog: 
text: She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the
text: face. Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes
text: wild. He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle. Empty
text: cans, bottles, a lampstand.
text: He connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes to
text: the door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost
dialog: pitiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, I'll leave and sober up.
dialog: Everything's botherin' me, that's
dialog: all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I hate you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Well, I hate you, too. No I don't.
dialog: I love your mama. Nobody
dialog: understands what I go through. I'll
dialog: leave. You bunch of freaks have
dialog: fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey.
dialog: I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass,
dialog: really.
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: You ever hit me again you little
dialog: bastard and I'll make you sorry
dialog: your daddy ever squirted your
dialog: little ass out.
dialog: 
text: He leaves and slams the door. Frank goes to Linda's side, as
dialog: does Vaughan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You all right, Mama?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and
dialog: forget about tonight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We don't need to think bad
dialog: thoughts, do we Mama?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No, honey, we don't.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'll make some coffee and start
dialog: cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Did Vaughan go home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Yeah, he has to go to work in a

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Did Karl go to bed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: I guess. He went to the garage.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Doyle wouldn't really kill you,
dialog: would he?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I promise we're gonna get away from
dialog: him. The time has to be right,
dialog: that's all. I'd rather him get
dialog: tired of me and leave me. Then he
dialog: wouldn't want to hurt me. He
dialog: wouldn't care then. We'll be fine.
dialog: I promise. You go to bed now.

speaker_heading: LINDA

speaker_heading: KARL

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Well, it is nearly breakfast time

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL

dialog: Thank ye.

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: It's all right.

dialog: You know I was thinkin' there's
dialog: this girl that works with me. She's
dialog: real heavy, but she's cute in the
dialog: face. Well, you know, she's slow.
dialog: She's a little bit, I think. She's
dialog: not retarded, just -- it don't
dialog: matter, listen to me. I thought you
dialog: might like to meet her. Vaughan
dialog: wants to have a little supper over
dialog: at his house and we could invite
dialog: her. Would you like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA

text: in the state hospital.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That's okay. It's not really my
dialog: business. I have wondered though.
dialog: Why was it? Was it like a nervous
dialog: breakdown?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I killed my mother and a old boy
dialog: name Jesse Dixon. I thought they
dialog: was a-doin' wrong. I was about your

dialog: 
text: Linda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but
dialog: not as much as you would think.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Yes ma'am.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I like your garage.

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: So Karl, do you intend to stay in
dialog: the lawnmower business for a while
dialog: or do you have other plans?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I reckon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: I think Karl is going to be a
text: writer or a librarian eventually.
dialog: You should see all the books he
dialog: has. He must read constantly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I ain't read 'em yet except two or
dialog: three of 'em. I can't understand a
dialog: lot of what I try to read. My mind,
dialog: hit wonders off to somethin' else
dialog: when I try to read.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I'm the same way. Of course, in my
dialog: line of work, I stay too busy to
dialog: read.
dialog: But at least I have job security.
dialog: People may stop doing a lot of
dialog: things, but one thing is for sure,

dialog: Isn't that somethin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Yes ma'am, I reckon.

speaker_heading: MELINDA
dialog: Well, when you like pricing items

speaker_heading: VAUGHAN

speaker_heading: VAUGHAN

speaker_heading: KARL

speaker_heading: MELINDA

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: Same difference.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just don't have anything to say

dialog: 
text: Silence for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Listen everybody, I know this may
dialog: sound corny, I've had a few glasses
dialog: of wine and that kind of makes me a
dialog: little emotional, but I'm going to
dialog: say it anyway. It just came over me
dialog: in a rush. I want you all to know
dialog: that I care about each and every

speaker_heading: VAUGHAN

speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: That's real good. You ort not to if
dialog: ye ain't married to somebody. Bible

speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: You ort not to pull on yourself

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I kind of like you tellin' me what
dialog: to do and not to do. Just like my
dialog: daddy. I didn't mind him tellin'
dialog: me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to

dialog: get away from him is for him to get
dialog: away from us. That we can't leave
dialog: him or he'll try and hurt her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL

speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Naw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: 'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if
dialog: you ain't no good. It takes your
dialog: mind off of everything else while
dialog: you're doin' it. When you run real
dialog: fast tryin' to make a touchdown you
dialog: don't think about anything else. I
dialog: ain't no good, but my daddy always
dialog: said he was proud of me when I
dialog: threw a ball or ran with it. Did
dialog: you have any brothers and sisters
dialog: growin' up to play with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I had one there for little bit. Hit
dialog: didn't get old enough to play with.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why not? It died?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Hit was borned a little too early
dialog: on. My mother and father made hit
dialog: come too early some way or other. I
dialog: reckon they changed their mind
dialog: about havin' another'n. I was about
dialog: six or eight year old then and they
dialog: didn't care too much for me so I
dialog: reckon they didn't need somethin'
dialog: else to worry 'em with.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So it died when it come out?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: My daddy come to the shed out back
dialog: and got me and said throw this here
dialog: away and handed me a towel with
dialog: somethin' in it. I went for the
text: trash barrel there and opened up
dialog: the towel to see 'cause they was a
dialog: noise and somethin' movin' in it.
dialog: Hit was bloody-like around that
dialog: towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty
text: baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was alive?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Yes sir. Right then it was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A boy or girl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: A little ol' boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You threw it in a trash barrel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I didn't feel right about doin'
dialog: that. I takened a shoe box from
text: there in the shed and emptied out
text: some screwdrivers and nuts and
text: warshers from it and put the little
dialog: feller in that and buried him in
dialog: the corner of the yard there. That
dialog: seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was still alive when you buried
dialog: it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I heared it cryin' a little through
dialog: that box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That don't seem right. It seems
dialog: like you should have kept him alive
dialog: and took care of him if he was your
dialog: brother.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon
dialog: I didn't know what to do. I didn't
dialog: know how to care for no baby. Mama
dialog: and Daddy didn't want him. They
dialog: learned me to do what they told me
dialog: to. These days I figure it might of
dialog: been best to give him right back to
dialog: the Good Lord right off the bat
dialog: anyhow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That makes me feel real sad.
dialog: Couldn't you have done somethin',
dialog: Karl? I would have. I wish I would
dialog: of had him. He'd be here right now.
dialog: Livin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Hits been hard thinkin' about it.
dialog: They ain't a day goes by I don't
dialog: think about it. I kindly have a
dialog: picture of it up in my head that I
dialog: see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have

text: Frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just diggin'.

dialog: I ain't ever gonna be happy now.
dialog: Not with that son of a bitch movin'
dialog: in for good. I wish me and you and
dialog: Mama could just run away. But she
dialog: said he would find us wherever we

dialog: ever born.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I'm glad of it you was borned.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I reckon I ain't gonna be there in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin'
dialog: bad about you, but why don't you
dialog: stop Doyle when he gets that away?
dialog: You're older than him. You're
dialog: strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let
dialog: him do that to me and Mama.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: That feller's a whole sight meaner
text: than me. He'd just whup the tar out
dialog: of me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I'm tired, too, Frank.

text: He hands him the books.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Maybe you can make more sense out
dialog: of them than I can.
dialog: I made you a little old book marker
dialog: and stuck it in that book on
dialog: Christmas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You don't want to give away all

dialog: leave here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay.
dialog: 
text: Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand
text: on Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then
text: Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes
text: the book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a
text: folded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be
text: happy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in
text: the trees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Karl!
dialog: 
text: Karl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other
text: through the trees.

dialog: in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Naw, not yet.

dialog: I want ye to give this to Mizz
dialog: Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VAUGHAN
dialog: What about you, Karl? Do you want
dialog: to stay here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I don't reckon you have to go with
dialog: women to be a daddy to a boy.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You've been real square dealin'
dialog: with me. The Bible says two men ort
dialog: not lay together. But I'll bet you
dialog: the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody
dialog: like you to Hades. Some folks calls
dialog: it Hell, I call it Hades.
dialog: (Karl starts away)

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Where's ever'body else? You seen
dialog: 'em?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I thought I told you to get the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: How does a feller go about gettin'
dialog: ahold of the police?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Pick up the fuckin' phone and call
dialog: 'em, I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: What numbers do you punch?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: I told you to get away from here,
dialog: didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and
dialog: look at TV.
dialog: (notices blade)
dialog: What are you doin' with that piece
dialog: of iron? I swear to God you're the
dialog: weirdest son of a bitch I ever
dialog: heard of.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: I aim to kill you with it.
dialog: 
text: Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police
dialog: you push 911. You'll need to tell
dialog: 'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a
dialog: hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're
dialog: gonna kill me.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: 
text: Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We
text: see the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear
text: one short dull thud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh God! Oh God!
dialog: 
text: We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting
text: the floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to
text: the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it
text: for a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood
text: on his face, hand and shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes ma'am. I need the police over
text: here at the Wheatley house.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I've killed somebody with a mower
dialog: blade.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I
dialog: hit him two good whacks. That
text: second time just plumb near cut his
dialog: head in two.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Hits a little old yeller house
text: right on the corner of Marigold
text: Street and some other street.
text: They's a red pickup truck out front
text: says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION
dialog: on it. I'll be a settin' here
dialog: waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the
dialog: police, Doyle said you might want
text: to send a ambulance or a hearse.
dialog: Thank ye.
dialog: 
text: He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar
text: of mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the
text: kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering
text: up some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the
text: mustard jar and runs the knife around it.
text: There's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the
text: biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: CLOSE UP OF CHARLES THE NUT CASE
dialog: 
text: He's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull
text: back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital
text: again with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles. Karl
text: is now wearing the hospital issue clothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: ... on the third day I washed her.
dialog: She wasn't very clean. I got all
dialog: the right spots. She was the first
dialog: one I ever kept for any length of
dialog: time, you see I get bored easily, I
dialog: have a short attention span. I
dialog: can't say she enjoyed her stay,
text: although the washcloth in her mouth
text: held in place by good duct tape
dialog: kept any complaints to a minimum. I
dialog: don't really like people who talk a
dialog: lot. I like to do the talking. I
dialog: guess that's why I'm so fond of
dialog: you. You're so easygoing, although
dialog: I do sense a little tension in you
dialog: sometimes. By the way, how was it
dialog: out there? Did you have any fun?
dialog: Make any new acquaintances? Tell me
dialog: what it was like.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: They was a boy. We made friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: I bet you did. I was never bent
dialog: that way. I'm bent the other way.
dialog: So, you liked it out there in the
dialog: world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: It's too big.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Well, it's not too big in here, is
dialog: it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I feel very generous today. I feel
dialog: like listening. I'm sure you have
dialog: plenty to tell me. And please bore
dialog: me with the details.
dialog: (long pause) )
dialog: Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was
dialog: it the boy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Don't say nothin' about that boy.
dialog: 
text: Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KARL
dialog: Fact the bidness, don't you say
dialog: another word to me. I ain't
