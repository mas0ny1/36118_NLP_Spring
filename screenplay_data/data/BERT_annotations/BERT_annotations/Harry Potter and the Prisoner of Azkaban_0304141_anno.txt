scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 2

speaker_heading: WHISPER:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lumos Maxima...
text: The tent BLOOMS SOFTLY with light -- briefly illuminating
text: a bedside PHOTOGRAPH (of James & Lily Potter) -- then
text: goes dark.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lumos Maxima...
text: The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a
text: TOILET FLUSHES. Instantly, the SHADOW stiffens, the
text: blankets DIM, and the tent flattens. Just as...
text: ... the bedroom door OPENS, revealing... UNCLE VERNON.
text: He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then...
dialog: withdraws.
text: The tent rises.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Lumos Maxima...
text: As the blankets blaze, we CUT INSIDE, find a SKINNY BOY
text: with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting
text: crookedly atop his nose: HARRY POTTER. Open before him

text: The DOORBELL CHIMES and a shrill VOICE THUNDERS:
speaker_heading: AUNT PETUNIA (0.S.)
dialog: Harry! Harry!
text: Harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall,
text: where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly.
text: Petunia flicks a bit of fluff from Dudley's sweater,
text: glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: AUNT PETUNIA
dialog: Well, go on. Open it.
text: Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS
text: OPEN, revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and
text: a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle Vernon lurches
text: forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in
text: hand, and drops it on Harry.
speaker_heading: AUNT PETUNIA
dialog: Marge! Welcome! How was the
dialog: train?
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
text: Wretched. Ripper got sick.
speaker_heading: AUNT PETUNIA
dialog: Ah. How... unfortunate.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: I would've left him with the
dialog: others, but he pines so when I'm
dialog: away. Don't you, darling?
text: Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down
text: the hallway. Harry follows with Uncle Vernon.

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign
dialog: this form.
speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nothing. Something for school...

dialog: suspiciously.
speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: Later perhaps. If you behave.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I will if she does.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: (turning, eyeing Harry)
dialog: So. Still here, are you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Don’t say 'yes' in that ungrateful
dialog: tone. Damn good of my brother to
dialog: keep you, if you ask me.
dialog: (to Vernon, Petunia)
dialog: It'd have been straight to an
dialog: orphanage if he'd been dumped on
dialog: my doorstep.
text: Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV --
text: emits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that
dialog: my neffy poo? Come and say hello
dialog: to your Auntie Marge.
text: Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks,
text: waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently.
text: Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his
dialog: ankle.
scene_heading: INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DINING ROOM - DUSK

speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: Can I tempt you, Marge?
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Just a small one. A bit more... a
dialog: bit more... That's the boy.
dialog: (taking a
dialog: sloppy sip)
dialog: Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia.
dialog: It's normally just a fry-up for
dialog: me, what with twelve dogs.
text: She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Ripper
text: take a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catches
text: Harry looking.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: What are you smirking at! Where
dialog: is it that you send him, Vernon?
speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate
dialog: institution for hopeless cases.
text: Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who
text: glares darkly at him.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: I see. And do they use the cane
dialog: at St. Brutus's, boy?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads
dialog: of times.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Excellent. I won't have this
dialog: namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense
dialog: about not hitting people who
dialog: deserve it.
dialog: (another sip)
dialog: Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
dialog: how this one's turned out, Vernon.
dialog: It all comes down to blood. Bad
dialog: blood will out. What is it the
dialog: boy's father did, Petunia?
speaker_heading: AUNT PETUNIA
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: Nothing. That is... he didn't
dialog: work. He was -- unemployed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Of course. And a drunk,
dialog: I expect --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That's a lie.
text: Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: My dad wasn't a drunk.
text: POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.
speaker_heading: AUNT PETUNIA
dialog: Oh my goodness! Marge!
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Not to worry, Petunia. I have a
text: very firm grip.
text: Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise.
speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: You go to bed. Now.
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter
dialog: about the father. In the end it
dialog: comes down to the mother. You see
dialog: it all the time with dogs. If
dialog: there's something wrong with the
dialog: bitch, there'll be something wrong
dialog: with the pup...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Shut up! Shut up!
text: Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON on
text: her dress sails into the air. SEAMS GROAN. THREAD
text: SNAPS. Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN. Her cheeks BILLOW. Her
text: whole body BILLOWS. And she begins to INFLATE like a
scene_heading: MONSTROUS BALLOON.
speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
speaker_heading: MARGE!
text: As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her. RIPPER GROWLS,
text: fixes his teeth to his trousers. Harry frightened by

speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: Don't worry! I've got you...
text: Slowly... to his horror... Uncle Vernon himself begins to
text: RISE. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes...
speaker_heading: AUNT MARGE
dialog: Vernon. Don't you dare --
text: But he does. He lets go. Falls to his knees. And
text: watches Aunt Marge float away.
scene_heading: INT. HARRY'S ROOM - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 8
text: Harry crashes inside, takes his TRUNK, then puts his heel
text: to a LOOSE FLOORBOARD and removes his WAND from its
text: hiding place. Turning, he grabs the PHOTOGRAPH of his
dialog: parents.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9
text: BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the TRUNK down the
text: stairs... finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him.
speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER
text: BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No! She deserved what she got!
dialog: And you... you keep away from me.
text: Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with
dialog: knowing cruelty.
speaker_heading: UNCLE VERNON
dialog: You're not allowed to do magic out
dialog: of school. They won't have you
dialog: now. You've got nowhere to go.
text: Harry realizes it's true. Briefly falters. Then:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Anywhere's better than here.
scene_heading: EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9A
text: As Harry storms out with his trunk, we DOLLY TO the
text: street WITH him. High in the sky, a plump DOT rises.
dialog: Aunt Marge.
dialog: 10
scene_heading: EXT. MAGNOLIA CRESCENT - NIGHT (LATER) 10
text: Harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops. Glances
text: about. An empty PLAYGROUND. SWINGS CREAKING gently on
text: rusted chains. A tiny CAROUSEL, kissed gently by the
text: wind, turning slowly.
text: Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Deep in the night, an
text: ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT. Harry, still as a statue.
text: Listening. In the trees above, LEAVES TREMBLE. The WIND
text: gathers.
text: Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.
text: Then, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something in
text: the shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draws
text: his wand.
text: Then he sees... it. Something BIG. Darker than the
text: shadows which conceal it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING
speaker_heading: EYES.
text: Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Afraid not to. Wand
text: outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten
text: trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES.
text: BANG! TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Aaaah!
text: GIANT WHEELS bear down. Harry rolls clear -- just as a
scene_heading: PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a
text: halt. GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the windscreen: The
dialog: Knight Bus.
scene_heading: DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18-
text: year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty

dialog: sun in years.
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: (wearily, drearily)
dialog: Welcome to the Knight Bus.
dialog: Emergency transport for the
dialog: stranded witch or wizard. My name

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I didn't do it on purpose.
text: Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly.
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Well, come on then. Let's not
dialog: wait for the grass to grow.
text: As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows
text: across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs
dialog: aboard.
scene_heading: INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 11
text: No seats. Only BEDS. The BRASS frames need a shine, the
text: lines a wash. In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS,
text: turns over in his sleep.
speaker_heading: DISHEVELED WIZARD
dialog: Not now... I'm pickling slugs...
text: Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK
text: GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with
text: sweat. A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror,
text: MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace its
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Take ‘er away, Ern.
speaker_heading: SHRUNKEN HEAD
dialog: Yeah, take it away!
text: BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide
text: six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed
text: nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly
text: above his head. Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC
text: WHIPS past in a blur.
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Wot you say your name was again?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I didn't.
text: Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily
text: Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once
text: more. Harry brushes the fringe of his hair over his
text: scar, watches an AMBULANCE -- SIREN WAILING -- careen
dialog: past.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: 11 CONTINUED: 11
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: The Leaky Cauldron. That's in
dialog: London --
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Is it now? Get that, Ern? The
dialog: Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
text: Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH.
speaker_heading: SHRUNKEN HEAD
dialog: Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from
dialog: the pea soup!
text: As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers
text: out the windscreen, watches London careering by.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Isn't this a bit... dangerous?
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Naah. Haven't had an accident
dialog: in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?
speaker_heading: SHRUNKEN HEAD
dialog: Heads up! Little old lady at
dialog: twelve o'clock!
text: Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is
text: crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and
text: Harry flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes
text: pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and
text: Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets
dialog: forward once more.
text: As Harry rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of
text: Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a
text: sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a
scene_heading: MOVING PHOTOGRAPH.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Who is that? That man.
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Who is that? That's Sirius Black,

speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: A murderer, he is. Got ‘imself
text: locked up in Azkaban for it.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How'd he escape?
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Tha's the question, isn't it?
dialog: He's the firs' that's done it.
dialog: Gives me the collywobbles thinking
dialog: he's out there, though, I'll tell
dialog: you that. Big supporter of You-
dialog: Know-'0o, Black was. Reckon you
dialog: heard o' him.
text: Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Meet
dialog: Harry's.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. Him I've heard of.
text: Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly
text: toward the Knight Bus. Before can scream, the entire
text: Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the
text: two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces.
speaker_heading: SHRUNKEN HEAD
dialog: Hate that.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This bus. Don't the Muggles ever...
speaker_heading: STAN SHUNPIKE
dialog: Them! Don' listen properly, do
dialog: they? Don' look properly either.
dialog: Never notice nuffink, they don'.
text: Just then, a COUPLE walking a DOG are engulfed by a RUSH
text: of WIND as the (invisible) Knight Bus WHOOSHES past. The
text: couple glances about in bewilderment. The DOG YAPS
text: madly.
speaker_heading: SHRUNKEN HEAD
dialog: Turn! Turn!
text: Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a
text: dizzying 360-degree turn. HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the
text: windows as the bus rides up on two wheels and Harry is

scene_heading: EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 12B
text: As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are

dialog: alarm.
scene_heading: INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BAR/HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS 13
speaker_heading: LATER)
text: Harry trails Tom through the quiet room. The BARTENDER
text: glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A
text: solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his
text: COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF. Tom leads Harry upstairs.
scene_heading: INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BACK ROOM - NIGHT 14

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hedwig!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Right smart bird you've got there,
text: Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes
dialog: before yourself.
text: A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED
text: SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE) at the window, staring at
text: the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers
text: in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR LUPIN
text: Right then. Wand at the ready.
dialog: One. Two. Three!

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Excuse me, sir, but... where's

speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: That's not really your concern, is

speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn

text: Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and

speaker_heading: SNAPE
dialog: Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must

speaker_heading: RON

text: the HAIR above his knuckles RISES.
text: In the sky, Harry flies fearlessly, searching for the
text: Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and
text: CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF VIEW far below. Suddenly, in
text: the stands opposite, a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand
text: of a RAVENCLAW GIRL. For a moment, it sails wondrously
text: through the heavy air, a Magritte dream, then -- WHOOP!
text: WHOOP! WHOOP! -- abruptly picks up speed, ROTATING LIKE
text: A HATCHET. Harry DUCKS, turns, and watches it disappear

dialog: something:
text: In the stadium's HIGHEST TOWER, something ENORMOUS
text: flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE, then is obscured by a
text: veil of mist.
text: Harry turns. In the distance, the stray umbrella spins
text: INTO VIEW, harpoons a player. Harry's eyes shift. The
text: SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of
text: a cloud. Harry begins to go... when the veil of mist
text: shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief
text: moment -- a GREAT DOG is revealed. As this mist closes,
text: Harry frowns, jets away.
text: As Harry pelts after the Snitch, the crowd RISES TO THEIR

scene_heading: DEMENTORS.

speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: No!!!

speaker_heading: SHRUNKEN HEAD #1
dialog: So I says to him, ‘Careful, Ned.

text: As the three heads CACKLE HYSTERICALLY, bobbing up and
text: down on their strings, Harry turns... just as an UNSHAVEN
text: WIZARD'S arm whips down and a DART goes WHISTLING right
text: toward Harry's eyes. Harry DUCKS, pivots, and -- THWOCK!

text: Harry hurries on, trailing Fudge and McGonagall up a DARK

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: Years ago, when Harry Potter's

dialog: they went into hiding. Few knew
dialog: where they were. One who did was
dialog: black. And he told...
speaker_heading: MADAM ROSMERTA
dialog: You-Know-Who. I've heard this
dialog: rot. It was all over The Daily
dialog: Prophet back in the day. And I'll
dialog: say now what I said then: Of all
dialog: the boys I ran out of here,
dialog: Black's the last who would've gone
text: over to the dark side. Hearsay.
dialog: That's all the Ministry had.
dialog: Hearsay.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS FUDGE
dialog: Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!
speaker_heading: MADAM ROSMERTA
dialog: Peter Pettigrew?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

text: tagging after Black and...
speaker_heading: MADAM ROSMERTA
dialog: I remember him. What's he got to
dialog: do with it?
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: After the Potters were killed,
dialog: Pettigrew went looking for Black.
dialog: And, unfortunately... found him.
speaker_heading: CORNELIUS FUDGE
dialog: Black was vicious. He didn't kill
text: Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A
dialog: finger. That's all that was left.
dialog: A finger -- there's your hearsay.
text: Rosmerta looks to McGonagall. She nods grimly.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
dialog: Sirius Black may not have put his

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: If Black can fight the Dementors,
dialog: I need to know how too.
text: Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR LUPIN
dialog: Very well. The spell I'm going to
dialog: teach you is called the Patronus
dialog: Charm. Ever hear of it?
text: Harry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR LUPIN
dialog: A Patronus is a kind of positive
dialog: force. For the wizard who can
dialog: conjure one, the Patronus works
text: something like a shield. The
text: Dementor feeds on it instead of
dialog: him.
text: Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eyes
text: wander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attention
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR LUPIN
dialog: But in order for it to work, you
dialog: must think of a memory. And not
dialog: just any. This memory needs to be
dialog: a very happy one. And powerful.
text: Harry thinks a bit. Then... nods.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR LUPIN

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Expecto... Patronum...

speaker_heading: PROFESSOR LUPIN

dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: PROFESSOR LUPIN
dialog: Think, Harry, think --
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Just do it!
text: Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens the

text: He sets his jaw...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Expecto Patronum!
text: Harry's hand TREMBLES. His whole BODY TREMBLES. But he

scene_heading: INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING 102
text: The students gaze into CRYSTAL BALLS, faces reflecting
text: the mist within, so that their very skin seems to be made
dialog: of smoke.
text: Conspicuously, Harry, Ron and Hermione sit apart.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
dialog: Crystal-gazing requires that you
text: clear the Inner Eye. Only then,
dialog: will you... See. Oh my, what do
dialog: we have here...?
text: As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Here we go again. It's the Grim!
dialog: It's the Grim!
scene_heading: PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
dialog: (eyes narrowing)
dialog: My dear, from the moment you first
dialog: arrived in my class, I sensed that
dialog: you did not possess the proper
dialog: spirit for the noble art of
dialog: Divination. You may be young in
dialog: years, but the heart that beats
dialog: beneath your bosom is as shriveled
dialog: as an old maid's, your soul as dry
dialog: as the pages of the books to which
dialog: you so desperately cleave.
text: Stung, Hermione starts to reply, but -- remarkably --
text: seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly,
text: she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry
text: watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the

scene_heading: INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 102B
text: Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts
text: to go, when... the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly
text: DARKENS. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that
text: appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then,
text: a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and...
text: ++. a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder. He wheels,
dialog: finds...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Professor Trelawney --
scene_heading: PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
dialog: He will return tonight....
text: Harry stiffens. Trelawney's voice is eerily HOLLOW.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: S-sorry?
scene_heading: PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
text: Tonight, when the clock strikes
dialog: twelve, the servant shall break
dialog: free. He and his Master shall be

text: Harry's shoulder. Her hand.
scene_heading: PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
dialog: So sorry, dear boy. Did you say

speaker_heading: HERMIONE
dialog: Haaaaaaarrrrrrilllilii!
