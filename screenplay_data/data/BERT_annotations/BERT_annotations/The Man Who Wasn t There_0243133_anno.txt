dialog: "THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"
speaker_heading: BY
dialog: Ethan Coen &amp; Joel Coen
dialog: 
dialog: Black.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But
dialog: I never considered myself a barber...
text: We track back from a barber's pole.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I stumbled into it--well, married
dialog: into it more precisely...
text: We track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening
text: door. The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head
text: of a customer entering in slow motion.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I wasn't my establishment. Like
dialog: the fella says, I only work here...
text: We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade,
text: aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...The dump was 200 feet square,
dialog: with five chairs, or stations as we
dialog: call 'em, even though there were
dialog: only two of us working...
text: We track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across
text: a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one
text: hand. In slow motion, he laughs and chats.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law,
dialog: was the principal barber. And man,
dialog: could he talk...
text: Another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers
text: across a child's head. A cigarette between his lips.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Now maybe if you're eleven or
dialog: twelve years old, Frank's got an
dialog: interesting point of view, but
dialog: sometimes it got on my nerves. Not
dialog: that I'd complain, mind you. Like I
dialog: said, he was the principal barber.
dialog: Frank's father August--they called
dialog: him Guzzi--had worked the heads up
dialog: in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years
text: until his ticker stopped in the middle
dialog: of a Junior Flat Top. He left the
dialog: shop to Frankie free and clear. And
dialog: that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's
dialog: ambitions: cutting the hair and
dialog: chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk
dialog: much...
text: He plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into
text: a tray.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I just cut the hair...
scene_heading: LATE IN THE DAY
text: The barbershop is empty of customers. Late sun slants in
text: through the front window. The two barbers--the narrator and
text: his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs, idly
dialog: reading magazines.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Says here that the Russians exploded
dialog: n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing
dialog: we can do about it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How d'ya like them apples?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Russians exploded an A-bomb.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Jesus...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Now, being a barber is a lot like
dialog: being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's
dialog: not much to it once you've learned
dialog: the basic moves. For the kids there's
dialog: the Butch, or the Heinie...
text: We cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off:
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...the Flat Top, the Ivy, the Crew,
dialog: the Vanguard, the Junior Contour
dialog: and, occasionally, the Executive
dialog: Contour. Adults get variations on
dialog: the same, along with the Duck Butt,
dialog: the Timberline...
text: Ed trims the fringe around a balding head.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and something we call the Alpine
dialog: Rope Toss.
text: He snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes
text: it across a bald pate.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I lived in a little bungalow on
dialog: Napa Street. The place was OK, I
dialog: guess; it had an electric ice box,
text: gas hearth, and a garbage grinder
dialog: build into the sink. You might say I
dialog: had it made.
text: We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as
text: a black coupe pulls into the driveway.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Oh yeah. There was one other
dialog: thing...
text: We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting
text: on a girdle.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Doris kept the books at
dialog: Nirdlinger's, a small department
dialog: store on Main Street. Unlike me,
dialog: Doris liked the work, accounting;
dialog: she liked knowing where everything
dialog: stood. And she got a ten per cent
dialog: employee discount on whatever she
dialog: wanted--nylon stockings...
text: Close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to
dialog: the garter.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...make-up, and perfume...
text: Close on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia
dialog: by Tuvache.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...She wore a lot of perfume.
text: Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster,
dialog: was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the
dialog: department store heiress. Tonight
dialog: they were coming over for dinner--as
dialog: Doris said, we were 'entertaining'...
text: Ed sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable
text: suit, smoking.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Me, I don't like entertaining.
text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: Ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure,
dialog: bird-like wife.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: How ya doin', Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: OK. Take your coat, Ann?
speaker_heading: DINNER TABLE
text: The two couples are in the middle of the meal.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Japs had us pinned down in Buna for
dialog: something like six weeks. Well, I
dialog: gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it
dialog: tough, but, Jesus, we had supply.
dialog: *They* were eating grubs, nuts,
dialog: thistles. When we finally up and
dialog: bust off the beach we found Arnie
dialog: Bragg, kid missing on recon; the
dialog: Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if
dialog: you'll pardon the, uh... And this
dialog: was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin'
dialog: to write home about. I mean, I never
dialog: would've, ya know, so what do I say,
dialog: honey? When I don't like dinner,
dialog: what do I say?
text: Ann smiles wanly.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg--
dialog: *again*?!
text: He roars with laughter.
text: Ed gives an acknowledging smile.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!
text: He dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Were you in the service, Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, Dave, I wasn't.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Ed was 4F on account of his fallen
dialog: arches.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Mm, that's tough.
speaker_heading: FRONT PORCH
text: Ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down.
text: Crickets chirp. From inside the house we hear laughter and
text: clattering dishes.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all
dialog: that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had
dialog: the feeling that she and Big Dave
dialog: were a lot closer than they let on...
text: He turns and looks through the screen door into the house.
text: Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly
text: lit kitchen. Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the
text: counter drying dishes. His broad back heaves with laughter
text: while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing
text: dishes across.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...The signs were all there plain
dialog: enough--not that I was gonna prance
dialog: about it, mind you. It's a free
dialog: country.
text: Footsteps approach the front porch.
text: With the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Holding down the porch area?
text: Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement. Big Dave relaxes,
text: forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front
dialog: lawn.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...That's quite a wife you got there.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: She's a rare one.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How's business, Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Couldn't be better. These're boom
dialog: times in retailing. We're opening
dialog: another store, Big Dave's Annex,
dialog: there on Garson. This is strictly
dialog: haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas,
text: ladies' foundations and undergarments.
dialog: Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making
dialog: Doris the comptroller. How're things
dialog: at the, uh, the barbershop?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: All right, I guess.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want
dialog: to drop by the Annex when we open,
dialog: update your suit--'course, you're in
text: the smock all day.
text: He chuckles.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Say, where do you get those things
dialog: anyway?
speaker_heading: ED
text: Specialty store down in Sacramento.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: There is a silence. At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big
text: Dave clears his throat.
speaker_heading: CHURCH
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Doris and I went to church once a
dialog: week...
text: We are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting
dialog: the resurrection of Christ.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Usually Tuesday night...
text: Faintly, we hear an amplified voice:
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: I... seven...
text: Ed sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit
text: cigarette in his mouth.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: ...Bee... Four...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Doris wasn't big on divine worship...
text: Doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and I doubt if she believed in
dialog: life everlasting; she'd most likely
dialog: tell you that our reward is on this
dialog: earth and bingo is probably the extent
dialog: of it...
text: Still focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Watch your card, honey.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: I... sixteen...
text: Ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from
dialog: his cigarette.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: I wasn't crazy about the game, but,
dialog: I don't know, it made her happy, and
dialog: I found the setting peaceful.
speaker_heading: CALLER
dialog: Gee... nine...
text: Doris sucks in her breath.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Jesus, bingo--BINGO!
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day.
text: Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor,
text: a cigarette dangling from his lip. Frank sits on one of the
text: vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I
dialog: mean, if you're really serious. You
dialog: tie your own flies, you do a--I know
dialog: it's matickless, I know, people say,
dialog: hey, you can buy flies at the store--
dialog: but you can buy your fish at the
dialog: store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The point is there's a certain art
dialog: to the process. The point is not
dialog: merely to provide, and let me point
dialog: out, these fish are not as dumb as
dialog: you might think.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sportsmanship! That's my point. June
dialog: fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these?
dialog: Well, what fish do you seek?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure, go to the store. Go there,
dialog: describe to the man where you will
dialog: be fishing, and for what, and the
dialog: weather conditions, sun, no sun,
dialog: whatnot, and so forth, and then you
dialog: might as well have the man go ahead
dialog: and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
text: We see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows
text: at the far end of the shop. He is almost blown out by the
text: late-day sunlight hitting the window.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...My point is, this is a man who
dialog: knows nothing no matter how much you
dialog: tell him, so sell him the goddamn
speaker_heading: FISH, Ed.
text: The bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle-
text: aged man walks in. He is well dressed--perhaps a little too
text: snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil
text: mustache.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: OK, boys, which of you gets the
dialog: privilege?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're just closing, friend.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing
dialog: well enough to turn away business!
dialog: More power to ya, brother! The public
dialog: be damned!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, what's your problem, friend?
dialog: This is a business establishment
dialog: with posted hours--
text: Ed cuts in with a jerk of the head.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'll take care of him, go ahead,
dialog: Frank. Have a seat, mister.
text: Frank looks sourly at the stranger.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...You sure, Eddie?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, yeah--go home.
text: As Frank leaves:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In your ear, mister.
text: The stranger chuckles.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say!
dialog: Not so fast there, brother--
text: Ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him
text: back; he lifts off a toupee.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: ...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the
dialog: experts. 100 percent human hair,
dialog: handcrafted by Jacques of San
dialog: Francisco, and I'd hate to have to
dialog: tell you what I paid for it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for
dialog: it down on the installment plan...
text: Ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: ...A lot of folks live with the pate
dialog: exposed. They say the dames think
dialog: it's sexy. But for my money it's
dialog: just not good grooming--and grooming,
dialog: my friend, is probably the most
dialog: important thing in business--after
dialog: personality, of course...
text: He twists around to offer his hand.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: ...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to
dialog: know ya.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa
dialog: Rosa?
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: A goose, friend. I was chasing a
dialog: wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard
dialog: of venture capital?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh--
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Well, it's the wildest goose there
dialog: is. Risk money. Very speculative.
dialog: Except, Ed, in certain situations,
dialog: it's not, see? I thought I had a
dialog: prospect here. Well, I make the haul
dialog: up and this lousy so-and-so tells me
dialog: his situation has changed--all his
dialog: capital's gonna be tied up in
dialog: expansion plans of his own. Thank
dialog: you, mother! Pop goes another bubble!
dialog: It's only the biggest business
dialog: opportunity since Henry Ford and I
dialog: can't seem to interest a soul!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That right.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: It's called dry cleaning. You heard
dialog: me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'--
dialog: wash without water, no suds, no
text: tumble, no stress on the clothes.
dialog: It's all done with chemicals, friend,
dialog: and your garments end up crisp and
dialog: fresh. And here's the capper: no
dialog: shrinkage.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: That's right! Dry cleaning--remember
dialog: the name. It's going to revolutionize
dialog: the laundry industry, and those that
dialog: get in early are gonna bear the fruit
dialog: away. All I need is $10,000 to open
dialog: my first store, then I use its cash
dialog: flow to finance another, and so on--
dialog: leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole
dialog: chain. Well, me and a partner.
dialog: Cleanliness, friend. There's money
dialog: in it. There's a future. There's
dialog: room to grow... Say, that's looking
dialog: pretty good. Let's see it with the
dialog: hairpiece on...
scene_heading: BATHROOM DOORWAY
text: It is evening. Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb
text: contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a
text: cigarette between his lips pluming smoke.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Dry cleaning...
text: The reverse show Doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Was I crazy to be thinking about
dialog: it? Was he a huckster, or opportunity,
dialog: the real McCoy?
text: Ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...My first instinct was, no, no,
dialog: the whole idea was nuts. But maybe
dialog: that was the instinct that kept me
text: locked up in the barbershop, nose
text: against the exit, afraid to try
dialog: turning the knob. What if I could
dialog: get the money?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Honey?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mm.
text: She lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Shave my legs, will ya?
text: Ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette
text: back in his mouth to free his hands. He picks up a bar of
text: soap and starts soaping the leg.
text: He sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor.
text: The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark
text: bits of hair flecking the white foam.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...It was clean. No water. Chemicals.
text: He shakes the razor in the tub. Shavings float away across
text: the soap-slicked water.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: (absently, as she
dialog: reads)
dialog: Gimme a drag.
text: Ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers,
text: uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for Doris
text: as she sucks.
text: He brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to
text: his own mouth. She murmurs:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...Love ya, honey.
speaker_heading: A DOOR
text: We hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into
dialog: laughter.
text: A hand enters to knock.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Yeah, come in.
text: The door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves
text: sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. A tray of room-
text: service dishes sits near him.
text: He is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.
text: He hangs up, looks quizzically at Ed.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: ...Oh, I thought you were the
dialog: porter... Can I help you?
text: Ed stands awkwardly by the door.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I'm, uh, Ed.
text: The stranger's look does not show recognition.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at
dialog: a disadvantage.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Jesus! The barber! I'll be a
dialog: sonofagun. Why didn't you say so?
dialog: 'Course--the barber.
text: Ed nods, his smile faint and forced.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: ...I didn't recognize you without
dialog: the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave
dialog: something at the shop?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. I might be interested in that,
dialog: uh, business proposition--
text: Creighton, surprised, quickly picks up his hairpiece and
text: arranges it on his head.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: You got the dough?!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I can get it, yeah.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Come in, come in, siddown over there.
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. I--tell me--
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What's involved, aside from putting
dialog: up the money? What're you looking
dialog: for the partner to do?
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want
dialog: to keep tabs on your investment, of
dialog: course, but I'm looking for a silent
dialog: partner. I've done the research,
dialog: I've contacted the vendors, the deal
dialog: is set. I'm just looking for venture
dialog: capital, friend. Disappear if you
dialog: want, check in whenever you like--I
dialog: want the dough; I don't take
dialog: attendance.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: And how do we share--
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
text: Fifty-fifty, straight down the line.
dialog: You and me. Finance and expertise.
dialog: So--you've got the dough then, do
dialog: ya?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'll have it in a week.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Well, I'll be damned. The barber!
dialog: And I thought this trip was a bust.
dialog: Well...
text: He reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand
text: and hands Ed a glass.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: ...it just goes to show, when one
text: door slams shut, another one opens.
dialog: Here's to ya, uh...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ed.
text: They both knock back the whiskey. Creighton leans back and
text: gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips,
text: his hairpiece slightly askew.
text: Ed stares back.
text: After a beat, without taking his eyes of Ed, Creighton reaches
text: up and loosens his tie. An almost imperceptible wink.
text: Ed stares.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Was that a pass?
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: (hoarsely)
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You're out of line, mister.
text: Creighton throws up his hands apologetically.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: No problem!
speaker_heading: ED
text: Way out of line.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Right! Strictly business.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON TYPEWRITTEN NOTE
dialog: It says:
scene_heading: I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND DORIS CRANE. COOPERATE OR ED CRANE
scene_heading: WILL KNOW. YOUR WIFE WILL KNOW. EVERYONE WILL KNOW. GATHER
text: $10,000 AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.
text: A hand pulls the note out of a typewriter carriage.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: I sent it to Dave the next morning.
dialog: And I waited.
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: We are looking down at the top of an eight-year-old's crew
text: cut as clippers buzz its perimeter.
text: Frank reads a magazine. The youngster reads a comic as Ed
text: works his head.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: This hair.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...You ever wonder about it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whuddya mean?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't know... How it keeps on
text: coming. It just keeps growing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No, I mean it's growing, it's part
dialog: of us. And we cut it off. And throw
dialog: it away.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare
dialog: the kid.
text: Ed shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: OK, bud, you're through.
text: The kid hops down, still reading his comic, and ambles out
text: the door. Ed gives Frank a considering stare.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw
text: it out in the dirt.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm gonna mingle it with common house
dialog: dirt.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the hell are you talking about?
text: Ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't know. Skip it.
scene_heading: EXT. ED'S HOUSE
text: It is twilight. Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and,
text: cigarette in his mouth, heads up the walk.
text: Music filters out from the house.
scene_heading: INT. ED'S HOUSE
text: Ed walks though the living room, hands in his pockets. The
text: music emanates from a radio in the bedroom.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Ed?
text: A track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity, doing her
text: hair. Her dress is half zipped at the back.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...Gimme a zip.
text: Ed walks over behind her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I
dialog: told you last week, for the Christmas
dialog: Push.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah, right.
text: We are close on the zipper as Ed's hand takes the tab, pauses,
text: the lowers it slightly. Her back blooms through the dark
text: fabric of the dress.
text: He slides the zipper up, and Doris reaches for a perfume
dialog: atomizer.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Come on, get ready. It's important.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Oh, don't be a grump.
speaker_heading: SALES FLOOR
text: It is festooned with streamers.
text: Ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the
text: other bringing a cigarette to his lips.
text: Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the
text: dance floor. Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms
text: over their knees.
text: A thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed, watching,
text: his Adam's apple bobbing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Wild, man!
text: He goes out onto the dance floor. Ed, left by himself, gazes
text: across the floor.
text: His view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows Big Dave worriedly
text: talking to Doris.
text: Doris reacts angrily.
text: Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris. He
text: glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation.
text: He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You in ladies' wear?
text: The young man with the Adam's apple is back, looking out at
text: the floor, snapping his fingers.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Huh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Haven't I seen you up in ladies'
dialog: wear?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't work here. My wife does.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Check out the rack on that broad in
dialog: the angora.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: A hand is laid on Ed's shoulder. It is Big Dave; he leans in
dialog: to murmur:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Ed. Can I talk to you?
scene_heading: BIG DAVE'S OFFICE
text: Music from the party drifts in only faintly. The office is
text: built into a corner of the sales floor. It is dominated by a
text: large desk. A large window on the far side affords a partial
text: view of the floor.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Siddown. Siddown...
text: Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk. Dave fumbles
text: nervously on top of the desk for a cigar. He trims the end
text: of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel
dialog: grip.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Souveniered it off a Jap in New
dialog: Guinea.
text: He hands one cigar to Ed, takes one for himself, then drags
text: up a chair to face Ed's.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...I guess you're wondering what
dialog: Doris was so hot about.
text: The office is dark, the only illumination coming from the
text: window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave. Ed leans
dialog: forward for Dave to light his cigar.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...These're Havanas. Romeo and
dialog: Juliets. Private stock.
text: Dave, having lit Ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Ed, I...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What is it, Dave?
text: Dave breaks down, weeping. He buries his face in his hands,
text: the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Ed, I've been weak...
text: His shoulders heave.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.
text: Ed has taken Dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been
text: carrying on with a married woman.
dialog: Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh--
dialog: what is it they say?--the--the--the
text: chickens are coming home to roost.
text: Ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But,
dialog: uh, that's not the worst of it. I
dialog: got a note. A blackmail note. You
dialog: know, come across or everybody knows.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, you know what that would do to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I guess it would be pretty awkward.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my
dialog: keister! Hell, it's her family's
dialog: store--*her* store. I serve at the
dialog: indulgence of the goddamn ownership,
dialog: Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I only work here! And the lady's
dialog: husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How much to they want, Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: $10,000! I don't know what to do,
dialog: Ed. I don't know what I *can* do.
dialog: Even though I know who the sonofabitch
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...You know... who *who* is?
speaker_heading: DAVE
text: The sonofabitch. The blackmailer.
dialog: It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's
text: a businessman from Sacramento. A
dialog: goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope
dialog: me into some crackpot scheme; I heard
dialog: him out and then told him to go to
dialog: hell. And the very next day, the
dialog: very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed
dialog: for the same amount.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Well, I guess he don't care that
dialog: it's obvious.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: He's staying at the hotel I've gone
dialog: to with, uh, with the lady in
dialog: question. Must've seen us.
text: Big Dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from Ed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Thanks...
text: He exhales with a long sigh.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Oh, Jesus.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: That's my capitalization on the Annex!
dialog: *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty.
dialog: That's what I was just talking to
dialog: Doris about, a way of getting the
dialog: money from the store that we could
dialog: hide from Ann.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn
dialog: wife!
text: He give a tearful chuckle.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Doris, she was pretty hot about
dialog: that. God bless her. She doesn't
dialog: know I'm telling you this--she's mad
dialog: enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're
dialog: the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm
dialog: sorry I... I better get back to the
dialog: party.
text: He rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...I look all right?
speaker_heading: PULLING ED
text: He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room
text: lit only by spill from the party. It is the music department;
text: pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: In a way I felt bad for Big Dave. I
dialog: knew the ten grand was going to pinch
dialog: him where it hurt...
text: Ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray. He takes
text: out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...But Doris was two-timing me and I
dialog: guess, somewhere, that pinched a
dialog: little too.
text: His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. Someone
text: is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room.
text: The person can only be seen only obscurely, from three-
text: quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of
text: haphazardly arranged instruments. The person begins to play.
text: Ed listens. The piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby.
text: The player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and
text: Ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his
dialog: face.
text: The piece ends.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That was pretty.
text: The player turns, surprised. It is a young woman.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Did you make that up?
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig
dialog: van Beethoven.
text: Ed nods recognition of the name.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That was quite something.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: I know who you are, Mr Crane.
text: His look shows surprise.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: ...My father used to take me with
dialog: him when he got his hair cut. Walter
dialog: Abundas?
text: Ed's head tilts back in acknowledgment.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls
dialog: me Birdy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sorry, I just didn't remember.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Oh, that's all right. You can't be
dialog: expected to remember every skinny
text: girl who comes in with her dad.
text: Ed give a wry smile.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...You don't like the music out there?
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really.
dialog: I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
text: A woman calls sharply from offscreen:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Ed.
text: He looks.
text: Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat
text: over her arm, purse in hand.
speaker_heading: ED'S CAR
text: Doris and Ed are driving home.
text: Doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at
dialog: the road.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...What a knucklehead.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Dave.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How's that?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Ahh...
text: She waves angrily.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...Money problems. He's thinking
dialog: about canceling the Annex.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Mm.
text: They ride in silence for a beat. Doris shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...What a knucklehead.
speaker_heading: STREET
text: As the car roars past and into the distance.
scene_heading: ANOTHER STREET
text: It is day. We are looking from inside a parked car toward a
text: hotel entrance. Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a
text: Packard and drives off.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Big Dave did it, though...
text: Ed, sitting in his car, is watching.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I sent a note telling him where
dialog: to drop the money...
speaker_heading: HOTEL HALLWAY
text: Ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray
text: by the elevator.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and he did. He came across.
text: Ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and
text: pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag.
text: He goes back to the stairwell.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER FLOOR
text: Ed emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks.
text: The door swings open.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Yeah, good, how are ya, come in...
text: Ed follows him into the room.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: ...You bring a check?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Cash.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Cash?!
text: He gives Ed a look.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: ...Usually we do this kind of thing
dialog: with a bank draft. But cash--that's
dialog: fine--it's all the same in the end--
dialog: dough's dough, huh?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: I got the paperwork here. Partnership
dialog: papers here, they reflect our
dialog: agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I
dialog: supply professional services, you
dialog: supply the capital. I'll give you a
dialog: receipt on the dough there, huh?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Pretty straightforward, but I don't
dialog: know if you wanna show this stuff to
dialog: a lawyer--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It's OK.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to
dialog: tangle it up and then you pay 'em to
dialog: untangle it, what's the point?
text: He perspires as he counts the money.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: ...Just a second here, I'll give you
dialog: a receipt on the, uh... Whoa,
dialog: Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't
dialog: talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm
dialog: gonna call the place Tolliver's,
dialog: after me, you know, I didn't think
dialog: you were much interested in, uh--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That'll be fine.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
text: He wipes his brow, finishes counting.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: ...Yeah, that's it. As per our
dialog: discussion.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Creighton hands Ed an executed agreement and a receipt.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: Well, there it is. Writ large in
dialog: legal escriture, next step is--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, uh... Creighton...
text: He gives Creighton a level stare, smoke pluming from the
text: cigarette planted in his mouth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...You're not gonna screw me on this?
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a
dialog: lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry*
dialog: cleaning, this is not some fly-by-
dialog: night thing here! I must say, I've
dialog: been an entrepreneur for thirteen
dialog: years and I've never--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: And I've never been asked--Look, you
dialog: want the dough back? You know who I
dialog: am! You--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: OK.
text: Creighton mops his brow again.
speaker_heading: CREIGHTON
dialog: So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?
speaker_heading: CAR
text: Ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth. Doris sits
text: next to him. Rural scenery slips by in the background.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: The next day was Saturday. We were
dialog: going to a reception for Doris' cousin
dialog: Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner
dialog: out near Modesto. Doris didn't much
dialog: feel like going, and I didn't either,
dialog: but, like she said, we had a
dialog: Commitment.
text: Doris gazes stonily out at the road. At length:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...I hate wops.
text: Ed gives her a brief glance. Doris glares at him.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...What's so damn strange about that?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I didn't say a word.
text: She looks back out at the road.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...*You* didn't have to grow up with
dialog: 'em.
text: This brings nothing from Ed. Doris shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...Family. Boy.
speaker_heading: BY A BARN
text: Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled
dialog: with food.
text: A small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and
dialog: screams:
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's
dialog: ridin' Garibaldi!
text: Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung
text: over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig. He slaps
text: at the pig's ass with a large straw hat.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: That was when she started drinking.
text: Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine
text: from a water glass. Ed stands nearby.
text: A large woman hugs Doris.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: How you doin', Doris, you been OK?
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: How're you, Constanza?
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And
dialog: how you been, uh...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ed.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Ed. How's a business?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: (to Doris)
dialog: He's a barber, right? It's a good
dialog: trade. So how come you got no kids?
speaker_heading: PICNIC TABLE
text: A group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a
text: picnic table set out with pies in a row.
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for
dialog: Frankie!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!
text: An old man stands by with a stopwatch.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Ready...
text: He clicks the timer.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: ...Go!
text: Frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the
text: line of blueberry pies.
text: The other picnickers cheer them on.
speaker_heading: ELSEWHERE
text: Ed and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple
text: accepting congratulations.
text: Doris, holding her empty glass, is not a happy drunk:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: 'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn
dialog: wonderful.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Congratulations, Gina.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Life is so goddamn wonderful, you
dialog: almost won't believe it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Honey...
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries,
dialog: I'm sure.
text: Ed tries to lead her away.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Honey...
text: Doris calls back over her shoulder:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Congratulations on your goddamn
dialog: cherries!
text: As Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...Leggo my goddamn elbow.
speaker_heading: ELSEWHERE
text: In a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill, staggering
text: slowly, painfully, toward a tree. In his right hand he
text: clutches a trophy.
text: When he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against
text: it, leans forward, and vomits.
speaker_heading: CAR
text: Late afternoon, driving home.
text: Ed drives. Doris sits in the front passenger seat, snoring
text: lightly. Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to
text: his chest, eyes closed, murmuring:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I never wanna see another blueberry
dialog: pie...
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...I never even wanna hear those
dialog: words.
text: Doris moans.
dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Don't says those words, Ed.
scene_heading: EXT. BUNGALOW
text: It is twilight. Ed's coupe is parked in the driveway. He is
text: just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger-side
text: door. He pulls Doris from the car, half asleep, half drunk.
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW
text: The door swings open and Ed stumbles in supporting Doris,
text: who has one arm draped around his neck. He helps her into
text: the bedroom and eases her onto the bed.
text: He sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her.
text: Shadows from branches just outside wave across her face. She
text: is breathing through her open mouth; her face is moist with
dialog: perspiration.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: I'd met Doris blind on a double-date
dialog: with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who
dialog: was seeing a friend of hers from
dialog: work. We went to a movie; Doris had
dialog: a flask; we killed it. She could put
text: it away. At the end of the night she
dialog: said she liked it I didn't talk much.
dialog: A couple weeks later she suggested--
text: A harsh jangle from the telephone. Doris moans but does not
text: wake; Ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What--now?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Please, Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: But it's...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Please, Ed.
text: Ed sighs.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Your place?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: OK.
text: He hangs up.
text: He nudges Doris.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Honey.
text: She murmurs.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Honey.
text: She rolls away and burrows into a pillow.
text: Ed opens her purse and pokes through it.
speaker_heading: NIRDLINGER'S
text: We are looking over Ed's shoulder as he hesitantly swings
text: open a door.
text: It reveals Big Dave's office, quiet and rather dark.
text: A down-facing banker's lamp on the desk illuminates Big Dave's
text: hands on the desktop.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Dave?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: Come on in.
text: Ed enters, sits.
text: An awkward silence.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...What's the problem, Big Dave?
dialog: Another silence.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...I'm ruined.
text: His hands writhe on the desktop.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...It ruined me. This money. No annex.
dialog: I'm all shot to hell.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So you paid the guy?
text: Big Dave stares without speaking.
text: After a long beat:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...What kind of man *are* you?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Huh?
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: What kind of man *are* you?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Big Dave--
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'd understand if you'd walked in
dialog: here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever.
dialog: I deserved it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I, uh...
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: I'm not proud of what I did. But
dialog: *you*.
text: No one talks.
text: Big Dave sighs.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know.
dialog: And then I went and found the pansy.
text: He looks at Ed.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah,
dialog: well, you already know the story. I
dialog: didn't, I hadda beat it out of the
dialog: pansy. *Your* money.
dialog: No response.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...What kind of man *are* you?
text: Big Dave rises.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...Well.
text: He crosses around the desk and adds, sadly:
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...I'm all shot to hell.
text: Ed starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him.
text: Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall.
text: Ed hits the wall and bounces off, back into Big Dave. Big
text: Dave wallops him in the stomach. Ed doubles over.
speaker_heading: DAVE
dialog: ...What kind of man *are* you?
text: Big Dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face
text: against the desktop. Ed's hands scrabble at the top of the
text: desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts. He slams
text: him face-first into the window between the office and the
text: dark sales floor.
text: Ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed against
text: the glass. Big Dave's hands lock around his throat.
text: Big Dave sweats and strains.
text: A crack shoots up the pane of glass.
text: Ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's
dialog: neck.
text: Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. His hands go up to
text: his throat.
text: Ed watches. He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer.
text: Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his
text: head twisted away.
text: He falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face-
text: down onto the floor.
text: Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his knees
text: but with his hands still at his throat. His face and knees
text: awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something
text: across the floor with his nose.
text: He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself
text: in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through
text: the wall. Blood is pooling out from under him.
text: Big Dave's legs are still working. His gurgling continues.
text: Ed watches.
text: Big Dave's legs start to move furiously. They convulse. His
text: whole body shakes as he goes into shock.
text: Ed watches.
text: Big Dave stops shaking. He remains wedged awkwardly into the
text: corner, face-down. He is still.
text: The room is very quiet.
text: Ed looks down at his hands.
text: He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks
text: across the darkened sales floor.
scene_heading: EXT. STORE
text: Ed walks to his car. He does not look about, is not
text: particularly furtive. He gets into the car. He starts the
dialog: ignition.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE
text: He pulls up, sits motionless for a beat. Gradually, something
text: draws his attention; he cocks his head and looks up through
text: the windshield.
text: A branch creaks and sways in the breeze.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
text: Ed gets into bed next to Doris. He stares at the ceiling.
text: Wind rustles outside.
text: The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the
dialog: wind.
text: He looks at Doris.
text: Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth
text: is closed now, her breathing more peaceful. The leafy shadows
text: play over her face.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...It was only a couple of weeks
dialog: after we met that Doris suggested
dialog: getting married. I said, Don't you
dialog: wanna get to know me more? She said,
dialog: Why, does it get better? She looked
dialog: at me like I was a dope, which I've
dialog: never really minded from her. And
dialog: she had a point, I guess. We knew
dialog: each other as well then as now...
text: He is gazing at her.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Anyway, well enough.
text: Sound and image face.
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
dialog: The next day.
text: Ed cuts hair, a cigarette between his lips.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Holy-moly, do I got a headache.
text: Frank is giving a haircut as well.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...How you today, Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You don't got a headache?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Nah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Damn, I got a headache to beat the
dialog: band.
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Ed sits in his chair, hands folded in his lap, head tilted
text: back, eyes closed.
text: We hold on Ed as we hear a clipper buzzing and Frank talking
text: to someone in his chair.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it?
dialog: That'll just flood it.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold
dialog: it down. *That'll* flood it.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You crazy? You pumped it?
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Well, ya can't hold it down.
text: There is the jingle of the door bell. Ed opens his eyes.
text: Two men in fedoras are entering.
text: Ed starts to rise.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: Ed Crane?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: Come on outside.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
text: The two men are staring at the sidewalk, smoking, hesitant
text: to speak. One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker:
speaker_heading: MAN 2
dialog: ...So you're a barber, huh?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: MAN 1
dialog: I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.
text: Ed nods toward their car:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...We goin'?
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: Huh? No.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: ...Cigarette?
text: Ed holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: Right. Uh... Pete's got some news
dialog: for you.

speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: ...Look, pal, it's a tough break,
dialog: but, uh... well damnit, your wife's
dialog: been pinched.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: They sent us to tell ya.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: They sent us to tell ya. We pulled
dialog: the detail.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: My *wife*?
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county
dialog: jail, uh...
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: Homicide.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A
dialog: guy named David Brewster. He's, uh...
dialog: He's the decedent.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: He's the dead guy.
text: Ed stares at him.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: ...Yeah, it's a tough break.
speaker_heading: KREBS
text: Visiting ends at five. Too late today.
dialog: You can see her tomorrow.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: ...Crap detail.
scene_heading: RESIDENTIAL STREET
text: It is evening. Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined
text: street similar to his own. He gets out of his car and goes
text: up the walk, and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a
text: hand of greeting.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: 'Lo, Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello, Walter.
text: He steps up on the porch.
text: The man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks
text: as the swing moves. His skin glistens with drinker's sweat,
text: and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone who's
text: put at least a couple away.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Have a seat.
text: Ed glances around but the swing is the only seat. He sits
text: next to Walter.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh, hell. Drink?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure you don't need one?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: OK. Boy. Jesus!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah. What do I, uh...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of
dialog: my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh,
dialog: probate, real estate, title search,
dialog: uh... I'd be absolutely worthless,
dialog: something like this. Absolutely
dialog: worthless.
text: He belches.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: 'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um.
dialog: Frankly, Doris'd be better off with
dialog: the county defender.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He a good man?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I
dialog: won't kid you though, Ed, nobody
dialog: around here has any experience with
dialog: this kind of, er... And I hear they're
dialog: bringing a prosecutor up from
dialog: Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking
dialog: it seriously... Hmm...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Taking it seriously.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So, who should I--
text: The front door opens and someone speaks through the screen:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: You want any coffee, Dad?
text: Ed looks around at the voice.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Oh, hello, Mr Crane.
text: She steps out: it is Birdy Abundas.
text: Ed rises, and they awkwardly shake hands.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello, Rachel.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Coffee, Ed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm fine. Thanks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: No thanks, honey.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane.
text: They watch her go back in.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Damnit! She's a good kid.
text: Ed nods.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...So, uh, who should I--
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San
dialog: Francisco. Probity--you know, no one
dialog: ever said anything iffy about Lloyd
dialog: Garroway. Conservative. Jury might
dialog: like that. Might like that here.
text: He takes a sip of his drink.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...Probity.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for,
dialog: uh...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Well, the best, the money-is-no-object
dialog: best, for a criminal case, any lawyer
dialog: would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider.
dialog: Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't
dialog: know how you're fixed for money.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yeah, the best.
text: He sniffs.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I
dialog: could tell you more. Hell, I wish I
dialog: could handle it myself. But I'd be
dialog: absolutely worthless for this kind
dialog: of thing.
text: He takes a musing sip.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...Criminal matter? Freddy
dialog: Riedenschneider.
dialog: He thinks.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...No question about it.
speaker_heading: ED AT A TABLE
text: It is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides,
text: one side for prisoners, the other for visitors. The room is
text: empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across
text: from a younger woman at the far end of the table. The younger
text: woman, in a prison smock, is wailing. The elderly woman is
text: holding her hand.
text: Ed sits across from an empty chair, clutching a flower-printed
text: toiletries kit. There are echoing voices suggesting large
text: spaces outside the room.
text: He sits and waits.
text: Approaching footsteps.
text: The door opens. A large prison matron steps aside to let
text: Doris enter.
text: Doris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big
text: for her. Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled. Not only is
text: she not made-up, she has a couple of bruises and a cut on
text: her lip.
text: As Ed stands, she gives a hollow look around.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Honey... I brought your make-up.
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Honey.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: How are you?
text: She shrugs.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I don't know what's going on. I--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: What happened to you?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...I don't know what happened to Big
dialog: Dave. I know some of it.
dialog: Irregularities in my books, they
dialog: said. Can I explain it.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You don't have to--
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I helped him cook the books, Ed. I
dialog: did do that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You don't have to tell them anything.
dialog: We're getting you a lawyer.
text: Doris doesn't seem to be listening. She sighs:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I know all about that. But I don't
dialog: know how much to tell them.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting
dialog: you Freddy Riedenschneider.
text: Doris finally looks at him.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Should I... should I tell you why?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You don't have to tell me anything.
text: Her gaze drifts away again. She notices the sobbing woman.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: Doris looks around and laughs.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone
dialog: could open them up, make sense of
dialog: the whole goddamn store.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Honey...
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: I knew we'd pay for it.
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: Ed sits in a waiting-customer chair, wearing his smock. Frank
text: paces in front of him. He smacks a fist into his palm.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is what family is for, Ed! This
dialog: is when ya come together!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons
dialog: of bitches!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Frank, uh, you know I'll try to
dialog: contribute, but, uh--Freddy
dialog: Riedenschneider--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't care what it costs! This is
dialog: when ya come together!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's very generous.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The hell with it, Eddie!
speaker_heading: BANK
text: Ed and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby.
text: Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit. As they
text: wait, he looks nervously about.
text: In a hushed voice:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They're just people like you and me,
dialog: Ed. Remember that.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just people. They gotta put up the
dialog: big front so that people will trust
dialog: them with their money. This is why
dialog: the big lobby, Ed. But they put their
text: pants on one leg at a time. Just
dialog: like you and me.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite
dialog: of appearances. And their money will
text: be secured by the barbershop. A rock.
dialog: A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean,
dialog: how long has *this* place been here?
text: A door opens. A conservatively dressed man of late middle
text: age emerges.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Mr Raffo?
text: Frank hops to his feet.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Could you come with me please?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure. Can Ed come too?
text: The man looks dubiously at Ed.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Mr...?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Crane. Ed Crane.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: You also have an interest in the
dialog: securing property?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's a barber.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Second chair.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Not an owner.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, he's family, he's my brother-in-
dialog: law.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited
dialog: here.
text: He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank
text: trailing dejectedly behind. They enter, the door closes, and
text: we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of the
dialog: words lost.
text: Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of
text: business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped
text: to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes
text: successive documents across his desk with a word of
text: explanation for each as Frank signs.
text: Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassively.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
text: The barbershop. Doris and Frank's
dialog: father had worked thirty years to
dialog: own it free and clear. Now it got
dialog: signed over to the bank, and the
dialog: bank signed some money over to Frank,
dialog: and Frank signed the money over...
text: TRACKING POINT OF VIEW
text: It is midday. We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a
text: long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb. A couple of
text: kids have stopped to peer into the car's windows; the car is
dialog: no doubt the fanciest in town.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who
dialog: got into town two days later...
text: Ed, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a
text: restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that
text: obscures the interior. Gilt lettering on the window spells
dialog: out "DaVinci's".
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and told me to meet him at
dialog: DaVinci's for lunch.
text: TRACKING POINT OF VIEW
text: Inside the restaurant. We are tracking toward a table whose
text: lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu
text: as he orders from a facing waitress:
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...not fried, poached. Three of 'em
text: for two minutes. A strip steak medium
dialog: rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato
text: juice, and plenty of hot coffee.
text: He flips the menu over.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...Do you have prairie oysters?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Then bring me a fruit cocktail while
dialog: I wait.
text: He looks up at Ed.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...You're Ed Crane?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah--
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Barber, right? I'm Freddy
dialog: Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell
dialog: me the chow's OK here. I made some
dialog: inquiries.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No thanks, I--
text: The waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of
dialog: Riedenschneider.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Look, I don't wanna waste your time
dialog: so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind?
dialog: *You* don't mind. So while I'm in
dialog: town I'll be staying at the Hotel
dialog: Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah,
dialog: it's goofy, the suites're named after
dialog: operas; room's OK though, I poked
dialog: around. I'm having 'em hold it for
dialog: me on account of I'll be back and
dialog: forth. In addition to my retainer,
dialog: you're paying hotel, living expenses,
dialog: secretarial, private eye if we need
dialog: to make inquiries, headshrinker should
dialog: we go that way. We'll talk about
dialog: appeals if, as and when. For right
dialog: now, has she confessed?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Good! That helps. Not that she didn't
dialog: do it, that she didn't confess. Of
dialog: course, there's ways to deal with a
dialog: confession, but that's good!--one
dialog: less thing to think about. Now.
dialog: Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow.
dialog: You should be there. Three o'clock.
dialog: One more thing: you keep your mouth
dialog: shut. I get the lay of the land, I
dialog: tell *you* what to say. No talking
dialog: out of school. What's out of school?
dialog: Everything's out of school. I do the
dialog: talking; you keep your trap shut.
dialog: I'm an attorney, you're a barber;
dialog: you don't know anything. Understood?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...OK.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Good! Any questions give me a ring--
dialog: Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a
dialog: message. You sure you don't want
dialog: anything? No?
text: He points a finger at Ed.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's
dialog: OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory.
text: The waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...And the flapjacks, honey.
scene_heading: DRIVING POINT OF VIEW
text: We are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the
text: windshield of a moving car.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: All going about their business. It
dialog: seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger
dialog: one even then what had really happened
dialog: to Big Dave, something none of them
dialog: knew...
text: On Ed, driving.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Like I had made it to the outside,
dialog: somehow, and they were all still
text: struggling, way down below.
speaker_heading: ED IN BED
text: Arms folded behind his head, staring at the ceiling.
text: On the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb.
text: A distant, muffled knock.
text: Ed turns his head.
speaker_heading: FRONT DOOR
text: Ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe.
text: The woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black: a
text: black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her
text: bird-like frame.
text: Wind rustles in the trees behind her.
text: She stares at Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ann.
text: For the first time, we hear her speak, in a low, tremulous
dialog: voice:
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Hello, Ed.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ann. Will you come in?
text: She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: ...No, No, it's very late.
text: Ed nods.
text: After an uncomfortable beat, through which she continues to
dialog: stare:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I'm so sorry about your loss.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Yes. Thank you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Of course, you know, Doris had nothing
dialog: to do with it. Nothing at all.
text: She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came
dialog: to tell you...
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yes, Ann?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: And you should tell Doris...
text: She falls silent. The trees behind her rustle.
text: She gives a wary look back. Then, confidingly, to Ed:
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: ...You know how Big Dave loved
dialog: camping. And the out-of-doors.
dialog: Ed is puzzled:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: We went camping last summer. In
dialog: Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene,
dialog: Ed.
text: She gives him a searching look, hoping, it seems, that he
dialog: will find this significant.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Yes?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: At night, there were lights--we both
dialog: saw them. We never told anyone,
dialog: outside of our official report.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ann--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: A spacecraft. I saw the creatures.
text: They led Big Dave onto the craft. He
dialog: never told anyone what they did,
dialog: outside of his report. Of course he
dialog: told *me*. No one else.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ann--
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: The government knows. I cannot repeat
dialog: it to you. But this thing goes deep,
dialog: Ed. This was not your wife. I goes
dialog: deep, and involves the government.
dialog: There is a great deal of fear. You
dialog: know how certain circles would find
dialog: it--the knowledge--a threat. They
dialog: try to limit it, and--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ann, will you come in, sit down,
dialog: maybe have a drink?
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed.
dialog: After this happened, things changed.
dialog: Big Dave... he never touched me again.
text: Ed says nothing.
text: She touches his arm.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: ...Tell Doris not to worry. I know
dialog: it wasn't her. Perhaps this will
dialog: bring it out, finally. Perhaps now
dialog: it will all come out.
text: She turns and heads down the walk.
text: Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the sidewalk,
text: then are lost in the rustle of leaves.
text: Ed watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller.
scene_heading: PRISON MEETING ROOM
text: It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs.
text: One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight.
text: Ed and Doris sit at the table; Freddy Riedenschneider stands
text: to one side staring up at the high window, hands dug into
text: his pockets.
text: All three are motionless for a long beat. Finally:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...It stinks.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: But it's true.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: I don't care it's true, it's not
dialog: true; it stinks. You say he was being
dialog: blackmailed; by who? You don't know.
dialog: For having an affair; with who? You
dialog: don't know. Did anyone else know
dialog: about it? Probably not; you don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I knew about it. Big Dave told me
dialog: about it, and the spot he was putting
text: himself in by getting the money.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Terrific. Your husband backs you up.
dialog: That's terrific.
text: He starts pacing.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...You've gotta give me something to
dialog: work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is
dialog: good, but he's not a magician. He
dialog: can't just wave his little wand in
dialog: the air and make a plausible defense
dialog: materialize. Look. Look at what the
dialog: other side is gonna run at us. They
dialog: got the company books, prepared by
dialog: you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive.
dialog: They got a murder scene *you* had
dialog: access to. That's Opportunity. They
dialog: got that little trimmer thing he was
dialog: stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's*
dialog: weapon--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: It was Big Dave's.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: --don't interrupt me--that's Means.
dialog: They got a fine upstanding pillar of
dialog: the business community as a victim,
dialog: and then they got *you*, a disgruntled
dialog: number-juggling underling who on the
dialog: day in question was drunk as a skunk
dialog: and whose alibi for the time in
text: question is being passed out at home,
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: *I* was with her.
text: Riedenschneider gives him a hard look.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Like I say, it stinks.
text: Another long pause.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I killed him.
text: Riedenschneider eyes him. Wheels start turning.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: OK, we forget the blackmail. *You*
dialog: killed him. How come?
speaker_heading: ED
text: He and Doris... were having an affair.
text: Doris eyes him. His manner does not reveal anything.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: OK, how did you know?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I... just knew. A husband knows.
text: Riedenschneider rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Will anyone else say they knew?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't know. I don't think so.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: How did you get into the store?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I took Doris's keys.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Will anyone say they saw you there?
dialog: On your way there? In there? On your
dialog: was back?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I don't think so.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Will anyone corroborate and goddamn
dialog: part of your story at all?
text: Ed returns Riedenschneider's stare. Riedenschneider resumes
dialog: pacing.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Come on, people. You can't help
dialog: each other like that. Let's be
dialog: realistic now. Let's look at our
dialog: options. Well, frankly, I don't *see*
dialog: any options.
text: A nod of the head indicates Doris:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...I cannot present Story A.
dialog: Another nod indicates Ed:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...I cannot present Story B. I could
dialog: plead you for a nutcase but you look
dialog: too composed. I could offer a guilty
dialog: plea and in return they don't give
dialog: you the juice, but I don't think you
dialog: want to spend the rest of your life
dialog: in Chino and I know you didn't hire
dialog: Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your
text: hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell,
dialog: you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway
dialog: for that. No, we're not giving up
dialog: yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider,
dialog: it means you're *not* throwing in
dialog: the towel. I litigate, I don't
dialog: capitulate. All right, no options,
dialog: we gotta think. All right, we go
dialog: back to the blackmail thing. It
dialog: titillates, it's open ended...
text: His pacing becomes more animated.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...And it makes *him* the bad guy--
dialog: ya dig around, ya never know,
text: something unsavory from his past, he
dialog: approaches you to help with the money,
text: it's too late, his past comes back
dialog: to haunt him, who's to say...
text: He is heading for the door.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous
dialog: husband thing, that's silly; we're
dialog: going with the blackmail. I'll be in
dialog: touch.
text: The door slams.
speaker_heading: HOTEL LOBBY
text: The camera drifts in toward the reception desk. Ed talks to
text: the clerk behind the desk, but the scene plays silently; we
text: hear only Ed's narration.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Of course, there was *one* person
dialog: who could confirm Doris's story, or
dialog: plenty of it: the dry-cleaning
dialog: pansy...
text: The desk clerk is shaking his head.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...But he'd left the hotel, skipped
dialog: out on his bill...
speaker_heading: HALLWAY
text: It is a rooming-house hallway. A stern middle-aged woman is
text: on the hall telephone. This too plays silently under the
dialog: narration.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: He'd also disappeared from the
dialog: residence he gave me...
speaker_heading: ED'S LIVING ROOM
text: We are drifting in toward Ed, who nods at the telephone and
text: then cradles it. He stares down at the business card he holds.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...owing two month's rent. How could
dialog: I have been so stupid. Handing over
dialog: $10,000. For a piece of paper. And
dialog: the man gone... like a ghost...
scene_heading: PULLING BACK FROM ED
text: In a different living room. He sits on a sofa, hands clasped
text: behind his head, listening. For the first time, as the voice-
text: over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano
dialog: music.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...disappeared into thin air,
text: vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki.
text: Gone now. All gone. The money gone.
dialog: Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could
dialog: I have been so stupid?
text: The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby
text: chair, also listening as Birdy plays.
text: Walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids
text: droop. As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion
text: his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed,
text: and he starts lightly to snore.
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at
text: the cut. Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs,
text: administering haircuts.
text: The customer in Ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do
text: not hide rolls of fat. He has a hot towel over his face that
text: does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some
dialog: extent:
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: She makes this stuff, she calls it
dialog: gatto, it's got egg in there, it's
dialog: got sugar, it's got--it's cake,
dialog: basically, except she calls it gatto.
dialog: Like if you don't call it cake maybe
dialog: you won't put on any weight, like I
dialog: need to eat gatto, you know what I'm
dialog: saying? This stuff, if I've had a
dialog: square meal, I've had my steak and
dialog: potatoes, I can just have another
dialog: cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask
dialog: for the desert if it's not there...

dialog: Sooner or later everyone needs a
dialog: haircut...
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: Got the recipe from a magazine,
dialog: woman's magazine...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: We were working for the bank now. We
text: kept cutting the hair, trying to
dialog: stay afloat, make the payments, tread
dialog: water, day by day, day by day...
speaker_heading: CRANE DOWN
text: Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table,
text: the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff
text: reading an indictment. Doris stands next to Freddy
dialog: Riedenschneider.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Most people think someone's accused
dialog: of a crime, they haul 'em in and
dialog: bring 'em to trial, but it's not
dialog: like that, it's not that fast. The
text: wheels of justice turn slow...
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: ...did willfully and with malice
dialog: aforethought take the life of one
dialog: David Allen Brewster, a human being...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
text: They have an arraignment, and then
dialog: the indictment, and they entertain
dialog: motions to dismiss, and postpone,
dialog: and change the venue, and alter this
text: and that and the other. They empanel
dialog: a jury, which brings more motions,
dialog: and they set a trial date and then
dialog: change the date, and then often as
dialog: not they'll change it again.
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: What say you to these charges?
dialog: Our boom down has ended close on Doris. We hear Freddy
dialog: Riedenschneider, off:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: We plead not guilty, your honor.
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: Booming down toward the fat man.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: And through all of it we cut the
dialog: hair.
speaker_heading: CUSTOMER
dialog: I say, Honey, if you're gonna make a
dialog: cobbler, make a little bit of cobbler,
dialog: don't put a whole pan in front of me
dialog: and tell me it's not gonna be any
dialog: good when it's cold...
speaker_heading: OPERA SINGERS
text: We are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in
text: character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies,
text: dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths
text: of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song. We
text: pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room,
text: floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider, a
text: mask over his eyes, slumbers.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
text: ...Meanwhile, Freddy Riedenschneider
dialog: slept at the Metropole...
speaker_heading: RESTAURANT
text: Tracking in toward Freddy Riedenschneider, who sits twirling
text: spaghetti with a fork against a spoon.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and shoveled it in at DaVinci's.
speaker_heading: LATERAL TRACK
text: From inside a car. Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk. Among
text: them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to
text: the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: He'd brought in a private investigator
dialog: from Sacramento...
speaker_heading: LATERAL TRACK
text: Moving the opposite way. A different day, but again a crowd
text: moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man
text: scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his
text: hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring
text: his face.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...to nose around into Big Dave's
dialog: past.
text: PUSHING IN TO ED
text: In the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy
text: at the piano, but now the two of them are alone.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: I found myself more and more going
dialog: over to the Abundas's. It was a
dialog: routine we fell into, most every
dialog: evening. I even went when Walter was
dialog: away on his research trips. He was a
dialog: genealogist, had traced back his
dialog: side of the family seven generations,
dialog: his late wife's, eight. It seemed
dialog: like a screwy hobby. But then maybe
dialog: all hobbies are. Maybe Walter found
dialog: something there, in the old county
dialog: courthouses, hospital file rooms,
dialog: city archives, property rolls,
dialog: registries, something maybe like
dialog: what I found listening to Birdy play.
dialog: Some kind of escape. Some kind of
dialog: peace...
text: The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, but
text: then is snapped by a sharp clang.
scene_heading: PRISON DOOR SWINGS OPEN
text: We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room.
text: None of its three occupants is moving.
text: The tableau consists of Doris staring down at the table; the
text: private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped
text: back against a wall, his arms folded across his chest, his
text: fedora pushed back on his head, a toothpick clamped between
text: his teeth; and Freddy Riedenschneider, standing, hands clasped
text: behind his back, gazing with a distant smile up into the
text: shaft of light that slants through the high window.
text: A warder shuts the door behind Ed.
text: Doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance;
text: Riedenschneider does not.
text: Ed pulls out a chair across from Doris, clasps his hands on
text: top of hers.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: 'Lo, honey.
text: She looks at his hands on top of hers.
text: A long beat.
text: Still gazing up into the shaft of light, Freddy
dialog: Riedenschneider announces:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...They got this guy, in Germany.
dialog: Fritz something-or-other. Or is it.
dialog: Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got
dialog: this theory, you wanna test something,
dialog: you know, scientifically--how the
dialog: planets go round the sun, what
dialog: sunspots are made of, why the water
dialog: comes out of the tap--well, you gotta
dialog: look at it. But sometimes, you look
dialog: at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya
dialog: can't know the reality of what
dialog: happened, or what *would've* happened
dialog: if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn
dialog: schnozz. So there *is* no 'what
dialog: happened.' Not in any sense that we
dialog: can grasp with our puny minds. Because
dialog: our minds... out minds get in the
text: way. Looking at something changes
dialog: it. They call it the 'Uncertainty
dialog: Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy,
dialog: but even Einstein says the guy's on
dialog: to something.
text: His gaze up at the window breaks. He strolls around the room,
text: still smiling.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Science. Perception. Reality.
dialog: Doubt...
text: He stops to examine a bur on his fingernail.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin',
dialog: sometimes, the more you look, the
dialog: less you really know. It's a fact. A
dialog: proved fact. In a way, it's the only
dialog: fact there is. This heinie even wrote
dialog: it out in numbers.
text: He looks up at the private detective.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Burns?
text: With a slight weight shift, Burns tips his chair so that its
text: front legs slap down onto the floor. He fishes a small
text: notebook from an inside pocket.
text: His boredom is profound; his only concession to performance
text: is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the
dialog: other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: Subject: David Allen Brewster. Born:
dialog: Cincinnati, 1911. Father: insurance
dialog: salesman; mother: homemaker. One
dialog: year Case Western University on
text: football scholarship. Flunks out.
dialog: 1931: retail appliance salesman in
dialog: Barnhoff's department store,
dialog: Cincinnati. 1933: meets Ann
dialog: Nirdlinger, married later that year,
dialog: moves here. 1935: arrested on an
dialog: assault complaint; complainant, an
dialog: organizer for the ILGWU, has a broken
dialog: nose, couple of ribs, wife's family
text: intercedes, some kind of settlement,
dialog: charges dropped. 1936: another assault
dialog: beef, bar altercation--
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Yeah, yeah, couple of fistfights. Go
dialog: to his service record.
text: Burns looks at him sourly. He flips a couple of pages.
speaker_heading: BURNS
dialog: ...Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned
dialog: to fifth fleet US Navy, petty officer
dialog: first class, serves in clerical
dialog: capacity in US naval shipyards in
text: San Diego, one fistfight broken up
dialog: by MPs, no court martial, honorable
dialog: discharge May 8, 1945. Since then
dialog: he's been clean.
text: Riedenschneider nods, smiling.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Thank you, Burns, get lost.
text: Burns pockets his notebook, adjusts his hat, jams his hands
text: into his pockets, and ambles out of the room.
text: The slam of the door leaves quiet.
dialog: At length:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...So?
text: Riedenschneider's fixed smile now fades.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: So? *So?!* This could be your dolly's
dialog: ticket out of the deathhouse, so!
text: Ed and Doris look at each other.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I don't get it.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Look, chum, this is a guy, from what
dialog: I understand, told everybody he was
dialog: a war hero, right? Island hopping,
dialog: practically liberated the Pacific
text: all by himself with a knife in one
text: hand and a gun in the other and twenty
text: yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: And now it turns out this dope spent
text: the war sitting on his ass in some
dialog: boatyard in San Diego. You asked for
dialog: blackmail, let me give you blackmail:
dialog: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to
dialog: open his own business here, has been
dialog: lying to everybody in this town for
dialog: the last four years, probably
text: including half the people sitting on
dialog: that jury. Well, it finally caught
dialog: up with him--these dopes, it always
dialog: does; someone threatened to spill
dialog: it. Somebody knew his dirty little
dialog: secret, just like your wife says.
dialog: They called, they demanded money...
text: He is looking at Doris.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Did Big Dave mention that it was
dialog: something about his war service? I
dialog: don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll*
dialog: have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified,
dialog: maybe he didn't; I'm not putting
dialog: words in your mouth; the point is
dialog: that this liar, this cynical
dialog: manipulator, this man who through
text: his lies sneered and belittled the
dialog: sacrifice and heroism of all our
dialog: boys who *did* serve and bleed and
dialog: puke and die on foreign shores, and
dialog: who made a fool out of this entire
dialog: town, turns to *you* to help him out
dialog: of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: So... who... who actually--
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But
dialog: the point is that if Mr Prosecutor
dialog: over there had devoted half the time
dialog: he's spent persecuting *this* woman
dialog: to even the most cursory investigation
dialog: of this schmoe's past, then we might
dialog: *know* who! But we can't *know* what
dialog: really happened! Because of Fritz,
dialog: or Werner, or whatever the hell his
dialog: name is! And because Me Prosecutor
dialog: is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch
dialog: who decided it's easier to victimize
dialog: your wife! Because it's easier *not*
dialog: to look! Because the more you look,
dialog: the less you know! But the beauty of
dialog: it is, we don't *gotta* know! We
dialog: just gotta show that, goddamnit,
dialog: *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt.
dialog: Science. The atom. *You* explain it
dialog: to me. Go ahead. Try.
text: He chuckles as he heads for the door.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees
dialog: daylight. We got a real shot at this,
dialog: folks. Let's not get cocky.
text: The door shuts behind him.
text: Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene.
text: A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her
dialog: mouth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Honey...?
text: The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh.
text: Ed frowns.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Honey?
text: Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides
text: and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes
dialog: her head:
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: What a dope.
scene_heading: ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM
text: Ed sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment,
text: her eyes on the sheet music:
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: He was deaf when he wrote this.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Beethoven. He created it, and yet he
dialog: never actually heard it. I suppose
text: he heard it all in his head, somehow.
dialog: Over her continued playing:
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: So maybe Riedenschneider could get
dialog: Doris off. Maybe it would all work
dialog: out. And I thought--I hoped--that
dialog: maybe there was a way out for me as
dialog: well...
speaker_heading: A SIGN
text: The cardboard sign on an easel says "COME ONE, COME ALL /
scene_heading: PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW / WEDNESDAY APRIL 29, 1949,
text: 8:00 P.M.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: The girl had talent, anyone could
dialog: see that. And *she* wasn't some fly-
dialog: by-nighter, she was just a good clean
dialog: kid...
scene_heading: SCHOOL GYMNASIUM
text: A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift
text: stage to a smattering of applause. Birdy walks out to the
text: baby grand that has been set out center stage.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...If she was going to have a career
dialog: she'd need a responsible adult looking
dialog: out for her...
text: We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set
text: out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents,
dialog: many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to rest
dialog: on Ed.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...some kind of... manager. She'd
dialog: have contracts to look at, be going
text: on tours, playing on the radio maybe.
dialog: I could help her sort through all of
dialog: that, without charging her an arm
dialog: and a leg, just enough to get by...
text: Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL
text: Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm
text: summer night. He looks around the parking lot.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I could afford to charge less
dialog: than the usual manager, not having
dialog: to put up a big front like a lot of
dialog: these phonies. And I could be with
dialog: her, enough to keep myself feeling
dialog: OK...
text: A trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car,
text: laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another
dialog: student--a boy.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Why couldn't that work?... Why
dialog: not?...
text: Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's
text: drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Hi, Mr Crane.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello, Birdy. I thought that was
dialog: very good.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Oh, in there? I messed up a little
dialog: bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody
dialog: noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is
dialog: Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr
dialog: Crane.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello, Tony.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Hello, sir.
text: Silence. The teens wait for the adult to direct the
text: conversation; Ed has nothing to say. At length, he clears
text: his throat.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Well, congratulations. I guess
dialog: I'll be getting home.
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: Nice to meet you, sir.
speaker_heading: TURANDOT SUITE
text: It is morning. We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the
text: bathroom, where we hear water running.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Anyway, that's what I was thinking
dialog: about in the days leading up to the
dialog: trial. It seemed like once that was
dialog: over, I'd be ready for a new start.
dialog: Freddy Riedenschneider was very
text: optimistic. He was busy preparing...
text: We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider
text: hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water.
text: He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some
text: tonic in his hair.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...And finally it came... the first
dialog: day of the trial...
text: Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...What Riedenschneider called the
dialog: Big Show.
text: He straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist.
speaker_heading: COURTROOM
text: We are close on the back of Riedenschneider's gleaming hair.
text: He is sitting at the defense table.
text: There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where's the judge? How come there's
dialog: no judge?
text: Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row
text: directly behind Riedenschneider.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Where's the judge, Ed?
text: Ed shrugs. Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...How come the judge doesn't come
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: The judge comes in last. He'll come
dialog: in when Doris gets here.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So where's Doris? I thought we started
dialog: at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's
dialog: Doris?
dialog: Riedenschneider is curt:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
text: She's late.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Late? How can she be late?
text: Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us*
dialog: are in prison, and yet we're not
dialog: late. We're on time, Ed. How can
dialog: Doris be late? What, they don't have
dialog: wake-up calls?
text: The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's
text: bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters.
text: The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down
text: and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his
text: desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider
dialog: and the prosecutor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Counselors.
text: Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his
text: counterpart from the other table. The judge, still leaning
text: forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible
dialog: from the gallery.
text: The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones.
text: Frank leans in toward Ed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's going on, Ed? I thought there
dialog: would be arguments. The bailiff, and
dialog: so forth...
text: Ed, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who suddenly
text: stiffens. As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider
text: looks back over his shoulder at Ed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Ed, what is this? Is this
dialog: procedure?
text: The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their
text: respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man
text: standing to one side.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: Bailiff.
text: As the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks
text: down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: I don't understand... We had a real
dialog: shot at it... We could have won this
dialog: thing...
dialog: The Bailiff Announces:
speaker_heading: BAILIFF
dialog: In the matter of the State of
dialog: California versus Doris Crane, Case
dialog: Number 87249 assigned to this Superior
dialog: Court...
text: As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...It doesn't make any sense...
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: Late afternoon sun slants in.
text: The shop, not open for business, is very still. Ed, in his
text: courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line
text: the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees.
text: Frank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber
text: chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: She'd hanged herself. I'd brought
dialog: her a dress to wear to court and
dialog: she'd used the belt. I didn't
dialog: understand it either. At first I
dialog: thought maybe it had something to do
dialog: with me, that she'd figured out
dialog: somehow how I fit into it and couldn't
dialog: stand it, couldn't stand knowing...
speaker_heading: BEDROOM
text: Night. Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...That wasn't it, I would find out
dialog: later. For now, everything just seemed
dialog: ruined...
speaker_heading: METROPOLE LOBBY
text: Riedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. Behind
text: him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back
text: to Sacramento still shaking his head,
dialog: saying it was the biggest
dialog: disappointment of his professional
dialog: career...
speaker_heading: FRANK'S HOUSE
text: Day. Frank's kitchen.
text: Frank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown
text: over his pyjamas, unshaven.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect
dialog: he was drinking; anyway, he stopped
dialog: coming to work...
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: Ed, in his smock, works on a customer.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...That left me to keep the place
dialog: going, or the bank would've taken
dialog: it.
text: As he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between
text: his lips. He squints against the smoke drifting past his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...*I* was the principal barber now.
dialog: I hired a new man for the second
dialog: chair...
text: Ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a
text: gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I'd hired the guy who did the
dialog: least gabbing when he came in for an
dialog: interview. But I guess the new man
dialog: had only kept quiet because he was
dialog: nervous; once he had the job, he
dialog: talked from the minute I opened the
dialog: shop in the morning...
scene_heading: EXT. BARBERSHOP
text: It is evening. Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to him
text: on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticulating
text: to illustrate his store.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...until I locked up at night. For
dialog: all I know, he talked to himself on
text: the way home.
speaker_heading: STREET
text: Ed walks along the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...When *I* walked home, it seemed
dialog: like everyone avoided looking at
dialog: me...
text: Indeed, none of the passers-by establish eye contact; their
text: averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...as if I'd caught some disease.
dialog: This thing with Doris, nobody wanted
dialog: to talk about it; it was like I was
text: a ghost walking down the street...
speaker_heading: HOUSE
text: As Ed lets himself in.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...And when I got home now, the place
dialog: felt empty.
text: He sits on the couch and, after a beat, takes a cigarette
text: pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I sat in the house, but there was
dialog: nobody there. I was a ghost; I didn't
dialog: see anyone; no one saw me...
speaker_heading: BARBERSHOP
text: Ed is in his smock again, operating the clippers.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I was the barber.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
text: The drone of the clippers has continued over the black. A
text: voice fades up:
speaker_heading: VOICE 1
dialog: So two blocks later I look at the
dialog: change she gave me and, golly, I'm
text: two bits short.
speaker_heading: VOICE 2
text: Two bits short.
speaker_heading: VOICE 1
dialog: So I walk back over to Linton's,
dialog: find this gal--big argument; she
dialog: doesn't even recall the transaction.
speaker_heading: VOICE 2
dialog: No recollection.
speaker_heading: VOICE 1
dialog: Doesn't recall the transaction, no
dialog: recollection, so I said, Look, dear...
speaker_heading: FADE IN
text: We are looking at a magazine story. Its headline, over an
text: illustration of a cresting wave, is: WAVE OF THE FUTURE.

scene_heading: NEXT TO GODLINESS - Dry Cleaning Sweeps The Nation - The

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Crane?
text: Ed looks up.
text: A man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question

speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I'm Crane.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: My name is Diedrickson. County medical

speaker_heading: ED

speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON

speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...Why don't I buy you a drink?
text: Ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock,
text: addresses the new man, who still gapes.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?
speaker_heading: DWIGHT
dialog: Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BAR
text: It is late afternoon, dusty and empty.

text: his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position.
text: As the bartender approaches:
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: Rye.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Just coffee.
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: You sure you don't want something
dialog: stiffer?
text: Ed shrugs and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Coffee it is.
text: He leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop
text: and stares at them. After a beat:
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
text: ...County M. E. does an autopsy on
dialog: anyone who dies in custody. I don't
dialog: know if you knew that. It's routine.
text: Ed doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring at
text: his hands, plows on:
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...Doesn't become a matter of public
dialog: record unless there's foul play.
dialog: However. I don't believe I'm
dialog: *prohibited* from telling you this.
dialog: I guess I'm not obliged to tell you,
dialog: either. I don't exactly know. But
dialog: if *I* were the man, I'd want to be
dialog: told.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Told what?
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: I, uh... thanks.
text: The bartender has set down the drinks.
text: Diedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from his
dialog: glass. Finally:
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...I'm sorry to add to your burden,
dialog: Crane, but I'd want to know it it
dialog: was me. Your wife was pregnant. First
dialog: trimester.
text: A pause.
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...Well, there it is.
dialog: Another pause.
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...I'm sorry.
text: He mutters to himself:
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...Hell, I hope I've done the right
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: My wife and I had not... performed
dialog: the sex act in many years.
text: Diedrickson stiffens.
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: (murmuring)
dialog: ...Jesus.
dialog: (aloud)
dialog: ...Well, that's not really my
dialog: business.
text: He is hastily digging for money.
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...I'm sorry. Well, there it is.
text: He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he
dialog: leaves:
speaker_heading: DIEDRICKSON
dialog: ...Good luck, Crane.
text: His retreating footsteps echo down the bar.
scene_heading: APARTMENT HALLWAY
text: It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. Ed stands in the
text: middle background, knocking on a door.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: Doris and I had never really talked
dialog: much. I don't think that's a bad
dialog: thing, necessarily. But it was funny:
dialog: now I wanted to talk--now, with
dialog: everyone gone. I was alone, with
dialog: secrets I didn't want and no one to
dialog: tell them to anyway.
text: The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.
speaker_heading: APARTMENT
text: We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. It
text: is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests
dialog: too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas
text: are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the
text: one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its
text: feeble light.
text: Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across
text: from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of
text: the murmuring. Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration
text: as she mumbles.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: I visited a woman who was supposed
dialog: to have powers in communicating with
dialog: those who had passed across, as she
dialog: called it. She said that people who
dialog: passed across were picky about who
dialog: they'd communicate with, not like
dialog: most people you run into on this
dialog: side...
text: The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Giff me your hant.
text: Ed places his hand in the center of the table.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...so you needed a guide who they
dialog: didn't mind talking to, someone with
dialog: a gift for talking to souls...
text: Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it
text: rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Well, first she told me that my
dialog: wife was in a peaceful place, that
dialog: our souls were still connected by
dialog: some spiritual bond, that she had
dialog: never stopped loving me even though
dialog: she'd done some things she wasn't
dialog: proud of...
text: Ed looks up at the old woman.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...She was reading me like a book.
text: She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...And then she started talking about
dialog: 'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that
dialog: and was there anything I wanted to
dialog: tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just
dialog: be telling it to the old bat. And
dialog: even if somehow Doris could hear, it
dialog: wouldn't be on account of this so-
dialog: called medium.
scene_heading: APARTMENT HALLWAY
text: Ed is leaving.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: She was a phony. Just another gabber.
scene_heading: EXT. TENEMENT
text: Ed emerges from the building.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger,
dialog: Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my
text: back on the old lady, on the veils,
text: on the ghosts, on the dead, before
dialog: they all sucked me in...
text: Ed disappears into the night.
speaker_heading: ABUNDAS HOUSE
text: It is night. We are looking through the screen door. Walter
text: Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the
text: side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. He is
text: murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers,
text: glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand.
text: Ed's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets
text: the phone down and comes to the door.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Ed, how're you holding up?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
text: Walter opens the door to him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I'm so damn sorry about your loss.
dialog: Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long
dialog: distance here.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sure, Walter. Thanks.
speaker_heading: PARLOR
text: Birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her:
text: homework. She looks up at Ed's entrance.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Hello, Mr Crane.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello, Birdy.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: We haven't seen you since... I'm
dialog: terribly sorry.
text: Ed sits across from her.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: We've certainly missed you.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Birdy, I've been doing a lot of
dialog: thinking. There are a lot of things
dialog: that haven't worked out for me. Life
dialog: has dealt me some bum cards...
text: He is loading a cigarette into his mouth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...or maybe I just haven't played
dialog: 'em right, I don't know. But you're--
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Pop doesn't like people smoking in
dialog: here.
text: Ed stares. This takes a moment to register.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Oh. Sorry.
text: Birdy lowers her voice:
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Sometimes I have a cigarette in here
dialog: when he's away. Never when he's in
text: the house. He can smell it a mile
dialog: off.
text: Ed is pocketing the cigarette.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Sure... Sure, it's his house.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: That's what he keeps telling me.
text: Ed smiles thinly.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Anyway, uh... my point is you're
dialog: young. A kid really, your whole life
dialog: ahead of you. But it's not too soon
dialog: to start thinking... to start making
dialog: opportunities for yourself. Before
text: it all washes away.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so
dialog: too. I work pretty hard at school.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: That's swell. However, the music, if
dialog: you want to pursue it, well, the
dialog: lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only
dialog: take you so far. There's this guy in
dialog: San Francisco, I've made inquiries,
dialog: everybody says he's the best. Trained
dialog: lots of people who've gone on to
dialog: have big concert careers, symphony
dialog: orchestras, the works. His name is
dialog: Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure
dialog: I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway,
dialog: he's a Frenchman.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Boy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: You've got talent, anyone could see
dialog: that. And he's the best. If he thinks
dialog: a student has talent, he'll take 'em
dialog: on for next to nothing. You're a
dialog: cinch to be accepted, I could cover
dialog: the cost of the lessons, like I said,
dialog: it's pretty modest--
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Oh, Mr Crane--
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I have to do it. I can't stand by
dialog: and watch more things go down the
dialog: drain. You're young, you don't
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't
dialog: really thought about a career or
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I know you haven't. Look, just go
dialog: meet him as a favor to me. I talked
dialog: to this guy. Hope I pronounced his
dialog: name right. He sounded very busy,
dialog: but he's not a bad egg; he loosened
dialog: up a little when I told him how
dialog: talented you are. He agreed to see
dialog: you this Saturday. He said maybe you
dialog: were a diamond in the rough. His
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Geez, Mr Crane.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Just see him, as a favor to me.
scene_heading: STUDIO WAITING ROOM
text: It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set
text: against the walls. At the far end of the room a door leads
text: to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a
text: fast and difficult piece of music.
text: Ed sits waiting. He is the only adult; two or three youngsters
text: of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons.
text: Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow
text: tie. He is perhaps eleven. His hair is greased back in a
dialog: Junior Contour.
text: Another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch.
text: The piano piece is ending. There is the murmur of voices.
text: Dull footsteps.
text: The studio door swings open.
text: A small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette
text: ash is bowing Birdy out the door. He has a goatee and a
text: knotted foulard. His eyes flit over the waiting room and
dialog: settle on Ed.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: ...You are ze fahzer?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: No. Uh... family friend.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I am Carcanogues.
text: He smiles at Birdy.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...You wait, my dear?
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Sure, Mr K.
text: A jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise.
speaker_heading: STUDIO
text: Ed enters, uncomfortable. He looks around, taking in the
text: high-ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano.
text: Carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: I speak to you on ze phone, non? You
dialog: have a special interest in music?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: Ah yes, a music lover.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: Ah.
text: He uncaps a small bottle of pills, shakes two into his palm,
text: tosses them back and washes them down.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: ...Ah-hah.
text: He twists a cigarette into a long holder, sticks it in his
text: mouth and lights it.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: ...Mm.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well? How'd she do?
text: This elicits a Gallic frown of consideration.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: Ze girl?... She seems like a very
dialog: nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur,
dialog: like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very
dialog: nice girl. However, ztinks.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: Is not so hard to understand. Her
dialog: playing, very polite.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Did she make mistakes?
dialog: Another gallic moue:
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she
text: plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the
dialog: right note, always. Very proper.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I don't understand, no mistakes,
dialog: she's just a kid--I thought you taught
dialog: the, uh, the--
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: Ah, but that is just what I cannot
dialog: teach. I cannot teach her to have a
dialog: soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano,
dialog: is not about the fingers. *Done*
dialog: with the fingers, yes. But the music,
text: she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
text: A two-handed gesture, indicating his heart.
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: ...The music start here...
text: He waggles his fingers:
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: ...come out through here; then,
dialog: maybe...
text: His wave takes in the heavens:
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: ...she can go up there.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Well, look, I don't claim to be an
dialog: expert--
speaker_heading: CARCANOGUES
dialog: Then you listen to me, for I am
dialog: expert. That girl, she give me a
dialog: headache. She cannot play. Nice girl.
dialog: Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday,
dialog: I think, maybe, she make a very good
dialog: typist.
speaker_heading: DRIVING
dialog: We are driving through the rural countryside of northern
text: California. It is a two-lane road with little traffic. Sun
text: strobes the car through the passing trees.
text: Ed drives, glaring. Birdy, next to him, seems unperturbed,
dialog: ever cheerful.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: ...I stank, didn't I?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: He didn't say that.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: But more or less.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Look, I'm no expert, but--
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: I'm sure there's a dozen teachers
dialog: better than this clown. More
dialog: qualified. Goddamn phony.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm
dialog: not interested in playing music
dialog: professionally.
text: Ed looks at her.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: ...I'm not certain I'll have a career
dialog: at all, and if I do, I'll probably
dialog: be a veterinarian.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: I do appreciate the interest you've
dialog: taken, though.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Ah... it's nothing.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: I'm only sorry that I didn't play
dialog: better for you. I know it would've
dialog: made you happy. You know what you
dialog: are?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: You're an enthusiast.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Huh. Yeah. Maybe...
text: He loads a cigarette into his mouth.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...I guess I've been all wet.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
text: She reaches over to touch his thigh.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: ...I wanted to make you happy.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Birdy--
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: It's OK...
text: She is leaning over his lap.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: ...I want to do it, Mr Crane.
dialog: Ed is shocked:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Birdy!
text: He reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting
dialog: to be violent.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...No, please.
speaker_heading: BIRDY
dialog: Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
text: The blare of an oncoming horn.
text: Ed looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on
dialog: the wheel.
text: The oncoming car.
text: Ed swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams.
text: CRASH: the car hits a roadside tree.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
text: Time slows down right before an
dialog: accident, and I had time to think
dialog: about things. I thought about what
dialog: an undertaker had told me once--that
dialog: your hair keeps growing, for a while
dialog: anyway, after you die...
text: A hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then
text: off the road, down an embankment.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and then it stops. I thought,
dialog: what keeps it growing? Is it like a
dialog: plant in soil? What goes out of the
dialog: soil? The soul? And when does the
dialog: hair realize that it's gone?
text: We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head
text: resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. We boom
text: down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. As we move
text: we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry.
text: The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright
text: revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it
text: disappears, leaving only black.
speaker_heading: FADE IN
text: Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a
text: cigarette in the late afternoon light.
text: A dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children
text: are playing somewhere up the street.
text: Ed looks down at his watch. It is 5:30.
text: Something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway
text: stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat. He is a small
text: figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway.
text: After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the
text: house, and jots something down.
text: He finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and
text: is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is
text: being watched. His manner instantly warms.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Hello.
text: The man starts up the walk.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I notice you still have peastone in
dialog: your driveway.
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, of course, you don't have to
dialog: rejuvenate that once every couple of
dialog: years, don't you, when the peastone
text: thins out.
text: Ed shrugs.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...Where does it go, huh? Like the
dialog: odd sock. But you *know* where it
dialog: goes--you probably pick pieces of it
dialog: off your lawn all the time, churn it
dialog: up with your lawn mower, sweep it
dialog: off the walk here--pain in the neck.
text: Ed shrugs again.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Doesn't bother me.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, have you ever considered tar
dialog: Macadam? People think it's just for
dialog: public works and commercial purposes,
dialog: roads, parking lots, so forth...
text: A car pulls into the drive.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...but we have the technology now to
dialog: bring it to the homeowner, the
dialog: individual consumer, at a very
dialog: reasonable price.
text: Doris emerges from the car.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...Mind if I show you the
dialog: specifications?--Evening, ma'am.
text: Doris gives him a hard look.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: What're *you* selling?
text: The man gives a practiced laugh.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Well, ma'am, I was just telling your
dialog: husband here about tar Macadam, for
dialog: your home driveway here--these are
dialog: the specs...
text: Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: ...It's the modern way to--
text: Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back.
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Get lost.
text: The man gazes at her. His smile fades fast and he and Doris
text: stare at each other, two hard cases.
text: He turns stiffly and stalks off.
text: Once his gaze has broken, Doris turns as well. She stalks up
text: the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front
text: door of the house, letting it slam behind her.
text: Quiet, early evening.
text: Ed sits, smoking.
text: At length he rises and goes in to the house.
scene_heading: INT. BUNGALOW
text: It is dim, no lights on yet. We hear banging and clomping
text: from the kitchen.
text: Doris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes around
text: a drink with a swizzle stick. Her face is still hard-set.
text: With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the
dialog: couch.
text: Ed sits as well. He draws on his cigarette, drags an ashtray
text: closer on the coffee table.
text: She sips. He puffs.
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: ...Doris--
speaker_heading: DORIS
dialog: Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
text: The sit. The light is failing. The clink of ice cubes.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
text: In the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin. As
text: the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting, faint,
dialog: distant:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Are you there? Are you awake?
text: A blurry white disc is fading up. As it focuses it resolves
text: into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning in
dialog: close.
text: He leans away, murmuring:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: He's coming around. Can you talk,
dialog: sir? These men have to talk.
text: Ed is lying in a hospital bed. His face is bandaged and one
text: side is grotesquely swollen. The machine noise is life
dialog: support.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: ...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.
text: Two police officers, Persky and Krebs, lean in.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: Are you awake?... Is he awake?
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: Crane? We have to tell you, as soon
dialog: as you're conscious--is he conscious?
speaker_heading: PERSKY
text: His eyes are open.
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: Uh... you're under arrest.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: As soon as the doctor lets us, we
dialog: gotta move you. Does he understand
dialog: that? We're supposed to tell him.
dialog: Are you conscious?
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: You'll go to the prison hospital.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
text: Under arrest for murder.
text: Ed's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia:
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Birdy... I didn't mean to--
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: What'd he say?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Birdy...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK.
text: Broken clavicle.
text: The doctor leans in.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: ...That's the collarbone, Crane.
dialog: Broken. She's OK though.
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: So he understands? He's under arrest
dialog: for murder?
speaker_heading: ED
dialog: Big Dave.
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: What'd he say? Does he understand?
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: He said OK. Is that what he said?
text: Krebs raises his voice:
speaker_heading: KREBS
dialog: You're under arrest for the murder
dialog: of Creighton Tolliver! Do you
dialog: understand?
text: The voices are fading away:
speaker_heading: PERSKY
dialog: ...Does he understand?...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Light glimmers in water. We are drifting down, down, down.
text: We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child, waving
text: to keep himself submerged. It is a ten-year-old boy staring,
text: wide-eyed, at something in front of him. Bubbles
text: intermittently stream from his open mouth.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
text: The pansy. A kid diving at a waterhole
dialog: outside of town had found his car...
text: The reverse shows the car, also submerged, with Creighton
text: Tolliver inside, also wide-eyed, his hairpiece attached at
text: only one corner, the rest of it waving free.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...They'd winched it out...
speaker_heading: TRACKING
text: We are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated
text: men. The men rise.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and found he'd been beaten, just
dialog: like Big Dave said--beaten to death...
text: We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small
text: door behind his raised bench.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Inside the briefcase were the
dialog: partnership papers I'd signed...
text: The judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on
text: the jury, now reseating itself.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...showing that I'd given him ten
dialog: grand. For the district attorney...
text: In response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney
text: rises to read the charge. His voice plays distantly, muted,
text: the words not discernible under the continuing voice-over.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...that made it fall into place: I'd
dialog: gotten Doris to steal the money, the
dialog: pansy had gotten wise somehow, and
dialog: I'd had to kill him to cover my
dialog: tracks. I was in a spot. I called in
dialog: Freddy Riedenschneider...
text: Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table. As he
dialog: listens to the charge:
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...and signed the house over to him.
dialog: He said he didn't ordinarily work
dialog: that cheap, but he figured he owed
dialog: me something since the last one hadn't
dialog: played out...
text: The drone of the D.A. has ended and Riedenschneider's echoing
text: voice drops into the hole:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Not guilty, your honor...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: I tried to tell him the whole story,
dialog: but Riedenschneider stopped me. He
dialog: said the story made his head hurt,
dialog: and anyway he didn't see any way of
dialog: using it without putting me on the
dialog: hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...
text: Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he
text: sits next to him. Ed still wears a cast on one arm and one
dialog: leg.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...He told me not to worry, though,
dialog: said he'd think of something, Freddy
dialog: Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.
speaker_heading: JAIL
text: We are tracking in on Ed, lying on the bunk in his cell.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...They put me on twenty-four-hour
dialog: deathwatch...
text: A reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightbacked
text: chair, outside the cell door, staring at Ed.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...so that I couldn't Cheat Justice
dialog: like they said my wife had done...
speaker_heading: COURTROOM
text: The district attorney is rising again, this time to address
dialog: the jury.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...But in front of the jury they had
dialog: it that Doris was a saint; the whole
dialog: plan had been mine, I was a Svengali
dialog: who'd forced Doris to join my criminal
dialog: enterprise...
text: The district attorney is pointing at Ed.
scene_heading: DISTRICT ATTORNEY
dialog: ...cynically used his own wife as a
text: cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical
dialog: cunning...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: On and on it went, how I'd used Doris
dialog: and then let her take the fall. That
dialog: stuff smarted because some of it was
dialog: close to being true...
text: The district attorney seats himself. The jury's eyes turn to
text: Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of
text: him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or seeking
dialog: inspiration for his own.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...And then it was Freddy
text: Riedenschneider's turn.
text: Riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed
text: a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked
dialog: about how I'd lost my place in the
dialog: universe...
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...a puny player on the great world's
dialog: stage...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...how I was too ordinary to be the
dialog: criminal mastermind the D.A. made me
dialog: out to be, how there was some greater
dialog: scheme at work that the state had
text: yet to unravel, and he threw in some
dialog: of the old truth stuff he hadn't had
dialog: a chance to trot out for Doris...
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...who among us is in a position to
dialog: say...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...He told them to look at me--look
dialog: at me close. That the closer they
dialog: looked the less sense it would all
dialog: make, that I wasn't the kind of guy
dialog: to kill a guy, that I was the barber,
dialog: for Christ's sake...
text: We pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I was just like them, an ordinary
dialog: man, guilty of living in a world
dialog: that had no place for me, guilty of
dialog: wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure,
dialog: but not of murder...
text: Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground
text: to point a finger directly at Ed's face.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...He said I *was* Modern Man, and
dialog: if they voted to convict me, well,
dialog: they'd be practically cinching the
text: noose around their own necks. He
dialog: told them to look not at the facts
dialog: but at the meaning of the facts, and
dialog: then he said the facts *had* no
dialog: meaning. It was a pretty good speech,
dialog: and even had me going...
text: A tap on the shoulder turns Ed around.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...until Frankie interrupted it.
text: Frank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor.
text: A bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over
text: Ed, bellowing through tears:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What kind of man *are* you? What
dialog: kind of man *are* you?
text: Riedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and Ed's,
dialog: loudly protesting:
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: Move for a mistrial, your honor!
dialog: Move for a mistrial! This outrageous
dialog: display cannot help but prejudice...
text: Ed moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong
text: glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: RIEDENSCHNEIDER
dialog: ...and inflame the passions of these
dialog: twelve fine men and women...
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Well, he got his mistrial, but
dialog: the well had run dry. There was
dialog: nothing left to mortgage;
dialog: Riedenschneider went home and the
dialog: court appointed Lloyd Garroway...
text: Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman
text: who enters the plea in the new trial:
speaker_heading: GARROWAY
dialog: Your honor, we plead guilty, with
dialog: extenuating circumstances.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...who threw me on the mercy of the
dialog: court. It was my only chance, he
dialog: said. I guess that meant I never had
dialog: a chance...
text: The judge starts droning the sentence:
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: ...a menace to society... a predator
dialog: on his own wife, his business
text: associates, on an innocent young
dialog: girl... social contract... line
dialog: crossed... the offender forfeits the
dialog: right to his own life... I hereby
dialog: order that you be taken to a place
dialog: of confinement...
speaker_heading: PRISON HALLWAY
text: We are tracking down the hall.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: He wasn't buying any of that Modern
dialog: Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff,
dialog: or any of the mercy stuff either.
dialog: No, he was going by the book, and
dialog: the book said I got the chair...
text: Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk,
text: hands clasped behind his head.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...so here I am. At first I didn't
dialog: know how I got here. I knew step by
dialog: step of course, which is what I've
dialog: told you, step by step; but I couldn't
dialog: see any pattern...
speaker_heading: LATER
text: Ed sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Now that I'm near the end, I'm
dialog: glad that this men's magazine paid
dialog: me to tell my story. Writing it has
dialog: helped me sort it all out. They're
dialog: paying five cents a word, so you'll
dialog: pardon me if sometimes I've told you
dialog: more than you wanted to know...
dialog: Recent issues of the magazine, Gent, and its sister
text: publication Nugget lie on the little desk. Their lurid covers
text: depict feature stories like I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS and
text: AFTER TEN YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE, I DISCOVER I AM AN ESCAPED
speaker_heading: LUNATIC.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...But now, all the disconnected
text: things seems to hook up.
text: Ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...That's the funny thing about going
dialog: away, knowing the date you're gonna
dialog: die--and the men's magazine wanted
dialog: me to tell how that felt...
text: We hear a pulsing treble hum. Ed opens his eyes.
text: The door to his cell is open.
text: He rises and goes through the door.
speaker_heading: PRISON HALLWAY
text: Ed, alone, walks down the hallway. The pulsing treble hum is
dialog: louder.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Well, it's like pulling away from
dialog: the maze. While you're in the maze
dialog: you go through willy-nilly, turning
dialog: where you think you have to turn,
dialog: banging into dead ends, one thing
dialog: after another...
speaker_heading: PRISON YARD
text: Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone
text: walls. A hard spotlight shines down from above. Ed squints
dialog: into it.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...But get some distance on it, and
dialog: all those twists and turns, why,
dialog: they're the shape of your life. It's
dialog: hard to explain...
text: The spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer. We see its
text: revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of
text: its top bubble.
text: After spinning briefly, it tips and flies away, carrying the
text: tremolo hum with it.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...But seeing it whole gives you
dialog: some peace.
text: Ed turns and re-enters the prison.
speaker_heading: ED'S CELL
text: Ed is lying on his bunk, eyes closed, hands clasped behind
text: his head. A hand enters to shake him awake.
text: Three men loom over him: two guards and another man wearing
text: a surplice and holding a bible.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...The men's magazine also asked
dialog: about remorse. Yeah, I guess I'm
dialog: sorry about the pain I caused other
dialog: people...
speaker_heading: PRISON HALLWAY
text: He is walking the last mile.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...but I don't regret anything. Not
dialog: a thing. I used to. I used to regret
dialog: being the barber.
text: A door at the end opens:
text: An electric chair. Straps open, and waiting:
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I dont know where I'm being taken.
text: Ed is placed in the chair.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...I don't know what waits for me,
dialog: beyond the earth and sky. But I'm
dialog: not afraid to go.
text: A man stoops at his feet. He has a bucket of water and a
dialog: straight razor.
text: He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch
dialog: of Ed's calf.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Maybe the things I don't understand
dialog: will be clearer there, like when a
text: fog blows away...
text: Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the
text: bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating
dialog: hairs.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...Maybe Doris will be there.
text: They are strapping him in, connecting the electrodes.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...And maybe there I can tell her...
text: The men withdraw.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...all those things...
text: A thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch.
text: As he reaches for the switch, Ed looks up into the light.
speaker_heading: ED (V.O.)
dialog: ...they don't have words for here.
dialog:
