dialog: It’s already a good day.
text: And as Rob SWINGS THE CAMERA AROUND we get a better look at
text: our surroundings -- we're in a MANHATTAN APARTMENT -- floor-

text: decor suggests a feminine touch.
text: CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the living room. We hear Rob’s BARE
text: FEET quietly padding along the hardwood floors --
text: He approaches a SIDE TABLE covered with FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS --
text: they’re all of A GIRL (Beth) and her various friends and

text: This is BETH MCINTYRE.
text: As the morning-light finds her face, we can see she‘s half-
