text: We see an aerial shot of Boston. The sound of WAAB-FM burbles
dialog: over the top. We hear about local events, rock concerts,
text: films. We see a red 75’ Chevy Van stuck in traffic.
dialog: Title: May 13 1978. Boston.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET. ABANDONED FACTORY. DAY
text: A blue 72 Plymouth Fury is parked up by a battered looking
text: warehouse. There are three people inside. A woman and a man
text: in the front, a man in the back.
scene_heading: INT. PLYMOUTH DAY.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where is he?
text: Justine speaks; flat American with a tinge of something
dialog: European.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: It’s okay Frank. We have ten
dialog: minutes yet.
text: Frank shakes his head and looks at his watch. Chris shrugs.
text: He speaks with a Dublin accent.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: These things happen, probably
dialog: traffic.
text: Frank sniffs. This is on him. He brought the late guy into
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fuck it. I hate this shit.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Stop fretting... it’s fine.
text: Justine smiles listening to the conversation.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: How long have you two been married?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Long time... The sex has stopped.
dialog: We just argue now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You flatter yourself. I wouldn’t go
dialog: gay for you...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who then?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No one... I don’t want to talk
dialog: about that kind of thing.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You started it...
text: Chris enjoys needling Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK CHRIS
dialog: I knew his Father Here it comes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I promised i'd keep him out of
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Well you pretty much fucked that
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ah well, life can get in the way of
dialog: promises sometimes.
text: Justine smiles. She knows.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Justine?
text: Justine is looking out the window, lost in her own thoughts.
text: After a beat she turns.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where are you from darling?
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: Originally?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yes, I can hear something in that
dialog: accent.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It’s Swedish.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Swedish? I was going to say German.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: She’s not a German. You have cloth
dialog: ears Frank
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: German. Looks she’s smiling.
text: Justine smiles to herself.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Laughing... at you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: When I say German... She smiles.
dialog: It’s the memory of the old
dialog: country... the Motherland...
dialog: Germany, Germany, Germany...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I spent six weeks in Stockholm in
dialog: 72 remember.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That thing... Fuck. How could I
dialog: forget that.
text: Frank shakes his head remembering.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: I'm Swedish
text: Chris smiles.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You see.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t overplay your hand.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'd like to go back to Stockholm.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well that can happen soon enough.
dialog: We just have to sort this bit of
dialog: business out.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Then back we go
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Back to Ireland?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah.
text: Frank looks out of the window and pulls a filter-less Camel
text: from its pack.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you like this place?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Boston?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: America.
text: There’s a pause. It’s as if she’s never considered it.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Sure.
text: She isn’t giving anything away from behind her sunglasses.
text: Frank smiles and lights up. He wants to go home. He watches a
text: stray dog nosing around in some rubbish.
scene_heading: INT. RED CHEVY DAY
text: Inside, Stevo, 28. Long hair, wide ‘Apocalypse Now’
text: moustache. T-shirt jacket and jeans. He has a black eye. He
text: talks in a Boston accent. Bernie is his heavy lidded side
dialog: kick.
text: Bernie is driving, Stevo is holding his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: My fucking head.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: I told you not to mix your
dialog: drinks...
speaker_heading: STEVO
text: I feel like my brain is trying to
text: crawl out of my eyes.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Every time... I tell you
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Have you got any headache pills?
text: Pause. Bernie looks sideways at Stevo.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: No. I’ve got some smack though.
text: Bernie shrugs apologetically. A sledgehammer to crack a nut.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I didn’t think you were doing that
dialog: shit anymore.
text: Stevo is mock worried.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Just at the weekends. It’s for
dialog: unwinding. I’ve got a very
dialog: stressful life.
text: Stevo sits there for five seconds. His head pounding like a
text: bass drum.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Okay maybe a little.
text: Bernie smirks and hands Stevo a small wrap of heroin.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: When will we finish today?
text: Stevo carefully opens the wrap.
speaker_heading: BERNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Careful.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Hour and a half tops. They do the
dialog: deal and we help load up the
text: crates.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: And there’s guns in the crates?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Yes guns... You don’t get paid $100
dialog: for moving cans of beans.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: I can’t get in any trouble Stevo...
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: You should have thought about that
dialog: before you punched that guy in
dialog: Harlequins last night.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: I was provoked.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Look in my eyes.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: I hate it when you do that... It
dialog: means you are bullshitting me.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Look in my eyes...
text: Bernie pushes Stevo away.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: I am driving...
text: Stevo decants a little of the Heroin into a burnt bit of tin
dialog: foil.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I love you man. I would never let
dialog: anything happen to you.
text: Stevo lights up his zippo under the tin foil.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: HA HA Now you have totally fucking
dialog: cursed me.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Dont worry man.. SNIFFFF... What
dialog: can go wrong?
text: He passes back the wrap.
text: Bernie smiles and Stevo drifts on a warm cloud of morphia.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET.
text: The van pulls up behind the Plymouth. Stevo gets out. Frank
text: has already got out to meet him. He walks over to the man and
text: drags him back to the van. We cut in close now and see:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where have the fuck have you been?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I’m sorry Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If you say traffic I’m going to
dialog: punch you in the throat.
text: Stevo looks at Frank.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: There was a density of cars that
dialog: slowed my egress.
text: Frank pauses.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you on drugs?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: No.
text: Frank starts again...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t lie to me you little fuck.
dialog: Are you high?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: No sir.
scene_heading: INT. CAR DAY.
text: Chris sees that Justine is watching Frank talking to the
dialog: boys.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: He’s just a bit on edge.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: ..-and he’s meant to be looking
dialog: after you?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sure... Do you think that’s the
dialog: dynamic? I’m meant to be making
dialog: sure he doesn’t get into trouble.
dialog: I'm a calming influence.
text: We hear a bump as Frank slams Stevo up against the van.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN
text: Frank knocks on the van window. It winds down. Bernie peeks
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey Bernard
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Hey Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is he on drugs?
text: Bernie thinks for a moment. His face a mask of control.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Hey. I am no rat. But he has taken
text: some medication for a migrane.
text: Frank turns to Stevo and steps up close. He looks him in the
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know you don’t really understand
dialog: how serious I am. What..
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I do Frank...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: .--I am talking...
dialog: What my capacity to hold a grudge
dialog: is...because nothing bad has
dialog: happened to you has it?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: No.
text: Stevo is agreeing to agree here. Though he does it poorly and
text: Frank reads him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Your Grandmother dieing of cancer
text: aged 95 does not count.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: You don’t know anything about me.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is that supposed to reassure me?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You are made of glass to me Steven.
text: Frank grabs Stevo by the balls. His fist crushing them
text: through the denim.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Does that focus your mind?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Fuuuuck.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m holding your brain in my hand
dialog: now ain’t I?
dialog: You ever going to be late for me
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: No.
text: Frank looks round and sees Bernie watching him
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Bernard. If you want some, just
dialog: say. I’1l open you up like a tin of
dialog: beans.
text: Bernie mulls this for a nano-second.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: You are good Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I promised my sister that I'd bring
dialog: you home in one piece. You are not
dialog: going to make a cunt of me are you?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: No..
text: Frank lets go of Stevo’s balls and he staggers back. Franks’
text: manner has changed. He is matter of fact.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why have you got a black eye?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Walked into a door?
text: Frank doesn't move. Stevo becomes uncomfortable
speaker_heading: STEVO (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing? Stop that.
text: Frank stares into his soul.
scene_heading: INT. PLYMOUTH DAY.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You ever wonder where the guns go?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: No
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You are not curious?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: What are you doing? Trying to rub
dialog: my nose in it?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I just wonder what you are doing
dialog: here
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Because of what? Because I’m a
dialog: woman?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: A good looking woman
dialog: Justine smiles
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Oh I see... okay
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What you laughing about?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Does it ever work?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: This. The humiliation routine.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I don’t follow.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: You're going to tell me all about
dialog: the horrors of your life, while
text: trying to get into my underwear.
dialog: That kind of thing.
dialog: Chris thinks
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah - I usually lead with the
text: horrors, then the looking haunted
text: then a bit of eye contact..
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: And this works?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sure
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Show me your haunted.
dialog: Chris does haunted
speaker_heading: JUSTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s more retarded.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What are you doing later?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Picking up my kid. Cooking dinner.
text: Not hanging out with terrorists.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’m not a terrorist.
text: Chris looks sad.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Sorry.. Stop ! That’s part of it...
text: Chris drops the sad look and smiles. Justine lights a
dialog: cigarette.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You dangerous are you? Mysterious
dialog: international gun dealing lady.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Yup.
text: Justine puffs on her cigarette. Frank gets into the car
text: followed by Stevo.
text: Chris looks at Stevo’s black eye. Frank looks at Stevo’s eye
text: in the mirror. He purses his lips. Chris points at the black
text: eye using the minimum of effort.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Did you win?
speaker_heading: STEVO
text: I walked into a door.
text: Chris smiles tightly... Stevo is a clown.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where did you get him from Frank?
text: Stevo reacts hurt. He shrugs..
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Talk to me if you’re talking about
dialog: me...
text: Chris and Frank ignore Stevo.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My sisters husband. She’s got a
dialog: bar.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You found him in a bar?
text: Chris smiles. Stevo frowns.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Frankie...
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t call me Frankie. I hate that.
dialog: -pauses—
dialog: Or Francis.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Frank...
speaker_heading: CHRIS (IN GAELIC)
dialog: This guy is an idiot.
speaker_heading: FRANK (IN GAELIC)
dialog: It was short notice.
text: Stevo rolls his eyes at the foreign language. He tries to
dialog: talk to Justine
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I’m Stevo. What’s your name?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t talk to her.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you know her?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you married to my sister?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: You are married?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Yeah
text: Justine makes a face ‘thats a suprise’
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where is the van from?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I bought it like you said. Bernie
dialog: got it.. It’s cool
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good. You did exactly what I said?
text: Stevo is embarrassed by the questioning in front of Justine.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Come on Frank. I’m not totally
dialog: stupid.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That’s up for debate.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You got any foundation with you
dialog: Justine love?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Sure
text: Justine pulls out a compact. Stevo works out what’s about to
dialog: be asked.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Oh Frank, fuckkk...
text: Frank hands it over.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You put it on boy...
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Jesus Frank.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Put it on or I'll give you one on
text: the other side to match.
text: Stevo sadly applies the powder to his eye. It helps a bit.
text: Frank looks at him. He softens.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Come here...
text: He grabs the powder and applies the makeup.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know what she sees in you
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I bet he is dynamite in the sack.
text: Justine looks round. She looks at Chris and shakes her head
dialog: ™o!
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: You can tell by looking?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: It’s my super power.
text: Chris watches Frank apply the make up to Stevo he shakes his
text: head. Stevo notices and pouts.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Keep your fucking head still.
text: Justine looks up and sees something.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Here he comes.
text: We see a guy shambling out of the shadows. He moves towards
text: the car. Good looking, longish hair as is the fashion. Suede
text: jacket. Blue jeans: His name is Ord.
text: Frank slaps Stevo’s cheeks.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There you go. You look great.
text: The man approaches he smiles broadly when he sees Justine. He
text: stops by the Plymouth.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Hey Justine.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Hey Ord.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: These your boyfriends?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Hey fellas...
text: Frank is tight lipped. We see Ord as Frank sees him. Clear
dialog: eyed (this is a tell for Frank of exercise and general
text: dangerousness). He looks military.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Afternoon. You’re late.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: I’m sorry. Traffic.
text: Frank looks Ord in the eye for a moment.
speaker_heading: ORD (CONT'D)
dialog: I love your accent.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Kerry?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Holywood.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Hollywood?
text: He smiles. Frank gets this reaction a lot. Holywood is
text: between Belfast and Bangor in Ireland. Hollywood is in
dialog: California.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The real fucking Holywood.
text: Ords’ smile remains as he looks to the backseat.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: And these guys?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You don’t need to know their names.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: I do Frank. It’s polite.
text: There’s a moment. Ords’ smile never leaves his lips. Chris
text: looks over for the first time. He takes his sun glasses off.
text: He reveals cold eyes.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Chris.
text: Ord turns to Stevo. He looks at the make up covered eye. He
dialog: registers something is a bit weird here.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Stevo - and that’s Bernie.
text: Bernie waves from the van.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Okay. My names James Ordan. You can
dialog: call me Ord. Okay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Please to meet you ‘Ord’. Can we
dialog: get on with this please?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Sure. Just a few guide-lines for
dialog: you all.. This is obviously a tense
dialog: situation. I am armed.
text: Ord opens his jacket with a flourish to reveal a holster and
text: pistol. He gestures to it dramatically.
speaker_heading: ORD (CONT'D)
dialog: I am sure that you are too.
text: Frank doesn't give anything away. Stevo grins embarrassed at
text: having his mind read. Maybe he is made of glass.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ORD (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to get home tonight. I've
dialog: got shit to do. I appreciate you
dialog: are very serious heavy freedom
dialog: fighting mother fuckers. Fuck the
dialog: Brits.. Free Ireland. I get that.
dialog: That’s cool. This is home of ‘Fuck
dialog: the Brits!’
text: Ord looks at Frank and Chris’s faces. They look on
text: impassively at his attempts at levity
dialog: Lets just take this calm.
dialog: Did you all jack off before coming
dialog: here?
text: The moment hangs there for a split second
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Did you jack off? In the hotel.
text: Ord makes the international gesture for masturbation.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the fuck does it have to...?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: I’m not working with any one who
text: brought a loaded weapon.
text: There is a moment of silence. Frank and Chris smirk.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I did.
text: Justine smiles.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Christ Steven.
text: There is a pause. Ord has doing his job well. The tension is
dialog: defused a little.
text: They get out of the car. Bernie joins them from the van.
text: They follow Ord towards the warehouse. Justine looks around.
dialog: The buildings are abandoned and nailed shut. If you wanted to
dialog: run, there would be no where to go.
text: Chris is carrying a brief case.
text: Ord looks at Stevo
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Why are you wearing makeup?
text: Before Stevo can say ‘I walked into a door’ Frank interrupts
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: He has a birth mark.
text: Ord doesn't buy this for a second.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: O-kay.
text: Chris glances around
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who owns this place?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: A friend of a friend. There’s a
dialog: security guy but he’s not here
dialog: today. Taking a ‘religious’
dialog: holiday.
text: This last bit is an obvious lie. Ord smirks at the idea of a
dialog: religious holiday.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What did they used to do here?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Make stuff.
dialog: Not any more though...
text: Titles roll over the walk.
text: Music: Boston plays ‘More than a feeling’
dialog: Title: Free Fire.
text: In yellow futura extra bold font.
text: Title: Adapted from the novel ‘IRON SIGHT’ by Jerome Karim
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR.
text: The group walk inside along dark concrete corridors. Frank
text: looks a little tense. He scans around expecting trouble.
text: Ord is not bothered. He knows the situation.
text: The rest of the titles play out here. Stars. Producers.
dialog: Financiers. Writer.
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE FACTORY
text: We see the group move through a broken down factory. Pigeons
text: flap about disturbed.
text: Title: Directed by Ben Wheatley
text: A big wide as the group move through a large empty space.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR.
text: They walk through a corridor. The door closes behind them and
text: clicks shut.
text: Ord looks back at it for a split second.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR.
text: They walk along another corridor and then enter out into
text: another large space.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: The warehouse has hefty concrete pillars dotted around it.
text: The ground is littered with broken bottles. Refuse sacks,
text: piles of rubbish, bits of abandoned cars, broken foundations
text: of offices and smashed machine tool plinths. The foundations
text: are stubby walls marking out where the offices would have
text: been in the factory. At their highest around two feet.
dialog: Sometimes lower than a foot.
text: Frank looks around scanning the space.
text: We see far back from the group. A POV of another person
text: behind a pillar watching them.
text: The group move towards the middle of the warehouse. There is
text: a small fold out table.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Ord turns gesturing to the table.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: We are here.
text: Frank looks out to the shadows. Chris turns around and looks
text: about. There is a staircase leading off to offices. Justine
text: looks up. There are skylights. She looks out to the far
text: pillar. She looks nervous.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where are your friends?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: They can see you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If there’s a problem, I guarantee
dialog: you will be the first to go.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: I told you Frank. I've got things
dialog: to do tonight.
text: Chris scans the area. It’s quiet. Justine looks to Ord.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Okay, let’s wrap this up Ord.
text: Ord whistles. A metal shutter rolls up at the far end of the
text: warehouse. Two figures enter. Martin Kargo and Vernon
text: Jeffries. Martin is thin and wiry. Vernon is thick set with a
text: heavy moustache. Vernon is carrying a rifle bag. Their
text: footsteps echo around the space. They approach.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Justine
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Vernon
text: Vernon unzips the bag and pulls out an AR18 automatic rifle.
text: He puts it on the table. Frank watches him carefully. The
text: AR18 looks like a standard machine gun. Same characteristics
text: as an M16. Black and dangerous looking.
speaker_heading: VERNON
text: AR18. Factory fresh.
text: Vernon takes out the magazine and puts it on the table. He
text: then pulls back the rack three times and presents it to Frank
text: so he can see that there are no rounds in the weapon. All
text: this time he has been pointing the weapon at the ground.
text: Vernon lays the now definitely empty weapon on the table.
text: Frank picks it up and weighs it in his hands. He passes it to
text: Chris. Chris puts down his briefcase. Martin watches this.
text: Frank notices Martin.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: A widow-maker.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: That’s what...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shut up.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Hey good to see you. My Mothers
dialog: people are from Sligo.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That’s nice.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You doing us a Sligo reduction
dialog: then?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: We're doing our bit. I don’t need
dialog: to be here at all.
dialog: Frank sucks his teeth. He knows what doing your bit entails.
dialog: And it’s cost him a lot more than Martin would ever be
text: prepared to give up.
text: Chris smells the gun. He looks down the barrel.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You got some rounds?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Sure.
text: Vernon rolls the bullets along the table top. Chris takes the
text: rounds and pops them in the magazine.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: I’m going to slowly take out my
dialog: handgun. Is that okay Frank?
text: Frank looks at Chris. Chris nods. Its okay.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure. Okay.
text: Ord takes out his pistol and aims it at the ground.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: This is just a precaution. While
text: the rifle is live.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You worked with these guys before
dialog: Ord?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Sure
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s okay to fire?
speaker_heading: VERNON
text: Fire away. No one can hear us.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey Ord. You ever used your
dialog: military background to chat up
dialog: women?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Try not to hit any metalwork. I
dialog: don’t want to get tagged by a
dialog: ricochet.
text: Chris gives him a slow sad look. He shoulders the rifle and
text: takes aim.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Military background?
text: Chris looks over at Justine.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Your memories of war... the band of
dialog: brothers... Blah blah.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: No... Who would want to hear that
dialog: shit?
text: The others step away and put their fingers in their ears.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You more the silent type Ord?
text: Chris squeezes off a round as Ord is about to answer.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry what?
text: Ord goes to talk again.
speaker_heading: BOOM! ORD
dialog: I hear its all about eye
dialog: contact
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry - what?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: It’s about eye contact. And caring
dialog: words.
text: Chris looks at Justine, who is giggling slightly. Chris makes
text: a ‘maybe he has a point’ face. Then pulls the trigger.
text: It makes a huge noise in the space. In the distance there is
text: a thwack as the bullet hits home. The ejected cartridge hits
text: the floor and rolls about.
text: Chris looks back at the others. Then to Frank.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay.
text: Chris squeezes of a few more shots. Refuse bags pop. A locker
text: falls over. There’s a clanging echo in the Warehouse. The
text: echo of the shots dims.
text: Chris then adjusts the Rifle to full auto. He lets off a
dialog: burst.
text: He then puts on the safety. Takes out the magazine and pulls
text: the rack, ejecting a live round. He does this twice more and
text: presents it to Vernon.
text: Vernon nods when he sees it’s safe.
text: Chris puts the rifle back on the table. Ord holsters his
text: pistol. Chris takes out a pen and uses it to pick up the
text: brass. He puts them on the table. He looks up at the pillar
text: near the table. He walks over to it. Ord watches him.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought we had talked about
dialog: M16‘s?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: We did.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The Brits wont even use these
text: things. They fail in the mud.
text: Chris runs his hands over the pillar. There are pock marks in
text: it. He looks at Ord. (What Chris is looking at are fresh
text: bullet scars. This place has recently been used as a firing
dialog: range.)
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Well don’t roll about in the mud...
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE BY THE PILLAR
text: Ord watches Chris looking at Pillar
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: What is the matter?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What does that look like to you?
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: Frank frowns and starts negotiating. Justine watches Chris.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’ve got money for M16’s
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Well I’ve got AR-18’s - that’s it.
text: Ord looks at the marks
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Bullet hits?
text: He shrugs. Not understanding why it might be relevant.
text: Chris looks out to the edges of the warehouse. They would
text: have come from a ways off. Chris looks to Ord then gives up
text: on his investigation. He turns to Vernon.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: They all folding stock?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Sure
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well where are they?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Lets see the money chief.
text: Chris pops the case on the table. He opens it up. Martin goes
text: into his bag and pulls out a money counter. Inside we see a
text: 20 round mag for the AR18. He feeds the money into the
text: counter. Justine looks at the money for a moment.
text: They all stand around and stare as he does it.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: It’s not that we don’t trust you...
dialog: it’s just easier this way.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure.
text: The money flips through the counter. It comes to an end.
text: Martin looks up.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: $40,000
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What would you do if you won the
dialog: lottery?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: I'd buy a cabin back home.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What’s the matter with here?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: I like it here, but, it’s just
dialog: moving through y’know.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Not really...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: So you going to do us a reduction
dialog: on these non M16's?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I’1l do them at 10% off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: 12
text: Chris nods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay. So I take $1200 back?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Sure. I can do you that in ammo if
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You were going to charge extra on
dialog: the ammo?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: It’s specialist. You got a press
dialog: you can do it in your garage or
dialog: what not?
text: Frank shrugs defeated.
scene_heading: INT. VAN
text: Inside the van sits Gordon: 32. Shoulder length hair. Leather
text: jacket. Harry: 27. Baby faced. Bomber jacket. Harry is
text: picking his knuckles. They are grazed from fighting. Gordon
text: watches out of the corner of his eye.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You got the walky turned on?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Yeah, thanks.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: We've been here ages. Maybe

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sure. They would have squawked.
dialog: signal.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: How long have you worked for
dialog: Vernon?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Long enough. Your energy is very
dialog: jumpy. Can you ratchet it down a
text: couple of notches.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sure. I’m just ready I guess...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: To load some boxes?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No... just peeeewwwwww ready.
text: Gordon rolls his eyes.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You need to wash those knuckles
dialog: you will get an infection.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I was in a fight.
text: The walky squawks.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: That’s the sign.
dialog: 25.
dialog: The

text: Gordan starts up the van. John Denver starts up on the 8
dialog: track.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: You like John Denver?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sure
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: In the distance there is the noise of a van starting up. The
text: men stand patiently as it approaches. Frank is tense. He
text: looks over to Chris. Chris is not scared but looks on
text: intensely. He strokes his jacket where his gun is. Frank
text: looks to Martin. The van enters the warehouse.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Look, if we wanted to rip you off
dialog: it would have happened already.
text: Frank looks them up and down for a second. He’s like a cat
text: with a mouse.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How do you all know each other?
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Will it make the guns fire any
dialog: straighter if you knew?
text: Vernon points at Justine.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: She vouches for us. That’s how it
dialog: works.
dialog: Justine smiles. Thats right.
speaker_heading: VERNON (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t want to know you Frank.
dialog: I’ve got enough friends already.
dialog: You Don’t want to know me. She
dialog: brings us all together. Its safer
dialog: that way.
text: Franks face is set. He’s smiling but he’s not happy. Justine
text: detects this. Martins is resolute in not talking.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: My father had a gun shop in Sweden.
dialog: I’ve known the Corsican since I was
dialog: kid. They know the Corsican, so we
dialog: are all friends.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's cozy. You always been into
dialog: guns Justine?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: I grew up with them. How about you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My Father took me shooting when I
dialog: was a boy.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve always been around them. He
dialog: was a good shot. Later he was in
dialog: the Easter uprising. It was a good
dialog: skill to have.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Story time over?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What war were you in Ord?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Whatever it was, the great Irish
dialog: army wasn’t involved...
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: The van rolls in. It comes to a stop. The two men get out.
text: They walk around the back of the truck and start unloading.
text: One of the men looks at Stevo. He walks around the van.
text: Martin opens the back door with a key on his key chain. The
text: two men (Gordon and Harry) Start lugging out the boxes. They
text: are about 0.5 ft by 3ft wooden containers with rope handles.
text: Martin takes the van keys from Harry and pockets them.
text: Soon there is a pile of boxes. Gordon and Harry are sweating
text: slightly. Harry is eyeing Stevo.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Lets have a look then.
text: Vernon takes a crowbar and opens one of the boxes. Inside are
text: three AR18’s in wood chippings. Frank smiles. He points to a
dialog: random box.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What’s your daughter called?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Agneth.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How about that one...
text: Vernon shrugs and opens it. Same deal.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Just open em all.
text: The boxes are opened up. Inside sit the AR18’s Frank purses
text: his lips. Chris leans into Justine. Martin watches neutrally.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I can’t believe you wont see me
dialog: tomorrow.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Do you think I’m stupid?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Stop pretending to be interested in
dialog: my kid.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Just making conversation...
text: Chris looks at the guns. Vernon looks over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: They like to run wet. Keep it lubed
dialog: even when its dirty.
text: He pulls out a can of lube.
speaker_heading: VERNON (CONT'D)
dialog: On the house...
text: Chris plays with the folding stock.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You got the ammo?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Sure. In the back... But not yet.
text: Chris smiles. Everyone is cautious.
text: Harry takes another look at Stevo as he passes with a box.
text: Stevo looks at him with vague recognition. This look turns to
text: cold dread over the next few moments. Gordon and Harry bring
text: the last box out and put it down.
text: Round the other side of the van Stevo motions to Bernie.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Look who it is...
text: Bernie looks back over his shoulder and spots Harry.
speaker_heading: BERNIE
dialog: Oh fuck no. Has he made you?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: How could he not?
text: Frank makes an inventory of the contents of the boxes. He
text: counts the contents and Chris has a look at a random sample.
text: They are all the same - this is the real deal. All new. Harry
text: is sneaking peaks at Stevo here and there. As each box is
text: signed off, it’s resealed and stacked.
dialog: 29.
text: A two foot high wooden wall is being built out of packing
text: cases. Gordon looks and sees Harry looking agitated.
text: Round the back of the van he talks to Harry
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: What’s the matter with you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I don’t know. I think I know those
dialog: guys.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Cops?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No.. From last night..
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You better get your shit together
dialog: because we are in a serious
dialog: situation here... Just chill out.
text: Around the front of the van the deal is coming to a close.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Okay. That’s our business almost
dialog: done here.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You tell the Corsican thanks.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Perfecto. We will leave and then
dialog: you load out. Give us 5 minutes.
dialog: You can drive your vehicle round on
dialog: Lassiter.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Okay. Got it.
text: Harry is staring now. Staring at Stevo. Gordon looks from
dialog: Harry to Vernon.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Harry...
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I know you.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Shut up Harry.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What’s the problem Gordon?
dialog: 30.
text: Martin looks at his watch and glances to Justine. She takes a
text: small step back. His watch is ticking towards 12.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: No you don’t.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah I do.
text: Martin takes a small look to the far pillars.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: What’s this about Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: This is the guy that hit us last
text: night at Harlequins. Him and his
dialog: buddy there.
text: Bernie shifts uncomfortably.
text: There is a pause. Frank looks up. Chris looks carefully at
dialog: Harry.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Is this true?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I don’t know what you are talking
dialog: about.
text: A moment passes. Vernon stares at Stevo.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You are a terrible liar son.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Come on now. Don’t be calling my
dialog: brother in-law a liar
text: Stevo is starting to sweat. He looks to Frank. Bernie looks
text: into the middle distance trying to disappear.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell them Steven.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I don’t know what he’s talking
dialog: about.
text: Harry's face is red with anger. As he says the next few lines
text: it’s as if he is stepping on an emotional gas peddle. He goes
text: from straight to ENRAGED in eight words.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Last night there was a fight in
dialog: Harlequins. Started by this guy and
dialog: his friends. My cousin, Sally
dialog: Perigan. She was bottled. She's
text: still in the hospital
text: Frank grimaces. Justine looks to Stevo. She’s not happy about
text: what she is hearing Bernie looks blank. Chris looks at Ord.
text: Looks at Ord’s hands. Frank talks very slowly and
dialog: deliberately.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We are here for work. Not to talk
dialog: about the rights or wrongs of
dialog: particular bar fights.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I agree.
text: Harry twitches. He is on the rack here. He knows this is the
text: wrong place. But his sense of righteousness is eating him
text: alive.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Her face is fucked up...
text: Vernon smiles in a fatherly way.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Well, that’s something you will
dialog: have to take care of another day.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: We can sort this thing out later
dialog: Harry
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: He ground the glass into her face.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I wasn’t there. This is bullshit.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Was he all banged up after last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I walked into a door. I’ve never
dialog: been to that bar.
text: Stevo is stepping forward towards Harry. Bernie is naturally
text: moving in. Harry is moving forward with Gordon as his wing
text: man. It’s coming together. It’s like it wants to happen.
speaker_heading: STEVO (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t start it.. You
dialog: motherfucker!
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You need to stop talking now.
text: Stevo punches Harry. Harry falls back. He scrambles to his
text: feet and grabs at Stevo. The two men fall to floor in a flail
text: of punches and short screams of exertion.
text: Ord looks over to Chris and shrugs.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Christ.
text: Ord and Frank move in and pull the two men apart. They grab
text: them and pries them open.
text: Chris is putting a little distance between himself and the
text: others. Ord and Frank have hold of the flailing men.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: YOU FUCKING SHIT. I’LL KILL
dialog: YOU...FUCKERS... LET ME GO... LET
dialog: ME GO...
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: I will Harry, but you have to
dialog: relax.
text: Ord looks to Chris. He can see Harry is about to go. There is
text: a moment when the fire could catch again just on the vapors.
text: Harry wipes his face, he is so conflicted. He’s never backed
dialog: down in a fight before.
text: Stevo is released by Frank and is wiping blood from his nose
text: and gasping for air.
text: Harry looks around at the other men. Chris puts out his hand
text: flat and bends down a bit. It’s placatory body language. He
text: is talking slowly. The sound has shifted now... It feels
text: muffled. Variously the characters are entering into an
text: endorphin state as their bodies flood with adrenalin.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’m sorry to hear about your
dialog: cousin. But we are taking these
text: guns now and leaving.
text: Ord lets go of Harrys’ arm. Chris backs away to give himself
text: a bit of distance. He instinctively knows what’s about to go
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: MARTIN
dialog: Let’s go Harry.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Okay... that’s okay...
text: Harry goes to walk away. He talks quietly. Defeated.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: She was only 17.
text: Stevo watches Harry walk away
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Then she shouln’t have been out
dialog: should she?
text: Chris is watching Harry’s hands. He looks over to Martin.
text: Chris’s hand twitches. He looks back.
text: Harry twists in Martins’ arms pulling a snub-nosed 38. Ord
text: sees and pushes forward to get to Harry.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: No!
text: Harry fires at Stevo. Time slows.
text: Flare flashes from the muzzle of the snub-nose.
text: Stevo is hit in the shoulder. It opens up in an explosion of
text: material and blood.
text: In one action his hand pulls out his M1911 hand-gun from his
text: jacket. Stevo falls.
text: Frank looks on in low resignation. This is his fault for
dialog: bringing the idiot along.
text: Justine looks at Ord. Can he help stop this?
text: Ord catches Justine’s look. It’s out of his hands now.
text: Martin grabs at Harry, trying to stop him. The men all stare
text: at each other for a moment.
text: Frank steps backward and gets ready to pull.
text: Chris scans back and forth to see which way this is going to
dialog: go.
text: There is a split second where this fight might not escalate.
text: But Chris knows as soon as the first shot is fired, the guns
dialog: will come out and there’s no other place to go.
text: Bernie looks on, frozen to the spot.
text: Gordon takes a step back. He looks on blankly.
text: Martin takes a step back. He is staring at Stevo falling.
text: Martin bumps into the table. The AR18 and a detached magazine
text: falls off it.
dialog: 34.
text: Vernon looks at Chris and sees the look. He doesn't even
text: think and goes for his pistol.
text: Ord staggers back looking for cover. He shifts his body
text: weight out of the line of fire of Stevo.
text: Vernon pulls his pistol. A Colt Cobra. A snub-nosed 38.
text: Chris quick draws his pistol; a police 38. He tucks his arm
text: in, so that his hand is in close to his hip. (A classic close
dialog: combat stance.)
text: Frank pulls his pistol. A Browning 9mm automatic.
text: Martin pulls his. A 44 Python. He cocks it. He looks around
dialog: for a target.
text: Ord moves backwards towards the AR18 cases.
text: Vernon fumbles with the safety catch on his pistol.
text: Chris has hunckered down to make as small a target as
text: possible and is trying to get to cover. He sees the pillar
text: out of his periphery vision. Tactically, he figures there are
text: too many people to engage. He needs to move and shoot to get
dialog: to a safe position.
text: Justine pulls her pistol - a 38 police special. She nervously
text: looks around.
text: Bernie is frozen. His hands come up slowly. He wants no part
dialog: in this.
text: Harry fires again. The hammer smashing down on a bullets’
text: percussion cap. It fires, igniting the gunpowder. The pistol
text: kicks as the bullet exits. The cylinder turns and engages
text: another cartridge.
text: The bullet whistles past Stevo’s head as he falls backwards.
text: Ord pulls out his pistol from a kneeling position. A Colt
scene_heading: M1991A1 Compact.
text: Stevo fires his automatic. The pistol spits fire. The slide
text: jerks back and a shell casing ejects.
text: The high calibre slug misses Harry and hits Gordon; blowing
text: his ear off. His long hair blows in the air at the impact.
text: Gordon grabs the side of his face as blood arcs out of his
text: head. He starts to scream but he is trapped in syrup like in
text: a dream.
text: Vernon is nervously fiddling with his pistol trying to unlock
text: the safety while backing away.
text: Bernie is watching events unfold around him. He is still
text: frozen.
dialog: 35.
text: Ord takes aim on Chris. He tracks him in the iron sights of
text: his automatic. It’s hard to hit him as Vernon moves across
text: his line of sight.
text: Chris fires in twos. Double taps. TAP TAP. He hits Martin at
text: close range. A gob of gore sprouts from Martins’ head.
text: Stevo hits the floor. He is still firing. A second bullet
dialog: chambers.
text: BANG - a spent cartridge spins across space...
text: He totally misses Harry. The bullet screams off wide. A light
text: in the ceiling explodes. Sparks fly.
text: Martin drops to his knees. Blood spits from his head.
text: Ord fires on Chris. Misses the first shot and hits him with
text: the second. Winging his arm. Ord is concentrated on his iron
text: sight. He tries to control the dump of adrenalin that’s in
text: his system. He starts to experience tunnel vision.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE 200 METERS OUT EAST
text: Jimmy 40. Slim, black jacket, steps out of the shadows with
text: his Ml carbine. He licks his fingers and wets the iron sight
text: at the end of his rifle. He watches for a moment as shots are
text: fired in the distance. Gunsmoke is gathering in the air. He
text: looks nervous; this wasn’t the plan. He looks to the far side
text: of the warehouse and sees a second rifle man... Howie.
scene_heading: INT.WAREHOUSE HOWIES PILLAR 200 METRES OUT WEST
text: Far away from the action we find Howie. 53. Pot bellied.
text: White whiskers. Dark hunting jacket. He takes aim with an Ml
text: Garrand. He looks stressed. He looks over to Jimmy's
dialog: position. Is this what they should be doing?
text: We see down his iron sight. In the distance we see the gun
dialog: battle.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: Vernon fires his pistol at Stevo and the bullet nicks Stevo’s
text: thigh. Blood squirts out. He turns and fires behind him.
text: Shell casings ping into the air.
text: Chris fires his 38 hitting Vernon’s arm. He staggers back.
text: Half running. It’s like he has been punched.
text: Martin fires his pistol involuntarily. It kicks back. The
text: ripple going down his arm.
dialog: 36.
text: The shot ricochets across the floor and whines towards Frank.
text: Frank almost bunny hops to the side in shock.
text: Chris fires his pistol at Harry and hits him in the side.
text: Harrys’ jacket puffs up and explodes with blood. The bullet
text: exits. Harry spins. Already off balance.
text: Bernie starts to realize what’s happening around him and runs
text: towards a pillar.
text: Frank fires his pistol at Vernon. He fires wide and the round
text: hits the van. It makes a low DUNK noise.
dialog: Bang
text: Justine darts right to avoid the gun fire.
speaker_heading: BANG
text: Harry falls backwards and fires into the air. Another
text: ricochet pangs off the light fixtures.
speaker_heading: BANG
text: Stevo fires his third shot. It’s wide and inaccurate.
speaker_heading: BANG
text: Gordon drops his pistol and grabs his head. Blood squirts out
text: through his fingers. He falls to the side and slides down the
text: side of the van.
text: Harry collapses into the dust.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE 200 METERS OUT.
text: Jimmy looks at his watch. Midday.
text: Jimmy squeezes off three shots with the Ml carbine. The shots
text: are loud and distinctive. WUDD. Clang WUDD, clang WUDD..
dialog: clang
text: Brass casings roll around on the floor.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: A bullet smacks into Franks’ arm, spinning him round. Chris
text: turns his head and sees the flash of the carbine for the
dialog: first time.
text: Bernie cowers behind the pillar. Bullets chasing through the
dialog: air.
text: Gordon clambers too his feet and looks for an exit.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE
text: Vernon dives out of the way. Harry tries to shield himself
text: from the incoming gunfire. It’s chaos. The initial pistol
text: shoot-out is superceded by the introduction of much greater
dialog: fire power.
text: The Ml Carbine fire continues in bursts of three. A shot goes
text: wide and hits Gordon in the leg. He is spun around and
text: collapses to the ground again.
scene_heading: INT.WAREHOUSE HOWIES PILLAR

speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: again, hitting nothing. His jacket rips open and AR18 rounds
text: tinkle to the ground.
text: Chris tries to take cover from the increasing rifle
text: crossfire. Bullets zing through the air. He grabs one of the

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. LOW WALL.
text: Justine looks at the wound in her leg. She sees that it’s in
text: and out. She picks the bits of trouser out of the wound with

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where did those guys come from?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: I don’t know.. They were waiting

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I knew it. Those bullet strikings

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
text: They were range markings. They had
dialog: time to practise.
text: She opens her mouth wash. She uses it to clean the wound in
text: her leg. She flinches as it pours on. She squirts some
text: perfume on the wound as well. The alcohol works as an
text: antiseptic.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. You think they were with Ord
dialog: and Vern?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Independents I’d say. Maybe they
dialog: got wind of the deal?
text: Justine pulls a needle out of her bag
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Maybe... You badly hurt?

speaker_heading: JUSTINE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JUSTINE (CONT'D)
text: Looks straight through...
text: She starts to make a bandage for him. She stitches up the

scene_heading: INT.WAREHOUSE AR18 CRATES
text: Gordon sees Stevo moving through the wheels of the van. He

text: He aims his pistol and fires. A bullet skids into the

speaker_heading: ORD

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Son of a bitch... shot me...

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. AR18 BOXES
text: Ord looks over to Gordon. Vernon looks about. He sees where
text: Justine and Chris are. Franks position. He looks at Bernards
text: dead body. He looks over to Martin and Howie collapsed. He
text: thinks for a moment. There are a lot of dead and dying people
text: here. He’s coming to a conclusion. Ord sees him thinking.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: What do you want to do?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: VERN
dialog: I want to go home
text: Ord smiles..
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: I see we have three options... One:
dialog: we leave, two: we shoot it out with
dialog: them, three: we negotiate.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Here's the thing. We have four
text: bodies already and a load of guns.
dialog: This is a very bad situation.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Yeah
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I think the only way out now is to
dialog: kill them all.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Oh Vern. Come on.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: This is the logical play. We can’t
dialog: take the risk.
text: Ord looks around at the damage. He looks over to where Jimmy
text: was. He sees he is moving about.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Who the fuck was that guy?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: The Micks looked as surprised as
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Who knows from our side outside of
dialog: the Corsican?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Maybe it was Justine..
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: What would she have to gain?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: How well do you know anyone?
dialog: Situations change.. People like us
dialog: already take a lot a risks. What’s
dialog: one more?
text: Vernon looks over to her... He’s already decided a course of
text: action. He looks back to Martin’s inert body
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: VERNON (CONT'D)
dialog: I worked with him for 10 years.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE WEST PILLAR.
text: Jimmy is sobbing. He looks at his hand. He can see colours at

text: a picture of his wife and child.
text: Jimmy sobs. He tries to pull him self together.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE LOW WALL
text: Justine peers over the top of her wall. She sees Ord pop his

speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: ORD!
speaker_heading: ORD’
text: HEY JUSTINE. I HOPE YOU DIDN’T GET
dialog: HIT TOO BAD?

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE LOW WALL
text: Chris and Justine lay next to one another.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Who are we dealing with here?
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Ord is an ex-military guy they
dialog: bring in to have a bit of sensible
dialog: muscle. Martin and Vernon are the
dialog: connections. I deal through their
dialog: boss. The kids I dont know.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Ord seems like someone we can work
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: He wont panic.. The others...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You should stay here.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: I’m getting over to the others.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Why would you leave me here?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You have to stay independent. If
dialog: you align with us, they will kill
dialog: you. The first opportunity you get
dialog: you have to get out of here.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Can think you can win?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: At the end of the day a battle is
text: won by the side that gives up last.
dialog: I ain't dieing here
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: You think you have the most reason
dialog: to live?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I’ve got an ideology at least.
dialog: These guys have just got money.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE
dialog: Money can mean a lot of things. It
dialog: can mean freedom. People will do
dialog: anything for freedom.
text: Justine looks shaky.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I won’t let them hurt you.
speaker_heading: JUSTINE

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE AR18 BOXES
text: Ord is moving about dragging bags of rubble over and putting

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: FUCK YOU!
text: Vernon hisses over to Harry.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I should put one in you, you little
dialog: bastard.
text: Ord turns to Vernon
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Those other shooters are
dialog: independents. This would have gone
dialog: down like this whatever happened.
text: In fact, Harry’s lunacy may have
dialog: helped us.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Because without the initial gunplay
dialog: the shooters would have caught us
text: completely off guard.
text: Ord puts another bag of rubble up against the wooden crates.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What are you doing? Building a
dialog: fort?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Do you think wooden boxes stop
dialog: bullets?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Don’t they?
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: You watch too much TV. Do you think
dialog: a stud wall stops a bullet?
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Do you not know the difference
dialog: between concealment and cover?
text: Vernon registers the error of his ways.
speaker_heading: VERNON

speaker_heading: HOWIE

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUTH PILLAR

speaker_heading: VERNON (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s fucking dead.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUTH PILLAR

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Here we are...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good to see you.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Your brother in law is a fucking

text: Frank looks miserable and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you think they have anyone

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I think they have troubles of their

dialog: And it looks like the last one got

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I didn’t see where it came from.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: If any ones coming for them it
dialog: isn’t any time soon.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ord never says anything by

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I never told Leary where we were
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: He might work it..
text: Chris tries to hide his defeat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He’s an idiot. He is never going to

text: Chris looks out to the far door where the van came in.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We can’t let them leave. If they
dialog: get outside we are fucked. Look at
dialog: all these bodies..
speaker_heading: FRANK.
dialog: Well we can cover the back door. I
dialog: don’t think anyone is going to be

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Even if we could make it out. We
dialog: can’t leave without the guns
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t think that’s a priority at

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We are on fairly thin ice with our

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We can but try.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: The biggest problem we have is if

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUTH PILLAR.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay Chris.

text: Justine. She looks scared.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. AR18 BOXES
text: Ord can hear a squeaking noise. It’s the sound of the trolley
text: wheels. He moves over to the edge of the boxes and takes a
text: look. Vernon shifts over to have a look as well. He sees the
text: trolley being pushed by Chris. It’s loaded with refuse bags
text: of rubbish. Chris can be seen bobbing about behind it.
text: Ord looks over to where the trolley seems to be heading.

speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: What ammo are you shooting?
speaker_heading: VERNON
text: 9mm hollow point.
speaker_heading: ORD

speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: You are wasting your time. Aim for

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. AR18 BOXES

text: collapses.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE TROLLEY
text: Chris scrambles for cover as the trolley falls to pieces.
text: Bullets rip across the concrete. Chris rolls - cursing.

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. AR18 BOXES
text: Vernon fires blindly.

speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What the fuck was that?
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE RUBBLE BAGS
text: Chris crawls out from his cover towards the South pillar. He
text: moves methodically forward. Pulling himself along. He looks
text: back to the AR18 Boxes. The small explosion hadn’t done much

text: pillar. Frank is beckoning him in.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUTH PILLAR.
text: Chris is pulled behind the pillar by Frank and Stevo. Chris
text: is exhausted. Frank grabs his head and hugs him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You mad bastard.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Did she make it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah.
text: Chris looks round and sees Justine by the low wall. She looks

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE AR18 BOXES
text: Ord chuckles to himself.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What are you laughing at?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: This guy is a problem... Trying to

speaker_heading: VERNON

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUTH PILLAR.
text: Chris and Frank plan.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We have to get to that phone and

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’1l go.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I should go.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’ve already got you shot when I
dialog: was supposed to be looking out for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: I am a big boy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s not you I am worried about,
dialog: it’s my sister. I promised her you

speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Ill do it...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I am going... I am the only one fit
dialog: enough.
text: Chris and Frank look at each other. There’s an understanding.
text: Chris looks at the lay of the land.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: If you can get over towards the
dialog: stairs it will be very hard for
dialog: them to hit you. If you crawl low
dialog: and use the rubbish for cover.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure. What have they got.
dialog: Automatics and revolvers... it’s
dialog: too far for a shot.
text: He smiles winningly. The other two men are not so sure.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. AR18 BOXES
text: Ord watches the South pillar. He looks at his leg wound and
text: ties off the bandage.
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: They are going to go for the phone
dialog: and bring their guys now.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: I can make it... You cover me.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: We should stay ensconced here.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: And wait for them to bring Rick O
dialog: Shea and his brothers down here.
dialog: Fuck that.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: We should get the ammo out of the
text: van and overpower them.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: You had your chance. I’m not
dialog: listening to you again.
text: Ord looks at the distance and tries to run the play in his
dialog: head. Maybe...
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Let’s have a look at you.
text: Ord looks at Vernon’s leg wound. He tidies up the bandage. He
text: looks around finds some cardboard. He starts to rip it up.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: If you are going to crawl on the
dialog: this floor you are going to need
text: some pads.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: Are you kidding
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: The shit in this warehouse is more
dialog: likely to kill us than bullets.
dialog: Pigeon shit... Chemicals... And you
dialog: are going to crawl around in it
dialog: with open wounds... You need every
dialog: bit of help you can get.
text: He ties the cardboard around his legs.
speaker_heading: VERNON
dialog: How the fuck did this happen...
text: There’s a moment of calm between them. Ord appreciates what
text: Vernon is about to do even if it is crazy.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Okay. Good luck.
text: Vernon is now wearing his cardboard armor. He looks dejected.
text: He shuffles out.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE THE BACK OF THE VAN
text: Vernon crawls out to the back of the van. He looks over to
text: the South pillar. He holds his leg and grimaces. He sees
text: Frank making his way out. He holds his pistol up. It’s heavy.
text: We see the gun wobbling about. Vernon tries to steady it. He
text: can’t do it. He opens the cylinder to look at how many shots
text: he has. He frowns. He puts his hand in his pocket and finds a
text: couple of bullets. He reloads his gun.
text: He looks over and can see Frank is further away. He takes
text: aim. He has even less chance of hitting him now.
text: He looks on in frustration. Vernon holsters his pistol and
text: with a nervous look over to the South pillar he prepares to
text: crawl. He looks back to Ord. Ord has his pistol aimed at the
text: pillar. He urges Vernon on with his eyes.
text: Vernon lays as close to the ground as he can and starts to
text: shuffle out from behind the cover of the van.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. AR18 BOXES
text: Ord watches the South pillar. There is no movement. He looks

speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: HE’S COMING FRANK!
text: INT. WAREHOUSE TOWARDS THE STAIRS
text: Frank grunts as he crawls. He uses his arms to pull his body
text: along, dragging his legs behind him. He has a steady pace on
text: now. He is pushing through detritus on the floor. Cartons and
text: abandoned refuge bags. He is huffing and puffing. He stops
text: for a moment and looks over his shoulder. In the distance he
text: can see Vernon. He turns and looks toward the stairs. They
text: lay about 500 meters away. Between him and the stairs are
dialog: many obstacles.
dialog: 68.

speaker_heading: CHRIS

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE 10 METRES OUT FROM THE VAN

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ORD
dialog: Go and get it, then.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: That’s pretty dangerous Ord.
text: Ord looks at him in a way that Harry knows that he doesn't
text: have a choice in the matter. Harry weighs up the threat. He
text: looks around and sees Gordon. Gordon looks at him with wild
text: eyes. He looks back at Ord.
text: He turns and starts to crawl back towards the van. It’s about
text: 10 meters of open ground.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUTH PILLAR.
text: Chris is watching the progress of Vernon
speaker_heading: STEVO
dialog: Take the shot.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: STEVO

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE. AR18 BOXES
text: Ord looks over to Harry. Ord is trying to stop the bleeding
text: from his new wound. He gestures to Harry to open the doors.
text: Harry shrugs and makes a carkey mime.
text: Ord looks over to where Martins lays.
text: And then he looks back to Harry. Harry shakes his head.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE SOUTH PILLAR.
text: Chris and Stevo scramble on the floor. Chris is punching
text: Stevo in the head. They thrash about - each man not strong
dialog: enough to get the better of the other.
text: Chris reaches down and grabs Stevo’s leg and forces his

text: distance. He winces and looks down at his hand.
dialog: 71.
text: It’s got a syringe sticking in it. It’s gone in quite deep.

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE.
text: Harry gets over to Martins’ body. He turns him over. He has
text: been shot in the head. Harry goes through his pockets trying

dialog: What are you waiting for?
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRS
text: Frank arrives at the stairs. He looks up them. There is a

scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE STAIRS
text: Frank looks around the corner carefully. He sees that Vernon

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR.
text: Justine reaches the door. She reaches up to the door handle.
text: Her hand slips off it. She tries it again. The door is locked

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: You get away from that.
