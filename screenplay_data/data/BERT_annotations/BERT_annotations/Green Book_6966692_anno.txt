speaker_heading: BARKEEP

speaker_heading: DR. SHIRLEY (CONT'D)

scene_heading: DR. SHIRLEY

speaker_heading: LIP
dialog: What, I can’t get mad when he says

scene_heading: DR. SHIRLEY
dialog: You're blacker than me?
speaker_heading: LIP

dialog: talk, how they live--you don’t even
dialog: know who Lil’ Richard is!
scene_heading: DR. SHIRLEY

scene_heading: DR. SHIRLEY

speaker_heading: OLEG (CONT'D)

scene_heading: DR. SHIRLEY

text: Graham Kindell shifts uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: LIP
dialog: Wait a minute. You’re tellin’ me

speaker_heading: GRAHAM KINDELL

speaker_heading: LIP

speaker_heading: GRAHAM KINDELL
dialog: Of course. We’ll be happy to send

speaker_heading: GRAHAM KINDELL

speaker_heading: LIP
dialog: And Dr. Shirley expects to eat
dialog: tonight. Why can’t you just make an
dialog: exception this one time?
speaker_heading: Kindell SIGHS.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM KINDELL
dialog: Lemme tell you a story. You ever
dialog: hear of the Boston Celtics
dialog: basketball club? Those boys came
dialog: through here a couple years ago on
text: a barnstorming tour. Now, seeing as
dialog: they were World Champions of the
dialog: league and all, we was tickled to

text: drink on the top of the piano. Shirley takes the drink, puts
text: it on the floor.
text: SHIRLEY PLACES HIS HANDS ON THE KEYS, TAKES A MOMENT...
text: And then... Shirley starts to play. This isn’t a catchy jazz
