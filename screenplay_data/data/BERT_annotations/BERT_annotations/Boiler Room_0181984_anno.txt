scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

text: Seth is 20 years old. No menacing physical presence but a

text: Confident but edgy. Eyes always darting.
text: The bus is filled with 19 and 20 year olds. They wear very
text: sharp suits: Hugo Boss, Armani, very slick.
text: They're going nuts. Cards games in the aisle. Five guys

speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: MANAGER

text: The doors open as we approach, and the group enters. Seth
text: smiles widely as he enters. The group has attacked the
text: buffet and the bar. A large group of managers are snorting
text: coke off a glass coffee table. A dice game is beginning. At
text: least 30 guys are in front of the TV betting on a horse race.
speaker_heading: RICHIE

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Quiet down a second. I want you all to
dialog: know that those pikers at the NASD are
dialog: finally off our ass. JT Marlin once
dialog: again has unlimited trading
dialog: authorization. I told you guys, you
dialog: can't keep a good man down.
dialog: (big applause)
dialog: We are the superstars now. JP Morgan
text: just faxed over their congratulations.
dialog: It said, "Welcome to the Club." This
dialog: also means that the teams headed by Ron
dialog: and Anthony who were good enough to
dialog: give up their rep numbers, can stop
text: cold calling and start trading again.
dialog: Welcome back. To show you guys just
dialog: how appreciative I am, I have a little
dialog: something extra for you.
dialog: I want all of you guys from those teams

scene_heading: INT. SUITE 418 - NIGHT (LATER)
text: CLOSE UP ON RICHIE, a broker with a bad temper, who is
text: fucking a prostitute from behind on one of the double beds in
text: the room. He's still half dressed. There is nothing sensual
dialog: about it.
text: We PAN OVER to the other bed where another broker is fucking
text: a prostitute. The two men are looking at each other and
text: laughing.
text: The women are quiet. There is a lot of noise coming from the

speaker_heading: MARC

speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: THREE MONTHS EARLIER
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA/JT MARLIN - MORNING
text: We follow GREG FEINSTEIN through a reception office. Greg is
text: a senior broker here at JT Marlin. He walks tall, wears
dialog: expensive clothing, drives a Ferrari. But if you look close
dialog: you can see the high school loser who made good.
text: An attractive secretary in her mid-twenties, DEBBIE HILLIARD,
text: picks her head up when Greg walks in. Debbie is black.
text: She's street smart and has that "in the know" look about her.
text: Greg walks straight up to Debbie. He doesn't look happy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Morning baby. You wanna tell me where
dialog: the fuck you were last night?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Not particularly. And don't call me
dialog: baby.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: Greg, I'm not sure how better to
dialog: explain this to you, but it's over.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: That what you think?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (nonplussed)
dialog: Kiss off would you, I've got work to
dialog: do.
text: Greg, incensed, GRABS her by the arm as a group of brokers
text: walks in. He tries to act like he's showing her something on
text: the computer but she angrily SHAKES loose of his grip. Greg
text: leaves her and walks into...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)
text: ...the trading room of JT MARLIN. The cold light of this
text: enormous room almost blinds the viewer. The room is spartan.
text: This is no traditional trading house. Each broker's desk
text: touches another on either side as well as directly ahead.
text: It looks like one very long cafeteria style table with
text: brokers sitting across from and next to each other. There
text: are close to twenty brokers sitting at each table. On the
text: tables are only two items, phones and index cards. A
text: secretary is at the head of each table. They answer incoming
dialog: calls.
text: We move QUICKLY along one of the tables, passing brokers on
text: the phones, their pitches melding into one another.
speaker_heading: BROKER #1
dialog: About how much would you say you have
dialog: invested in the market right now? More
dialog: than a half million, less than...?
speaker_heading: BROKER #2
dialog: No, no, no. You don't want out now.
dialog: I'm telling you this stock is going to
dialog: thirty. I'm in very heavy myself.
dialog: Just stay put.
speaker_heading: BROKER #3
dialog: I don't know if you've ever had the
dialog: opportunity to purchase IPO before but
dialog: we have a company that we're bringing
dialog: to market in the next...
speaker_heading: BROKER #4
dialog: Look, we have to move on this right
dialog: now. This is gonna happen in the next
dialog: week. We don't want to marry this
dialog: stock. We're in we're out...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: No, I understand why you'd be
dialog: concerned. You just have to calm down
dialog: for a second. You see nothing's
dialog: changed. Our game plan's the same.
dialog: Look, this is off the record, but I
dialog: spoke to the controller this morning.
dialog: He assured me that they will be
dialog: reporting better than expected third
dialog: quarter earnings next month.
dialog: (soothing)
dialog: Right. See I'm telling you, just sit
dialog: tight, everything's fine. It's type
dialog: two buying power. You're golden. Call
dialog: me in a month from now when you're
dialog: rich. Bye.
text: One of Greg's trainees, MARC, approaches with a stack of
dialog: cards.
speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: Here you go, Greg.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I hope these are better than the last
dialog: batch of shit you gave me. You produce
text: more wood than Ron Jeremy.
speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: What? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I see you making your calls. Listen to
dialog: me, you can't just get on the phone and
dialog: say, 'Can I send you some information?'
dialog: If you want them off the phone so bad,
dialog: why don't you just hang up? You have
dialog: to excite them about things.
dialog: You want them to beg for a broker on
dialog: that first call.
text: Debbie walks through the trading floor to drop a package off
text: at a broker's desk. Greg watches, seething.
speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: You're right. I freeze up when...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Just stop pussying out every time
text: someone picks up the phone; it's what
dialog: you want.

speaker_heading: KID 2
dialog: From what?
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I spotted you at Douglaston last week.
dialog: Remember? The birdie on nine?
speaker_heading: KID 2
dialog: Oh yeah, yeah.
text: He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a bunch of chips
text: from a casino. He lays them out on the table and counts out
text: $25. All of the chips say "Seth's" on them.
speaker_heading: KID 2 (CONT'D)
dialog: Here you go. Now pass me the
dialog: sauerkraut, you stank ho.
text: He takes the chips, counts them, and drops them in his shirt

scene_heading: INT. SETH'S BEDROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
text: A comforter hangs in front of the window. Nothing is in

text: knocking is heard again and this time Seth straightens up.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOORWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Sorry about that.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
text: There are two full-size couches and a coffee table. A large-

text: The centerpieces of the room are two blackjack tables.
text: They're for real -- professional felts, cash boxes, stools.

text: "cunning linguist" T-shirt, dealing to the three kids.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
text: Seth stands at the door of an affluent looking home in

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: I'm just saying, this isn't good, Seth.
dialog: You're late and your father's really
dialog: upset with you. He won't even tell me
dialog: what it is. I just wanted to warn you.
text: She goes back to the kitchen before Seth can respond. He
text: opens the screen door and walks in. He's nervous.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - DAY
text: His family is eating dinner. Seth's father, MARTY DAVIS,
text: does not even look up from his plate. Marty is a Federal
text: Judge. He's an intimidating man both in his work and
dialog: personal life.
text: Seth moves toward the empty seat. His younger brother NEIL,

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: What's up, Seth?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hey bro, how's school?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: That's a good question. You want to
dialog: tell me what happened, Seth?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: We didn't know if you were still
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: There was traffic.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Don't you want to wait till after
dialog: dinner?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Yeah, I think that's a better...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Answer the question.
text: Everyone stops eating. There's no more denying the tension.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I dropped out.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Tell me why.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I gave it a year Dad, it's not for me.
dialog: I'm sure of it.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: So you've been lying to our faces for
dialog: six months now. Six months. Schools
dialog: fine, Dad. My grades are good, Dad.
dialog: Okay, let's leave that for a second.
dialog: If you dropped out then you're not
dialog: getting your student loan checks
dialog: anymore. Right? I want to know how
dialog: you're making rent every month.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Dad, please don't ask me that.
text: There is a long pause here as Seth just stares back at her.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You're dealing drugs, aren't you?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No, of course not. I'm not a drug
dialog: dealer, Mom.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Well, what are you doing? This is
dialog: making me nervous, Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay. There's a business I'm running.
dialog: But I'm earning my money honestly.
text: Marty reaches into his pocket and takes out a handful of
text: chips from Seth's casino, SLAMMING them down on the table.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Is this what you call earning a living?
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (hysterical)
dialog: What are those, Marty? Are those
dialog: drugs?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yes, it's an honest living. Ask any of
dialog: my customers.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Customers? What are you talking about?
dialog: They're people's children from this
dialog: community.
dialog: How do you think I got these? Anyway,
dialog: it's illegal! You're running a back-
dialog: door card game! How do you think this
dialog: reflects on me? I'm a judge for
dialog: Christ's sake! If this ever gets
dialog: out...
text: Seth looks away. He's just too scared to maintain eye
dialog: contact.
speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you listening to me?!!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SETH'S CASINO - NIGHT

text: dealer's hand.
text: Seth is dealing on one table and one of his employees, JEFF,
text: an even younger looking kid, deals at another. One patron is
text: at the center of all the action. He looks very nervous about
text: the stakes he's playing.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (stone cold)
dialog: That's sixteen.
speaker_heading: CASINO PATRON
dialog: Hit me.
text: Seth puts a King on top of his hand.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: And bust. I'm sorry.
text: The patron is fuming over his loss. He slams his hand down.
speaker_heading: CASINO PATRON
dialog: Fuck! I cannot win a fucking hand

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: STEVE (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah?

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Get in here.

dialog: What kind of soda you like?
speaker_heading: CASINO PATRON
dialog: (still angry)
dialog: I don't care!

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (holding out car keys)
dialog: Here, take my car and go get Mike a
dialog: coke and a falafel. You hungry?
speaker_heading: CASINO PATRON
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Yeah, yeah... sure. Why not?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Come on, Mike. It's a roller coaster,

dialog: Alright, place your bets.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. SETH'S CASINO - NIGHT (LATER)

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: See ya guys.
speaker_heading: KID (O.S.)
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Steve walks them to the door and locks up after they leave.

scene_heading: EXT. DOOR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: He's not gonna let you in. He doesn't

speaker_heading: SETH'S POV
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: ADAM (O.S.)
dialog: This is my boy Greg.
text: The plate closes and the door swings open.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: We thought we were done for the night.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Is it too late to get a couple of hands
dialog: in?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Nah. Twenty-four/seven, you know that.
text: Steve takes their coats and hangs them in the closet.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey Steve, go grab a couple of
dialog: sandwiches.
text: Seth leads them over to the tables and discreetly puts the
text: cash away. Greg takes notice. Seth shuffled the cards.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, house rules are as follows. We
dialog: play Las Vegas with the exception of a
dialog: particular side bet. You can bet over-
text: under thirteen on the dealer's hand
text: with a loss occurring on blackjack.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: That's cute, like the green spot on a

text: Seth does not respond.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: How many idiots take that bet?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: More than you'd think.

speaker_heading: ADAM

dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You didn't say anything about the

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What were you thinking?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Five hundred Max?
text: Steve, who has just walked in with the sandwiches stops dead
text: after hearing Greg's suggestion.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: We don't usually service that level of
dialog: action here... but I'd hate to turn
dialog: away a new customer. Thing is, we may
dialog: not have enough cash here to settle you
text: at the end of the night.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: That's okay. You can pay me tomorrow.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Sure. How much you want?
text: Greg unfolds his bank roll and puts down a wad of cash.
speaker_heading: GREG
text: Five dimes.
text: Seth counts out the money on the table.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: In what denomination?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Denomination? Ummm, I'll take three
text: Puerto Ricans, two Chinks and a Guinea.
text: Adam, Steve and even Seth laugh, lightening the mood.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll let you mix it up for me.
text: Seth takes the money and pushes it into the cash box. He

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You're such a prick. Gotta make me

speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)

dialog: Look, they even say "Seth's" on 'em.
dialog: This is no joke.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I told you.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: At first we just used Bicycle poker
dialog: chips, you know, the kind you can buy
text: in a deli. Then some kids started
dialog: sneaking in additional funds.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Jesus Christ. Bet you put a stop to
dialog: that shit real quick.
text: Greg reaches over to the platter for a sandwich.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: And you pay for food and drinks for all
dialog: these kids?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I sure as hell don't cook for them.
dialog: I've already lived in four places in

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: You and me both.
speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How you doing?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I'm fine, Seth. What's on your mind?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I just feel bad about the way things

dialog: like we just don't get anywhere talking
text: at home.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (cold)
dialog: I'm not sure what there is to talk

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Why can't we just discuss this? Maybe
dialog: you're not seeing my side.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Your side? You're doing wrong. I'm
dialog: not your best friend, here to nod my
dialog: head and sympathize. That's my your
dialog: mother's racket. I'm your father. I
dialog: let you know when you screw up. Did
dialog: you think I was going to pat you on the
dialog: back for this casino idea? Tell you
dialog: what an entrepreneur you are?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: So, what do you want from me? Meeting
dialog: me in a coffee shop is not going to
dialog: change the life you have. God, if I
dialog: ever asked my father to meet me for a
dialog: cup of coffee to talk about my screw-up
dialog: he probably he probably would have
dialog: laughed. We didn't have nice little
dialog: chats about why I was a bad boy.
dialog: Whether I was just calling out for
dialog: attention or not. I got smacked and
dialog: then I didn't do it again. Much
dialog: simpler.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: Well that really worked great on me,
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Look Dad, I'm sitting here and I'm
dialog: trying to restore what's left of our

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Relationship?
dialog: What are you talking about? We're not
dialog: dating, Seth. I'm your father, not

dialog: you this crap?
speaker_heading: SETH

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTY

text: about down-the-line time.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: So I should come work for you, huh? I

dialog: taking all your money here.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: First of all, I'm not done with your

text: They're all terribly dressed. Sunday's best doesn't cut it.
text: The front door opens and Seth walks in. He wears a sharp
text: suit. He walks tall. All eyes fall on Seth, even Debbie's.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Over here.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Have they started interviewing yet?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How long do you expect the wait to be?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: You'll all be going in at the same
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I thought this was an interview.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (finding the words)
dialog: It's a group interview. You'll see.
text: She reaches under the desk and pulls out a clipboard.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Here. Fill this out. I'd say have a
text: seat, but that doesn't look like it's
dialog: going to happen.
text: Seth doesn't have a clue that she is trying to make
text: conversation with him.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That's okay.
speaker_heading: RUDE KID
dialog: Hey, when's this shit gettin' started?
text: Debbie doesn't even look up from her desk.
speaker_heading: RUDE KID (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear me?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I hear you. I'm just not answering.
speaker_heading: RUDE KID
dialog: What the fuck?
text: She sighs as if she's done talking, then...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Open your mouth again and I'll
dialog: personally guarantee you never get a
dialog: job here.
text: One of the doors of the trading room opens. Seth catches a
text: glimpse of several brokers crouched down, playing dice near
text: the far window of the trading room. The door closes in SLOW
text: MOTION as Seth cranes to get every possible view.
text: Out walks JIM YOUNG. Jim is a team leader at JT Marlin. He
text: is dressed to the T. He looks like someone not to be fucked
dialog: with.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Alright guys, come this way.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOARDROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
text: The room used mostly for interviewing and on the rare
text: occasion a meeting is needed with someone outside the firm.
text: Jim walks in to find Marc sitting at the head of the table.
text: He laughs to himself.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm sorry, but that's my seat.
speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: (scared)
dialog: Oh man, I'm so sorry.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's alright.
text: Marc JUMPS to another seat. He is chided by one of his
text: friends, the same kid who was having words with Debbie.
speaker_heading: RUDE KID
dialog: Fucking dumb-ass.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You can get the fuck out of here.
speaker_heading: RUDE KID
dialog: (terrified)
dialog: What? What?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Don't talk to me, don't look at me,
dialog: just pick your ass up out of that
dialog: Italian leather chair and get the fuck
dialog: out of this room.
text: He gets up and leaves without saying another word.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: We expect everyone here to treat their
dialog: co-workers with a certain level of
dialog: respect.
text: Everyone in the room is silent and staring at Jim.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: (calm)
dialog: Now before I get started I have a
dialog: question. Has anyone here passed the
dialog: series seven?
text: One hand goes up. It's one of the few kids who wears a good
text: suit and wasn't too worried looking in the waiting room.
speaker_heading: SERIES SEVEN
dialog: I have a series seven license.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Good for you, now you can get out too.
speaker_heading: SERIES SEVEN
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Because we don't hire brokers. We
dialog: train new ones.
text: Jim waits for him to leave the room and then calmly
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the deal. I am not here to
dialog: waste your time and I can only hope
dialog: you're not here to waste mine. So I'm
dialog: gonna keep this short. You become an
dialog: employee of this firm and you will make
dialog: your first million within three years.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: Okay? Let me repeat that. You will
dialog: make a million dollars within three
dialog: years of your first day of employment
dialog: at JT Marlin. Everybody got that?
dialog: There is no question as to whether you
dialog: will be a millionaire working at this
dialog: firm, the question is how many times
dialog: over.
text: Every kid in the room besides Seth is completely starry eyed
text: at this point. Some mouths even hang open. Seth is excited
text: too, but is smarter than the rest... he doesn't show it.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: You think I'm joking. I am not joking.
dialog: I am a millionaire. It's a weird thing
dialog: to hear, right? I'll tell you, it's a
dialog: weird thing to sa. I'm a fucking
dialog: millionaire. Now guess how old I am?
dialog: Twenty-seven. You know what that makes
dialog: me here? A fucking senior citizen.
dialog: This firm is entirely comprised of
dialog: people your age, not mine. Lucky for
dialog: me, I am very fucking good at my job or
dialog: I'd be out of one. You guys are the
dialog: new blood. You're gonna go home with
dialog: the kesef. You're the future Big-
dialog: Swinging-Dicks of this firm. Now you
dialog: all look money hungry and that's good.
dialog: Anybody who says money is the root of
dialog: all evil, doesn't have it! Money can't
dialog: buy happiness? Look at the fucking
text: smile on my face. Ear to ear, baby.
dialog: You wanna hear details? I drive a
text: Ferrari 355 cabriolet.
dialog: (throws keys on desk)
dialog: I have a ridiculous house on the South
dialog: Fork. I've got every toy you can
dialog: imagine. And best of all, kids, I am
dialog: liquid.
text: Jim takes a pause here and circles the room.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: So now that you know what's possible,
dialog: let me tell you what's required. You
dialog: are required to work your ass off. We
dialog: want winners, not pikers. A piker is
text: someone who walks at the bell. A piker
dialog: asks how much vacation time he gets in
dialog: the first year. See, people work here
dialog: to become filthy rich. No other
dialog: reason. That's it. You want vacation
dialog: time? Go teach third grade public
dialog: school.
text: Jim pours himself a glass of water from a carafe and drinks.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Your first six months at the firm are
dialog: as a trainee... you make one hundred
dialog: and fifty dollars a week. After you're
dialog: done training, you take the Series
dialog: Seven test. When you pass, you become
dialog: a junior broker and you'll be opening
dialog: accounts for your team leader. After
dialog: you open forty accounts you begin
dialog: working for yourself and then... sky's
dialog: the limit. Now a word about being a
dialog: trainee. The other brokers, your
dialog: parents, whoever: they're gonna give
dialog: you shit about it. And it's true, a
dialog: hundred and fifty a week is not a lot
dialog: of money, but pay no mind. You need to
dialog: learn the business and this is the time
dialog: to do it. Once you pass the Series
dialog: Seven none of it will matter.
text: He pauses to drink.
speaker_heading: JIM (CONT'D)
dialog: Your friends are shit. You're gonna
dialog: tell them you made twenty-five thousand
dialog: last month and they're not going to
dialog: believe you. Fuck them! Your parents
dialog: don't like the life you lead? Fuck you
dialog: Mom and Dad! As a trainee you will be
dialog: building a foundation for yourself.
dialog: Think of it as the foundation to a
dialog: building. Right? Gotta build the
dialog: foundation before you can put up your
dialog: skyscraper. You know what I built?
dialog: (takes out a model)
dialog: The fucking twin towers. Now go home
dialog: and think about whether this is for
dialog: you. If you decide it isn't, nothing
dialog: to be embarrassed about. It's not for
dialog: everyone.
dialog: But if you really want it, then give me
dialog: a call on Monday and we'll talk. Just
dialog: don't waste my time. Alright. That's
dialog: it.
text: Jim walks out of the room leaving the door open behind him.
text: No one has moved from their seat.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.

scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION AREA/JT MARLIN - MORNING
text: Seth walks in. From the look on his face alone, you can see
text: it's his first day of work. He walks past Debbie.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Hey, Seth.
text: He stares at her for a long moment. Her beauty is hitting
text: him for the first time. No idea what her name is though.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hi...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Debbie.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm so sorr...
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (all smiles)
dialog: It's okay. I never told you my name.
dialog: Besides, you looked pretty frazzled the
dialog: other day. I'd be surprised if you'd
dialog: remembered.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: First day.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: No shit?
text: Seth laughs. Likes her already. She watches him leave.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM - MORNING
text: It's 8:00 and the trading room is already packed. Seth sits
text: at his new desk with a box of cards in front of him.
text: Greg drops down in a seat next to him. He picks up the box
text: of cards and starts right in.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: These are the D&B cards. Dunn and
dialog: Bradstreet.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Good morning.
text: Greg checks his paper as he continues...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: They're the company that supply us with
dialog: our leads. Every one of these cards is
dialog: an opportunity. These are good leads.
dialog: People on these cards buy stock. Your
dialog: job is to call them and get them
dialog: interested in the firm. You're not
dialog: actually selling stock yet, but you're
dialog: selling the dream. Get 'em wet and
dialog: tell them that in a month from now a
dialog: senior broker will call them back with
dialog: one idea.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Who are these people?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Average client's forty-five years old,
dialog: from the Midwest, two hundred and fifty
dialog: thousand dollar annual income, three
dialog: million net. Has a local broker, but
dialog: loves a New York guy who sounds good on
dialog: the phone. The card's not gonna tell
dialog: you any of that. Only says their name,
dialog: address and occupation. You gotta feel
dialog: them out.
dialog: (picks up card)
dialog: Here. Peter Davis, Vice President of
dialog: Parks Telecommunications. Guy's
dialog: probably a whale. See what he's
dialog: playing with. Truth is it doesn't
dialog: matter these days. With the DOW where
dialog: it is now, everyone wants a piece of
dialog: the market. I can close anyone at any
dialog: time anywhere in the country. Just
dialog: give me a phone number.
text: JOHN FEINER, the compliance officer, walks out of Michael's
text: office. He looks at Seth as he walks by.
speaker_heading: SHERYL
dialog: Greg, I have John Duncklee on line
dialog: three.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I'm not here. After you qualify the
dialog: guy you send him a press packet. It's
dialog: all really easy and it'll get you
text: feeling comfortable on the phone, which
dialog: is key. This entire business revolves
dialog: around the phone. A good broker makes
text: over seven hundred calls a day.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What's the phone bill like here?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: This month was approaching four hundred
dialog: thousand. Now listen to me. Even
dialog: though you're not actually selling
dialog: stock yet, I want you to remember the
dialog: coda we have here. Did you see
dialog: Glengarry Glenross?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Alright then, you remember ABC?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Always be closing.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Right. Always -- Be -- Closing.
dialog: That's the attitude you need. Always
dialog: be closing Seth. Telling's not
dialog: selling. Now there's two rules you
dialog: need to know as a trainee. The rest
dialog: will come later. Number one, we do not
dialog: pitch the bitch here.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: We don't sell stock to women. I don't
dialog: care who it is, we don't do it. I'm
dialog: serious. Nancy Sinatra calls, you tell
dialog: her you're sorry. They're a constant
dialog: pain in the ass and never worth the
dialog: trouble.
dialog: They will call you every fucking day
dialog: asking you why the stock is dropping.
dialog: And God forbid the stock should go up
dialog: you'll hear from them every fifteen
dialog: minutes.
dialog: (mocking)
dialog: Is it a good time to sell? It's simply
dialog: not worth the time or effort.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay, don't pitch the bitch.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Second rule. Don't write wood. A lot
dialog: of trainee are so anxious to get off
dialog: the phone they just steamroll the guy
dialog: into getting the press pack so they can
dialog: hang up. Then I call in a month and
dialog: say, Hi, you spoke to a junior
dialog: associate of mine last month. The
dialog: guy's like, Yeah, I'm not interested.
dialog: Bye. That's a shitty lead. It's
dialog: fucking wood. The info we send is
dialog: bullshit. The important part of the
dialog: call is telling them you have that one
dialog: great idea, and that a broker is going
dialog: to call them back in a month. This
dialog: shows that we don't just fire a million
dialog: recos a day. We tell them we have six
dialog: or seven great ideas a year! They
dialog: don't want to think you're pitching
dialog: them something you read in the journal
dialog: this morning. Get it? No wood.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, I got it. Chill.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Don't even start with that shit. I'm
dialog: just telling you what your place is and
dialog: what I expect of you. I'm making your
dialog: job easier.
text: This is not the Greg that Seth remembers from the casino.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay. Well what happens if they want
dialog: to buy stock right then?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Alright, now we're talking. You should
dialog: go into every call thinking just that.
dialog: If they want a recommendation, you put
dialog: the guy on hold, you stand up, and yell
text: "RECO" at the top of your lungs. The
dialog: first senior broker to get to the phone
dialog: gets the sale.
text: Seth smiles broadly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GREG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Seth walks up the path toward Greg's house. It's a beauty.
text: The door is open and Seth slowly lets himself in. He passes
text: through the living room which as no furniture -- just
text: cardboard boxes waiting to be unpacked.
text: In the den there are 15 guys from the firm sitting on the
text: floor. They're eating pizza and drinking beer. A huge TV
text: sits against a wall, the only thing in the room besides the
dialog: pizza.
text: They are watching the movie "Wall Street".
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Seth! What's up, man? Thought you
dialog: weren't gonna make it. Sit down, grab
dialog: a slice, have a beer.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: (pointing at TV)
dialog: Shut-up, shut the fuck up, Gecko's
dialog: coming. Alright my turn.
text: The doors to Gordon Gecko's office open and Greg begins. The
text: following is intercut with scenes from the film.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell's goin' on? I'm lookin'
dialog: at two hundred shares, pal. I wanna
dialog: know if we're part of it. We better be
dialog: or I'm gonna come down and eat your
dialog: lunch for you. Back in two, Alex.
text: Richie picks it right up.
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Sorry, Jeff. Look, I loved it at
dialog: forty, it's an insult at fifty. Their
dialog: analysts? They don't know preferred
dialog: stock from livestock. Alright, we wait
dialog: till it hits south, then we, we raise
dialog: the sperm count on the deal. Get back
dialog: at ya.
text: CHRIS VARICK picks it up from there. He's also a team
text: leader; but has his shit together more tightly than the rest.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: This is the kid. Calls me fifty-nine
dialog: days in a row, wants to be a player.
dialog: Oughta be a picture of you in the
dialog: dictionary under persistence, kid.
dialog: Yeah, now listen, Jerry. I'm lookin'
dialog: for negative control. No more than
dialog: thirty, thirty-five percent. Just
dialog: enough to block anybody else's merger
text: plans and find out from the inside if
dialog: the books are cooked. Looks as good on
dialog: paper and we're in the kill zone, pal.
dialog: We'll lock and load. Lunch? Oh you
dialog: gotta be kidding. Lunch is for wimps.
dialog: Okay, Fidel, I'll talk at ya.
text: Everyone in the room says this line in unison.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: How do you do, Mr. Gecko. Bud Fox.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So you say. Nice to meet you. Hope
dialog: you're intelligent. Where'd you get
dialog: these?
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: I got a connection at the airport.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: So what's on your mind, Kimosabi? Why
dialog: am I listening to you?

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MOTHER

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Thanks Mom.
speaker_heading: MOTHER

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hi, Howard Young please. It's Seth

dialog: expecting my call. No thanks, I'll
dialog: call him back.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Okay, first of all there are going to
dialog: be a lot of those regardless of how
dialog: good you are. But you happen to suck
dialog: dick. I have this friend who runs this
dialog: other firm. He gives out this book to
dialog: all his trainees. The Rebuttal Book.
dialog: Looks like a fil-o-fax. Has those
text: index tabs but they don't say A to B to
dialog: G to H, they say things like Wife won't
dialog: let me, I'm not in the market now, Call
dialog: me back, Send me a prospectus.
dialog: Has a rebuttal for any excuse. That's
dialog: all the shit you're gonna have to learn
dialog: later. For now you only have to
dialog: remember one thing. You can be whoever
dialog: you want on the phone. So say what you
dialog: have to. Use a different name if you
dialog: want. Tell them you're a vice-
dialog: president here. Just get them on the
dialog: line. That's the first step. It's the
dialog: hardest part sometimes, but just get
text: the cocksucker on the line.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I don't understand. How can I do shit
dialog: like that? Isn't there a compliance
dialog: offer here? Isn't it...
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Illegal? No, Seth. Everyone does that
dialog: shit. Even on Wall Street. And John
dialog: over there, he works for us.
text: Greg points to John who is at a desk in the back of the room.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: He's a fucking chimp. The only
dialog: compliance work he's doing is making
dialog: sure my lunch is still hot when it gets
dialog: here. He's only here because the SEC
dialog: requires it. He might have the easiest
dialog: fucking job in the entire world. Look
dialog: at him I think he's actually
text: masturbating right now.
text: A Fed-Ex package is brought over by Debbie. She's got a few

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: And you went big too.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I did.
text: Greg opens the package and removes a good $20,000 in cash.

speaker_heading: SETH
text: After the training program's over.
dialog: They really want you to get a good idea

speaker_heading: NEIL

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I gotta ask you: how come I've never
dialog: heard of this firm?
text: The question makes Seth nervous. Familiar territory.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: They're a small firm, Dad. There's a
dialog: million others just like it that you've
dialog: never heard of either.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I guess what I'm asking is why you
dialog: didn't try and go straight to Goldman
dialog: Sachs or a company of that stature.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Marty, why are you starting?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (calm)
dialog: It's okay, Mom. The reason, Dad, is
dialog: that the larger houses don't hire kids
dialog: straight out of college unless you went
dialog: to an Ivy League school or you want to
dialog: do cash-flow analysis for the next
dialog: fifteen years. They want you to work
dialog: outside their firm for a couple of
dialog: years to get a sense of the
dialog: marketplace. That's why almost all
dialog: brokers start in small firms like JT
dialog: Marlin.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (to Mother)
dialog: See, that wasn't so bad. He answered
dialog: the question. This is good stuff,
dialog: Seth. Good stuff. So how does it feel
dialog: to have a real job?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: It feels real good, Dad.
text: Seth looks elated. There's a long content pause.
speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah, exactly. I thought it was smack,
dialog: though. You know you have got to get a
text: hold of that edge. It's kind of sharp
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (embarrassed laugh)
dialog: I know, it's true. I just got so much
dialog: shit at JT. Sometimes I have to get
text: into that mode just to fend them off.

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You could always go back to school.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You pompous ass. What makes you think
dialog: I want to? College isn't for everyone.
dialog: It's not like every black girl dreams
dialog: of being a marine-biologist her whole
dialog: life.
dialog: (dramatic)
dialog: If only she could get out of the

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hey, you don't have to tell me. I
dialog: dropped out.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Really? Now that's a surprise.
speaker_heading: SETH

dialog: hangout. Merryl Lynch, Solomon Bros,

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What do you mean by that?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Always talking about being a big
dialog: swinging dick on Wall Street. It's
dialog: funny, 'cause Long Island is as close
dialog: as they're ever going to get. But you
dialog: could be doing the real thing at a real
dialog: trading house. Instead you're here.
dialog: You don't need to be making it this
text: way. At a chop-shop.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What are you saying? JT isn't a chop-
dialog: shop. We just push the envelope a
dialog: little. I mean it's not like we do
dialog: anything illegal. We just push a
dialog: little. Same as on Wall Street.

speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Easy Richie, would you?
speaker_heading: JP BROKER

speaker_heading: GREG

speaker_heading: JP BROKER

speaker_heading: JP BROKER

speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: Yeah right. And I'm a black Negro.
speaker_heading: JP BROKER #2
dialog: I know JT. It's a fucking chop-shop.

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: My family? It's a mess.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Whose isn't?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah I guess. Well my mom's great.
dialog: Real supportive and loving. Almost to
dialog: a flaw. I can do no wrong.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Sounds terrible.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: My dad's the mess, but that's not very
dialog: interesting conversation. What about
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Mom raised me. No money. Now I'm
text: taking care of her.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Chronic pneumonia. Smoked for fifteen
dialog: years. She's been sick for a while
dialog: now. It makes her so happy that I make
dialog: this salary so I can support us. It's
dialog: a little scary.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: And your Dad?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Rather not talk about my father either.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Boy, I'm so glad we had this
dialog: conversation. I really feel like I've
dialog: gained this insight into your life.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: And me into yours.
text: They both laugh.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me something real.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What do you want to hear?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Tell me a story about your dad.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well I have so many great ones.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay. I'm ten years old. I just got
dialog: this new bike. A red Mongoose. You
dialog: know, BMX. So I'm skidding out in this
dialog: puddle -- Starsky & Hutch style. My
text: foot slips, and the pedal spins around
dialog: hard enough to break my leg. Real bad
text: too. But I don't fall off the bike. I
dialog: keep coasting down this hill. So
text: finally I get scared and I jump off.
text: Fell right behind a parked car. Laid
dialog: there for half an hour. Finally, I
dialog: hear my father screaming my name from
dialog: up the block. I was so happy that he
text: was coming to get me. He comes around
text: the car and sees me lying there.
text: There's blood everywhere and the bone
text: is sticking out straight through my
dialog: skin.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I looked up at him, and for the first
dialog: time in my life I saw how much he loved
text: me. He was frozen. It hurt him to see
dialog: me in that much pain. So he leans
text: down... and slaps me across the face.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What? Why?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I don't know. Maybe he was mad at me
dialog: for making him that helpless, or it was
dialog: the only thing he could think of. I
dialog: don't really care anymore. What I
text: remember now is the look on his face
dialog: when he first saw me. That's all I
dialog: remember. That's what I miss.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I understand. I'm real busy here
dialog: myself, Doctor. Look, we're going to
dialog: come back to you in a month with one

dialog: what we have to say, great, we'll do

speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS

speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Who is this again?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Tell me something, you're a doctor.
dialog: Have you ever heard of a drug called

dialog: MSC pharmaceuticals.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well it's in the third stage of FDA
dialog: approval right now. Word is, it's
dialog: going to get approved in the next three
dialog: months. Could be tomorrow for all I
dialog: know. Anyway, I'm getting ahead of
dialog: myself. And you're real busy over
dialog: there. Why don't I send you out the
dialog: info you requested about the firm and a
dialog: senior broker will call you next month
dialog: with that one idea.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second,
dialog: forget the info, let's talk about this
dialog: now. What was the name of the drug
dialog: again?
text: Seth begins to smile.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You know what, sir, let me pass you on
dialog: to a senior broker who's more involved
dialog: with this particular stock. Hold on a
dialog: second.
text: Seth pushes the hold button. He pauses and then YELLS:
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Reco!!
text: Everything and everyone in the room stops. There is a slight
text: pause and then CHAOS. About 20 brokers BOLT toward Seth.
text: Chris is closest. Another broker JUMPS onto the table
text: separating him from Seth and clambers over it. Chris puts on
text: the steam and gets there first. The other broker runs
text: straight into Seth, unable to stop.
text: Chris regains his composure wiping the smile off his face.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Card.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Okay, his name's Dr. Jacobs and from
dialog: the sound of it, I'd say he's
dialog: definitely...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Whoa, whoa, I don't wanna hear it, kid.
text: Chris grabs the card from his hand and looks at it briefly.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, Dr. Jacobs, this is Chris Marlin
text: over at JT Marlin.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Marlin?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Right. He's my father.
text: Another broker connects a wire to a jack on the back of the
text: phone and the conversation is now heard on the PA system.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: So my associate tells me you're
dialog: interested in one of our stocks.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Yes, MSC sounds like it might be
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Might be? Might be doesn't sell stock
text: at the rate MSC is going, Dr. Jacobs.
dialog: We're talking about very high volume
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Well, I still have to run it by my
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That's great, Doc. If you want to miss
dialog: yet another opportunity here and go
dialog: watch your colleagues get rich doing
dialog: clinical trials, then don't buy a share
text: and hang up the phone.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Well hold on a second. I didn't say
dialog: that. I just wanted to talk more about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Honestly Doc, I don't have the time.
dialog: This stock is blowing up right now.
dialog: The whole firm is going nuts. Let me
text: open the door to my office.
text: Chris holds the phone up to the 100 brokers standing there
text: silently. They begin talking loudly and screaming "Buy,
text: Sell". Chris makes a hand motion and they stop.
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You hear that? That's my trading
dialog: floor, Doc.
dialog: Now I have a million calls to make to
text: other doctors who are already in the
dialog: know. I can't walk you through this
dialog: right now. I'm sorry.
text: Huge pause. Everyone looks on waiting to hear what he'll do.
text: Chris doesn't even look mildly concerned. Then...
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Okay, okay. Let's do this.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Now, since you're a new account I
dialog: cannot go any higher than two thousand
dialog: shares. I'd love to but I just can't
dialog: do it.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Two thousand?! Whoa! That's way more
dialog: than I was thinking about. Two
dialog: thousand, Jesus.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm just curious, why can't you sell me
dialog: more than that?
text: The brokers hold in their laughter.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Well, we like to establish a
dialog: relationship with our clients on
dialog: something small before we get to the
dialog: more serious trades. Let me show you
dialog: several percentage points on this small
dialog: trade and then we'll talk about doing
dialog: future business.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: That sounds good. Give me two thousand
dialog: shares.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Done.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: You sure you can't do any better on
dialog: this one?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, I'm sorry, Dr. Jacobs.
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: Alright, let's start with this trade
dialog: then.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Great. I promise we'll go big on the
dialog: next one.
dialog: (feigns masturbation)
dialog: Now do you want the confirmation sent
dialog: to your office or your mansion?
speaker_heading: DR. JACOBS
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Very funny, Mr. Marlin.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Alright, let me put my secretary on.
dialog: She'll take your info.
text: Chris hits the hold button and then...
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Done and done.

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I love doctors, man. All that money
text: and not a clue what to do with it.
dialog: Fucking rollovers. Hold onto your
dialog: ankles, Doc, here comes the love.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Why'd you put a max on his buy?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Didn't you tell him how it works?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: He's still a trainee. He doesn't need
dialog: to know about initial sell limits.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Right, right. Make sure he shows you
text: the ropes. He's too busy calling his
dialog: bookie. You fucking Hebrews, man.
dialog: Always looking out for yourselves,
dialog: never the trainees.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: That's great. Why don't you go back to
dialog: little Italy now?
text: Greg points across the room.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why don't you go make a latke dreidel
dialog: boy.
dialog: (back to Seth)
dialog: The reason I capped him is in case he's
dialog: a piker. See, we're going to go ahead
dialog: and front the money for this sale.
dialog: If he doesn't send the check, I'm the
text: one holding the bag.
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Last commission month a kid on Jim's
dialog: team wrote a million dollar ticket.
dialog: Stock was down three and a half points
dialog: by settlement. Fucking kid took a one
dialog: quarter million dollar hit. Besides,
dialog: first sale just whets the appetite. If
text: he's a whale, which it looks like he
dialog: is, then I'll get him on a day when
dialog: there's a real rip.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Rip?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Rip. Commission. That's why we work
dialog: here. We get huge rips.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I actually still don't know how it
dialog: works.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: A two dollar rip, which is unheard of
dialog: anywhere on Wall Street, means you're
dialog: walking away with two dollars for every
dialog: share you sell. Real money. Jesus
dialog: Greg, you tell him where the bathroom
dialog: is yet?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Seth, I showed you where Chris' desk
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: How does Michael afford that?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I don't know, but if he's doing it,
dialog: he's making money on it. Point is,
dialog: don't worry about selling small on the
dialog: first trade. You service the client
dialog: right and he'll be back for more. Bide
dialog: your time. Show him a three percent
dialog: return and he'll trust you to watch his
dialog: kids for the weekend. If he's serviced
dialog: correctly it's not a matter of whether
dialog: he's making a second trade with you,
dialog: it's a matter of how much.

dialog: know what your financial situation is
dialog: like right now but you need to buy at
dialog: least one decent suit. There is a
dialog: minimum level of aesthetic
dialog: professionalism that we have here. In
dialog: a couple of months you'll be able to
dialog: outfit your whole closet, but for now
dialog: just get something to hold you over.
dialog: There's an important phrase that we use
dialog: here and I think it's time you all
dialog: learned it. "Act as if". Do you
dialog: understand what that means? Act as if
dialog: you are the fucking president of this
dialog: firm. Act as if you have a nine inch
dialog: cock. Act as if. To do this properly
dialog: you need to at least look the part. So
dialog: go get dressed. Secondly, it's time to
dialog: get your Series Seven books. No need
dialog: to get nervous. If you study you'll
dialog: pass. Then you begin trading as an SEC
dialog: licensed broker. Then you're a fucking
dialog: millionaire. It's that simple. I need
dialog: three hundred from each of you for the
dialog: books which will be returned if and
dialog: when you pass the exam. And I'll need
dialog: that tomorrow.

speaker_heading: MARC
dialog: I'll just ask my mom.
speaker_heading: TRAINEE 2
dialog: Yeah, I'll have to do the same thing.
text: Others are discussing where they will come up with the money
text: as the meeting comes to a close. Jim gets up from his chair.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Okay then.
text: Seth is already up and walking towards Jim. He takes out a
text: roll of cash from his breast pocket and peels off three
text: hundred dollar bills in front of Jim. He looks proud doing
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Here you go.
text: All the other trainees stare.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: What are you, last night's erection?
speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Go ahead do it. Just try it, you'll
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Yeah. You're gonna feel so much

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Bob, be rude, be rude. Hang up the
dialog: phone.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: You won't. You wanna know why?
dialog: Because you see value! I'm money in
dialog: the bank. I'm your kid's college fund
dialog: for Christ's sake. That's great. If
text: we were looking at a long stock over a
dialog: long term period I'd be talking about
dialog: PE ratios and earnings with you right
dialog: now. The fact is, I'm not looking to
dialog: marry the stock. We're in, we're out,
dialog: three, four weeks. Look, I'm not a

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Listen, if you couldn't pull three

scene_heading: INT. BOILER ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Holy shit.
text: He had the different contracts lined up next to each other
dialog: and is comparing the names listed from the private equity
dialog: source. They're the same on every prospectus.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Christ, they're all the same.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What's the name?
text: Seth almost JUMPS out of his seat. Debbie is standing

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Shit. You scared me. How long have
dialog: you been standing there?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I just walked up now. I'm sorry.
text: Seth tries to hide the contracts under some papers.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Interesting reading?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: This? It's just the prospectus from
dialog: the last IPO the firm put out.
text: She walks around and puts her hands on his shoulders. She
text: doesn't seem to care. He looks pretty nervous.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I know what it is. I asked you if it
dialog: was interesting. You may be the first
dialog: person to ever read a JT prospectus.
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Some chocolate love. Should I practice
dialog: my pitch? I know it turns you on.
text: She smiles widely as she sits on the desk facing him, her

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Yeah. He was in the back late at

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Did he see you?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What's going on over there?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: What do you mean? You know what's
text: going on.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You think they're doing a lot of
dialog: illegal shit?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Come on, Seth, you can't have it both
dialog: ways. You say you like the hard sell
dialog: and the money but then you question it
dialog: when you see something that's a bit
dialog: off. Either admit that it's not
dialog: charity work and enjoy, or get out.
dialog: But going back and forth like this is
dialog: just tearing you up.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.

speaker_heading: SETH

dialog: you want. But I'll tell you this. I'm

dialog: You call me when the stock doubles.

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Seth just closed this guy for ten

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey Seth, get over here.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Hey Greg, I just closed this huge
dialog: account for you.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What the fuck are you doing? You just
dialog: violated a huge SEC regulation. Who
dialog: told you to start closing accounts.
dialog: You're a fucking trainee.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You're kidding right? You're not? You
dialog: told me I could use a different name on
dialog: the phone. Act as if! I figured I'd
dialog: take the initiative and make you some
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Greg, I was standing right next to him
dialog: the whole time. I would have stepped
dialog: right in if the kid got into trouble.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey! You got a conoli you can stick in
dialog: your mouth.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No. You got a menorah you can shove in
dialog: your ass?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: I don't care about the money, Seth.
dialog: Imagine if every trainee started
dialog: handling their own recos. This shop
dialog: would be closed in about a week.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: This is about something else. Isn't
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What would that be?
text: Greg turns around to see Debbie.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't you have to answer the phones or

speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll finish this later.
text: He walks toward the office when Jim steps out for a moment.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Hey Seth. You just earned a spot pal.
dialog: Get in here.
text: Greg is fuming but has to hide it. He pats Seth on the back.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Big time baby. We'll get to see if
dialog: you're as good as you say you are. It
dialog: gets pretty fucking hectic in there,
dialog: little man.
text: Seth walks toward the office. Greg stays behind.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck was that? Don't tell me

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm not interested.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Okay. I'm sorry to have bothered you.
dialog: Have a nice day.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: That's it? That's your pitch? You
dialog: consider that a sales call??!
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Well, ummm...
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You want to sell me a paper right?
dialog: Well you guys call me every Saturday
dialog: and I get the same half-assed attempt.

speaker_heading: SALESMAN

dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: SETH

speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: It's not what I want, sir... it's what
dialog: you want.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Alright, now you're talking. What are
dialog: you selling?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: I'm offering you a subscription to the

dialog: price. We're trying to reach out to
dialog: people that have never had home
dialog: delivery before.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: So, everyone else that already has a
dialog: subscription is getting fucked on this
dialog: one huh?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: ...Yeah, I guess so.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Good, I can live with that. Now why do
dialog: I want your paper? Maybe I should get
dialog: the Times or the Voice.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Well the Village Voice is free, sir, so
dialog: if you want it you should certainly
dialog: pick it up. But the Daily News offers
dialog: you something no other paper can, a
dialog: real taste of New York. We have some
dialog: writers on staff that have been with us
dialog: for over fifteen years. We have the
dialog: best features! More photographs than
dialog: any other daily in New York! And we
dialog: have the most reliable delivery in the
dialog: city! Now what do you think??!!
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Alright, Ron. Now that was a sales
dialog: call. Good job!
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: So are you going to buy a subscription?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No. I already get the Times.

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well, I was thinking that we should go

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Nah, I'm okay. Hey let me ask you
dialog: something, Chris. Do you ever wonder
dialog: how we get the rips that we do? I mean
dialog: how is it that we get rips that pay out
dialog: ten times the amount of any major firm?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Are you kidding me? That's the wrong
dialog: question to be asking. Who cares how.
dialog: The only thing you should be wondering
dialog: about is how you're gonna get laid
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm serious. Did you know that SEC
dialog: regulations state that a maximum rip
dialog: allowed is five percent of the sale.
dialog: We're making four times that.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What are you doing, Seth? Aren't you
dialog: happy with the way things are going?

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It's true. It don't matter if it's the

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I remember when I was cold calling, the
dialog: shit I'd do. I'd get on the phone and
dialog: say, Can I speak to Jim? Secretary's

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well I don't know about playing. I do
dialog: own some blue chips. They were
dialog: actually wedding gifts from our friends
dialog: in New York.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well, I'm calling to tell you about an
dialog: explosive situation we have going on
dialog: right now. A pharmaceutical company,
dialog: Farrow Tech has a drug called Parattin
text: in the third stage of FDA approval.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What does it do?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Good question, Harry. Good question.
dialog: This is the best part. It helps
dialog: premature babies develop properly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sound like a great drug.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: It is. Tell me, those Blue Chips you
dialog: own, what have they done for you since
dialog: you got married?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Not much really.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well you see, we deal in stocks that
dialog: really move.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Oh yeah, they really move.
text: Seth kicks his chair hard enough to send him rolling.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I would love to show you what I mean
dialog: and I can do so on a relatively small
dialog: investment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I really can't buy anything right now,
dialog: Seth. My wife and I are buying a house
dialog: this month and we're saving every last
dialog: penny.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Look, I don't care how much stock you
dialog: pick up. I just want you to test me
dialog: out. Harry, I want you to judge me on
dialog: the percentages I show you. Obviously I
dialog: show you thirty or forty percent, no
dialog: matter how big or small your position
dialog: is you're gonna get pretty excited
dialog: about my next idea, right?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well yeah.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Of course you would. You'd be handing
dialog: out my business cards, wouldn't you?
text: Harry laughs.
speaker_heading: SETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Pick up one hundred shares. It's the
dialog: absolute firm minimum. Okay, if I show
dialog: you three or four points on the trade
dialog: it's not going to make you rich. On
dialog: the same token, if the stock doesn't go
dialog: anywhere you're not out in front of
dialog: your store with a cup in your hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: No, that's true.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: (serious)
dialog: Look Harry, the truth is I could sell
dialog: you a lot more than one hundred shares
dialog: and feel completely comfortable about
dialog: the trade, but I'm asking you to start
dialog: small just to prove what I can do for
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Great! Should I send the confirmation
dialog: to your business or your home?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well I just have to talk to my wife
dialog: first. Then I'll call you right back.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: You don't have to do that, Harry. And
dialog: I going to lunch in five minutes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: No. I have to talk to her first.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I have to ask you something here,
dialog: Harry. You're at work now, aren't you?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Well what do you do, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm the purchasing manager for a
dialog: gourmet foods company.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Does part of your job involve making
dialog: decisions?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well of course.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Alright, well when you make one of
dialog: these decisions do you call your wife
dialog: to ask her what you should do?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (a little annoyed)
dialog: No, of course not. But that's a little
dialog: bit...
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Different? How? It's your money, you
dialog: earned it. Besides, all you're doing
dialog: is investing it. I'm not selling crack
dialog: here, Harry. I mean she's only going
dialog: to be happy when she sees you've made a
dialog: wise investment for the family. Just
dialog: think of the flip side.
dialog: When your wife does the shopping does
dialog: she call you from Pathmark to ask you
dialog: if she can use the coupons for Captain
dialog: Crunch?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Come on, that's not fair.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm just trying to make a point here,
dialog: Harry. We're not talking about a lot
dialog: of money. Just think what she's going
dialog: to say when you bring her back a big
dialog: fat check because you had the foresight
dialog: to see a good thing coming.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Alright, let's try it.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How's everybody doing?

speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Good to hear. First thing, I wanted to

speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This month is going to be bigger. It's
dialog: actually going to be the biggest month
dialog: we've ever had. We've got a new issue
dialog: I want to talk to you about. It's
dialog: called Med Patent. They've just
dialog: designed the world's first retractable
dialog: syringe. This means that doctors and
dialog: nurses will never again have to worry
dialog: about infection from dirty needles.
dialog: This is not going to be an alternative
dialog: in the medical world, it's going to be
dialog: the standard. We all know we're here
dialog: to make money, but if we can do
dialog: something good like this, then all the
dialog: better. So I want you all to go out
dialog: and buy yourselves a new car, or a
dialog: house. Whatever you want. Go into
dialog: debt. You will make a million inside
dialog: of six months.
text: The place goes wild.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (CONT'D)

dialog: Do you know how happy that shit makes

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: But it's all based on this fucking job.
dialog: This very legitimate respectable job.
text: A job he can tell his friends about
dialog: during the Yom Kippur appeal. And it's
dialog: all bullshit.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Then you'll quit. You'll tell him what
dialog: was happening and he'll respect you for
text: walking away.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I can't do that! I've invested too
dialog: much time and energy.
text: Seth takes a deep breath here and stares at Debbie.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Talk to me, Seth.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I figured out how Michael's making his
dialog: money. I almost wish I hadn't; because
dialog: it's all illegal.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: It really is, huh? Well we knew it was
dialog: shady. So how's he doing it?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: It's called bridge financing. It's so
text: simple. A group of investors make a
dialog: loan to a private company. Let's say
dialog: for three million. After the company
dialog: gets taken public they pay back a
dialog: million in cash and the other two they
dialog: pay back in common stock, but at the
dialog: IPO price. So the investors basically
dialog: get two million worth of IPO stock.
dialog: Then they can sell it on the open
dialog: market at triple what they bought it
dialog: for. Now that's actually all legal as
dialog: long as the investors are not tied to
text: the brokerage house. But Michael's
dialog: friends are the investors on every IPO
dialog: we do.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: That's why all the names were the same
dialog: on the contracts.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Right. Then he has us push it all on
dialog: the open market. We're selling
dialog: Michael's shares. That's where the two
dialog: dollar rips come in. He can afford to
dialog: pay us that much. He's still in an
dialog: obscene profit margin. It's to his
dialog: advantage to give us those rips. He
dialog: has to motivate us to push these
dialog: stocks. He depends on us to literally
dialog: create the market. It's all artificial
dialog: demand. There's no other firm selling
dialog: this shit. That's why he's always
dialog: telling us to go into debt. He wants
dialog: us hungry. Then as soon as we sell off
dialog: Michael's position there's no need to
dialog: maintain the inflated price anymore.
text: We stop pushing it and it crashes. And
dialog: get this. The last IPO, Med Patent,
dialog: it's cardboard. No research and
dialog: development, no employees, not even a
dialog: fucking building. Annual reports are
dialog: all bullshit. Michael manufactures
dialog: them. Med Patent doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Jesus Christ, Seth. Now what?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Now? I don't know. Maybe now I go do
dialog: it for myself.

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: What the fuck do you want from me? I'm
dialog: not you, Seth. I'm not going to kill

dialog: money and it sucks.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What? It's my business. I created it,
dialog: remember? You used to make ten dollars
dialog: an hour. Now you're pulling in a
dialog: thousand a week. And you're still not
dialog: happy? What the fuck is that? And you
dialog: still haven't answered me as to why
dialog: profits are down this much. What's
dialog: going on, Jeff?!
speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Nothing, you can check the tapes.
speaker_heading: SETH

dialog: skimming, Jeff?
speaker_heading: JEFF

dialog: I remember this guy once called me to

text: started asking him buying questions.
dialog: Like, what's the firm minimum? That's
text: a buying question. I ask a question
dialog: like that, he should take me down.
dialog: It's not like I asked him what his 800

dialog: question. I was giving him a run but
dialog: he blew it. To a question like, What's
dialog: the firm minimum the answer is zero!
dialog: You don't like the idea, don't pick up

dialog: me...
dialog: (mocking)

dialog: answer! You have to learn how to

dialog: push. Keep asking questions. Ask
dialog: rhetorical ones just to get a yes out
dialog: of them. If you were drowning and I
dialog: threw you a life jacket would you grab
dialog: it? Yes? Good. Pick up two hundred
dialog: shares, I won't let you down. Ask a
dialog: guy if he'll let you down.
dialog: Ask a guy if he'll be happy to see

dialog: tomorrow, that's bullshit! Anybody
dialog: says they got money problems about two

dialog: I say to that? Tell me you don't like
dialog: my idea, tell me you don't like my

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now how many more accounts do you owe
dialog: Greg?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So you'll be out of Greg's reach in a

dialog: you're on your own. You're gonna make
dialog: a lot of money after that. A lot of
dialog: money, Seth. Just don't fuck it up now
dialog: 'cause you're pissed at Greg. Got it?

dialog: twenty, right?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Right, and it's still going there,
text: probably even higher now. This doesn't
dialog: change anything except that you're

dialog: before. Look Harry, I liked it at
dialog: eight, I love it at four. It's an
dialog: average down for you.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Dollar cost averaging. If you own a
dialog: hundred shares at ten dollars and now
dialog: you buy another one hundred at five,
dialog: that's a F200 shares at $7.50 a share.
dialog: Your cost basis is lower. Now if I get
dialog: you involved at ten and take you out at
dialog: fifteen, you've made how many points
dialog: Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Five.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Exactly. But if I get you involved at

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I lose my judgeship just going along
dialog: for the ride.
speaker_heading: TRUE
dialog: I've got nothing to do with that.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Sure you do. You're gonna release that

dialog: much more glamorous with the
dialog: involvement of a Federal judge.
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: No deal.
speaker_heading: TRUE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: Take my father out the back door right
dialog: now and bring him home. He has nothing
dialog: to do with this case at all. If his
dialog: name shows up in one newspaper, I don't
dialog: testify. And I mean that. For me,
dialog: it'd be worth going to jail for.
speaker_heading: TRUE
dialog: You're serious?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: TRUE
dialog: I think you're nuts. You want to do it

speaker_heading: TRUE
dialog: Alright, alright, alright. Before we
dialog: start dealing here, just what are you
dialog: offering?
speaker_heading: SETH
dialog: I'm gonna hand you this case on a
dialog: silver fucking platter. I know
dialog: everything you don't. I know how it
dialog: all works. How Michael makes his
dialog: money, where it goes, and who's getting
dialog: it. Now what happens tomorrow?
speaker_heading: TRUE
dialog: You go back to work tomorrow like
dialog: nothing happened. Just for one day. I
dialog: need your client book and your whole C-
dialog: drive backed up onto floppy. But don't
dialog: get any stupid inclinations to travel
dialog: abroad. We know where your father
dialog: lives. You're going away, kid.

dialog: to know something.

speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Not a single day of my life has gone by
dialog: where I do not think about that moment,

dialog: one more chance. If I could take back
dialog: just one thing in my life, Seth, do one
