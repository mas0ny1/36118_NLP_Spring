text: one has the balls to sit them down and
dialog: say, "Look, just cut the shit."But

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't
dialog: tell that you didn't have one on!
dialog: Obviously, I was drunk!
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Was your vagina drunk? Did you think
dialog: it's the thinnest condom on earth I
dialog: have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I
dialog: made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed

dialog: fuck?!
speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: You are unbelievable.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Are you really?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No. It actually kind of makes sense

speaker_heading: ALISON
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and

speaker_heading: ALISON

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I should get going. I'm supposed to

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's true.
speaker_heading: PETE

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: How is this worse?
speaker_heading: DEBBIE

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look, the reason I make that up is
dialog: because if I told you what I was

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
