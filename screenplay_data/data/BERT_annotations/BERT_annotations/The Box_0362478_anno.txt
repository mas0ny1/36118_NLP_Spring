speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Should I close my eyes?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR

text: to a stop.
speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Why do they call it an owl pellet?
text: A MALE STUDENT ( 12) next to him takes his tray from Norma.

speaker_heading: NORMA (CONT-D)
text: Grey forest owls feed upon field

scene_heading: INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MEDIA ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Arthur eases his way into the small, crowded AUDITORIUM that
text: serves as a MEDIA ROOM. A PRESS CONFERENCE is underway.
scene_heading: NORM CAHILL ( 40s), the VIKING PROJECT COORDINATOR, is

text: with maps and various schematics projected from it onto a
scene_heading: LARGE SCREEN.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: It's been five months since the
text: Viking lander touched down on the
dialog: surface of Mars. We've seen dozens
dialog: of photographs of the rock covered
dialog: surface... what can you now tell us
dialog: about the tests you've been

text: Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium.
speaker_heading: CAHILL
dialog: Well... there are three separate
dialog: tests that we've been conducting...
dialog: Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release

speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: Are you showing us all of the
dialog: photos? Are there little green men
dialog: up there?
text: Laughter from the press.
speaker_heading: CAHILL
dialog: Well... there is a possibility that
dialog: the planet abounds with chemical
dialog: compounds produced by living
dialog: systems. Their chemical nature,
dialog: distribution and structural
dialog: uniqueness could be used to argue
dialog: the presence of microscopic living
dialog: organisms on Mars.
text: As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the
text: reporter on the shoulder.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
text: It all comes down to water.
text: Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia
text: Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity
text: of the site where VIKING II landed.
text: There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT-D)
dialog: If we find water beneath the
dialog: surface... and the topographic maps
dialog: of Utopia Planitia indicate that
dialog: there were once rivers on the
dialog: surface of the planet, it's
dialog: possible that we'll eventually find
text: evidence of life.

scene_heading: INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The OWL PELLET FILM is underway. Norma sits in the back of

scene_heading: INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CAHILL'S OFFICE -- MORNING
text: Arthur now sits across from Cahill in his office. Behind him
text: is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory.
speaker_heading: CAHILL

speaker_heading: WENDELL

dialog: that smell?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It's a salinic compound.
speaker_heading: WENDELL
dialog: What are you making?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Christmas present for Norma.

text: of the foot is round and missing its toes, save for the PINKY
speaker_heading: TOE.
speaker_heading: WENDELL
dialog: A new prosthesis for her foot?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yep.

speaker_heading: CHARLES
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: My friend... she saw you take your

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Well... it's a long story.
text: She looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: NORMA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: NORMA (CONT'D)
dialog: So they have to amputate four of my
dialog: toes. And then they had to take a
dialog: bunch of skin from my inner thigh
dialog: to cover the front of my foot. This

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON
dialog: My name is Arlington Steward.

text: Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone
text: to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and
text: GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is
dialog: supposed to conceal them.
text: Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON (CONT-D)
dialog: I assume you received the box that

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON

speaker_heading: NORMA

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON

speaker_heading: NORMA

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON
dialog: Well... in a way, yes. I do have an

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the key that opens the

text: Norma just stares at him.

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: The money will be delivered to you
dialog: in cash.
text: Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Are you for real?
text: Arlington smiles back at her.
speaker_heading: ARLINGTON
dialog: Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that
dialog: the offer is real.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Who do you work for?
speaker_heading: ARLINGTON
dialog: The guarantee of payment has

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Two... if you discuss the details

dialog: to retrieve the button unit from
dialog: you. It will be re-programmed and
dialog: the offer will be made to someone
dialog: else.
text: Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it
text: with crisp precision, and hands it over to her.
text: He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave.
speaker_heading: ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Until then... a good day to you,
dialog: Mrs. Lewis.
text: He nods his head and turns toward the foyer.
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

speaker_heading: NORMA

speaker_heading: (BAFFLED)

speaker_heading: ARLINGTON
dialog: My name is Arlington Steward, and I
dialog: can assure you that this is no
dialog: joke. The offer is real, but I am
dialog: not at liberty to disclose any more

text: He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her.
speaker_heading: ARLINGTON (CONT'D)

text: in an embossed BLACK FONT:
scene_heading: ARLINGTON STEWARD

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: I think maybe he's a life insurance

speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Pretty damn sad... losing the legs
dialog: that way, but I always thought it
dialog: was Karmic retribution for what I
dialog: did to Norma.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What'd you ever do to Norma?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I dropped that barbell on her foot
dialog: when we were kids. That's why she
dialog: went to get that x-ray. If it
dialog: wasn't for me... she'd still have
dialog: all her toes.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You can't think of it that way.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Why not? It's the truth.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You didn't leave the x-ray machine
dialog: on, Dr. Stupid did.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Yeah, but my mistake sent her to
dialog: Dr. Stupid... so that makes me
text: culpable in the eyes of Buddha.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: You're no more culpable than the
dialog: company that manufactured the
dialog: barbell. Stop punishing yourself.
text: Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack

speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: You know he's here.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: NATHAN

text: Nathan nods his head across the room... where DR. EARL STUPE
text: ( 50s) is seated at a table with his wife.
speaker_heading: NATHAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Dr. Earl Stupe. He's still got a
text: practice over on the west end.
text: Arthur looks over at him... for a moment they make brief eye
text: contact... and Stupe quickly looks away.
scene_heading: INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NEXT
text: Susan is now staring at Dr. Stupe. They are joined by DEBORAH
text: BURNS (24), Norma's younger sister and bride-to-be.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm sure he does.
speaker_heading: DEBORAH
dialog: I can't believe they still let him
dialog: practice medicine.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: You gotta let it go. You gotta
dialog: learn to forgive and forget.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'd be willing to forgive him if he
dialog: would've just admitted his
dialog: negligence under oath. The bastard
dialog: lied... said it was the x-ray
text: machine that malfunctioned.
text: SENATOR GRIFFITH POWELL (50s) and his son EDWARD POWELL
text: ( 20s), approach. Edward is the husband-to-be.
speaker_heading: SUSAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well Senator! You look very spiffy
dialog: tonight!
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Now that the mid-term elections are
dialog: over... the smile lines are
text: starting to fade.
text: Powell puts on a fake smile, grabs Jim's hand and they both
text: wave... poking fun at politician behavior.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well... we all voted!
text: Powell looks over at Norma.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: Norma... right?
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: That's right.
text: He shakes her hand... fascinated by her.
speaker_heading: POWELL
dialog: And you're married to the aspiring

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: That's right. There he is right
dialog: over there.
text: She points over to Arthur the bar. Powell looks over at

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: WALTER

speaker_heading: DANA

scene_heading: INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- BASEMENT -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Dana and Walter come down the stairs into the BASEMENT of the

speaker_heading: of MARS.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Is that Mars?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Yep.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog:

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: What did your dad have to do with
dialog: the Viking?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: He helped design the camera.
text: Walter points to a PLASTIC PROTOTYPE MODEL of the VIKING
text: LANDER mounted on a third WORK BENCH at the end of the room.
text: A model of the MARS SURFACE has been re-created and painted
text: with exacting detail.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's making the model for the
dialog: science museum.
text: Walter points to one of TWO CAMERAS mounted on the front of
text: the SPIDER-SHAPED LANDING MODULE. The camera is cylindrical
text: and features a VERTICAL SLOT on the front.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: They designed the camera to
text: photograph in 360 degrees. It scans
text: in the image one line at a time...
dialog: and takes about five minutes to
dialog: complete one revolution.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: How do they get the images back to
dialog: earth?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Radio transmission. They figured
dialog: out a way to interpret the scan
dialog: lines and then print them onto
dialog: film.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: How long does it take to transmit
dialog: back to earth?
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: About ten hours.
text: Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT
text: PAGE from September with a large image of MARS on it.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: They tested the camera in the
dialog: parking lot at Langley last year.
text: Walter points to another FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. In
text: the black &amp; white photograph, we see a group of FIFTY NASA
text: EMPLOYEES assembled in a long line in a PARKING LOT.
text: Walter points to his father standing in the group.
dialog:

speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: There's my dad.

speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
text: And there he is again.
text: Walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of
text: the photo... ARTHUR LEWIS appears for a third time.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
text: And there he is again.
text: Dana looks close at the photo.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: How'd he do that?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Because the camera takes five
text: minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he
text: waited until the camera passed over
text: him then jumped ahead in the
dialog: circle.
text: The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD
text: VERSION of ARTHUR LEWIS.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Your dad sounds pretty clever.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My dad is more than just clever,
dialog: Dana. My dad is the coolest man who
dialog: ever walked the face of the earth.
text: The CAMERA ZOOMS in close to Arthur's face... then tips down
text: to another MAN kneeling on the pavement directly below him.
text: It is ARLINGTON STEWARD... smiling at the camera. His face is

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: We could get out of Richmond...

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Then we could cross the border into

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: You can't arrest someone for

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What if it's someone's baby?
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: What if it's some murderer on death

speaker_heading: NORMA

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Can you turn off the Christmas tree

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I like leaving them on.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: It's a fire hazard.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: It keeps the Christmas spirit alive

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: We could die.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
text: Everyone dies eventually, Norma.
text: She stares at the tree.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Fine. Leave them on.
text: She goes upstairs... leaving him alone with the glowing tree.
text: Arthur looks down at the coffee table. The box sits there...

text: He then walks over to the wall and unplugs the Christmas tree
dialog: lights.
scene_heading: INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

speaker_heading: NORMA (CONT`D)

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: A psychological test. They want to

dialog: Well... I have met the lord. I have

scene_heading: EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT

text: There are more than a dozen POLICE CARS parked in front,
text: along with..several BLACK SEDANS and MILITARY VEHICLES.
text: Arthur hears the rumble of a HELICOPTER circling the sky

text: In front of the diner entrance... more than a DOZEN MEN
text: operate VIDEO CAMERAS and STILL CAMERAS mounted on tripods,
text: all pointed toward the front window of the diner.
text: Teague is standing with Cahill and Reston, along with several

text: Reston tries to comfort them with a smile.
speaker_heading: RESTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Take a walk with us.
text: Norma and Arthur begin to walk with Reston, Teague and Cahill
text: toward the diner entrance.
speaker_heading: RESTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you familiar with the myth of
dialog: Prometheus?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: In the 1940s... when NASA was
dialog: formed, we began developing, in
dialog: secret, a project that we dubbed
dialog: the Prometheus Effect.
speaker_heading: TEAGUE
dialog: Projecting fictional scenarios
dialog: about how we would respond, if and
dialog: when we came into contact with an
dialog: alien intelligence.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: If the intelligence had hostile
dialog: intent... or if it began to somehow
dialog: display proof of its ability to
dialog: destroy us, we would have a system
dialog: in place to begin negotiating with
text: it in secret.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: TEAGUE
dialog: The goal of Prometheus is to
dialog: maintain coexistence with this life-
dialog: form, and eventually achieve peace
dialog: with it, so that its power can be
dialog: harnessed, developed and applied in
dialog: such a manner that will benefit the
dialog: human race.
text: Arthur notices that Cahill is holding a folder in his right
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: CAHILL
dialog: On the night of September 3rd, as
dialog: the server was downloading images
dialog: from the Viking camera system that
dialog: you helped design... we experienced
text: an electrical surge from a bolt of
dialog: lightning.
text: As they arrive at the entrance to the diner, Cahill shows
text: Arthur a blurry black and white photograph.
speaker_heading: CAHILL (CONT'D)
text: An anomaly in the series of Viking
dialog: images produced this photograph of
dialog: the Mars surface.
text: The photo appears to be a ghost-like TRAIL OF WHITE LIGHT
text: streaking across the martian landscape.
text: Teague nods toward the diner window.
speaker_heading: TEAGUE
dialog: According to... it... and whatever
dialog: it is...
text: Arthur notices Arlington sitting alone in a booth inside the
dialog: diner... waiting...
speaker_heading: TEAGUE (CONT'D)
dialog: A ghost... an apparition... a
text: methane compound imbedded in pulse
dialog: of electricity...
speaker_heading: CAHILL
dialog: If the human spirit is assigned a
dialog: specific bandwidth upon
dialog: conception... twins... would
dialog: provide it with a dual bandwidth
dialog: carrier...
speaker_heading: RESTON
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: It claims to be more than six

speaker_heading: J
text: Arthur stares at the streak of white light in the photo.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: My camera... took this photo...
speaker_heading: CAHILL
dialog: We've run the data sequence off the
dialog: server more than a thousand times.
dialog: Each time... this one photo in the
text: sequence comes out of the dark room
dialog: just like this. We can't explain
dialog: why.
text: Arthur hands the photo back to Cahill.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: What does it want?
text: Cahill glances at Teague... who looks to Cahill.
speaker_heading: CAHILL
dialog: I think the same thing that it
dialog: wanted from Bevilacqua... except
dialog: that poor boy is no longer around
dialog: to tell us why he shot his wife.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: What did he say to you when you
dialog: were in the car with him?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Something about breaking the chain.
dialog: He wanted to find the next test
dialog: subject... and prevent them from
text: pushing the button.
text: Cahill is writing diligently on his NOTE PAD.
text: Reston can now feel something taking control of him... he
text: looks to Teague... terrified.
text: He closes his eyes... his body begins to twitch.
text: Teague stares at his friend... realizing what is happening.
text: Reston opens his eyes... now possessed... blood draining from
text: his ears.
speaker_heading: RESTON
dialog: General Teague... it's a pleasure
dialog: to meet you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I would like to continue with my
dialog: experiment... if you don't mind.
text: Reston smiles at the General.

speaker_heading: RESTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Please do not interfere... as I
dialog: assure you that if you do... there
dialog: will be dire consequences...
text: Reston then turns to face Arthur and Norma.
speaker_heading: RESTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Time is of the essence... and I'd
dialog: like to invite my guests inside.
text: Reston opens the door to the diner and gestures to Arthur and
dialog: Norma for them to come inside.
scene_heading: INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT
text: Arthur, Norma and Reston make their way down the long aisle
text: of the diner, flanked by a row of booths, across from a long
text: LUNCH COUNTER with a metal surface.
text: Arlington sits alone in a booth. He pivots his head around to
dialog: face them.
speaker_heading: ARLINGTON
dialog: Please have a seat.
text: Reston sits down next to his twin brother... Arthur and Norma
text: sit down across from the twins.
text: Arlington has now locked completely into his brother's
dialog: spirit...
text: The movement of the two men is in now in PERFECT
text: SYNCHRONICITY, staggered by exactly one second... Reston
text: following Arlington.
text: Arlington's eyes remain closed in deep concentration...
text: Arlington's lips move silently... and Reston repeats them out
text: loud. Reston's demeanor is now kind... gentle... almost
text: apologetic for his past behavior.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: Don't be frightened by my manner of
dialog: communication... but it is becoming
dialog: more difficult for me to speak,
dialog: given my body's... condition.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: What have you done with our son?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: We'll get to him in a moment... but
dialog: first I want you to know that I
dialog: have a deep respect and admiration
dialog: you both, and I am very sorry...
dialog: that you pushed the button.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT
text: Bud now has Walter laid out on the cement next the edge of
text: the SWIMMING POOL at the shallow end. The boy is

text: From across the pool... Dana is squatting on the end of the
text: DIVING BOARD... watching them.
text: Bud then removes Walter's right shoe and sock... exposing his
text: bare foot. He then retrieves a SERRATED HUNTING KNIFE... and
text: cuts in the flesh from his BIG TOE across the ball of his
dialog: foot... drawing blood.
scene_heading: INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT
text: Reston closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them...
text: tears have begun to form, as though he cannot bear the news
text: that his brother is forcing him to deliver.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: I will now give you a chance to
dialog: save yourselves... an opportunity
dialog: for redemption and salvation.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT
text: Bud is now carrying the unconscious Walter in his arms. He
text: steps into the shallow end of the heated pool... and dunks
text: the boy under the surface.
text: BLOOD from the cut on the bottom of his foot drains out into
text: the water like red ink...
scene_heading: INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT
text: Norma closes her eyes... the impending sense of dread
text: building inside of her.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: Two of your son's five functional

dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT
text: UNDERWATER... Walter floats with his arms spread wide...

text: bear a close resemblance to the image in the -Mars photo.
text: Blood streams out from his foot into the water.
scene_heading: INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT
text: Blood is now flowing out of Reston's left nostril. Both

speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
text: He is now blind and deaf.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: For the rest of his life, he will

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Why...
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: You are now presented with two
dialog: options.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Option one... you enjoy the rest of
dialog: your lives with the money you have
dialog: been given, and you learn to live
dialog: with your son's disability.
text: Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL.
text: He places it on the table next to the box.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: And then there is option number
dialog: two.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: There is one bullet in the chamber
dialog: of this gun.
text: Reston slides the gun across the table in Arthur's direction.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: You can fire this bullet into your
dialog: wife's heart... killing her.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: At the exact moment that her spirit

dialog: of his impaired senses will

dialog:

dialog: 102.
text: Arthur looks over at Norma in disbelief... then back at the
text: twins. He cannot fathom how it has now come to this.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
dialog: Arthur, you will then be arrested
dialog: and charged with the murder of your
dialog: wife... and the money will be
dialog: placed in an interest bearing trust
dialog: for your son to receive upon his
dialog: eighteenth birthday.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: That's not fair.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Let me do it. I, pushed your stupid
dialog: button. If I deserve to be punished
dialog: for it... then let me kill myself.
dialog: Arthur has nothing to do with this.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: I'm sorry, but the offer is not
dialog: negotiable.
speaker_heading: (TO ARTHUR)
dialog: And if Norma's fingers so much as
dialog: touch the weapon at any point from
dialog: this moment on... the restoration
dialog: of Walter's sight and sound will be
dialog: denied.
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: If Arthur has to do it... then I
dialog: want you to make it look like a
dialog: suicide. Arthur shouldn't be
dialog: punished for something that I did.
speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: I'm sorry... but the terms of the
dialog: offer are not negotiable.
text: Arthur faces has gone completely white.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Is there an afterlife?
text: The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: Because this is purgatory, right?
dialog: The earth is purgatory... and
dialog: you're here to start shutting
dialog: things down... right?
text: The twins appear impressed with his foresight.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: I find your theory to be quite

text: Arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Right. I get it.

speaker_heading: RESTON/ARLINGTON
dialog: Can someone please bring up the

scene_heading: EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Arthur and Norma emerge from the diner in a state of

text: Teague and Cahill approach... as MEN in dark suits snap
text: hundreds of photographs of the couple.
text: Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for
dialog: words.
text: Teague glances inside the diner... then back at Arthur.
text: Arthur nods his head slowly... his mind lost... and he limps

scene_heading: INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT
text: Norma sits behind the wheel... allowing Arthur to ride

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: NORMA

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: All these years... I've given you
dialog: the impression that Walter was an

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yeah... and?
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: And... it wasn't exactly an
dialog: accident.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I stopped taking the pill when I
dialog: met you...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: Because I was so afraid of losing

text: Arthur just stares at her... unsure how to respond.
speaker_heading: NORMA (CONT'D)
dialog: For that alone... I deserve a

speaker_heading: ARTHUR

speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: NORMA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Because you're an amputee. He says
dialog: that the soul of an amputee leaks

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
