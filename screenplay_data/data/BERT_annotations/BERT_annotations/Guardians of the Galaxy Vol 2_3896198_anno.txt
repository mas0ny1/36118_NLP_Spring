text: OVERHEAD SHOT: A `79 Cobra winds alongside the Missouri
text: River, past swaying loosestrife, vibrant sugar maples, and
text: oily self-pump gas stations. A hazy sun glints off the hood
text: of the Cobra which, like its descendant the Milano, is orange
dialog: and teal.
dialog: 
text: We MOVE DOWN AND IN on a fresh-faced girl of 18 in the
text: passenger seat: MEREDITH QUILL. As "Brandy" blasts from the

dialog: Do do do do do do do do do do do!
dialog: 
text: The driver, a MYSTERIOUS MAN in his 30's, dressed in sleek,

dialog: 
text: Meredith LAUGHS too. She SINGS and dances with abandon in

dialog: I am Groot.

speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: Well. That's intense.
dialog: 
text: Rocket, Quill, and Gamora JET-PACK OUT OF THE WAY, while they

dialog: 
text: But we FOCUS on baby Groot, who trots up to the stereo
text: speakers and Walkman.
dialog: 
text: He fiddles with two wires. They SPARK, the stereo POWERS UP,
text: and "MR. BLUE SKY" by ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA PLAYS as -
dialog: 
text: THE CREDITS START
dialog: 
text: Baby Groot DANCES IN-FOCUS in the foreground as the Guardians
text: get PUMMELED by the beast OUT-OF-FOCUS in the background.
dialog: 
text: Baby Groot's dancing is arrhythmic and many of his "dance
text: moves" are nonsensical mixtures of trembling, swaying, and
text: making weird faces.
dialog: 
text: But it is joyous.
dialog: 
text: As Groot struts, Quill comes ROLLING behind him. As he
text: stands, he sees Groot dancing and looks at him, worried.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Groot, look - !
dialog: 
text: A TENTACLE FLIES IN FROM OFF-SCREEN, KNOCKING Quill OUT-OF-

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Groot, smiling, dances onward, as DRAX, in the clutches of a

dialog:

text: BEAST.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Get out of the way, Groot! You're
dialog: going to get hurt!
dialog: 
text: Groot stops dancing. He WAVES at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
text: She AERO-JETS back into the fray.
dialog: 
text: As Groot DANCES, Drax FALLS directly behind him.
dialog: 
text: Groot FREEZES.
dialog: 
text: Drax stares at him a moment, suspicious. Groot stays frozen.
dialog: 
text: Drax LEAVES, and Groot COMMENCES THE DANCE where he left off.
dialog: 
text: Groot sees an INSECT FLYING BY.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly dancing is forgotten and GETTING THIS BUG is all-
dialog: important. He CHASES it.
dialog: 
text: He HOPS up and grabs it from the air...
dialog: 
text: And starts EATING it.
dialog: 
text: Rocket spots this and FLIES DOWN beside him, worried. He
text: PRIES OPEN GROOT'S MOUTH with his fingers, frantically trying
dialog: to get it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Spit it out! Spit it out!
dialog: 
text: Groot COUGHS IT OUT. The bug FLIES crookedly away, one wing
text: mulched.
dialog: 
text: Rocket JETS OFF back toward the battle, muttering:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
text: Disgusting.
dialog: 
text: Groot sees something else and becomes furious. We follow his
text: line of sight to a GRAZING ORLONI.
dialog: 7
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Groot SCREAMS A WAR CRY and ATTACKS IT. He GROWS HIS
text: BRANCHES AROUND IT, and the terrified Orloni DARTS AWAY,
text: DRAGGING GROOT WITH IT.
dialog: 
text: Groot's anger becomes panic as he is DRAGGED AROUND BY THE
text: ORLONI and can't let go.
dialog: 
text: The Orloni DARTS around the power station and underneath the
text: RAGING BATTLE, a CRYING Groot bouncing along behind it.
dialog: 
text: Finally, he LETS GO and goes TUMBLING, ROLLING directly INTO
speaker_heading: THE CAMERA.
dialog: 
text: And then stands up and, as if none of it happened at all,
text: starts DANCING AGAIN.
dialog: 
text: We PAN and see the speakers and Walkman beside him, and we
dialog: realize Baby Groot has traveled around the entire Power
text: Station and has arrived back where he started -
dialog: 
text: When Drax is FLUNG by the beast into the stereo system,
text: SMASHING it.
dialog: 
text: Groot stops dancing. Angry that Drax has ruined his fun, he
text: picks up a piece of the stereo and beats him with it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: CREDITS END.
dialog: 
text: Drax stands and glares at the ferocious beast as Rocket,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
text: The beast's hide is too thick to be
dialog: pierced from the outside. I must

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: Drax HOLLERS, CHARGING the creature.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA (CONT'D)
dialog: Drax, no! That doesn't make -

dialog: 
text: Quill and Rocket JET UP HIGH up over the creature as they
text: BLAST REPEATEDLY at it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here!
dialog: 
text: Gamora's rifle is jammed. She tosses it down. PULLS HER
scene_heading: SWORD. SNAPS IT OPEN.
dialog: 
text: The beast SCREECHES at Quill and Rocket FLYING overhead. The
text: colorful SPLATTER MATTER FLIES FROM ITS MOUTH, BATTERING
text: ROCKET, BURNING his clothes.
dialog: 
text: But its neck is exposed, where the skin is thinner, and there
text: is a small wound.
dialog: 
text: Gamora DASHES, LEAPING HIGH into the air, and she PLUNGES her
text: sword directly into the wound.
dialog: 
text: She holds tight to the hilt as she FALLS, SLICING AN INCISION
text: down the length of the creature's neck.
dialog: 
text: The beast WOBBLES, TOPPLES, and DIES. As it COLLAPSES, Drax
text: SPILLS OUT of the wound. He raises his arms in victory.

speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Ha ha! I have single-handedly

text: Rocket pulls out one of the ANULAX BATTERIES, checking it

speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: We got an armed Sovereign fleet,

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Golden, capsule-shaped, Sovereign OMNICRAFT, with a video
text: screen on front and a blaster on each side - getting closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Why would they do that?!
dialog: 16
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Probably because Rocket stole some

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Dude.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Oh, right. He didn't steal one of
dialog: those. I don't know why they're

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Dude, it was really easy to steal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA

speaker_heading: ROCKET

dialog: priestess talked down to us! I'm
dialog: teaching her a lesson!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Oh! I didn't realize your

dialog: us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Exactly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!

speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: ROCKET

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: GAMORA

speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: QUILL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL

dialog: combustible and could, in turn,
dialog: destroy the entire fleet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AYESHA
dialog: We have thousands of batteries and

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: It's called Berhert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: How many jumps?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Only one. But the access point is
text: 47 clicks away. And it's through
dialog: that Quantum Asteroid Field over
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: Quill spots, to his side, a HUGE FIELD OF SMALL, GLOWING
text: ASTEROIDS, SWIRLING IN RANDOM PATTERNS, DISAPPEARING OUT OF

dialog: 
text: Quill ZOOMS SIDEWAYS toward the field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Quill, to make it through that,

text: Quill smirks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Lucky for us -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: I am.
dialog: 
text: Rocket FLIPS the pilot controls between them so that he's the
text: one piloting the ship. Quill gapes at him.
dialog: 
text: The Milano DIVES into the QUANTUM ASTEROID FIELD, SWOOPING in
text: and around the SWIRLING ATOMIZED STONES, barely missing them.
dialog: 
text: The Sovereign ships FOLLOW. They are not pilots on par with
text: Rocket, so most of the ships are immediately PELTED WITH
text: STONES AND DESTROYED.
dialog: 20
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Quill FLIPS the controls back, so he's piloting again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: I've been flying this rig since I
dialog: was ten years old.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: I was cybernetically engineered to

dialog:

speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: ROCKET

dialog: 
text: Drax LAUGHS cheerfully. Gamora glances at him. He explains:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: I have famously huge turds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: We're about to die, and this is
dialog: what we're discussing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
text: They raise havoc with the pipes.
dialog: That's why I do all the plumbing. I

dialog: Unlike some people...
dialog: 
text: Drax eyes baby Groot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Groot, he's right, you have to
text: start aiming inside the box.
dialog: 
text: Groot looks ashamed. Quill FLIPS the controls back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Stop it.
dialog: 
text: Rocket SWITCHES it back. Quill SWITCHES it back.
dialog: 
text: They're nearing the end of the Asteroid Field when both go to
dialog: switch it at the same time and --
dialog: 
text: WHAM! A LARGE ASTEROID SMASHES THROUGH the stern of the
dialog: Milano.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: A CHUNK OF THE REAR OF THE CRAFT DISAPPEARS.

text: Her face and body cover with frost.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE
dialog:

speaker_heading: HOLE.
dialog: 
text: Groot GOES FLYING, but Quill CATCHES HIM, and casually TOSSES
dialog: him back to Drax --
dialog: 
dialog: So that he can punch in a code, causing -

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: A PROTECTIVE ENERGY SHIELD SLIDES UP in front of the hole.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: Idiots!
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Everyone catches their breath, relieved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Well, that's what you get when
text: Quill flies.
dialog: 
text: Gamora THROWS SOMETHING HARD at the back of Rocket's head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: There's still a Sovereign craft
dialog: behind us!
dialog: 
text: The electronics FLICKER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Our weapons are down!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
text: Twenty clicks to the jump.
dialog: 
text: The Mean Pilot BLASTS at them from the sole Sovereign Craft,
text: TAKING OUT another part of a wing. The Milano is TREMBLING.
dialog: 
text: Drax starts climbing down into the living area.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Where's he going?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: A group of pilots have gathered around the Mean Pilot,

dialog: 
scene_heading: FRIGHTENED PILOT
dialog: Come on, Zylak, you can do this.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Nebula sees the bowl of yaro root has spilled in front of
dialog: her.
dialog: 23
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She reaches for a piece, but it's KICKED OUT OF HER WAY.
dialog: 
text: She looks up to see Drax, grabbing a cable on a spool
text: attached to the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: It's not ripe.
dialog: 
text: Drax HOOKS the cable to his belt. A folder on the wall reads
text: SPACESUITS FOR EMERGENCY and, below that, in Rocket's scrawl:
speaker_heading: OR FOR FUN.
dialog: 
text: Drax pulls a small disk from the folder. He slaps it between
text: his shoulder blades and a SHIMMERY SHEATH COVERS HIS ENTIRE
text: BODY - a thin force-field spacesuit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Gamora watches THE MAP leading to the jump point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
text: Fifteen clicks.
dialog: 
text: Another BLAST from the Sovereign craft HITS them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The pilots rooting on the Mean Pilot erupt into CHEERS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Drax grabs a huge rifle.
dialog: 
text: He punches buttons on the wall. A SECOND PROTECTIVE SHIELD
text: OPENS UP between him and Nebula, and THE FIRST PROTECTIVE
text: SHEATH OPENS, exposing him to space --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Mean Pilot watches in awe as Drax JUMPS OUT the back of
dialog: the Milano.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Drax smiles. The cable UNSPOOLS and SNAPS TAUT when it
text: reaches its end.
dialog: 
text: Drax is DRAGGED HAPHAZARDLY by the Milano like a water sled
text: on a boat.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: ON THE MAP, the jump point gets closer.
dialog: 24
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
text: Ten clicks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: The Mean Pilot BLASTS WILDLY at Drax, missing him by mere
dialog: inches.
dialog: 
text: Drax brings the sight to his eye. Aims at the ship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Die, spaceship.
dialog: 
text: And he SHOOTS, BLASTING the Sovereign ship.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Mean Pilot SCREAMS as his lights go out. The Frightened

scene_heading: FRIGHTENED PILOT
dialog: You suck, Zylak.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Son-of-a-! They went around the

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: Ayesha smiles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

speaker_heading: EXPLODE.

scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

speaker_heading: AYESHA
dialog: What?! WHO?!
dialog: 
text: But the Admiral doesn't know.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Rocket sees the BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT is emanating from an OVAL-
scene_heading: SHAPED SPACECRAFT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: What is that?!
dialog: 
text: Quill sees the FLICKERING framework of a JUMP POINT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Doesn't matter! That's the jump
dialog: point! GO! GO!
dialog: 
text: As they're about to reach the jump point, Rocket sees a MAN
text: standing casually atop the oval ship, LIGHT BURSTING THROUGH
text: HIS BODY and into the craft - the source of the explosion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: It's a guy.
dialog: 
text: Quill doesn't see as the Milano DISAPPEARS INTO THE JUMP
speaker_heading: POINT.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY

dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

scene_heading: I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK/BERHERT FOREST - DAY
dialog:

dialog: 26
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He turns toward Gamora, but she's gone. Instead Baby Groot
text: is sitting alone, happily munching on candies as if he's
text: watching a movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Groot, put on your seat belt!
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY
dialog: 
text: The SPOOL DETACHES and FLIES toward the back, which would
text: leave Drax in the upper reaches of the planet's atmosphere -
dialog: 
text: But Gamora has made it downstairs - she GRABS ONTO THE SPOOL
text: with one hand while CLUTCHING onto a secure part of the ship
text: with her other. As it SNAPS TIGHT, it nearly wrenches her
text: apart. She GROANS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Prepare for a really bad -
dialog: 
text: The Milano HITS THE TREES, BARRELING OVER THEM. They PART
text: and FLATTEN and SWAT at the windshield.
dialog: 
text: Out back, Gamora HOLDS TIGHT despite searing pain, as Drax
text: BOUNCES VIOLENTLY off the trees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

speaker_heading: SUPER: BERHERT
scene_heading: M20 22A4834126+306CA12

speaker_heading: ROCKET

speaker_heading: YONDU

speaker_heading: STAKAR
dialog: I don't got to listen to nothing!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU
dialog: I didn't know what was going on -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAKAR
dialog: You didn't know `cause you didn't

dialog: 
text: NEARBY, a MONSTROUS RAVAGER leans in toward Kraglin, Tullk,

speaker_heading: MONSTROUS RAVAGER

speaker_heading: AYESHA

dialog: adventure at the time, battling
dialog: demonic forces to save this

dialog: can't quite recall, it all bleeds

dialog: of returning you, Yondu kept you. I

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: You look exactly alike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: One's blue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: EGO (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA

speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: I know, but -

speaker_heading: QUILL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: The wonderful television-singer

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: David Hasselhoff?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: He had a talking car, not a magic -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Why did it talk again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Just to be a good friend, I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: And as a child you carried his
dialog: picture in your pocket, and you
dialog: told the other children he was your
dialog: father, but he was out of town --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Shooting Knight Rider or touring
dialog: with his band in Germany. Why are
dialog: you bringing this up now? I was
dialog: drunk when I told you that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: I love that story.
dialog: 37
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: I don't. It's just sad! I was so
dialog: sad because I'd see the other kids
dialog: off playing catch with their dads,
dialog: and I wanted that, more than
dialog: anything in the world.
dialog: 
text: Gamora takes Quill's hands in her own.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: My point is, maybe this man is your
dialog: Hasselhoff. I know it's a long

dialog: child. I'd give anything...
dialog: 
text: Quill nods, grudgingly.

speaker_heading: GAMORA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: DRAX

speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: There's no way for them to know

speaker_heading: DRAX

speaker_heading: DRAX

speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Hope daddy isn't as big of a dick
dialog: as you, orphan boy.

dialog:

dialog: 
text: She places her hand on his forehead with her hand: her

dialog: 
text: Quill takes a small, folded piece of paper out of his pocket.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: Their purpose?
dialog:

speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Yes, Quill and I have a bet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: You're not supposed to say that.
dialog: 40
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: I say that if you are about to go

dialog: your antennae will feel this, and

speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Just making clear - if it's

speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: If I touch someone I can feel their
speaker_heading: FEELINGS -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: You read minds?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: No. Telepaths know thoughts.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: May I?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You feel love.
dialog: 41
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Yeah, I guess, yeah, I have sort of

speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: MANTIS

speaker_heading: QUILL

speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: That's so incredibly uncool.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Touch me. And the only thing you're
text: going to feel is a broken jaw.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: I can also alter emotions, to some
dialog: extent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: If I touch someone who is sad I can
dialog: ease them into contentment, for a
dialog: short while. I can make a stubborn
dialog: person compliant. But I mostly use
dialog: it to help my Master sleep. He lies

speaker_heading: DRAX

speaker_heading: MANTIS

dialog: 44
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As the confused group on the ground watches, Rocket presses

text: BACK UP INTO THE TREES.

speaker_heading: DRAX

speaker_heading: GAMORA

speaker_heading: GAMORA

dialog: 
text: She watches as it gets closer and closer, and realizes it is

dialog: 
text: Gamora RUNS.

scene_heading: INT. NEBULA'S SHIP - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Nebula HOLLERS as she BLASTS HER GUNS, DIVING towards Gamora.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Gamora FLEES from Nebula's ship like Cary Grant from the crop
text: duster in North by Northwest as HUGE CHUNKS OF LAND EXPLODE
text: on either side of her.
dialog: 
text: Gamora leaps into a DITCH, LANDING HARD, as the M-Ship SWOOPS
text: just a couple feet above her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: You psychopath.
dialog: 
text: Gamora sees the M-Ship banking and FLYING BACK at her again.
dialog: 
text: She stands and runs along the hillside as GUN BLASTS burst
text: behind her. But Gamora sees a CAVERN, leading down into the
dialog: earth.
dialog: 82
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She DARTS into it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EGO'S CAVERN - FIRST/SECOND LEVELS - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: As Gamora RUNS down the cavern, she glances back over her
text: shoulder where Nebula, insane with rage, continues FLYING
dialog: towards her --
dialog: 
text: The M-SHIP ENTERS THE CAVERN, which is too small for it,
text: CLIPPING ITS WINGS - but it keeps flying. It again BLASTS at
dialog: Gamora as she FLEES -
dialog: 
text: The BLASTS cause the ground to COLLAPSE around Gamora, and
text: she FALLS, SMASHING DOWN THROUGH ONE LEVEL, to another level
text: below, SLAMMING HARD on the ground.
dialog: 
text: The underside of the M-ship gets SCRAPED APART as it flies
text: above her, and pieces of it come RAINING DOWN around her.
dialog: 
text: Nebula ZOOMS towards a huge cavern wall. She tries to turn
text: her ship in time, to no avail.
dialog: 
text: She SIDESWIPES it, falling down, CRASHING on the ground,
text: where she is now on the same level as Gamora.
dialog: 
text: Gamora sees something beside her: it's one of the ENORMOUS
text: BLASTERS from the M-ship, attached to an AMMO RIG.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEBULA'S M-SHIP - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Nebula sees Gamora, through the canopy, picking up the
text: blaster, and clutching it. It is comically enormous.
dialog: 
text: Nebula struggles to get free and out of the way, but her legs
dialog: have been pinned in the crash -
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EGO'S CAVERN - SECOND/THIRD LEVELS - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Gamora CLAMPS two metal switches together, MACHINE-FIRING THE
text: GUN, as she walks forward.
dialog: 
text: The front of the M-ship is peppered with blasts and then
speaker_heading: EXPLODES.
dialog: 
text: The explosion causes the thin ground around it to COLLAPSE,
text: and the entire ship FALLS BACKWARDS to an even LOWER LEVEL -
text: BURSTING some more as it hits the ground.
dialog: 
text: Gamora gazes down at the ship.
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. NEBULA'S SQUASHED M-SHIP - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: Nebula is a mess. Her legs are broken, trapped in the ship.
text: There is a FIRE at her feet.
dialog: 83
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She struggles, trying to get out, but her machine parts are
text: SPARKING and she can hardly breathe. It seems as she's going
dialog: to die, when --
dialog: 
text: Part of the ship is TORN AWAY. She sees Gamora.
dialog: 
text: Gamora GRABS HER, unceremoniously PULLING HER FREE, just as
text: the M-ship EXPLODES, PITCHING THEM BOTH to the ground.
dialog: 
text: They lie next to each other. Nebula COUGHS as her legs are
text: healing, CRACKING back into place.
dialog: 
text: She looks over and eyes Gamora.
dialog: 
text: And then she HOLLERS and attacks her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Are you kidding me?!
dialog: 
text: They FIGHT.
dialog: 
text: Nebula snatches Gamora's blade from her, and TUMBLES on top
text: of her as she gains the upper hand. She holds the blade
text: above Gamora, ready to plummet it into her.
dialog: 
text: She wants to - she really does - but now that the moment is
dialog: here...
dialog: 
text: She SCREAMS in frustration, and falls back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: I win.
dialog: 
text: Gamora eyes her, a little surprised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEBULA (CONT'D)
dialog: I win. I bested you in combat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Uh, no, I just spared your life -

speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: GAMORA NEBULA (CONT'D)
dialog: Nebula, I really don't need I don't need you always

speaker_heading: ENOUGH -

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: I'm not the one who just flew

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEBULA

speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: I don't have to because you make it
speaker_heading: OBVI -

dialog: 
text: Gamora stops suddenly, struck. Nebula is cracking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEBULA (CONT'D)
dialog: You were all I had, but you were
dialog: the one who needed to win! Thanos
dialog: pulled my eye from my head and my
dialog: brain from my skull and my arm from

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: EGO (CONT'D)
dialog: Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a

text: They look at each other instead of where they're going, and
text: the CRASH into an overhanging piece of rock.
dialog: 
text: The entire side door is RIPPED OFF.
dialog: 
text: As the SCREECH through a smaller space and into --
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Laser Drill DROPS into this enormous open space within
dialog: the planet.
dialog: 
text: The Guardians gather on the side of the ship open to the
text: hollow, gazing out at its stunning beauty, lit by Ego's white
text: glow running throughout it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Whoa.
dialog: 
text: Mantis turns, looking through the portholes on the other
dialog: side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: There! Thats Ego's core.
dialog: 
text: Mantis points at the Self Chamber, down below them. They
text: twist down towards it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: That ore's thick. Rocket, we're
dialog: gonna need to use the big laser.
dialog: 
text: Rocket nods, FLICKS switches.
dialog: 
text: All the small lasers on the sides move through grooves to
text: combine into one huge laser in the center of the ship: the
scene_heading: MEGA-LASER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: We must hurry. It will not take Ego
dialog: long to find us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Keep it still!
dialog: 107
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Quill steadies the craft as best he can beside the Self
text: Chamber. But it's an unwieldy beast, built for power, not
dialog: precision.
dialog: 
text: Rocket powers up the mega-laser and holds tight to the
text: SHUDDERING CONTROLS as it DRILLS, BURNING a HOLE into the
text: protective sheathe. It melts and drips down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: We drill into the center, we kill
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Quill holds tight to the steering wheel. Yondu notices the
text: BLINKING LIGHT on the comm. He taps it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU
dialog: What is it, Kraglin?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KRAGLIN (O.S.)
dialog: Um, remember that Ayesha chick?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU
dialog: Yeah, why?
dialog: 
text: Yondu looks out the window where AYESHA'S SQUADRON is
text: SWOOPING OUT OF the cracks in the ceiling all around them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw, hell.
dialog: 
text: Quill PULLS AWAY from the envoys.
dialog: 
text: But the Sovereign envoys start BLASTING AT THE CRAFT all at
text: once; the LASER LOSES POWER and the VEHICLE TURNS SIDEWAYS -
dialog: 
text: Drax, Mantis, and Gamora GO TUMBLING from the hole in the
text: side. Nebula and Groot grab onto the floor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Gamora, Drax, and Mantis FALL from an incredible height. They
scene_heading: LAND - ONE, TWO, THREE - WITH APLOMB.
dialog: 
text: Gamora looks up and sees the Laser Drill CURL behind the Self
text: Chamber as it tries to avoid the envoys' BLASTERS.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SELF CHAMBER/LASER DRILL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Nebula and Groot settle as the ship rights itself and BLASTS
text: PIERCE the ship around them.
dialog: 
text: Quill peers down at Rocket, who has jumped out of his seat
text: and is pouring out the contents of his satchel.
dialog: 108
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Why aren't you firing the laser?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: They blew out the generator!
dialog: I think I packed a small detonator.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: A detonator is worthless without
dialog: explosives!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: We got these!
dialog: 
text: Rocket shows Nebula the Anulax batteries.
dialog: 
text: Quill leaves the controls to Yondu as he CLIMBS down beside
text: Rocket, now messing with wiring on his BOMB.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Is it strong enough to kill Ego?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: If it is, it will cause a chain
dialog: reaction throughout his entire
dialog: nervous system.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Meaning what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
text: The entire planet will explode.
dialog: We'll have to get out of here fast.
dialog: I rigged a timer.
dialog: 
text: Rocket stuffs the bomb back in his satchel. Groot climbs on
text: his back.
dialog: 
text: Rocket and Quill slap on their AERO RIGS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Go!
dialog: 
text: The run and jump out of the laser drill, FLYING ON THEIR AERO
text: RIGS, avoiding the GUNFIRE.
dialog: 
text: The ZOOM towards the blast hole on the side of the self
dialog: chamber.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rocket and Quill land here, messily, TUMBLING.
dialog: 109
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mantis is worried about something else entirely; the entire
text: chasm begins TREMBLING and the walls start to MUTATE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: He's coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Didn't you say you could make him
dialog: sleep?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: When he wants! He's too powerful! I
dialog: can't!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: You don't have to believe in
dialog: yourself because I believe in you.
dialog: 
text: They look ahead. They see, on the enormous wall in front of
text: them, the LIGHT-FORM of a giant EGO SCREAMING ANGRILY.
dialog: 
text: His SCREAM becomes a TUNNEL OF ROCKS RUSHING TOWARDS THEM
text: like a train.
dialog: 
text: Mantis sees a nerve bundle on the ground coming from Ego's
text: Core. Although afraid, she grabs it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
speaker_heading: SLEEP!
dialog: 
text: She SCREAMS with effort and some pain as energy travels
text: through the bundle and into the core, where it darkens.
dialog: 
text: The LIGHT LEAVES THE ROCK FORMATION and it SLAMS into the
text: ground in front of them, SPLASHING DIRT OVER THEM.
dialog: 
text: But they are safe, shivering. Drax and Gamora look at each
dialog: other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: I never thought she'd be able to do
text: it. With as skinny and weak as she
text: appears to be.
dialog: 
text: Mantis's arm is TREMBLING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: I don't know how long I can hold
dialog: him!
dialog: 110
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: You need to, girl. If you don't
dialog: keep Ego at bay, we all die.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Rocket shines a powerful PEN-LIGHT inside the cavity,
text: exposing the interior, spattered with Swiss-cheese-like holes
text: glowing with light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: The metal is too thick! For the
dialog: bomb to work we'd actually need to
dialog: place it on Ego's core. And our
dialog: fat butts ain't gonna fit through
dialog: those tiny holes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Well...
dialog: 
text: Quill slowly eyes Groot, who is playing with a leaf on his
text: arm and thinking about something else entirely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: That's a terrible idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Which is the only kind of idea we
dialog: got left.
dialog: 
text: Rocket SIGHS. He puts Groot on his back and MOVES with Groot
text: deeper into the blast hole, mumbling to himself:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Unbelievable. `Rocket, do this.
dialog: Rocket, do that.'
dialog: 
text: Quill turns toward the opening. PUSH UP AND IN ON QUILL.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Uh, what a day.
dialog: 
text: He jumps out into the fray.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY
dialog: 
text: Quill FLIES UP as a ship FLIES in toward him BLASTING, and
text: he's about to fire back. MAN VS. SPACESHIP. This is most
text: likely the beginning of the biggest, baddest fight scene
dialog: ever, but instead we CUT TO -
dialog: 111
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE BLAST HOLE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Quiet. Blasts in the deep background. Rocket places a tiny
text: bomb in front of Groot. It is a small, simple device with
text: two switches and two buttons. He explains, very carefully:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: All right. First you flick this
dialog: switch, then this switch. That
dialog: activates it. And then you push
dialog: this button, which will give you
text: five minutes to get out of there.
dialog: Whatever you do don't push this
dialog: button, because that will set off
dialog: the bomb immediately, and we'll all
dialog: be dead. Now repeat back what I
dialog: just said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GROOT
dialog: I am Groot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GROOT
dialog: I am Groot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GROOT
dialog: I am Groot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: No! That's the button that will
dialog: kill everyone! Try again.
dialog: 
dialog: Groot thinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GROOT
dialog: I am Groot.
dialog: 
text: Rocket nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GROOT (CONT'D)
dialog: I am Groot.
dialog: 
text: Rocket nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GROOT (CONT'D)
dialog: I am Groot.
dialog: 112
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: No! That's exactly what you just
dialog: said! How is that even possible?!
dialog: Which button is the button you're
dialog: supposed to push?! Point to it.
dialog: 
text: Groot thinks. And he points to the one that will kill
dialog: everyone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: NO!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, you're making him nervous!
dialog: 
text: Rocket runs to see, at the end of the hole, a sliver of the
text: outside as Quill peeks in while SHOOTING at envoys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Shut up! And give me some tape!
dialog: Does anyone have any tape out
dialog: there!? I want to put some tape
dialog: over the death button!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: I don't have any tape. Let me
dialog: check.
dialog: 
text: Quill disappears from the hole. As Rocket waits, he hears,
text: amongst the chaos, faintly -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Yo, Yondu, do you have any - ow! -
dialog: do you have any tape?!
dialog: 
scene_heading: O.S. GUN BLASTS.
dialog: 
text: We hear VOICES GRUMBLING.
dialog: 
text: Rocket and Groot look around, waiting. Rocket is impatient.
text: He coughs. Groot is like a bored kid in a waiting room. He
text: shifts around and plays with the wires on the bomb.
dialog: 
text: Quill reappears outside the hole, SHOOTING an envoy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
text: No one has any tape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Not a single person has tape?
dialog: 113
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: You have priceless batteries and an
dialog: atomic bomb in your bag! If anyone
dialog: had tape it would be you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: That's exactly my point! I have to
dialog: do everything!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Dude, you're wasting time!
dialog: 
text: Rocket turns back to Groot, who has already taken the bomb
text: and is heading towards the hole.
dialog: 
text: He makes a "WHEEEEEE" sound and smiles brightly as he HOPS
text: into the hole and SLIDES down as if on a water slide.
dialog: 
text: Rocket, heavy-lidded, watches him go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: We're all gonna die.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Yondu and Nebula, in the cockpit, are being overcome as
text: blasts come through the walls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU
dialog: We're done for without the
dialog: generator.
dialog: 
text: Nebula MOANS, frustrated. She flips open a section of the
text: dashboard, then a part of her arm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY
dialog: 
text: The remaining Sovereign envoys have ENCIRCLED the battered
text: Laser Drill, BLASTING IT TO BITS.
dialog: 
text: Quill FLIES into the Laser Drill, SLAMMING into the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AYESHA (ON SHIP)
dialog: Guardians! Perhaps it will provide
dialog: you solace that your deaths are not

scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Yondu works some switches: The LASERS slide back into the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU
dialog: This is gonna hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEBULA
dialog: Promises, promises.
dialog: 
text: Yondu flips ALL the switches; ALL THE POWER RUNS PAINFULLY
text: OUT OF NEBULA'S BODY INTO THE VEHICLE --
dialog: 
text: AND THE LASERS BEAM OUT OF THE SHIP IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT
text: ONCE, like a dangerous disco ball, slicing through almost
text: nearly every single ENVOY.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY
dialog: 
text: A BEAM ALMOST HITS Drax, but he LEAPS out of the way. Smoke
text: rises from a hole in the ground between him and Mantis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY
dialog: 
text: With flair, Yondu spins the pilot's wheel, so that the whole

dialog: 
text: Ayesha looks on, in horror as the BEAMS SLICE THROUGH the
text: remaining CRAFT - and one is COMING HER WAY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AYESHA (ON SHIP)
dialog: NO!!
dialog: 
text: AYESHA'S ENVOY IS RIPPED APART.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

text: And FIRE SPILLING toward the ship's engine, dripping fuel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: We're gonna blow!
dialog: 
text: Yondu WHISTLES as the FLAMES HIT THE FUEL -

scene_heading: INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Gamora watches as the ENTIRE LASER DRILL EXPLODES. She is
dialog: stricken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: Peter?
dialog: 
text: She sees a tiny body flying from the ship - it's Nebula, who
text: LANDS across from her on her feet.
dialog: 
text: Gamora looks at her, worried. Nebula gives her what might be
text: a little smile, and looks upward. Gamora follows her line of
dialog: sight.
dialog: 
text: Quill is FLYING FROM THE EXPLOSION on his aero-rig. Yondu is
text: holding onto a flying arrow: his one arm up straight, his
text: heels touching. Quill looks at him and SNICKERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: You look like Mary Poppins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YONDU
dialog: Is he cool?

speaker_heading: QUILL

text: Rocket FLYING DOWN on his aero-rig, and finally, Mantis,
text: staring forward with concentration until --
dialog: 
text: A HUGE CHUNK OF SPACESHIP FLIES IN FROM THE SIDE, FLATTENING
text: MANTIS. The others all look down at her in shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Oh. Wow.
dialog: 
text: Mantis, UNCONSCIOUS BENEATH a ship fragment, has lost hold of
dialog: Ego.
dialog: 
text: THE ENTIRE HOLLOW AROUND THEM BEGINS TO RUMBLE. THE GROUND

dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Someone needs to be up top when
text: Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis.
dialog: 
text: Drax nods. He picks up Mantis. Quill grabs the aero-rig off

text: WRAPS around his upper body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: Ahhh! My nipples!
dialog: 
text: He FLIES UPWARD.
dialog: 
text: The ground around them SPLITS INTO ENORMOUS CRACKS. Gamora

text: she turns toward him.
dialog: 
text: And Gamora's side CRUMBLES AWAY, GAMORA FALLING DOWN with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL

dialog:

dialog: 
text: Nebula grabs Gamora's arm and then grabs onto a passing
dialog: cliff.
dialog: 
text: They SNAP TO A STOP- OW! - hanging down off the side.
dialog: 
text: Nebula tosses Gamora up onto a flat surface.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY
dialog:

scene_heading: I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY
dialog: 
text: The thrusters FLARE as the massive ship STRUGGLES to free
text: itself from Ego's tendrils.
dialog: 119
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And it does PULL ITSELF UP for a moment, but the tendrils
text: tighten, SLAMMING it back down.
dialog: 
text: The whole Quadrant starts to TIP OVER. Kraglin falls down
text: against the side of the ship.
dialog: 
text: Drax sees the ship FALLING TOWARDS HIM and he RUNS away from
text: it in fear.
dialog: 
text: But he arrives a the edge of a cliff. He crouches as the
text: ship CONTINUES DOWN toward him, about to SQUASH both he and
speaker_heading: MANTIS --
dialog: 
text: But Kraglin heroically CRAWLS his way back up to the controls

scene_heading: EXT. PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY
dialog:

text: LIKE THE RED SEA.
dialog: 
text: As Ego walks, THE DIRT AND MOLECULES AROUND EGO FORM ORGANS

dialog: 
text: Quill sees a tentacle SLAM Yondu to the ground and COVER HIS

scene_heading: EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: He didn't chase `em away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET
dialog: Even though he yelled at `em.
dialog: 
text: Quill shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: And was always mean.
dialog: 
text: Quill shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROCKET (CONT'D)
dialog: And he stole batteries he didn't
dialog: need.
dialog: 
text: Quill is surprised - what? And then he looks at Rocket, a
dialog: little animal who doesn't know the rules of how to be any
text: more than a young boy whose tribe sold him into slavery.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Of course not.
dialog: 
text: Baby Groot is on Gamora's shoulder. He reaches for Drax, who
text: takes him. Baby Groot YAWNS and nuzzles into Drax's
text: shoulder, falling asleep. Drax lovingly pats his back.
dialog: 
text: Gamora looks at Drax and Groot, and Rocket, and Mantis,
text: taking it all in, this strange family of hers. She turns to
text: Quill, staring at him with love.
dialog: 136
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMORA
dialog: It's just some unspoken thing.
dialog: 
text: Quill wraps his arm around her and she sinks into him.
dialog: 
text: Mantis smiles and becomes teary and GASPS, overwhelmed, as
text: she looks out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANTIS
dialog: It's beautiful.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRAX
dialog: It is. And so are you.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
text: On the inside.
dialog: 
text: They turn back to the window and they stand there together,
text: our Guardians of the Galaxy, watching the Ravager funeral and
text: the colorful dust of an old friend dance.
dialog: 
text: And the shape of the dust seems to form something very close
text: to an ARROW.
dialog: 
text: Rocket sees this and he cries.

scene_heading: CREDIT BREAK 1 - INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: SURRENDER is PLAYING HERE. Kraglin has had a version of
text: Yondu's fin implanted in his head. He looks nervously down
text: at the arrow on the floor.
dialog: 
text: He tries to WHISTLE. It just flips around like a dead fish.
dialog: 
text: He WHISTLES again, and it FLIES UP, hitting a wall, and falls
text: back down again.
dialog: 
text: He WHISTLES again, and it ZIPS AWAY. We HEAR A SCREAM.
dialog: 
text: Kraglin looks around the corner where Drax is sitting, the
text: ARROW IMPALED in his chest, yelling in agony.
dialog: 
text: Kraglin looks around, hoping no one saw him there, and he
text: tries to slink away.
dialog: 137
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: MORE CREDITS as SURRENDER CHORUS KICKS IN: Mommy's all right,
dialog: Daddy's all right, they just seem a little weird.

scene_heading: END CREDITS - INT. STAKAR'S SHIP - OUTER SPACE
dialog: 
text: Stakar looks sad, serious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAKAR
dialog: It's a shame it takes a tragedy
dialog: like losing Yondu to bring us all
dialog: back together. But I think he'd be
dialog: proud if he knew we were working as
text: a team again.
dialog: 
text: Over Stakar we see this incredibly motley crew - MARTINEX,
text: CHARLIE-27, ALETA, who is holding MAINFRAME (a robotic head
text: in a cage), and the mouthless, wormlike KRUGARR,
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STAKAR (CONT'D)
dialog: What say we steal some shit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE-27
dialog: In.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARTINEX
dialog: Dope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAINFRAME
dialog: I MISSED you guys!

scene_heading: END CREDITS - INT. BIRTHING PODS CHAMBER - DAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAMBERMAID
dialog: High Priestess, the Council is
dialog: waiting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AYESHA
dialog: They are perturbed I have wasted
dialog: our resources.
dialog: 
text: The Chambermaid smiles politely, nods slightly, agreeing in a
text: circumspect manner. Ayesha stares across the way.
dialog: 138
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AYESHA (CONT'D)
dialog: When they see what I have created
dialog: here, their wrath will dissipate,
dialog: though it will be some time.
dialog: 
text: The Chambermaid looks where Ayesha is looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAMBERMAID
dialog: That is not just another birthing
dialog: pod, ma'am?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AYESHA
dialog: That, my child, is the next step in
dialog: our evolution: more powerful, more
dialog: beautiful, and more capable of
dialog: destroying the Guardians of the
dialog: Galaxy.
dialog: 
text: A large, human-sized cocoon stands where Ayesha stares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AYESHA (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I shall call him... `Adam'.

dialog: 
text: Quill is standing in the bedroom doorway, looking down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: Dude, seriously, you got to clean
dialog: up your room. It's a complete mess.
dialog: 
text: We REVEAL a gawky ADOLESCENT GROOT, hunched over, playing a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ADOLESCENT GROOT
dialog: I am Groot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL
dialog: I'm not boring, man. You're boring.
dialog: Once I got stuck on a planet where
dialog: everyone was just lines and dots. I
dialog: had to use geometry to get out of
dialog: prison. Is that boring?
dialog: 
text: Adolescent Groot shakes his head in disdain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what's boring? Not doing
dialog: the dishes. What's boring is me
dialog: tripping over your vines
dialog: everywhere.
dialog: 
dialog: Adolescent Groot SIGHS.
dialog: 139
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Drax and I switched pants in the
dialog: middle of that party last weekend.
dialog: For no reason other than we're
dialog: awesome and very much not boring.
dialog: 
text: Quill starts to walk away then comes back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Once I got a venereal disease that
dialog: made me float for three days...
dialog: Don't tell Gamora... it's dormant,
dialog: but... If that's boring then, I
dialog: guess I'm boring.
dialog: 
text: He looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not boring.
dialog: 
text: Groot ROLLS HIS EYES and makes an exasperated sound.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: What's boring is when you roll your
dialog: eyes like that at me and make an
dialog: exasperated sound like I'm an old,
dialog: boring, stupid idiot.
dialog: 
text: Quill thinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now I know how Yondu felt.
dialog: 
text: Quill begins to CRY.
