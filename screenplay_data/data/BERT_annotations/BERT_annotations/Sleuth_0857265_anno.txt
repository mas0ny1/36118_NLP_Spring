speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: In this day and age? Is marriage
dialog: absolutely necessary? Isn't it a
dialog: bit old hat?
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's a mugs game. I wouldn't go
dialog: near it if I were you. Anyway you
dialog: can't marry her. You can't marry
dialog: her because she's married to me.
dialog: Unless I divorce her, of course.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: And are you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Am I what?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Going to divorce her. Or are you
dialog: really going to make her wait five
dialog: years? She wants to know.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: To be honest, I can't wait to get
dialog: rid of her. But I do need to get
dialog: one or two things straight first.
dialog: For example, I've never heard of an
dialog: Italian called Tindle.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: My father's name is Tindolini.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Now that's lovely. Like a little
dialog: bell. I'd go back to Tindolini if I
dialog: were you. It suits you.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: So that if and when you marry
dialog: Maggie she'd be called Maggie
dialog: Tindolini. She'd get a real kick
dialog: out of that. Do you act under the
dialog: name of Tindle or Tindolini?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Tindle.
speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: She's left a few dresses here.
dialog: Can't even be bothered to pick them

dialog: That leather coat alone cost two

dialog: thing is this--sit down--you see,

dialog: money like water. If you're not
dialog: careful she'll eat you out of house
dialog: and home. She was born to luxury.
dialog: Jamaica, the Ritz, the Swiss Alps.
dialog: I mean, what are you? You're an out

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Never trust in love, chum. Love'1i
dialog: kick you up the arse as soon as

dialog: it's love, ten minutes later it's
dialog: contempt.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: That's your own experience, is it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Certainly not. Observation. Don't

dialog: other people.
text: He goes to the window and looks out. MILO watches him--
dialog: silence.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT'D)
dialog: What I'm getting at is this. You
dialog: won't be able to give her what she
dialog: wants so she'll leave you and come
dialog: back to me. But I don't want her
dialog: near me. She's the last thing I
dialog: want. I've had her up to here.
dialog: Anyway, I've got a lovely mistress.
dialog: She runs a Sauna in Swindon. She's
dialog: my girl. So you see, I want Maggie
dialog: to stay with you. I want you two to
dialog: stay together forever, but unless
dialog: you listen to me the whole thing
dialog: will be a fucking disaster with
dialog: catastrophic consequences all
dialog: round. But I have a solution.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You won't believe what I'm going to
dialog: say.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What are you going to say?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: I'm all ears.
speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Get away.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's true.
speaker_heading: MILO

dialog: Did you?

speaker_heading: ANDREW

scene_heading: INT. ANDREW'S HOUSE’ - BAR AREA - NIGHT
text: ANDREW pours drinks.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Listen. I'm going to make you a
dialog: proposition. A few years ago I gave
text: her some jewels. Amazingly
dialog: expensive. Well, I didn't give them
dialog: to her. I own them. They're insured
dialog: in my name. But I let her wear them-
dialog: -on special occasions. They're
dialog: worth half a million pounds. They
dialog: spend half their time in the bank
dialog: or in my safe. At the moment
dialog: they're in the safe in this house.
dialog: I want you to steal them.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Steal them?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: What the hell do you mean?
dialog: rg.
dialog: 35
dialog: 36
dialog: 37
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I mean I want you to steal the
dialog: jewels.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You want me to steal the jewels.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's very simple. Steal them. Sell
dialog: them abroad. Live happily ever
dialog: after with Maggie. I'll claim the
dialog: insurance money--they'1ll have to
dialog: pay up. I'll have got rid of my
dialog: wife and I'll be as happy as a pig
dialog: in shit and you can keep Maggie in
dialog: the manner to which she has become
dialog: accustometi. Sounds like a fair
dialog: bargain to me.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You want me to take part ina
dialog: scummy little plot to defraud your
dialog: insurance company? Is that it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Scummy? I think it's quite elegant.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: What do you think I am? I mean,
dialog: what the fuck are you actually
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Real facts.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: This is a joke.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No it isn't.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: It's also a trap.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: A trap?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Yes, it's some kind of trap. You
dialog: think I'm a fool?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well, are you?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Anyway, it doesn't hold up.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You say they're worth half a
dialog: million pounds?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Correct.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Well, you'd only get a fraction of
dialog: that--fram any fence.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I've already contacted a friend of
dialog: mine in Amsterdam. He'll give you
dialog: £400,000 tax free. Think of it.
dialog: £400,000 tax free.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Why would he do that?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Because when you steal the jewels
dialog: you also steal the receipts. So
dialog: he'll have the title to the jewels
dialog: as well as the jewels themselves.
dialog: So when he sells them he'll get the
dialog: full value. Get it? Think about it.
dialog: Take your time.
dialog: Pause.
scene_heading: 38 INT, ANDREW'S HOUSE - SEATING AREA - NIGHT 38
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: And why would you do all this?
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Listen. Under my crooked exterior
dialog: I'm a simple honest man. What I've
dialog: said to you is true. I swear it. I
dialog: want to get rid of my wife. But I
dialog: want it to be solid--permanent. I
dialog: don't want her on my back. I want
dialog: her to stay on your back.
speaker_heading: MILO
text: This is a frame up.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Frame up? How?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: You want to destroy me. You want to
dialog: see me in jail. You get me to do
dialog: this and then shop me to the
dialog: police.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No, no. Tf I shop you you'll shop
dialog: me. So we'd both end up in jail.
dialog: No, listen. I take a strictly moral
dialog: position in all this. My wife is an
dialog: adulteress. She should actually be
dialog: stoned to death. But anyway, it's
dialog: up to you. Make up your own mind.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Are you asking me to trust you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don't give a fuck if you trust me
dialog: or not. This is a very simple
dialog: proposition. You have an expensive
dialog: woman and no money. If you want to
dialog: keep her--steal the jewels.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Why don't you steal the jewels and
dialog: give them to me?
speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: MILO

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Why would I agree to the divorce if
dialog: you're both walking away with

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: She wants a legal settlement. She
dialog: wants pazt of your estate.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Greedy.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: It's legal justice.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Never trust legal justice. You know

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: But--wait a minute--you get

speaker_heading: MILO

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Trust me.
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: But I don't.
speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: what you did was this. You invited

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: (shivering)
dialog: Don't do it. Listen. Don't do it.
dialog: Don't shoot. Please. Don't shoot
dialog: me. Please. I'll just go away--
dialog: quietly. I'll just get into my car
dialog: and go. That's all. You'll never
dialog: see me again. Ok? Don't shoot.
dialog: Don't use that gun. Please. You're
dialog: crazy. No--you're not crazy. You've
dialog: just got things wrong. Totally. I
dialog: don't want your wife. I hate women.
dialog: You understand? I hate women. I
dialog: hate your wife. You've absolutely
dialog: no reason to be jealous. Women are
dialog: not my scene. I'd rather do it with
dialog: a dog, or a goat, or a boy I knew
dialog: at school. His name was Dooley. I
dialog: called him Dolores. I hate women.

speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: That's the one thing he's not

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: I've seen her. He was nowhere in

dialog: knew he was coming to see you, you
dialog: see. In fact she insisted that he
dialog: came to see you, as I know you
dialog: know. She thinks you may have
dialog: killed him. She thinks you're round
dialog: the bend. She thinks you're a very
dialog: dangerous man.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Me? She's joking.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: So tell me, between ourselves, did
dialog: you kill him?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'll tell you exactly what I did. I
dialog: pretended to kill him. I shot him
dialog: with a blank. I frightened the shit
dialog: out of him. Your man was right.
dialog: Your spy--or whatever he was. There
dialog: were three shots. The first two
dialog: were real, the third a blank. He
dialog: was terrified. When I shot him he
dialog: fainted. When he woke up I gave him
text: a drink and a pat on the bum.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: ANDREW(CONT'D)
dialog: He left the house, his tail--if you

speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: You gave him a pat on the bum?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: Metaphorically.
speaker_heading: BLACK

dialog: the bum?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: How did he take it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ~ BLACK
dialog: The pat.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Oh he's a good sport. He told me it
dialog: was game set and match to me.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: So this guy had a sense of humour?
dialog: Is that what you're saying?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Oh yes. Oh yes, he left this house
text: with a twinkle in his eye.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: So, tell me--whaz was the point of
dialog: all of this?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Humiliation. It's nice to see your
text: wife's lover a shivering,
text: frightened, fucking wreck in front
dialog: of you. But as a matter of fact I
dialog: quite liked him. I found him
dialog: attractive. I thought we might
dialog: become good friends. The shortest
dialog: way to a man's heart is, as I'm
dialog: sure you know, humiliation. It
dialog: binds you together.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: You found him attractive?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I was trying to stand in my wife's
dialog: shoes, in a manner of speaking. I
dialog: was trying to find out what
dialog: attracted her to him.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: And did you?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Oh yes. He was really terribly
dialog: sweet. I could see why she fancied
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: I could see why he fancies her. I
dialog: thought she was very tasty myself.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Really? +
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: Oh yes. Sumptuous. Ready for
dialog: action.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: Oh yes. I mean, I'm an experienced
dialog: detective. So guess what I
dialog: detected?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What ?
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: That she's in love with her own
text: body. It makes her dizzy with
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You detected this in five minutes?
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: Well, thirty-five. Or lets call it
dialog: forty-five. Perhaps even fifty-
dialog: five. Or even a bit longer.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You stayed for tea?
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: And cakes. Yes, must be funny for
dialog: you to know your own wife is being

speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: follow you.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: You don't?
speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: with.
speaker_heading: BLACK

speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: Yes, the old one two. In like a

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: The hard school. Family life.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: But you keep cheerful.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: You've got it. I keep cheerful.
dialog: I've got an optimistic nature. Well
dialog: you have to if you're a policeman.

dialog: twitch.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Itch?
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: Twitch, mate. Twitch. So I'm

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I fired two live bullets to set up

dialog: it. It was a game. I told you. I
dialog: played it to the hilt. Not worth
dialog: playing a game if you don't play it
text: to the hilt.

speaker_heading: BLACK

dialog: Blood.
speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's impossible.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: This is blood, chum. Whose blood is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's impossible. It was a game. It
dialog: was a blank.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: No no. It was a game with real

speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: Naked?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I don't know...how those clothes
dialog: got there.
speaker_heading: BLACK
dialog: So you made him strip before you
dialog: shot him? Part of the humiliation,
dialog: was it? No. The thing is this. It
dialog: might have started as a game but it
text: got out of hand. The third shot was
dialog: live, it killed him. So where's the
dialog: body?
speaker_heading: ANDREW

dialog: I'm so glad you like my mind. Not
dialog: many people like my mind. Quite a
dialog: few people like my body but I can't
dialog: think of anyone who likes my mind.
dialog: That makes you unique. But then of

dialog: mind is the body.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Is that what they say?
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Well, somebody said something like

speaker_heading: ~ ANDREW

speaker_heading: MILO

speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: Over boiled eggs? Do you like eggs?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
