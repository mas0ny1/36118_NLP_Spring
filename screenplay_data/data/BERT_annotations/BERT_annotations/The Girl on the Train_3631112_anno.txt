speaker_heading: RACHEL (SOFT V.O.)
dialog: ..-My husband used to tell me I

text: repressing an inner pain. Focusing on her sketch book.
text: Rachel's eyes land on a MAN IN A SUIT, red hair, 50, pasty
text: and plain-- typing on a laptop. He looks up at Rachel. There

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I tend to smile when I’m nervous.
dialog: Sometimes, I laugh.

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: For a year, Mac and I lived in this
dialog: hunting cabin. We started fucking.
dialog: We were the saddest people we knew.
dialog: But in a way, that cabin made us

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I read once that when a train hits,

speaker_heading: DR. ABDIC

text: She brings it to her lips, but quickly realizes that she

speaker_heading: RACHEL (V.O.)

dialog: troubled mind...
text: NOW, SOMETHING PECULIAR HAPPENS...
text: ...a DARK-HAIRED MAN steps onto the porch, and embraces
dialog: Megan.
text: CLOSE ON: Rachel blinks.
text: The train stops at the station, allowing Rachel a closer

speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR (0.S.)
dialog: The next station is: Ardsley-on-

text: With every few steps Rachel takes, she manages to see another

text: Rachel enters the next car, running to keep her view as the

text: BOOM! Another train barrels by in the opposite direction,

scene_heading: INT. GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Rachel exits her train with scores of other commuters,

text: - Glimpses of a laptop, displaying an email with the subject:
speaker_heading: XXXXXXXX
scene_heading: BACK IN GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL:

text: And then to the email. We get a cleaner view. It’s a chain

scene_heading: INT. TOM AND ANNA’S HOUSE - DAY
text: RACHEL’S MEMORY: Rachel sits in front of an open laptop
text: staring at the email as Tom’s voice reads it.
speaker_heading: TOM (V.O.)

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know what they say: “You

dialog: stupid. But when I saw it was from

dialog: Agent.

speaker_heading: RACHEL /WOMAN
dialog: Fuck you, Anna Boyd!

text: still recording video as she continues her rant.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That bitch is living in my house. I
dialog: picked everything in that house. I
dialog: picked everything. I picked the
dialog: dining table, the kitchen table. I
dialog: wonder if she knows that I fucked

dialog: eats at. I just want to tell her. I
dialog: wish I could tell her. I picked

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...I could never find the words to
dialog: describe how I felt when I read
dialog: that e-mail, but this morning, I
dialog: did. I did. When I saw that woman

dialog: husband, I felt it. I felt... Pure.
dialog: Rage.
text: Slowly the Camera pushes into Rachel’s naked face as the
text: sound of the bar vanish.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ...-Like something has been taken
dialog: from ME again. If I could... If I
dialog: could, I’d just go to her house.
dialog: And I'd go in and find her sitting
text: at the kitchen table. I’d wrap my
text: hand in her long blonde hair and
dialog: jerk her head back. Just jerk it
dialog: back! And then I’d pull her down to

text: Rambunctious and loud, their noise consumes the train.
text: One YOUNG GIRL catches Rachel’s eye, regarding her frankly.
text: Rachel looks around and it seems like everyone is staring at
dialog: her.
text: Rachel's gaze careens out the window trying to see into
text: Megan’s house.
text: The image of Megan kissing Abdic flashes in her vision over

dialog: Move! Get out of my way! Move!

scene_heading: EXT. ARDSLEY-ON-HUDSON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS

text: CLOSE ON: Rachel's face is pale.
text: THE MAN IN THE SUIT stares at Rachel from across the

text: the words keep evaporating off her tongue.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERPASS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Rachel leaves the station and looks ahead through the ARCH OF
text: THE UNDERPASS-- the dark tunnel. She is driven onward by the

scene_heading: INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - SAME MOMENT

text: Rachel stirs painfully and we see her hair matted with blood
text: as well. She reaches for the phone. A voicemail from Tom

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (on speaker phone)
dialog: Jesus Christ, Rachel! What the hell
dialog: is wrong with you? I’ve spent the

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: With her husband, Scott Hipwell?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No. It wasn’t him. This man was
dialog: different. And they were kissing.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Wow. That’s pretty coincidental,
dialog: isn’t it? You just happen to be on
text: a train at the same exact moment
dialog: that a woman you don’t know-- but
dialog: somehow recognize-- is cheating on
dialog: her husband?
text: Rachel just stands there.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know it sounds crazy, but--
speaker_heading: RILEY
text: Neighbors saw a drunk woman in the
text: vicinity of her house Friday night.
dialog: Megan Hipwell does bear a
dialog: resemblance to Anna Watson.
text: Rachel braces herself for the accusation.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Mrs. Watson reported that you go to
text: their house sometimes uninvited.
dialog: And that on one occasion, you
dialog: actually broke in and took their
dialog: child.
text: Rachel is shocked at the thinly-veiled accusation.
speaker_heading: RILEY
dialog: Let me give you some advice. Don’t
dialog: go back to Beckett Road. Don’t
dialog: contact your ex-husband. Don’t go
dialog: anywhere near Anna Watson or her
dialog: baby.
text: Rachel's mind is racing, trying to replay Friday night, but

speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: I lie to Scott. I lie to you. I
dialog: mean I know that’s not the point of
dialog: therapy, but I have to keep things
dialog: vague. Jumble up all the men, the
dialog: Exes, the lovers. It doesn't matter
dialog: who they are. It matters how they
dialog: make me feel.
text: Megan looks straight at Dr. Abdic.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Lying is like taking a trip. It’s
dialog: like having a secret. It’s like
dialog: touching yourself and no one else
dialog: knows...
text: Dr. Abdic watches as Megan slides up her skirt and runs her
text: hand over her panties. She hangs her head back in bliss.
text: MEGAN’S MEMORY: Our Megan of today is having sex in a hotel
text: room. She thrusts atop a man who is lying on his back in the
text: bed. We can’t see his face.
text: BACK IN SESSION: A moment passes. Megan smiles.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Except you.
speaker_heading: DR. ABDIC
dialog: But you’re just pretending. You’re
dialog: just pretending to touch yourself.
text: Diffused by Abdic, Megan moves on.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Scott’s possessive. Jealous. He
dialog: likes to own me. He figures out all
dialog: my passwords. Which is kinda sexy.
text: Megan avoids Dr. Abdic’s penetrating stare.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: So, when I came home last night,
dialog: Scott was on my laptop wondering
dialog: why--
speaker_heading: DR. ABDIC
text: Scott’s behavior is not normal.
dialog: It’s a form of emotional abuse. Are
dialog: you ever afraid of Scott?
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: It’s not abuse. Not if you don’t
dialog: care. And I don’t.
speaker_heading: DR. ABDIC
dialog: Maybe it’s become a normal state
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: MEGAN
dialog: Is it normal I think about you all

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Are you an artist?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, I like to think so.

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (no time to spare)
dialog: So you said on the phone...you
dialog: wanted to tell me something about
dialog: Megan.
text: Rachel hesitates.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (hard to say)

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I’m sorry. I know this is a
dialog: terrible thing to hear. I know how
dialog: it feels.
text: Scott turns toward her, measured.
speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes.
text: A moment.
speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No no no. Thank you.
dialog: (changing her mind)
dialog: ok. Sure.

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: SCOTT

dialog: She talked to you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Oh no. I haven’t heard anything.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You know her well enough to know

dialog: many friends.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Well, I used to live nearby... She
dialog: and I, we took yoga... we took
dialog: pilates together. I think I should
dialog: go, I feel like I’ve taken up too
dialog: much of your time. So sorry to have
dialog: had to tell you that in that way.

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Do you think you'd recognize him
dialog: again? If you saw him?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I don’t know.

speaker_heading: DR. ABDIC

speaker_heading: DR. ABDIC

dialog: (to Rachel)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
