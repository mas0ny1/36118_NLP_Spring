text: Long shadows as the sun goes down.
text: A field, by a road, lined with a fence.
text: Snagged in the barbed wire are hundreds of plastic bags.
text: Refuse and litter, blown by the wind, until they were
dialog: caught.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: I’m twenty six years old, and
dialog: I’ve been a carer now for seven
dialog: years.
text: By the road, a car is parked up against the grass verge.
text: Standing by the car, a young woman with blonde hair, KATHY,
text: looks towards the fields.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: My donors have always tended to

text: - the same woman, KATHY, standing at the window of an
dialog: observation room.
text: She is absentmindedly twisting a metal bracelet on her

speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: I’m not trying to boast. It

scene_heading: INT. OPERATING CHAMBER
text: TOMMY is in the process of being sedated.
text: He also wears a metal bracelet.
text: Beside him, an ANESTHETIST is inserting a drip into his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: Especially keeping the donors
dialog: calm.
scene_heading: INT. OBSERVATION ROOM
text: TOMMY turns his head to look at KATHY.
text: Their locked gaze is held for a beat.
text: Then KATHY nods. Very slight. As if to say: it’s okay.
text: TOMMY continues looking a moment longer.
text: Then the ANESTHETIST’S drug takes a hold of him.
text: seconds, his eyes have gone heavy, then closed.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: Anyway, I’m not making any great
dialog: claims for myself.

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - EARLY EVENING
dialog: In a few
text: The plastic bags in the barbed wire snap and rustle in the
dialog: wind.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: I understand how other carers can
dialog: be resentful. They say: she’s
dialog: from Hailsham. No wonder she has
dialog: a great record. She can pick and
dialog: choose her own kind.
text: As we CLOSE IN on KATHY, leaning against the car, her hair
text: caught and whipped in the same wind...
text: «+. FADE IN the sound of children playing.

speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

scene_heading: EXT. HAILSHAM - DAY
text: HAILSHAM SCHOOL: a large Victorian house, set in flat,
text: empty countryside.
text: The sky above is bright blue and cloudless. The sun is
text: bright. It is an idyll of early summer.
text: The extensive grounds of the school are surrounded by high
text: hedgerows. Nothing seems to connect it with the rest of
text: the world except a single grey ribbon of road.
dialog: Title:
dialog: NEVER LET ME GO
text: The title is not seen, but is SPOKEN by TOMMY.
text: After a few seconds, a title does appear on the screen.
speaker_heading: PART 1: HAILSHAM
scene_heading: EXT. HAILSHAM GROUNDS - DAY
text: In sunlight, two girls, aged twelve, lie on their bellies
text: on a patch in front of the main house.
text: Both wear the metal bracelets - as do all students at
dialog: Hailsham, and all other facilities like it.
text: The grass is strewn with daisies.
text: One girl has blonde hair. This is KATHY.
text: The other is dark. This is RUTH.
text: KATHY is interlocking the stems of the small flowers,
text: frowning in concentration, making a daisy chain.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I think one day I'd like...
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p4.
text: RUTH pauses. Thinking a moment.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Four horses.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No, five. Thunder, Bramble,
dialog: Daffodil, and...
text: RUTH trails off.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t know all their names.
dialog: But I'd like five horses.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The best would be Thunder. He'd
dialog: be dangerous to ride, so you
dialog: can’t ride him. You can ride
dialog: Bramble.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As long as you don’t use your
text: crop on him.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I wouldn’t anyway. I would have
dialog: thought that’s mean.
text: KATHY makes the last link.
text: She lifts the daisy chain delicately.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Pretty.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You have it.
text: KATHY places it over RUTH’S blonde hair...
dialog: «+. where it looks like it belongs.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: «+. Look.
text: KATHY follows RUTH’S gaze.
text: By the entrance of the main house, two women have appeared.
text: One is older, in her mid sixties. This is MISS EMILY, the
dialog: head guardian of Hailsham.
text: The other is younger, in her late twenties.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's that with Miss Emily? Do
dialog: you think it’s the new guardian

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Miss Lucy. I think it must be.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We haven’t had a new guardian for

speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: I wonder if she’ll fit in.

scene_heading: EXT. HAILSHAM DAY - DAY
text: A group of boys in their PE kits, run through an outdoor

scene_heading: EXT. PLAYING FIELDS - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. ORNATE GATE - CONTINUOUS
text: «+. a group of girls, watching from the shade of a large

text: The girls are joined by KATHY and RUTH.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Ruth. Kath. Look - they’re
text: going to set off Tommy.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Light blue touch paper and stand
dialog: well back!
speaker_heading: 8A
dialog: 10
text: On the playing field, we see the boy they are referring to.
speaker_heading: TOMMY.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He really doesn’t suspect a
dialog: thing.
dialog: The girls all laugh -
dialog: - except KATHY.
text: KATHY watches TOMMY with slight concern.
dialog: 11
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pé6.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: He’s got his shirt on... His
dialog: favourite polo shirt.
text: From their vantage point, the girls can now see the boys
text: have started lining up. Two CAPTAINS have stepped forward
dialog: and are about to start picking teams.
text: One of the two captains is ARTHUR, a sporty boy who feels
dialog: as Alpha male as Tommy feels Delta.
text: The CAPTAINS start choosing team members. TOMMY stands -
text: almost a comical figure, puffing out his chest in order to
dialog: make himself stand out.
text: The other boys are noticeably less keen. Chatting, or
text: checking the tightness of their boot laces.
text: Even from a distance, we can sense TOMMY’S shift from
text: bright eagerness to puzzled concern, as four boys are
dialog: chosen before him...
dialog: Then five... six...
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s coming. Hold on... any
dialog: moment now...
text: «+. Until eventually TOMMY is left standing alone.
dialog: Realising he hasn’t been picked. And isn’t going to be
dialog: picked.
text: The boys all start sniggering.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Seven seconds. Six, five, four,
dialog: three...
text: And SUDDENLY - before RUTH’S countdown can complete - TOMMY
text: explodes.
text: Head is thrown back. Bright red. Shaking. Screaming.
text: The BOYS are now laughing openly -
text: - then start to run away, on to the football pitch.
text: Leaving TOMMY alone, directing his rage at the clear blue
text: sky, arms and legs oddly rigid.

text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p7.
scene_heading: EXT. ORNATE GATE - CONTINUOUS 12
text: The girls watch, a mixture of transfixed and absently
text: amused by this strange sight.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I suppose it is a bit cruel, the
dialog: way they work him up like that.
dialog: But it’s his own fault. If he
dialog: learned to keep his cool, they'd
dialog: leave him alone.
text: RUTH looks to KATHY, as if for approval -
dialog: - but doesn’t get it.
text: KATHY has stood, and is walking away from the gate towards
speaker_heading: TOMMY.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAYING FIELDS - CONTINUOUS 13
text: KATHY approaches TOMMY, who is panting from the exertion of
text: his tantrum, still gazing up at the sky.
text: KATHY puts a hand on TOMMY’S arm -
text: - and TOMMY recoils violently, throwing his arm up,
text: knocking her hand aside and striking the side of her face.
text: The strike is an accident - a reaction of surprise and
text: confusion more than anger - but TOMMY seems even more
text: shocked than KATHY by what he has done.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Isn't that your favourite shirt?
text: TOMMY says nothing.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: I just wanted to say, you
dialog: shouldn't play football in that
dialog: shirt. You’1l only cover it in
dialog: mud.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (mumbling, a little
dialog: stunned)
dialog: So what? It’s nothing to do with
dialog: you anyway.
text: TOMMY starts to walk away.

scene_heading: EXT. ORNATE GATE - CONTINUOUS 14 *
text: KATHY rejoins the girls, who are coming out of the
text: pavilion, and make an outraged fuss over her.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Are you all right, Kath?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I can’t believe he hit you!
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I don’t think he meant to.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Are you bleeding?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: He’s an animal. That’s what I
dialog: think.
text: KATHY doesn’t respond, and instead looks back to the
text: playing field.
text: Where she sees TOMMY -
text: - standing on the edge of the playing field, talking to the
text: new guardian, MISS LUCY.
text: TOMMY and MISS LUCY are too distant for us to hear their
dialog: conversation, but we can read some of the body language, *
text: when MISS LUCY reaches out and touches him lightly on the *
dialog: shoulder. *
text: Whatever MISS LUCY is saying, TOMMY is listening intently. *
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D) *
text: A mad animal.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 15
text: Children are lined to enter the MATRON’S office for a
dialog: medical examination.
text: The children are neatly lined, but chatting, and
text: unconcerned. These examinations are completely routine.
text: At the head of the queue are KATHY, RUTH and AMANDA.
text: A group of three children exit MATRON’S office, followed by
dialog: MATRON herself.

speaker_heading: MATRON
dialog: Next.
scene_heading: INT. MATRON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 16
text: KATHY, RUTH and AMANDA are being examined by the MATRON,
text: and two male DOCTORS.
text: The presence of the two DOCTORS, and some high-tech pieces
dialog: of medical equipment, feel unnatural.
text: One of the DOCTORS is listening to RUTH’S chest with a
dialog: stethoscope.
text: AMANDA stands in front of the second DOCTOR, with her arms
text: raised. The man is using his hands to feel around her bare
text: torso, as if looking for lump tumours or sensitivities.
text: MATRON is examining KATHY, making notes on a clipboard
speaker_heading: headed: KATHY H
text: She tilts KATHY’S head to the side, frowning slightly at
text: the slight bruise from where TOMMY accidentally struck her.
speaker_heading: MATRON
dialog: What’s this from?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Don’t remember.
speaker_heading: MATRON
dialog: Doctor.
text: The first DOCTOR glances round from RUTH.
text: He peers at KATHY’S bruise critically. For a beat or two
dialog: longer than would seem appropriate for such a small
text: contusion.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: It’s nothing. Just a bump.
scene_heading: INT. ART ROOM - DAY 17
text: A group of the Hailsham students are in the ART ROOM,
text: quietly working on paintings and sculptures.
text: In the corner of the room, another of their guardians, MISS
text: GERALDINE, is helping two of the children mix paint
dialog: colours.
text: At her table, KATHY works on a sculpture.
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH plo.
text: Meanwhile, RUTH pointedly leans over to the table beside
text: them, where TOMMY is working.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Tommy. What are you doing? Show
dialog: us so we can have a look.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (quiet, to Ruth)
dialog: No, Ruth. Don’t.
text: TOMMY looks up from his drawing, and sees a semi-circle of
text: faces looking back at him.
text: A beat, as he returns their gaze.
text: Then he spins the picture round so that it faces them.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh! It’s a -
dialog: (she feigns uncertainty)
dialog: - what is it exactly?
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: I think it must be a dog. Is it
dialog: a dog, Tommy?
text: One of the boys, ARTHUR - who had been one of the team-
text: pickers from the playing fields - joins in.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
text: It can’t be a dog. Its eyes are
dialog: too small. I think it must be a
dialog: kind of rat.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: Yes! That’s it! Tommy’s drawn a
dialog: rat. Ruth, do you think Tommy’s
dialog: rat will be selected for the
dialog: gallery?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I don’t know. Why don’t we ask
dialog: Miss Geraldine to come over and
dialog: tell us what she thinks?
text: CLOSE UP on TOMMY’S face - flushing.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
text: It’s not finished yet.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: That’s right. You need to draw
text: the whiskers.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It’s not a rat.
speaker_heading: 17A
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pll.
speaker_heading: AMANDA
dialog: And a longer tail.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (voice rising)
dialog: It's not a rat!
text: On the other side of the room, the raised voice makes MISS
text: GERALDINE’S head turn.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Here it comes!
text: The kids goading TOMMY wait expectantly.
text: Then TOMMY speaks.
text: And the calmness has returned to his voice.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It’s not a rat.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s an elephant.
text: He spins the picture back to face him, and continues to
dialog: work on it.
text: RUTH and AMANDA exchange a slightly puzzled glance -
text: - but let it go, because MISS GERALDINE is now walking over
dialog: to their table...
text: .+. and the kids return to their respective works.
scene_heading: INT. MISS LUCY’S STUDY - DAY 17A
text: In her small study, MISS LUCY is writing at her desk.
text: KATHY appears in the doorway.
text: MISS LUCY seems unaware.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Miss Lucy.
text: MISS LUCY looks up.
text: Then smiles.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Kathy. Kathy H.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pl2.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY
dialog: Yes, of course. Kathy H. Come
dialog: in.
text: KATHY takes a step into MISS LUCY’S office.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY (CONT’D)
dialog: What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I was wondering what you said to
dialog: Tommy.
text: MISS LUCY doesn’t seem to follow. Perhaps having to
dialog: remember exactly who TOMMY is.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: You said something to Tommy. Out
dialog: on the playing fields. And
dialog: whatever it was, it’s had quite
dialog: an effect on him.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY
dialog: I see.
text: Bemused, but seeing the seriousness in KATHY’S face, MISS
dialog: LUCY makes an effort to be precise.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY (CONT’D)
dialog: So - what was it I said? I
dialog: believe I was trying to calm him
dialog: down, because he seemed so upset.
dialog: And he explained that he was
dialog: often teased about things like
dialog: sport, and art. So I told him
dialog: that he shouldn’t get upset at
dialog: these things. The other children
dialog: are only teasing him to get a
dialog: reaction.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And if it happens that he isn’t
dialog: particularly good at sport or
dialog: art, well - it doesn’t matter.
dialog: It’s not so important.
text: KATHY frowns.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Not so important.
text: MISS LUCY shrugs, almost as if to shrug off the intense
text: gaze of the little girl in front of her.

speaker_heading: MISS LUCY
dialog: No. Not really.
scene_heading: INT. REFECTORY - DAY 18
text: Lunch, in Hailsham’s refectory.
text: Trays contain compartments filled with extremely overcooked
text: food. Grey meat and faded vegetables.
text: The kids take the trays from the food trolleys, then take
text: seats at long refectory tables.
text: KATHY is carrying her tray with RUTH, AMANDA and LAURA.
text: She sees TOMMY.
text: As the other girls move forwards with their trays...
text: ... KATHY hangs back.
scene_heading: INT. REFECTORY - DAY 19
text: TOMMY sits at a table with a few spaces around him.
dialog: We can sense he is used to eating alone.
text: Not least from the surprise in his face when he looks up,
text: and sees KATHY taking the seat opposite him.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Kathy.
dialog: (awkward)
dialog: Aren’t you sitting with the
dialog: girls?
text: KATHY looks around, as if half expecting to find the girls
text: either side of her.
text: Then she looks back at TOMMY.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I just checked, and I’m pretty
dialog: sure I’m not sitting with the
dialog: girls. I’m sitting with you.
text: TOMMY smiles.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I wanted to say I was sorry. I
dialog: didn’t mean to hit you when -
dialog: (he breaks off)
dialog: I mean, I wouldn’t want to hit
dialog: any girl. But particularly not
dialog: you.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pl4.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Well. It was an accident, that’s
dialog: all. *
text: A passing guardian, MISS GERALDINE, glances at TOMMY’S *
dialog: plate.
text: At the collection of over-boiled carrots, not eaten as yet.
speaker_heading: MISS GERALDINE *
dialog: Tommy. Finish those vegetables.
text: MISS GERALDINE moves on. *
text: KATHY leaves a calculated pause.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: So... you didn’t lose your temper
dialog: when they were teasing you
text: earlier. In the art room.
text: TOMMY nods seriously.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I’m not going to get angry like
dialog: that any more.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Because of what Miss Lucy told
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You notice everything, don’t you,
dialog: Kath?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I’m nosy.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You are.
text: AT THIS MOMENT, the seats immediately beside TOMMY and
text: KATHY are taken by some kids coming over with their trays.
text: About to reply, TOMMY seems to think the better of it -
dialog: apparently uncomfortable about their conversation being
dialog: overheard.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D) *
dialog: Why don’t we talk about it at the
dialog: pond.
dialog: 20
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pls.
scene_heading: EXT. POND - DAY 20
text: At the back of Hailsham, tucked away in the grounds, is a
text: large pond surrounded by bulrushes and over-hanging trees.
text: Hailsham is reflected in the water.
text: It’s quiet. Feels private.
text: TOMMY sits on a large flat rock, with KATHY beside him.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: She can’t actually mean that
dialog: being creative isn’t important,
dialog: can she?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: That’s exactly what she meant.
dialog: She said some children are good
dialog: at things, and some aren’t. So
dialog: if I wasn’t creative, there was
dialog: nothing wrong with it.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: But what about the gallery? If
dialog: being creative isn’t important,
dialog: then why have a gallery at all?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I don’t know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The funny thing is, even though I
dialog: don’t understand what she’s
dialog: saying, it helps. I’ve stopped
dialog: feeling so angry about things,
dialog: because -
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: - whatever I’m doing wrong, or
dialog: doing worse than the rest of you,
dialog: it isn’t my fault.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I think this shouldn't be spread,
dialog: okay? It’s not the kind of thing
dialog: that should get around, because

dialog: moment of chase, or slapstick...

dialog: emphasise, once again, that it is
dialog: much, much worse for a student of
dialog: Hailsham to smoke than anyone
dialog: else. I should not have to
dialog: explain that students of Hailsham
dialog: are special. Keeping yourselves

text: - and a song starts.
text: It’s a slow ballad. The singer, Judy Bridgewater, is
dialog: American.
text: KATHY is immediately transported by the sound.
text: She reacts as if it is the saddest, most beautiful song she
dialog: has ever heard.
text: As the song moves into its second verse, KATHY picks up a
text: small pillow from one of the beds, and holds it close to
text: her chest, as she starts to sway in time to the music.
text: By the time the second chorus comes around, she has learned
text: the melody, and picked up the repeating lyric of the
dialog: chorus: Baby, never let me go.
text: Her eyes close, and she starts to mouth these words...
text: ++. until the short song is over.
text: As the noise from the cassette player returns to the hiss
text: between music tracks, KATHY opens her eyes, as if waking
dialog: from a dream -
text: - to find herself looking at MADAME, framed in the doorway
dialog: of the dormitory.
text: Both KATHY and MADAME are frozen in the act of seeing each
dialog: other.
text: But whereas KATHY’S expression is simple surprise, MADAME

text: It shudders in the wind.
scene_heading: REVEAL MISS LUCY’S class. KATHY, RUTH, TOMMY, ARTHUR,

text: Until she speaks.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY
dialog: I don’t think I can keep silent

speaker_heading: MISS LUCY (CONT’D)
dialog: The problem is that you have been
dialog: told, and not told. That is what
dialog: I’ve seen while I’ve been here.
dialog: You have been told, but none of
dialog: you really understand. So I’ve
dialog: decided I’1l talk to you in a way
dialog: that you will understand.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know what happens to
dialog: children when they grow up?
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY (CONT’D)
dialog: No - you don’t. Because nobody
dialog: knows.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY (CONT’D)
dialog: They might grow up to become
dialog: actors, and move to America. Or
dialog: they might work in supermarkets,
dialog: or teach in schools. They might
dialog: become sportsmen, or bus
dialog: conductors, or racing car
dialog: drivers. They might do almost
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: MISS LUCY (CONT’D)
dialog: But with you, we do know. None

dialog: None of you will do anything,

text: Noticeably from TOMMY.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: A replacement will be found for
text: her, but in the meantime her
dialog: classes will be divided between
dialog: Miss Geraldine and myself.
text: MISS EMILY pauses.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: It is hard, is it not -
text: Abruptly, MISS EMILY breaks off.
text: In the assembly hall, the silence feels like a non-
dialog: sequitur.
text: MISS EMILY drifts inside a private thought pattern.
text: Children and guardians wait for her to continue. Which,
text: after a few moments, she does. With a heat injected into
text: her voice. Anger rising.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: It is hard, is it not, to

speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)

dialog: I will not be coerced. No! And

speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: I didn’t understand why, after

text: KATHY watches as RUTH turns TOMMY’S face towards hers.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They say girls are always mean to

text: In the back are six Hailsham students, now aged eighteen.
text: Among them, KATHY, RUTH and TOMMY.
dialog: KATHY and TOMMY we have seen before in adult incarnation,

dialog: My year were scattered to

dialog: working farm.
text: At the far end of the dirt road, a cluster of farm

speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: We called them the Cottages.
scene_heading: EXT. THE COTTAGES - DAY 63
text: A small collection of farm buildings, with a central house,
text: are nestled in remote countryside.
text: But it is not picturesque. It is desolate. Old farm
text: machinery lies where it was last used. A couple of
text: chickens run through the muddy space between the buildings.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: At the time, we thought the
dialog: Cottages were just a staging post
text: before the donation centers.
text: A MINIBUS pulls up outside, and the students get out, each
text: carrying a rucksack and a suitcase.
text: They all look slightly taken aback by what they see.
text: KEFFERS directs them unceremoniously to the main house.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But looking back, I can see they
dialog: were actually a training ground
dialog: of sorts. During our time there,
dialog: some of us would be expected to
dialog: volunteer as carers.
text: As the students walk to the house, they have to pick their
text: way across the mud. Their shoes are unsuitable. Their
text: clothing looks insufficient for the cold.
text: Standing in the doorway of the main house is a girl.
text: Slightly older. She wears a heavy jumper and Wellington
dialog: boots. This is CHRISSIE.
text: CHRISSIE watches them blankly as they approach.

text: On another sofa is CHRISSIE.
text: Entering the room is RODNEY, CHRISSIE’S boyfriend.
text: As he walks behind CHRISSIE, he gives her shoulder a little
text: squeeze. Then sits beside her, and she slips her arm into
dialog: his. As a gesture, it is clingy. As a rule, whenever
text: RODNEY and CHRISSIE are near each other, they hold each
dialog: other in such a way.
text: All of them have slightly glazed expressions -
text: - because they are watching the TV, which is showing a
dialog: generic American sitcom, circa early nineties.
text: In the background, other inhabitants of the Cottages come

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m not even saying I’1l apply to

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Ruth, I’ve been meaning to ask
dialog: you. Why do you do that thing -

dialog: whenever you pass him?
text: RUTH looks slightly confused.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I’m allowed to touch Tommy,
dialog: aren't I?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It’s the way you’re touching him.
dialog: You know what I’m talking about.

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: All that behaviour: it’s not what

dialog: thinking.
text: Hold on RUTH’S face. She looks angry - but unsure how to
dialog: fight back.
text: So she shrugs.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: So what? It’s no big deal. A
dialog: lot of us do it.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What you mean is, Chrissie and
dialog: Rod do it.
text: And now the anger on RUTH’S face becomes, for a flashed
dialog: moment, triumph.

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, Kathy. So that’s what this
dialog: is about. It must be awful for
dialog: you, surrounded by all these

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (hotly)
dialog: I never said that. I’m just
dialog: saying it’s daft: you copy what

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: But I’m right, aren’t I? And you
dialog: don’t like the fact that Tommy

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No, you're not right.

text: CHRISSIE bursts into tears.
dialog: Although the intensity of her reaction might simply be her

scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGES - DAY 72

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Quite a lot.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No we haven't!
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We did a lot of role-playing

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: CcuT TO -
scene_heading: INT. CAFE - DAY 77
text: KATHY, RUTH, TOMMY, RODNEY and CHRISSIE all sit around a
text: table in a small seaside cafe for lunch, looking at a menu.
text: A WAITRESS is taking their order.
text: As she waits for them to make up their minds, we see the
text: WAITRESS reacts slightly to the sight of the bracelets.
text: Not unlike MADAME, but perhaps better repressed. A frozen
text: quality in her gaze that betrays the inward shudder.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: I‘1ll get sausage, egg, and chips.
dialog: 78
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p56.
text: The WAITRESS nods and turns to TOMMY - who looks slightly
text: panicked, as if confronted with an elaborate menu at an
text: intimidating French restaurant. So he defaults to RODNEY’S
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Sausage, egg, and chips, please.
speaker_heading: RUTH
text: Yes. Sausage, egg, and chips.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Sausage, egg, and chips for me
dialog: too.
text: CHRISSIE laughs.
speaker_heading: CHRISSIE
dialog: I suppose I’d better get the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Right. Five sausage, egg and
dialog: chips. Drinks?
text: A beat.
text: Then KATHY, RUTH and TOMMY all look to RODNEY.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: Five cokes, please.
scene_heading: INT. CAFE - LATER 78
text: The five of them eat their lunch.
text: The cokes are circa 1970s bottles of cheap Corona Cola.
text: TOMMY seems distracted by the sight of the sea and the
text: shore line, just outside the window.
text: They are eating in silence.
text: Then CHRISSIE shoots a glance at RODNEY, who nods, almost
text: imperceptibly.
text: KATHY sees it.
speaker_heading: CHRISSIE
dialog: You know, there’s something I’ve
dialog: been wanting to talk to you lot
dialog: about. The problem is that back
dialog: there, at the Cottages, it’s
dialog: impossible. Someone is always
dialog: listening in.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p57.
text: Something about CHRISSIE’S tone feels a little over-casual.
text: Again, KATHY notices this - and also the way RODNEY has
text: leaned forwards, and is now watching RUTH closely.
speaker_heading: CHRISSIE (CONT’D)
dialog: So - it was just something we had
dialog: heard about Hailsham students.
dialog: Someone was saying that some
dialog: Hailsham students, in the past,
dialog: had managed to get a deferral.
dialog: Apparently, those Hailsham
dialog: students could have their first
dialog: donation put back by three, or
dialog: even four years.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As long as they qualified.
text: CHRISSIE pauses, and checks the faces of KATHY, TOMMY and
dialog: RUTH, for any clue that they know what she is talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: If there was a boy and a girl,
dialog: and they were in love with each
dialog: other - really, properly in love,
dialog: and you could prove it - then you
dialog: would be given a few years
dialog: together, before you began your
dialog: donations.
text: TOMMY is frowning. Clearly, this story is news to him.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Where did you hear about this?
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: When we were at White Mansion.
speaker_heading: CHRISSIE
dialog: People there used to go on about
dialog: this Hailsham couple. And when
dialog: the guy was only a few weeks from
dialog: donation, he just went to see
dialog: someone. He applied. And
dialog: everything got sorted out.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: They got three years straight.
dialog: Three years together, just to
dialog: themselves. Because they could
dialog: prove they were properly in love.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CHRISSIE
dialog: I suppose -

dialog: 80
dialog: 81
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

text: CHRISSIE can no longer maintain the enforced casualness of
dialog: her voice.
speaker_heading: CHRISSIE (CONT’D)
dialog: - you lot would know about that.
dialog: Being from Hailsham. You'd know
dialog: the rules about that sort of
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: Who is it you go to? Who would
dialog: you talk to if you wanted to
dialog: apply?
dialog: Silence.
text: Until it is broken by TOMMY.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: To be honest, I don’t know what
dialog: you're talking about.
text: A flash of anger in RODNEY’S face.
speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: Oh, come on. Do you expect us to
dialog: believe that? Everyone knows
dialog: Hailsham is special. So what is
dialog: it? Why keep all these things to
dialog: yourself?
dialog: Another silence.
text: Then KATHY says, delicately:
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: There were lots of stories in

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: RODNEY

dialog: irregular L-patterns.
text: Some of the OFFICE WORKERS are moving between the desks,

dialog: The sight of these workers - the sight of these normal

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: «+. Do you think it’s their lunch

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It must be...
text: With KATHY, RUTH, TOMMY, RODNEY and CHRISSIE, we watch the

speaker_heading: RODNEY
dialog: Yes. That’s her.
dialog: But it isn't. This woman is not RUTH’S genetic match, with
text: thirty years of age on her. And KATHY knows it.
text: The five continue watching the WOMAN for several moments...
text: ... then one of the other OFFICE WORKERS, a MAN, notices
text: the five young adults across the road, all staring in at
dialog: them.
text: The MAN nudges the WOMAN beside him, and gives a slightly

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Ruth - don’t -

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: We all know it. We just never

speaker_heading: TOMMY (0.S.)

speaker_heading: RUTH (0.S.)
dialog: Then what do you want? If you
dialog: don't want to make me angry, if
dialog: you don’t want me to be upset,
dialog: why would you say something so
dialog: completely stupid?
dialog: We can't fully make out the words, but we can recognise the

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: About the deferrals.

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I was thinking that if this

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Well - the Gallery for instance.
dialog: We never got to the bottom of it,
dialog: what the Gallery was for.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Pictures, poetry, sculptures. It
dialog: tells you something about
dialog: yourself. That’s the point about
dialog: art, isn’t it? It says what’s
dialog: inside you.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That’s what they used to tell us.
dialog: It reveals your soul.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p66.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Exactly. Your soul.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So suppose that the rumour is
dialog: true. A special arrangement has
dialog: been made for Hailsham students.
dialog: If they’re in love. There would
dialog: have to be a way to judge if
dialog: couples are telling the truth,
dialog: and not just lying to put off
dialog: their donations.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Well that’s what the Gallery
dialog: would be for. In the Gallery,
dialog: they can find out everything
dialog: about us that they need to know.
dialog: So if we say we’re in love, they
dialog: can look into our souls, and
dialog: they’1l know if it’s real love,
dialog: or just a lie.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That’s a strange idea, Tommy...
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Is it? I don’t see why it’s
dialog: stranger than any other idea.
speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: The true test of a carer is when

speaker_heading: HANNAH

text: She sees a wrist-watch, and some hair-clips...
dialog: -».- and a single Hailsham token. Kept like a lucky casino
dialog: chip.
text: KATHY reacts.
text: Then shuts the drawer.
text: Almost as soon as she has done so, KATHY hears a noise.
text: The toilet in the bathroom flushes.
text: KATHY turns, and, a moment later, the door to the toilet
text: opens.
text: Revealing RUTH.
text: She is struggling slightly to exit the bathroom, because
text: she is having to use a walker in order to stay upright, and
text: it’s awkward manoeuvring it past the self-closing door.
text: So for a moment or two, she doesn’t notice KATHY.
text: Then she has the walker past the doorframe.
text: And looks up.
text: Then freezes at the sight of KATHY. Momentarily stunned,

text: For a moment, the two women gaze at each other.

speaker_heading: KATHY

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That he’s done his second

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: +. What kind of things?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Oh, you know. How maybe, after
dialog: the fourth donation, even if
dialog: you've technically completed,
dialog: you're still conscious in some
dialog: sort of way. And then you find
dialog: out there are more donations.
dialog: Plenty of them. Except there are

speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Is it the end of the day already?
text: KATHY looks up to the sky.
text: The sun is low.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s funny. Over the last few
dialog: months, I’ve probably thought
dialog: about you every day. Hoping I'd
dialog: see you. And actually I felt
dialog: sure I would. It seemed
dialog: impossible that I’d complete
dialog: without seeing you one last time.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: It’s not the last time, yet,

speaker_heading: RUTH

scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Look - I was lying awake last

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: (casual)
dialog: I didn’t much think of where.
dialog: Just a trip.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Though a place did occur to me.
text: One of the boys on the next floor
dialog: was telling me about it. It’s
dialog: near the Kingsfield recovery

text: KATHY reacts slightly to the name Kingsfield.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Is it the boat? The one stranded
dialog: on the beach?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You're heard about it too?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: From a carer who had worked
dialog: there.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s quite a drive from here.
dialog: Are you sure you’re up to it?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Quite sure.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: (gently)
dialog: And do you suppose, if we're

dialog: think about calling in on Tommy?
text: Seeing as he’s staying at

scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY 117
text: KATHY drives up towards the main building.
text: Outside the front doors, there is a group of four people,
text: patients, standing and chatting.
text: RUTH makes a sudden sharp intake of breath.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Look. There he is.
text: One of the figures is TOMMY. Older, hair cut short,
text: thinner. But entirely recognisable.
text: He turns to watch the approaching car.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think he’s recognised us
dialog: through the glass?
text: As if in answer, TOMMY lifts his hand, as if shielding his
text: eyes from overhead light, and squints at them.
text: This sends RUTH into a slight panic.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: What do we do? Do we get out?
dialog: No, no, let’s not get out.
text: But KATHY has already opened the door.
dialog: We stay in the car with RUTH -

dialog: 119
dialog: 120
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH psi.

speaker_heading: KATHY.

scene_heading: EXT. KINGSFIELD RECOVERY CENTRE - DAY 118
dialog: 
dialog: Now we are with TOMMY and KATHY...
text: ++. aS KATHY is spun round by TOMMY’S embrace -
text: - so that she now faces RUTH, watching through the car
text: windscreen.
text: RUTH face is oddly blank, almost frozen, as if she is
text: watching people in a play.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (pulling back)
text: Ruth’s in the car.
text: TOMMY pulls back from KATHY, and goes to open the passenger
dialog: door...
text: .»+. and now it is KATHY’S turns to watch through the

dialog: cheek.
text: It is a different kind of greeting. More restrained. And
text: KATHY can see that.
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 119
text: KATHY’S car drives down a narrow, winding country road.
text: Almost a dirt-track.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 120
text: KATHY drives, with RUTH still in the passenger seat, and
text: TOMMY in the back seat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I can't believe I have the two of
dialog: you here. Does it feel to you
dialog: like we’re back at Hailsham
dialog: again? Like no time has passed?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: No. It doesn’t.
text: TOMMY laughs.
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH ps2.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No, it doesn’t at all, does it!
dialog: It feels really weird.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But good weird!
text: TOMMY laughs again.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: So I suppose you both heard that
dialog: Hailsham was closed. From what
dialog: you hear, the only schools left
dialog: now are like Morningdale. Like
dialog: battery farms, they say.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m sure it’s an exaggeration.
text: RUTH is looking out of the passenger window a little
text: anxiously, as the narrow road gets rougher and more
text: overgrown.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Are you sure this is the right
dialog: way?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes. I’m sure.
scene_heading: 121 EXT. NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 121
text: KATHY stops the car.
text: The dirt track has come to an end.
text: KATHY and TOMMY exit the car.
text: RUTH opens her door and peers out.
text: Again, we see the same slight panic in RUTH that we saw
text: when they arrived at Kingsfield and saw TOMMY. It is as
dialog: if, over the intervening years, all her power and authority
dialog: has gone.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: My walker is going to be useless

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: It’s okay. We’ll carry you.

scene_heading: INT. FOREST - DAY 122

dialog: considerable.
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Kath - really, are you absolutely
dialog: sure -
text: KATHY snaps slightly.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Oh do be quiet, Ruth. I’ve

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: 123B

scene_heading: EXT. SAND DUNES - DAY 123B

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you ever hear, Kath. About
dialog: the other students from Hailsham?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Sometimes.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I heard that Amanda completed on

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I think that happens more than

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: There’s no conspiracy. It does
dialog: happen sometimes. But it’s not
dialog: common.
text: TOMMY keeps gazing at the boat.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: There was a guy, at my centre.
dialog: He always worried he wouldn't

dialog: But it all turned out fine. He’s
dialog: come through his third now, and
dialog: he’s completely all right.

dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: «+. Forgive you for what?
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Keeping you and Tommy apart.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: It should have been you two
dialog: together. I always knew it, as
dialog: far back as I can remember. But
dialog: I kept you apart. It wasn’t just
dialog: because of the rumours about
dialog: deferrals. It was because I was
dialog: jealous. You had real love, and

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It’s not too late. Tommy. You
dialog: tell her.
text: TOMMY says nothing.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll see. Both of you. I

text: RUTH reaches into her pocket and pulls out a crumpled piece
dialog: of paper.
text: She hands it to TOMMY.
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Madame’s address. That’s

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: It wasn’t easy. But I’ve had

text: Many thousands of careful pen-strokes build up to depict an
text: ELEPHANT standing in tall grass.
text: It is oddly similar to the clumsy drawing that TOMMY did as
text: a child. In fact, compositionally it is the same.
dialog: But this drawing shows the opposite of clumsiness. If
dialog: anything, it shows a meticulous care, bordering on
dialog: obsessive.
dialog: And there is something strange about the surface of the

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: I started doing them when we were

dialog: something. Something about what

dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)

text: Her gaze is directed at one house in particular.
text: As she watches, in the background, a tall Nigerian man -

text: The old woman is wrapped and sunk into a blanket, and
text: though we do not see her face, it is in fact MISS EMILY.
scene_heading: EXT. KINGSFIELD RECOVERY CENTRE - DAY 131
dialog: 
text: KATHY and TOMMY walk around the Kingsfield grounds, by a
text: swimming pool which has been filled-in with concrete.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I checked the address.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We just go there. Next week,
dialog: I’ll take you for lab tests.
dialog: I‘1l sign you out for the whole
dialog: day. And we'll visit Madame on
dialog: the way back.
text: TOMMY nods.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: If we get this - she gives us the
dialog: deferral - and she gives us, say,
dialog: three years, just to ourselves...
dialog: what do we do? Where will we go?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I don’t know. Maybe they’1ll send
dialog: us back to the Cottages.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 132
dialog: 133
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pol.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Or maybe they have a separate
dialog: place for people like us. We’1l
dialog: have to wait and see.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We'll have to decide which of my
dialog: pictures to take. We’1ll only
dialog: take the best. Maybe six or
dialog: seven or them.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)

dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING CHAMBER 132
text: RUTH is strapped to an operating table.
text: She is surrounded by SURGEONS and NURSES, who are operating
text: on her opened torso.
text: Her eyes are open, but glazed.
text: RUTH blinks once.
text: The alarm on the heart-rate monitor starts to sound.
text: No one takes any notice.
text: RUTH flatlines.
text: The operation continues, unaffected.
dialog: Concludes.
text: And the various operating staff finish up. Scrub down.
dialog: Exit.
text: Leaving RUTH, her cadaver, on the operating table. Alone.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY 133
text: KATHY and TOMMY sit in the car -
text: - looking at a red brick terraced house.
text: A woman is outside the house, weeding large terra-cotta
text: planters in the front garden.

dialog: 134
dialog: 135
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pg2.
scene_heading: EXT. MADAME’S HOUSE - DAY 134
text: KATHY and TOMMY approach the front gate.
text: MADAME doesn’t appear to notice them.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Madame.
text: MADAME starts - and looks up. Confused.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. I didn’t mean to startle
dialog: you. But we were at Hailsham.
dialog: I’m Kathy. This is Tommy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We haven't come to give you any
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: From Hailsham...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If you haven’t come to give me
dialog: trouble, then why are you here?
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We came to talk to you. I’ve
dialog: brought you some things.
text: TOMMY lifts his bag.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Some things you might want for
dialog: your Gallery.
text: A long beat, as MADAME gazes at them, head tilted slightly.
text: Then she nods.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Very well, then. Come inside.
scene_heading: INT. MADAME’S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - DAY 135
dialog: 
text: The inside of the house is dark, and MADAME doesn’t switch
text: on the lights.
text: MADAME ushers TOMMY and KATHY into the living room, then
text: dissapears.
text: The living room was once two rooms, with the partition wall
text: removed, now replaced by a sliding screen.
text: The interior is lit by what light filters through the net
dialog: curtains.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p93.
text: It reveals a Victorian living room, with period furniture,
text: and a feeling of dust and age.
text: On one wall are two agit-prop posters, in support of the
dialog: Hailsham movement.
text: Opposite, a large watercolour of Hailsham is hung above the
dialog: fireplace.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Look.
text: He indicates the watercolour to KATHY.
text: They talk quietly.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Hailsham. It’s the bit
text: around the back of the pond.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: What do you mean? There’s no
dialog: pond here.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: No, the pond’s behind you.
text: KATHY seems slightly taken aback by the irritation in
text: TOMMY'’S voice.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You must be able to remember. If
dialog: you’re round the back, with the
dialog: pond behind you...
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes.
text: Their quiet exchange is silenced by noise on the far side
text: of the sliding screen: MADAME moving about. Then the
text: sliding screen is pulled back...
text: ... but apparently for no purpose. The rear half of the
text: living room - beyond what was once the partition wall - is
text: almost completely in shadow.
text: With the screen fully pulled back, MADAME enters the lit
text: area of the room, and indicates that they should sit.
text: MADAME takes a seat in an armchair beside the fireplace,
text: and KATHY and TOMMY sit on the sofa opposite.
text: As they get comfortable, there is a soft mechanical
text: whirring sound from the dark half of the living room, which
text: KATHY is distracted by.
text: Then brought back to focus by MADAME.
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pod.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: So.
dialog: Long beat.
dialog: Then:
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: We’re in love.
text: TOMMY turns to KATHY. Then back to MADAME.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: We're in love. True love.
dialog: Verifiable.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: We would never have bothered you
dialog: if we weren’t really sure.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Verifiable. I see.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Go on.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Well, we’d heard about the
dialog: deferrals. And we'd worked out
dialog: the purpose of the Gallery.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Tell me the purpose.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: To use our art from Hailsham to
dialog: look into our souls, which would
dialog: verify that we deserved a
dialog: deferral.
text: MADAME does not react.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: The trouble is, I was a bit mixed
dialog: up in those days. I didn’t
dialog: really do any art, so you never
dialog: took anything. I know that’s my
dialog: fault, and it’s probably much too
dialog: late...
text: He reaches down and opens his bag.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: +. but I brought some things
dialog: with me now.
text: He starts to lay the drawings out on the floor for MADAME
dialog: to see.
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pos.
speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Some were done quite recently,
dialog: but a lot of them are several
dialog: years old, so there’s a spread.
dialog: And you should have Kath’s stuff
dialog: already. She got plenty into the
dialog: Gallery, didn’t you, Kath?
speaker_heading: ON KATHY -
text: - looking at MADAME.
text: She's a step ahead of TOMMY. Realising the mistake that
dialog: she and TOMMY have made. Perhaps because, deep down, she
dialog: already knew.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: I’m sorry.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t know what to do at this
dialog: point. I never know what to do.
dialog: Should I let them continue, or
dialog: should I stop them now?
dialog: Silence.
dialog: It takes a moment to realise that this question was not
text: asked to the ether, but was directed at someone in
dialog: particular.
text: Someone actually in the room, who has not yet been
dialog: revealed.
speaker_heading: MADAME (CONT'D)
dialog: Well?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MADAME (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s you they’ve really come to
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I suppose it is.
text: The VOICE has come from the darkness at the rear of the
dialog: living room.
text: And from that darkness now comes the metallic whirring
text: again. A wheel turning.
speaker_heading: VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll take it from here.
text: A moment later, out of the darkness, MISS EMILY appears.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH py6.
text: A shrunken figure, pushed forwards on a wheelchair by her
text: nurse, GEORGE.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY
dialog: Leave us, George. I’11 call when
dialog: I’m done.
text: GEORGE turns and goes.
text: A moment between MISS EMILY, KATHY and TOMMY.
text: KATHY and TOMMY are frozen with surprise.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: Kathy H and Tommy D. I remember
dialog: you both. Kathy, a bright girl,
dialog: and so creative. Tommy, a big
text: heart. And terrible rages.
text: TOMMY remains motionless, holding one his drawings in his
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: We used to get two or three
dialog: couples like you a year. But not
dialog: so much these days.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're the first for quite a
dialog: while.
text: TOMMY still doesn’t quite understand.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: To apply for a deferral.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: There are no deferrals, Tommy.
text: TOMMY looks at KATHY, uncomprehending.
text: Then back at MADAME. Who gently confirms.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: There are no deferrals. And
dialog: there never have been.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY
dialog: We didn’t have the Gallery in
dialog: order to look into your souls.
dialog: We had the Gallery in order to
dialog: see if you had souls at all.
text: In the silence, MADAME stands.
dialog: 136
text: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH po7.
text: She goes to the Hailsham watercolour above the fireplace,
text: and gazes at it a moment.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: Hailsham was the last place to
dialog: consider the ethics of donation.
dialog: We used your art to show what you
dialog: were capable of. To show that
dialog: donor children were all but
dialog: human.
dialog: But it was all a mistake. We
dialog: were providing an answer to a
dialog: question that no one was asking.
text: MISS EMILY glances at MADAME.
text: Then back to TOMMY and KATHY.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: You have to understand. Cancer
dialog: used to kill almost everyone.
dialog: Now it kills no one at all.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You see, it’s not an ethical
dialog: issue. It’s just about the way
dialog: we are. If you ask people to
dialog: return to darkness, the days of
dialog: lung cancer, and breast cancer,
dialog: and motor neurone disease...
dialog: (she shrugs)
dialog: «+. they simply say no.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: MISS EMILY (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you understand?
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Yes.
text: MADAME turns to TOMMY.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Your drawings are very good. If
dialog: you want, I’ll keep them.
text: TOMMY doesn’t answer.
text: He just stares blankly into space.
scene_heading: EXT. MADAME’S HOUSE - DAY 136
text: TOMMY and KATHY leave MADAME’S house.
text: TOMMY walks ahead of KATHY, straight to the car parked
text: outside, and gets inside.
speaker_heading: + OH HHH HH
dialog: *
dialog: 137
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p98.
text: KATHY pauses at the doorway, where MADAME stands.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: Thank you for talking to us.
text: MADAME says nothing.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: KATHY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know what you’re thinking.
text: MADAME reacts, slightly dreamily, as if she has momentarily
dialog: lost focus.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: There was a time you saw me. It
dialog: was one afternoon, in the
dialog: dormitories. There was no one
dialog: else around, and I was playing
dialog: this tape. This music.
text: MADAME smiles distantly.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I still think about that occasion
dialog: from time to time.
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: ++. So do I.
text: A beat.
text: Then MADAME reaches out, and touches KATHY’S cheek.
speaker_heading: MADAME
dialog: You poor creatures. I wish I
dialog: could help you. But you’re by
dialog: yourselves now.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - EARLY EVENING 137
text: KATHY and TOMMY drive in silence through countryside, back
text: towards Kingsfield.
text: Shadows are long. The countryside is bathed in the last of
text: the day’s sunlight.
text: Fields line the road on either side.
dialog: 138
dialog: 139
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p99.
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: Could you stop the car? I’m
dialog: sorry. I need to get out a
dialog: minute.
text: KATHY turns to TOMMY, but TOMMY is looking directly ahead,
text: his gaze fixed on an indeterminate point.
text: KATHY slows the car, pulls over to the side of the road.
text: They stop on a small grass verge.
text: Without saying another word, TOMMY gets out of the car, and
text: shuts the door behind him.
text: Leaving KATHY in a little bubble of silence.
text: She watches as TOMMY walks a short way down the road.
text: Then stops, caught in the glare of the headlights.
text: Then, just as he did as young boy, on the playing field -
text: - he throws his head back and starts to scream at the sky.
text: Insulated from the sound, KATHY watches.
text: Then she opens the door.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 138
text: KATHY walks to TOMMY.
text: KATHY and TOMMY stand by KATHY’S car.
text: They embrace, holding each other tightly for several
dialog: moments.
dialog: Eventually, FADE TO -
scene_heading: INT. HAILSHAM - DAY 139
text: KATHY, twelve, sits in the art room.
text: She sees TOMMY, studiously working on his drawing.
text: Sees RUTH, working on her own drawing.
text: She watches them for several moments. In the afternoon
text: sunshine. The tree tops moving in the wind outside the art
dialog: room windows.
text: Then TOMMY looks up at KATHY and smiles.
dialog: 140
dialog: 141
dialog: 142

speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: Tommy completed on his fourth

scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY 140
text: KATHY’S car is driving along an empty road.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: I’ve been given my notice now.
dialog: My first donation is in six
dialog: weeks.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY 141
text: KATHY isn’t sobbing, but her eyes are filling with tears.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: What I’m not sure about is
dialog: whether our lives have been so
dialog: different from the lives of the
dialog: people we save. We all complete.
text: She pulls over to the side of the road, and gets out of the
dialog: car.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - DAY 142
text: KATHY stands by the roadside, collecting herself.
text: By the road are fences, lining the fields.
text: And caught in the barbed wire...
text: ++. are hundreds of abandoned plastic bags.
speaker_heading: KATHY (V.O.)
dialog: And none of us really understand
dialog: what we've lived through. Or
