text: DISSOLVE THROUGH ESTABLISHING SHOTS to door lettered:
scene_heading: DAVID HATCHER HUXLEY
dialog: Curator of Fossil Reptiles
speaker_heading: PRIVATE
text: Prof. Digges LaTouche, who is bald-headed and looks as if he might be a
text: Museum exhibit himself, enters from one side and knocks tentatively on
text: the door, which is immediately opened by Miss Alice Swallow -- on her way
text: out. She is carrying a notebook and wears a tailored waist with a tie,
text: tailored suit, flat-heeled oxfords. Her hair is drawn back very severely
text: from her face in a knot and she wears pince-nez glasses.
scene_heading: PROF. LATOUCHE
dialog: Oh, Miss Swallow -- is Huxley in?
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
text: (indicating by a nod across the corridor)
text: He's in the brontosaurus room.
scene_heading: PROF. LATOUCHE
dialog: I was just wondering if he'd heard anything from Utah.
dialog: (2]
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: (proprietary about David)
dialog: I don't think you can see him now, Prof. LaTouche. He has an appointment,
text: almost immediately.
scene_heading: PROF. LATOUCHE
dialog: (with a friendly smile)
dialog: I understand we're going to lose you tomorrow?
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: Lose me? How do you mean?
scene_heading: PROF. LATOUCHE
dialog: Aren't you and Huxley being married tomorrow?
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: At three o'clock in the afternoon. I'll be back at my desk by four-thirty
dialog: -- unless David wants to stop for tea.
dialog: (as he looks surprised)
dialog: He wanted to take the day off, but I feel that his work comes before
dialog: everything. If I didn't feel that way, I couldn't marry Dr. Huxley. I
dialog: belong in the Museum.
scene_heading: PROF. LATOUCHE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: That will work very well, young lady, until you have children.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: (with pride)
dialog: We have no intention of impeding his work with domestic life. You know
dialog: how he's been working in that room for nearly four years --
scene_heading: PROF. LATOUCHE
dialog: Ah yes, heart and soul!
dialog: (3]
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: (proudly, indicating what the room contains)
dialog: That will be our child.
text: She sweeps on into the room across the hall and CAMERA FOLLOWS. We
text: immediately see in a FULL SHOT the gigantic skeleton of a brontosaurus
text: and David perched on a high stepladder near its head. Chin in hand, he
text: sits on his high perch and absent-mindedly wriggles a jawbone of the
text: reconstructed skeleton, which fills the entire hall. Miss Swallow
text: approaches the ladder and looks up at him. He is still lost in thought.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: David!
dialog: (raising her voice)
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (deep in thought)
dialog: I'm not sure this isn't a part of the tail.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: You tried it in the tail yesterday, and it didn't fit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: That's right. So I did.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: Come down off that ladder. I have something important to tell you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (coming down)
dialog: And I have something important to tell you, Alice. I had a telegram from
dialog: Dr. Blakeley --
dialog: (Indicates giant spine)
dialog: and the last bone we need to complete this brontosaurus will very likely
dialog: arrive here tomorrow.
dialog: (4)
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: (excitedly)
dialog: The intercostal clavicle?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The intercostal clavicle! Think of it! Let's go out and celebrate!
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: (stuffily)
dialog: You haven't time to celebrate. You have an appointment with Mr. Peabody.
dialog: You're playing golf -- at Piping Rock.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Peabody? Who is Mr. Peabody?
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: Alexander Peabody -- as you should know, David -- is one of the biggest
text: corporation lawyers in New York. He represents Mrs. Carleton Random.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh yes. Isn't that the old girl who's going to give the Museum a million
dialog: dollars -- to complete this group?
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: Perhaps. A lot depends upon the impression you make on Mr. Peabody. And
dialog: don't call Mrs. Carleton Random ‘old girl’.
text: David smiles and kisses her on the cheek. This leaves her unperturbed.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: This is hardly the place or the time, David. Do go along or you'll be
dialog: late.
text: (calling after him as he goes out)
dialog: And don't forget your golf clubs!
text: (more loudly as he reaches the door)
dialog: And let Mr. Peabody win!
dialog: (5]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (absent-mindedly
dialog: Yes, dear.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 2 EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
text: We find Mr. Peabody and David walking down the first fairway. Mr. Peabody
text: has made a straight long drive and they are now approaching his ball. Mr.
dialog: Peabody is a gentleman of the old school, a man of high integrity and one
text: who takes his golf as seriously as he takes everything else in life. Mr.
text: Peabody's caddy is standing by his ball awaiting the approach of David
text: and Mr. Peabody. David, who has been feverishly selling Mr. Peabody on
text: recommending his cause to Mrs. Random, is still at it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't tell you, Mr. Peabody, how much this endowment would mean to the
dialog: Museum -- and to me personally. I wish you'd come to the Museum and let
dialog: me show you what we've accomplished in less than four years.
text: Mr. Peabody has silently selected a club, which he now waggles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (hovering over Mr. Peabody's shoulder
dialog: It's breath-taking! Unless you've spent your life among old fossils, as I
dialog: have, you can't realize the thrill -- the sense of power -- the almost
text: poetic ecstasy there is in fitting one bone to another.
text: Mr. Peabody waggles the club silently and with irritation
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you could just give me some assurance -- that you will use your
dialog: influence --
text: Mr. Peabody rests his club head on the ground.
dialog: [6]
scene_heading: MR. PEABODY
dialog: Dr. Huxley, when I play golf I talk only about golf -- and then only
dialog: between shots. We'll take this matter up over a whiskey-and-soda when
dialog: we've finished our game. I believe you hooked your ball.
dialog: (gestures)
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (backing away)
dialog: Oh yes, I did. I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody.
text: He starts off in the direction which has been indicated by Mr. Peabody.
text: Mr. Peabody waggles once more, makes a clean brassie shot and starts
text: after it down the fairway with satisfaction.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. GOLF COURSE - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY
text: David and his caddy coming through the brush that forms the barrier
text: between the first and the eighteenth fairway. David stops and the caddy
text: points past camera.
speaker_heading: CADDY
dialog: There it is, sir.
scene_heading: 4 MED. LONG SHOT
text: of the ball lying in a very conspicuous position, as Susan Vance enters
text: with a swinging stride. The ball is in the f.g., as David and Susan both
text: enter and converge on it from different angles. Susan has an iron in her
text: hand. She reaches the ball first, quickly takes a swing at it, making a
text: nice shot for the green. David calls sharply, but too late.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's my ball!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (turning on him reproachfully)
dialog: You shouldn't do that, you know.
text: She starts walking toward the green and CAMERA TRUCKS with them, as David
text: follows, protesting.
dialog: (7)
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (trying to keep his dignity)
dialog: But that was my ball.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't be ridiculous! Don't you see where it went? Right on the green!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That has nothing to do with it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (a trifle haughtily)
dialog: Oh -- are you playing through?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I've just driven off the first tee --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But this is the eighteenth hole and I'm right on the green.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But with my ball!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I never played the wrong ball in my life!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What kind of ball are you playing?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: A Spalding Special.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm playing a Dunlop Green.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (airily)
dialog: That doesn't prove anything.
dialog: [8]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (following her)
dialog: It will prove that you're playing my ball. A Spalding Special is marked
text: with two black dots. A Dunlop Green has a circle.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (as they reach the ball)
dialog: But this is the eighteenth green.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (trying to control his exasperation)
dialog: That has nothing to do with it!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (in chilling protest)
dialog: Please!
text: With dignity she takes a putter from her caddy. David points triumphantly
text: at the ball, as she gets ready to make the putt.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There you are! It's a circle!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Of course it is! Do you think it would roll if it were square?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (as she putts the ball into the cup)
dialog: I'm referring to the mark on the ball.
text: (dives on ball and pulls it forth triumphantly
dialog: You see, it's a Dunlop Green! My ball!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: What does it matter? It's only a game, anyway.
dialog: (9]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (trying to control his temper
dialog: My dear young woman, you don't seem to realize that you've put me in a
dialog: very embarrassing position. The most important corporation lawyer in New
dialog: York is waiting for me on the first fairway!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then it's absurd of you to be fooling around on the eighteenth green.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (in a quiet frenzy as he holds up the ball)
dialog: Do you mind if I take this with me?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, not at all.
text: (calls after him as he goes off, followed by his caddy
dialog: But it is my ball.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. GOLF COURSE - A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY - DAY
text: TWO SHOT -- David and his caddy, as they enter. David stares irritably
text: first at the ball and then at the disgusted face of the caddy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do I do now?
speaker_heading: CADDY
dialog: Well, Mister, first I'd hit her. Then I'd start all over.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. FAIRWAY - DAY
text: Mr. Peabody is waiting on the fairway as we hear a shout of ‘Fore!’ and
text: he ducks a golf ball that bounces past him. He is beginning to look
dialog: annoyed.
dialog: (10-11]
scene_heading: 7 EXT. AT FIRST TEE - DAY
text: David enters and doggedly tees his ball again. Rather grimly he takes a
text: driver from the caddy and begins to measure his swing. As he lifts his
text: club for the swings, an automobile horn toots nearby. He doesn't look
text: around but the sound throws him off-balance. He drops his club and raises
text: for another swing. Another horn -- which distracts him. As he raises the
text: club again determinedly, there is the crash of bumper against bumper. He
text: lowers his club grimly and looks around.
scene_heading: 8 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: WHAT HE SEES: In the parking space nearby, Susan is trying to move her
text: roadster out of a row of cars. She has smacked the car ahead.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. AT FIRST TEE - DAY
text: David is going on with his golf game, come hell or high water. He raises
text: his club again and this time there is a terrific crash. Slowly he lowers
text: his club and looks around.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: Susan in her car. This time she has backed smack against David's car and
text: has locked bumpers.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. AT FIRST TEE - DAY
text: David watches, dumbfounded. Over his reaction we hear Susan racing her
text: engine and grinding her gears in a series of terrible noises, as she
text: tries to extricate her car. David suddenly drops his club and strides
dialog: out.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: Susan is racing her engine. She extricates her car, pulling David's car
text: astern. David comes running and jumps on the running board of his car,
text: yelling the while.
dialog: (12]
scene_heading: 13 EXT. GOLF COURSE - FIRST TEE - DAY
text: Mr. Peabody stalks angrily into scene followed by his caddy. Near CAMERA
text: he stops and looks off with amazement.
scene_heading: 14 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: WHAT HE SEES: MED. LONG SHOT head and shoulders of David above a hedge.
text: David is standing in his car, shouting at Susan, who is blithely towing
text: him around the lanes of the parking lot. Susan and her car are concealed
text: by the hedge.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. GOLF COURSE - FIRST TEE - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE SHOT -- Peabody.
scene_heading: MR. PEABODY
dialog: (summoning)
dialog: Huxley!
scene_heading: 16 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: MOVING SHOT -- David being towed by Susan. CAMERA is now on opposite side
text: of hedge so that we see clearly David's predicament. David turns and
text: waves helplessly at Peabody as he rolls past.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
scene_heading: 17 EXT. GOLD COURSE - FIRST TEE - DAY
dialog: CLOSE SHOT -- Peabody for reaction.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: FULL SHOT parking space as Susan, gathering speed, tows David around a
text: lane that brings him past the hedge again.
dialog: {13]
scene_heading: 19 EXT. GOLF COURSE - FIRST TEE - DAY
text: Peabody watches amazedly, his head turning.
scene_heading: MR. PEABODY
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: Huxley!
scene_heading: 20 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: WHAT HE SEES: David's head and shoulders gliding smoothly along behind
text: the hedge. He turns and waves placatingly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
scene_heading: 21 EXT. GOLF COURSE - FIRST TEE - DAY
text: CLOSE SHOT -- Peabody, who is beginning to go to pieces. His gaze follows
text: David out of scene.
scene_heading: MR. PEABODY
dialog: (in a temper; to his caddy)
dialog: Put my clubs in the car!
dialog: (stalks out)
scene_heading: 22 EXT. PARKING SPACE - DAY
text: MOVING SHOT -- David, still standing. He looks after the departing
text: Peabody frantically, then slides down in the seat and viciously jams on
dialog: the brakes.
speaker_heading: 23 SUSAN
text: in her car stops so suddenly that she nearly goes through the windshield.
text: She looks around, extremely irritated.
speaker_heading: 24 SHOT
text: taking in both of them.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Will you please stop following me?
dialog: (14)
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (trying to say that she has his car locked)
dialog: You've got my car!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: Is there anything in the world that doesn't belong to you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, thank Heaven -- You!
text: (climbs out of his car and stands on his own bumper
dialog: Now go ahead!
text: Susan drops the clutch in and her car starts with a jump. The bumper's
text: clear on David's side but the other side holds fast and his car is slewed
text: around, striking a tree. He jumps clear but the rear fender of his car is
text: smashed against the tree.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (after a pregnant pause)
dialog: All right -- that's one fender. Go ahead!
text: This time she races her motor, drops in the clutch and tears his bumper
text: off with a terrible grinding noise. She nearly hits another line of cars
text: as her car leaps ahead. She slams on the brakes and stops in the nick of
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (after calmly surveying the damage)
dialog: Don't go yet! There's still another fender!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's that model. They don't hold up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I had a choice between this and a tank. I should have taken the tank.
dialog: (15)
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: I'm awfully sorry! I'll get you out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just back out -- please. And go slowly.
text: Susan backs with great dexterity and seems to be clearing the car
text: perfectly when her front bumper catches his rear fender and rips it off.
text: David climbs into his car. Susan starts to back out and he backs out
text: after her toward the parking space. Looking back, she inadvertently sets
text: her brakes and David smacks into her. She looks around indignantly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: There's no need to lose your temper!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (quietly frenzied)
text: I'm not losing my temper -- I'm trying to get back to my golf game.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Really, I'm at the end of my patience!
text: And she puts her car in gear, and tries to go around him. In so doing she
text: smashes his only good fender. For the first time he loses his temper. He
text: looks after her car as it rolls away down the driveway, then on a mad
text: impulse drops into gear and follows. As she goes out of the gate, he
text: comes around past her and scrapes her front fender. Her eyes flash. She
text: pursues him and takes off his fender. They keep up this game, ad lib.
text: director, until finally no fenders are left on either car and David is in
text: a ditch. Susan is disheveled but triumphant as she sails off.

dialog: (16]
scene_heading: 25 INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT
text: David enters in tails, carrying silk hat in hand. The head waiter
text: approaches him.
speaker_heading: HEAD WAITER
dialog: Good evening, sir. Have you a reservation?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm looking for Mr. Peabody. Alexander Peabody. I was told he is dining
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: HEAD WAITER
dialog: Mr. Peabody hasn't arrived yet, sir. Will you wait?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. Will you let me know when he comes?
speaker_heading: 26 FULL SHOT
text: at bar. We see a number of people in evening clothes about the bar.
text: CAMERA MOVES in on CLOSE SHOT Susan, who is carefully watching the
text: bartender do sleight-of-hand tricks with three olives. Susan, chin in
text: hand, is obviously trying to master his technique. We see that she has
dialog: watched this for quite some time and is beginning to think that if a
text: bartender can do it so can Susan Vance. Absentmindedly she places her
text: purse on the bar, shoves it a little away from her as she speculatively
text: takes a handful of olives from a large dish which stands before her.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: I've sworn I wouldn't eat an olive until I am able to do that. And I'm
text: getting hungry for olives.
text: She attempts a trick similar to his. We see the olive fly in a high are.
text: Susan's head tilts up and follows it and then as her head tilts down we
text: know that it has landed on the floor.
speaker_heading: 27 LOW CAMERA
text: A pair of masculine feet -- which we immediately place as David's --
text: stride in, connect with the olive. The feet jerk wildly and David crashes
text: into scene, sitting squarely on his silk hat. For a thoughtful moment he
text: just sits there.
dialog: (17)
speaker_heading: 28 TWO SHOT
text: as Susan enters and regards David.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hello. You're sitting on your hat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (without moving)
dialog: I know it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But that's silly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pensively)
dialog: I might have known you were here. The moment I sat down I had a feeling.
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: For six solid hours I've been engaged in a vain attempt to find the man
dialog: whom -- thanks to you -- I abandoned on the first toe this afternoon.
text: Then you throw an olive at me and I sit on my hat. It all fits perfectly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: The bartender was doing a trick. Sometimes the olives get away from him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sure it wasn't entirely his own idea.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well -- you can't learn a trick without dropping some olives. You -- you
dialog: -- have to practice.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (violently)
dialog: Go away!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I was here first.
dialog: [18]
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (rising, making a few feeble passes at concealing the pancake which has
dialog: taken the place of his hat)
dialog: Then I'll go away.
text: And he stalks out of scene. Susan stands, indeterminate for a minute. She
text: thinks of following him. Then she thinks perhaps she won't. She moves a
text: few steps to the left, wondering if people are noticing that she is a
text: woman who has been abandoned by a man for no reason at all, and then she
text: walks out of scene with an assumption of indifference. She is however
text: staring over her shoulder at David as she wends her way between the
dialog: tables.
speaker_heading: 29 DAVID
text: standing in the middle of the cocktail lounge trying to pretend that he
text: is there for a good time, that he has not sat on his hat and that the hat
dialog: doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: 30 SUSAN
text: enters to where Dr. Digby, a rather pompous dignified man of fifty in
text: full evening dress, is sitting waiting for his wife, who has gone to the
text: Ladies' Room and left her purse lying on the table. Susan's distracted
text: gaze falls on the dish of olives on Dr. Digby's table. She smiles
text: pleasantly at him as she reaches out, takes an olive and sits on the
text: lounge diagonally facing him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Do you mind? I've been trying to do this trick all evening.
text: She tries the trick unsuccessfully. The olive flies out of scene.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
text: (a little stiffly, watching the olive)
dialog: No. Not at all.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (reaches out again)
dialog: It's very difficult. The bartender can do it. I don't see why he had to
dialog: be so nasty about it.
dialog: (19)
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
text: (shoving the dish toward her
dialog: Won't you -- just take the olive dish?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, thank you. I can reach.
text: She tries the trick and by some happy circumstance pulls it off. She
text: looks as pleased as Dr. Digby looks surprised.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I did it! I knew I could! I'll bet he can't do it.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: You just said the bartender did it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I didn't mean the bartender. I meant somebody else.
text: Now she is freed of her vow not to eat olives. She makes conversation in
dialog: order to have free access to the olive dish.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Haven't we met somewhere? Your face is familiar.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Not to my knowledge.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (reaching for another olive)
dialog: I'm sure I've seen you somewhere. My name is Susan Vance.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: You may have heard me lecture. I'm Dr. Alfred Digby.
dialog: [20]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (depositing the olive pit in his ashtray and taking another olive)
dialog: Oh. What do you lecture about?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (on his favorite subject -- himself
dialog: Nervous disorders mainly. I'm a psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh. Crazy people.
text: She takes another olive and looks off at David, who is standing near the
text: steps watching for Mr. Peabody to come in.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (settling down to a good discussion)
dialog: We dislike the use of that word. All people who behave strangely are not
dialog: insane.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (now taking two olives, looking off past Digby at David speculatively
dialog: What would you say about a man who follows a girl around and then fights
dialog: with her if she speaks to him?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Is the young man your fiance?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: oh no. I don't even know him. I never saw him before today. He just
text: follows me and keeps fighting.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: The love impulse in man very frequently reveals itself in terms of
dialog: conflict.
dialog: (21)
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The love impulse?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Without my knowing anything about it, my rough guess would be that he has
dialog: a fixation on you. A fixation is --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (rising and staring off at David. This is a lovely new idea)
dialog: Wait. I can't remember any more. Fixation The -- love -- impulse -- in
dialog: -- man -- very -- frequently -- reveals -- itself -- in -- terms -- of --
dialog: conflict.
dialog: 
text: Convulsively she clutches at Mrs. Digby's purse, thinking it is hers, and
text: starts to follow out this new train of thought. CAMERA PANS with her as
text: she hurries to David.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (confronting David)
dialog: Do you know why you follow me? You have a fixation on me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've been standing right here. I haven't moved from this spot. And do you
dialog: know what's going to happen to you if you don't stop following me?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (fumbling in Mrs. Digby's purse in an attempt to find her handkerchief)
dialog: Don't be absurd! who's always behind who?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: I am not behind anything but the eight-ball. I haven't been for hours.
dialog: [22]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (staring at him, trying to fix him with a hypnotic eye -- and still
text: fumbling in Mrs. Digby's purse)
dialog: The love impulse in man very frequently reveals itself in terms of
dialog: conflict.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (staring at her blankly
dialog: Who what impulse?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The love impulse.
text: Before David can gather full violence for his answer she discovers with a
text: gasp that the purse in her hand is not her own. She looks at it blankly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, but this isn't --- Now where do you suppose --- Oh dear! Hold this --
dialog: don't go away. I'll be right back.
text: She thrusts Mrs. Digby's purse into his hand and, having obligated him to
text: stay by making him custodian of what he naturally assumes is her
text: property, she hurriedly exit in the direction of the bar.
scene_heading: 31 DR DIGBY'S TABLE
text: Mrs. Digby enters to Dr. Digby.
scene_heading: MRS. DIGBY
dialog: I'm sorry I was so long, Alfred.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: It's quite all right. I was having a very interesting conversation with a
text: young lady who does tricks with olives -- when she gets it right.
dialog: [23]
scene_heading: MRS. DIGBY
text: I got ‘way to the Ladies’ Room and discovered that I'd left my compact in
dialog: my purse.
dialog: (looks for her purse)
dialog: Alfred! Where is my purse?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Your purse, dear? I thought you had it with you.
scene_heading: MRS. DIGBY
dialog: Alfred! No! It's gone! My diamond pin is in it!
text: They start looking around under the table.
speaker_heading: 32 AT BAR
text: Susan leans over bar anxiously. Jean, the bartender, without a word
text: reaches down under the bar, hands her her purse.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh -- thanks. I was a little worried.
speaker_heading: 33 NEAR STEPS
text: David, looking helplessly and angrily at the purse, starts in the
text: direction of the bar, apparently intent upon returning Susan's property
text: to her. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he passes the Digby's table. Mrs. Digby
text: rears up just as he passes. She clutches simultaneously at David, who is
text: carrying her purse, and at her husband, who is still searching for it
text: under the table.
scene_heading: MRS. DIGBY
dialog: Here -- wait! Alfred!
text: Now Alfred rears up and rises.
scene_heading: MRS. DIGBY
dialog: Alfred! This is my purse! Have this man arrested!
dialog: [24]
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: That was very clumsily done, young man.
dialog: (clutches at the purse)
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (clutching back at purse)
dialog: Give me that! Let go my arm!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (who has been expecting a denial and has only one answer)
dialog: A likely story!
speaker_heading: 33A AT BAR
text: Susan, powdering her nose, suddenly looks over the top of her mirror out
dialog: of scene.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with a gasp)
dialog: Ooh!!!
text: (jams makeup back into her purse and hurries out of scene)
dialog: [25]
speaker_heading: 34 GROUP SHOT
text: Dr. Digby's table. Dr. Digby is holding fast to David, who is holding
text: fast to the purse.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: The contents of that purse are easily identified. It's madness for you to
dialog: stand there and say it is not my wife's.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (as Susan enters hurriedly)
dialog: This purse belongs to that young lady.
text: (points to it, looking at Susan)
dialog: Isn't this your purse?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (holding up her own purse)
dialog: No. This is my purse.
text: The head waiter now joins them.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Armand, I think you'd better call an officer.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (getting between them)
dialog: I gave him that purse. It's all a mistake. You see, I lost my purse and I
dialog: must have picked up your wife's purse by mistake and I wanted him to stay
dialog: here so I gave him your wife's purse while I went to look for my purse. I
dialog: was coming right back.
text: (brightly, as they stare at her, trying to unravel all this)
dialog: That's clear, isn't it?
text: Digby is stopped. His brain is so massive it takes a long time to turn
text: over. The head waiter speaks to him in a low tone.
speaker_heading: HEAD WAITER
dialog: I've known Miss Vance for a long time, sir. I think perhaps it might be
dialog: well to drop the matter, if you don't mind, sir.
dialog: [26]
text: David takes one murderous look at Susan and then turns and starts toward
text: the stairway. Susan trails at his heels, bleating. CAMERA FOLLOWS them.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now look! You can't actually think that I meant to do it!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If I could think, I'd have run when I saw you.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I haven't done anything. I just gave you a purse to hold, that's all. I
dialog: was going to find out who it belonged to.
text: David has reached the top of the stairs. He starts down hurriedly. Susan
text: makes a flying leap and catches one of his coat tails.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now wait! I can explain the whole thing!
text: She hangs onto the coat tail and David keeps on going. A perfectly
dialog: natural thing occurs. One thing has to give and it isn't Susan. There is
text: a soft tearing sound as the coat splits up the back. For a moment David
text: stops, stands absolutely still.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm afraid -- you've torn your coat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look -- will you do something for me?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: A needle?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wearily)
dialog: No. It's simpler than that.
dialog: (27]
text: David shifts his stance, unknowingly getting one foot on the edge of her
text: dress on the step. He raises his two hands in a pleading gesture.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why -- why yes. What is it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll close my eyes. This way.
text: (puts his hand over his eyes)
dialog: And you go away. When I look up you won't be there. I get tired of people
dialog: when I see too much of them.
text: (puts his hand over his eyes)
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, I like that! I was only trying to be nice.
text: She turns and flounces back up the stairs. She flounces however without
text: the rear panel of her dress, which is left under David's foot. David
text: opens his eyes to see her stalking up the stairs, her silk-stockinged
text: legs and lace panties showing. She is quite unaware of the disaster. With
text: a horrified look he snatches up the silken strip and rushes after her,
text: taking two steps at a time. He reaches her at the top of the stairs,
text: CAMERA FOLLOWING them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look here!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh no. You can't talk to me that way and then crawl out of it. When I'm
dialog: mad, I'm mad!
text: He races along beside her through the cocktail lounge, Susan increasing
dialog: her pace.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Something horrible has happened!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well don't tell me about it. Get out of it the best way you can. And you
dialog: can just stop following me, fixation or no fixation!
dialog: [28]
text: David, seeing the reaction of people in the cocktail lounge, agonizedly
text: gets directly behind Susan and swings into a lockstep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (over her shoulder)
dialog: If you'd only stop talking for a minute and listen!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Stop crowding me!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You've torn --
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Oh no, I didn't! If you hadn't been in such a hurry to get away without
dialog: listening to an explanation your coat would be perfectly all right. You
dialog: can't tell me I tore your coat. There's such a thing as being fair and
dialog: there's such a thing as being unfair. Now I --
dialog: (turns to face him)
scene_heading: 35 CLOSE TWO SHOT
text: Susan and David. David grabs her shoulders and pulls her around with her
text: back to him once more.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Let me go! The idea! Hauling me!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Please! Let's get out of here! just keep walking.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh! Now you want to walk! well, I'm not sure I want to walk with you.
text: She starts away. Once more he crowds up behind her. As he puts his hand
text: on her arm she catches sight of the strip of silk he holds and her voice
text: dies away in a strangled whisper.
dialog: [29]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's -- what I've been trying to tell you. You haven't any dress -- in
dialog: the back.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (frantically as she walks toward the corridor leading to the lobby,
text: CAMERA PANNING with them)
dialog: Get behind me!
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (agonized, to Susan)
dialog: I have to see somebody... Will you wait just a moment?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (without looking around)
dialog: If you leave me now there'll be such a screaming tearing row that you'll
dialog: be taken out of here by a policeman.
text: David fixes an appealing gaze on Peabody, turns his head and speaks
text: hoarsely as he passes him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!
text: Susan turns to go out the revolving door and David, still looking at Mr.
text: Peabody, continues in a straight line. After a split second he realizes
text: that there is nobody in front of him. A quick look around shows him Susan
text: nearly at the revolving door. He leaps back, gets behind her and as Mr.

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (airily)
dialog: Well, that's perfectly simple. Just explain to him that you met somebody

speaker_heading: DAVID

text: I can picture myself explaining our exit from the Ritz-Plaza to Mr.

speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: It's not Boopie you're trying to see!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, his name is Alexander. Alexander Peabody.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But that's Boopie!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (incredulously)
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Know him! He's my guardian. I was dining with them tonight. I can fix it
dialog: for you. I wind Boopie around my little finger. He does anything I ask
dialog: him to!
dialog: [32]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: If I hurry, I might catch him before he finishes dinner.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Wait until I change. I'll go with you. If we miss him there we'll drive
text: up to his house at Riverdale.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, but I can't spend that much time. Miss Swallow is waiting for me at

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Do they build all the houses in Riverdale alike?
dialog: [33]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't think so. Why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Because if they don't we've passed that one six times.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, have we? I guess maybe I've -- kind of lost my bearings.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think, Susan, that you lost your bearings some time ago. Because to
dialog: pass this spot six times --
dialog: (looking at his watch)
dialog: has taken us exactly an hour. Unless you have a fondness for this
dialog: particular house, do you think we could stop to inquire where we are?
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There aren't any lights. Mr. Peabody must be in bed.
dialog: [34-35]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: They couldn't be in bed this early!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If they anticipated a visit from you, they could -- with the covers over
dialog: their heads.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: If you don't stop nagging, I won't help you see Boopie.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (with some inner warning)
dialog: Somehow I have a feeling that it might be better if I didn't.
dialog: [36]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Scaredy-cat!
text: She hops out and strides toward the front door. David stares after her

text: follows.
scene_heading: 51 EXT. AT FRONT DOOR OF BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Susan enters in the dim light. David enters behind her, his premonitions
text: deepening. She starts to press the doorbell button. He stops her, with a
text: last stab at sanity.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Before you take the final step, Susan, I want to point out to you,
dialog: without rancor, that you are inclined to act on impulse and without
dialog: logic. If we wake him up in the middle of the night he may be irritable.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I tell you I can wind him around my little finger!
text: (she puts her finger firmly on the button and presses it)
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (staring into space)
dialog: I may be wrong, but it seems to me that everything that could happen has

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (reassuringly)
dialog: It's just been a bad day.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A masterpiece of understatement.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: Now just relax. Leave everything to me.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: I think we'd better go and come back in the morning. They don't answer.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (leaning on the button with renewed vigor)
dialog: They're just being stubborn... And if this doesn't work I know where
dialog: Boopie sleeps.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (puts his hand to his forehead, closing his eyes in sick despair)
dialog: Susan. Please! This has gone far enough.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (generously)
dialog: No. You've made me realize that it was all my fault that the most
dialog: important moment of your life was ruined. I said I was going to fix it
dialog: tonight and I'm going to fix it tonight!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But they won't wake up.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, yes, they will!
text: She turns from the door and starts around the house. David follows with

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan. You can't climb in this man's bedroom window!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I know. It's on the second floor.

dialog: Won't you please come away before we're taken away?
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: Well, of all the pigs! I must say if this is Boopie's idea of
dialog: hospitality, I don't think much of it!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (taking another tack to stop her)
dialog: It's too late, Susan. We'll come another time. You can't wake him up!
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: Can't I though!

dialog: Pebbles?
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: 56 CLOSE SHOT
text: from David's angle, on Mr. Peabody leaning out with a puzzled look as a

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You conked him!
text: Both stare up, open-mouthed.
speaker_heading: 58 CLOSE SHOT

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now don't you worry, David. Everything's going to be all right. We'll see
text: Boopie together -- when he's had time to regain his calm. There's not a
dialog: thing to worry about. I'll see you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (hesitantly, trying to find adequate words)
dialog: Wait, Susan... I don't want you to think that I'm not appreciative of all
dialog: you've done. But you may understand, when you're older, that there are
dialog: limits to what a man can bear. Now don't be offended. I don't want you to

dialog: being married.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Married? What for?
dialog: [42]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (going on doggedly)
dialog: Don't interrupt, Susan. I'm being married and my future wife has always
dialog: looked upon me as a man of some dignity. Privately I'm convinced that I
dialog: have some dignity.
dialog: (with growing vehemence)
dialog: It isn't that I don't like you, Susan -- in fact, I'm strangely drawn to
dialog: you in moments of quiet. But there hasn't been a quiet moment! Our
dialog: relationship from beginning to end has been a series of misadventures. I
dialog: will, if you will allow me, make my own appointments with Mr. Peabody --
dialog: unarmed. Now I must call my fiancee and try to explain why I left her at
dialog: Carnegie Hall this evening with a party of four. If I may be allowed
dialog: emphasis at this point, Susan, I would like to say that I sincerely hope
dialog: that I never, never set eyes on you again!

dialog: well, he might have a headache, Alice.

text: Susan on phone. She has bathroom door open and is trying to urge Baby in
text: with her foot.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Of course it isn't! Why would my brother be hunting stuffed panthers in
dialog: Brazil when he could buy them right here in New York?
text: (Baby goes into exile and Susan pushes door shut with her shoulder
dialog: It's lucky I met you yesterday, because you're the only zoologist I know.
dialog: Will you come right over?
text: (a pause and she looks indignant)
dialog: You mean you refuse to help me?
text: (we hear a loud SOUND through the receiver)
dialog: Wait!
text: (starts toward the small table where there is a fan)
dialog: He's looking funny at me!
text: (kicks over a chair and screams with admirable gravity. Quickly she
text: listens and then thrusts the transmitter against the rubber blade of an
text: electric fan. This makes a terrible roar, on top of which she screams
dialog: again)
dialog: Don't worry about me, David. I'll be all right.
text: Calmly drops the receiver, sits down to resume her coffee and the perusal
text: of Mark's letter. From the dangling receiver we hear again frantic
text: squawking SOUNDS. Susan, with an affectionate smile, reaches down and
text: pats the receiver.
scene_heading: 71 INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: David on telephone. Alice watching him bewilderedly. He is frantic as he
text: pleads for an answer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's happened? Are you all right? Answer me!
dialog: [48]
text: His ear is nearly shattered by another terrible roar from the receiver.
text: We know, without seeing it, that Susan has again placed the instrument
text: against the fan blade.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: David! What is it?
text: The next instant he nearly bowls her over as grabbing his hat and still
text: carrying the fossil, he dashes out of the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (hoarsely, as he exits)
dialog: Go along to the Museum! I'll join you there! I haven't time to explain!
text: Alice stares after him as he vanishes.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 72 INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Susan is sitting in the chair where we left her. She looks up calmly as
text: the door flies open and David dashes in and stops short, seeing her safe.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Hello, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan! Are you all right?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I'm all right. Except that I've got a panther.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stiffening with suspicion)
dialog: Where is this alleged panther?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (indicates)
text: In the bathroom.
dialog: [49]
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (as he stalks to the bathroom door)
dialog: I can see that I've been victimized once more by your unbridled
dialog: imagination!
text: As he speaks he is pulling open the bathroom door, which opens outward.
text: We see what he sees: a full-grown panther leaps out of the bathtub and
text: rears up playfully before him. David, dumbfounded, hastily slams the door
text: and leans against it tensely.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: See? That will teach you to go around talking about people!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (a man in a crisis)
dialog: Susan! You must get out of this apartment at once!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't be silly. I have a lease.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Then you must get this thing out! I'll call the Zoo!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No you won't call the Zoo! I'm going to keep him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (drags a chair and props it against bathroom door)
dialog: But you can't. I won't allow it!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with calm finality)
dialog: Mark says I'm to keep him, and I intend to keep him.
dialog: (picking up Mark's letter)
dialog: Listen!
dialog: (waves letter at him)
dialog: From my brother Mark. From Brazil.
dialog: [50]
dialog: (starts reading)
dialog: ‘Dear Susan -- I'm sending you Baby, a panther I picked up. Guard him
dialog: with your life. He's three years old, gentle as a kitten, and he likes
dialog: dogs.’
text: (pauses, frowns, then smiles apologetically)
dialog: I don't know whether Mark means he eats dogs or is fond of them. Mark's
dialog: so vague at times.
dialog: (continues reading)
dialog: ‘He also likes music -- particularly that song, "I Can't Give You
dialog: Anything But Love, Baby."’
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's absurd! Your brother is joking.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh no, it's quite. I tried it. Listen!
text: She goes to the victrola and snaps on a record. "I Can't Give You
text: Anything But Love, Baby" blares out. There is a scratching at the
text: bathroom door and the chair begins to vibrate as Baby tries to get out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: Stop it, Susan! Stop it!
text: But he is too late. The panther is already out and coming toward David,
text: who backs away.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (stopping the victrola)
dialog: There! You see? He loves it!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (shakily, backing away
dialog: If we put the victrola in the bathroom, would he go back in?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Stand still, David. Don't be nervous.
dialog: (51)
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still backing around)
dialog: Make him stand still!
text: (backs against the piano and closes his eyes in awful apprehension)
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, don't be silly, David. You can't make a panther stand still.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (weakly, holding aloft the package which contains the bone)
dialog: If anything happens to me, see that this is delivered to the Museum.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (coming to his rescue)
dialog: Nothing is going to happen to you, David. He likes you.
text: The panther rubs against David's legs and a convulsive shudder goes
text: through David's body.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Look, David, how cute he is!
text: David opens his eyes. The panther is now lying down at David's feet.
text: David sidles out to make a getaway, but instantly the panther is up,
text: ready to go with him. The panther simply loves him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (overcome)
dialog: I never saw anything take such a liking to anybody in such a short time.
dialog: It's sweet, David. Why, he'd follow you anywhere. We shan't have any
text: trouble taking him to the Connecticut house.
dialog: [52]
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (in revolt as he edges away from panther, who can't understand why the
dialog: nice man doesn't like him)
dialog: Susan, maybe you're taking him to Connecticut. I want no part of it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (following him)
dialog: But, David --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I will not be involved in any more of your hare-brained schemes!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: It's not a hare-brained scheme. Imagine -- Aunt Elizabeth arriving today
dialog: -- and running smack into a panther! That would be the end of my million
dialog: dollars!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (the panther still following him)
dialog: Now wait, Susan! Please! Let's take one thing at a time -- and slowly!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: If you had an aunt who was going to give you a million dollars if she
dialog: liked you, and you knew she wouldn't like you if she found a panther in
dialog: your apartment -- what would you do?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, since there is small chance of my ever being in that situation I
dialog: see no point in my trying to figure it out.
text: He reaches the door, holding the package which contains the precious
dialog: bone.
dialog: [53]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (clutching at him)
dialog: David! You can't leave me!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (instinctively protecting his fossil by holding it out of her reach)
dialog: Susan! Don't jump at me! I'm a nervous man! I should be at the Museum
dialog: with this -- right now!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But you have to help me!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Oh no I don't! There are two things in the world I have to do -- finish
dialog: my brontosaurus and get married!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Did I hesitate last night when you were in trouble? No! Do you think
dialog: there is anything I'd hesitate to do for you? No! That makes it an
dialog: obligation, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (doggedly)
dialog: My one obligation is to be married at three o'clock!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You'll be back in plenty of time! It's only to Westlake!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, I am a zoologist. I am going to marry a zoologist. That makes me
dialog: happy. This makes me unhappy. I have only one desire. That is to go and
dialog: complete my brontosaurus. Now!
text: And clutching his precious fossil he opens the door and stalks out. The
text: panther, who doesn't want him to leave alone, follows with alacrity.
dialog: (54)
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (indignantly calling to David from open doorway
dialog: Go on -- Quitter!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (stalking down the hall, unaware that the panther is at his heels)
dialog: It's no good calling me names, Susan. I'm not going to argue with you any
dialog: more.
text: As he turns to deliver this parting shot, he sees our friend Baby, who
text: has that ‘whither-thou-goest-I-will-go’ look in his eye. David points
text: sternly at the doorway where Susan stands and eyes Baby. He becomes
dialog: masterful.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Go back!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're wasting your time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (raising his voice)
dialog: Back, sir!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Promise him something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Baby, ignoring her
dialog: Get back in that apartment!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: There's only one way to get him back. That's for you to come back.
text: David stalks into the apartment and Baby follows. At the same pace David
text: stalks around a chair, eyeing Baby treacherously, makes a dash for the
dialog: door.
dialog: [55]
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (maliciously as he jerks the door open)
dialog: Well -- take care of yourself!
text: He slams it behind him, almost on Baby's nose. Baby sits down and regards
text: the door. Why doesn't the man like him? Susan also regards the door. With
text: malice aforethought she opens it. Baby patters out happily.
scene_heading: 73 INT. UPPER CORRIDOR - APARTMENT BLDG - DAY
text: David at elevator. The elevator enters scene and the door is opened.
text: David steps in and once more a door bangs almost on Baby's nose. This
text: time Baby doesn't sit down and regard the door. He turns and patters down
text: the stairs. The man is going down. Baby will find him.
scene_heading: 74 INT. APARTMENT BLDG FOYER - DAY
text: David emerges from the elevator, clutching his package, now concentrating
text: on the Museum and his lifework. He walks through the corridor. Baby comes
text: down the stairs, falls in behind him. They walk out through the entrance,
text: CAMERA FOLLOWING, and disappear.
scene_heading: 75 EXT. STREET - DAY
text: David, freed of his problem, starts to stride down Park Avenue all
text: unaware that he has a friend whose devotion seems to be one of those
dialog: lifelong things.
scene_heading: 76 EXT. AT APARTMENT BLDG ENTRANCE - DAY
text: REVERSE ANGLE on doorman of the apartment house as he watches the
text: progress of David and Baby with amazement. Susan comes into scene. She is
text: pulling on her hat. She dashes toward the curb where her station wagon
dialog: stands.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to doorman)
dialog: Morning!
text: Dazed, the doorman touches his hat.
dialog: [56]
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Good morning, Miss Vance!
text: Susan gets into the station wagon and drives out of scene.
scene_heading: 77 EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY
text: David is too absorbed in his thoughts to notice that his approach seems
text: in some queer way to push people off the street. They edge to the curb
text: and keep going in the other direction; in fact, without difficulty and
text: without being aware of it, David clears the streets. Susan, in the
text: station wagon, pulls into scene and drives along beside him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Who's your friend?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (calling)
dialog: They say once a leopard gets fond of a man there's no getting rid of him.
text: David, horror-struck, turns and looks. Baby rubs against his leg.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (the fiend)
dialog: I've been thinking, David -- he likes you so much that I think I'll give
dialog: him to you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can't do this!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (blandly)
dialog: Oh yes I can. If I can't get him up to Connecticut -- and I certainly
dialog: can't get him up to Connecticut if he keeps following you and you don't
dialog: go to Connecticut --
dialog: (shrugs, makes a resigned gesture)
dialog: the only thing I can do is wash my hands of him. He's yours.
dialog: (57]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He's not mine!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Prove it!
text: She starts to drive on. David runs out, with the leopard following, and
text: catches on to the side of the station wagon.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, you can't leave me with this!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I can if you don't help me take him to Connecticut.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
dialog: [Scene Details]
scene_heading: 78 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
text: MOVING SHOT station wagon bowling along. David sits in the front seat
text: beside Susan. Baby, in the back of the station wagon, is wistfully
text: peering into the front seat, wishing that they'd let him ride beside
text: them. He makes several futile attempts to achieve his purpose but is
text: pushed back by Susan, who is talking incessantly and, she thinks,
text: convincingly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: If you meant to be unpleasant during the entire drive, I don't see why
dialog: you bothered to come. I didn't ask you to come. You just jumped on the
dialog: runningboard and insisted. All I was doing--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (finishing it)
text: -- was leaving me with a leopard in the middle of Park Avenue.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (oblivious)
dialog: -- all I was doing was driving along. That's all I was doing.
dialog: [58]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: You blackmailed me into this Westlake trip. I have no assurance whatever
dialog: that I will come out of it with my sanity. Despite your protestations
dialog: that everything is going to be all right, Susan, I have the horrible
text: crawling conviction located at the base of my neck that something
dialog: dreadful is going to happen.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, David --
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (silencing her with a professorial gesture)
dialog: Don't interrupt. I was about to say that if I emerge from this -- this
dialog: temporary insanity, you are not going to blackmail me into anything else.
dialog: I intend to deliver this animal, take the first train to New York, finish
dialog: my brontosaurus and get married. I shall endeavor to forget that these
dialog: last twenty-four hours ever took place.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What's wrong with the last twenty-four hours? Nothing special has
dialog: happened except that we've got a leopard. That's nothing to get fussed
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If you don't mind, we won't go into a discussion concerning normal and
dialog: abnormal behaviour. I feel sure we wouldn't get anywhere. I feel equally
dialog: sure that, even if you could see things my way except upside down, I
dialog: could not carry on a sensible discussion while this beast is breathing
text: down the back of my neck.
dialog: [59]
text: Susan reaches back, without looking, and pushes at Baby's head.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Get down, Baby. Get down.
text: Baby doesn't want to get down. He wants to breathe down the back of
text: David's neck. Susan turns and concentrates on her task. Some way she must
text: please David. As she turns, the station wagon overhauls a wagon piled
dialog: high with crates of chickens, ducks, geese and, if you like, sparrows.
text: Anything feathered will do. David closes his eyes, knowing what is going
dialog: to happen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (agonized)
dialog: Susan! Duck!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Yes, I know! Geese, too! Hold Baby!
text: She skillfully hooks the rear wheel of the wagon. David covers his eyes.
speaker_heading: 79 SHOT
text: of chicken wagon on its side. The crates, which have been thrown off,
text: have burst open and the contents are fluttering and squawking in every
text: direction. The irate driver is clawing his way out through a number of
text: his charges, attempting unsuccessfully to gather them up. As he
text: approaches the station wagon, which has slewed and landed at the other
text: side of the road, he is shouting imprecations at Susan.
speaker_heading: 80 SHOT
text: of station wagon. Susan is trying to get David's hat up over his
text: forehead. In the excitement it has in some curious way managed to get
text: pulled down over his eyes. David is frantically waving his arms.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Leave it alone! My head will come with it!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now just be calm, David. I'll get it.
dialog: [60]
text: Meanwhile Baby has reared up and is excitedly watching his feathered
text: friends. He poises on the side of the station wagon, balancing for a
dialog: leap.
speaker_heading: 81 WIDER ANGLE
text: to include the chicken wagon. The driver halts in his steps. Abusing
dialog: Susan and David is one thing. Abusing Susan, David and a leopard is
text: another. As Baby leaps to the ground Susan sees him, abandons her
text: wrenching at David's hat and further confounds him in his temporary blind
text: state by climbing over him to get to Baby. David, freed of Susan's
text: tuggings, takes off his own hat with not too much trouble. Susan is
text: wading through ducks, geese and chickens, singing, "I Can't Give You
text: Anything But Love, Baby." The chicken wagon driver is backing away, which
text: is quite pointless, because Baby is not at all interested in the driver.
dialog: He is interested purely and simply in selecting the goose, duck or
dialog: chicken which will be most satisfactory to his palate. He pays absolutely
dialog: no attention to Susan.
speaker_heading: 82 CLOSE SHOT
text: David staring out of scene.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: Susan! Never hang on to a leopard's tail!
speaker_heading: 83 CLOSE SHOT
text: Susan, who has reached Baby and is desperately clinging to his tail,
text: singing, "I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby" She sings the next
text: speech to the same tune.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (Just as wildly, over her shoulder
dialog: Sing, David! Sing! He's slipping!
speaker_heading: DAVID'S VOICE
dialog: I can't sing!
text: The tail slips from Susan's hand and she falls on her back.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (shrieking balefully)
dialog: Now look what you've done!
dialog: (61)
scene_heading: 84 MED. SHOT
text: taking in station wagon and chicken wagon. The now thoroughly frightened
text: driver, who has abandoned his chickens in favor of his life, is hot-
text: footing it out of scene. Baby is crouched for a leap at a fine-looking
text: figure of a duck. David scrambles out of the station wagon and runs
text: toward Baby.
speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: "Don't worry, David. Everything's going to be all right."
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 85 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY
text: We find David operating a tire pump. He has his back to the station wagon
text: and Susan. His coat is off. His tie is off. His hair is rumpled and he is
text: madder than ever. Susan sits on the hood, chin in hand, and regards him
text: interestedly. Baby, equally interested, is lying under the wagon gnawing
text: at the other side of the tire which David is pumping up. Baby has
text: successfully gnawed through the tire, creating a space which lets the
text: tube which David is pumping to protrude. As it puffs out toward him, Baby
text: draws back and regards it with interest. He pats it tentatively.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why, he was right in the middle of the road, David! I never hit anything
dialog: in my life if it was in the right place!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: That wagon was on its own side of the road, Susan. Now don't try to crawl
dialog: out of it! How much longer am I supposed to pump?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't know. And I'm not crawling out of anything! I tell you I saw it
dialog: and it was in the middle!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: I saw it too and I say it wasn't in the middle! What time is it?
dialog: [62]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, it's about twelve o'clock, I guess.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: It doesn't seem to mean anything to you that I'm supposed to be back in
text: New York at three o'clock.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Can I help it if it takes you so long to fix a tire?
speaker_heading: 86 CLOSE SHOT
text: Baby, who is growing more and more interested in the bubble, which is
text: getting bigger and bigger. He rolls over on his back and tries patting it
text: upside down.
speaker_heading: 87 WIDER ANGLE
text: as David angrily stops pumping and turns to look at Susan.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But you can't just keep pumping a tire!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, I suppose you can't. Why don't you stop?
speaker_heading: 88 CLOSE SHOT
text: Baby. He pats the bubble once too often. It goes off with a loud bang.
text: Baby jumps back, hurt and surprised, and slinks around the side of the
dialog: wagon.
speaker_heading: 89 GROUP SHOT
text: David sinks dejectedly on to the runningboard, his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (brightly)
dialog: Well, at least, David, now that you've practiced it won't take so long to
dialog: fix it this time.
dialog: [63]
text: There is the sharp putt-putt-putt of a motorcycle approaching. A

text: which holds up his vehicle.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: (pointing to Baby)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (pointing to David)
dialog: It's his.
text: David stands up. He has had all he can bear. He turns and looks at Baby,

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I still maintain that it was going a bit far to tell that officer that

dialog: knife thrower.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, I don't know.
speaker_heading: DAVID

text: FULL SHOT of store, over which is a large sign:
scene_heading: WESTLAKE MARKET
text: There are gaudy circus posters in the windows of the market and we can
text: hear faintly from the distance a circus calliope. Cars are parked
text: diagonally along the curb in f.g. There are two open spaces, one of which
text: faces a fire-plug. As we DISSOLVE IN a big limousine enters along street
text: and pulls into the proper parking space in front of market. Dr. Digby, of

dialog: (moving toward door of market)
dialog: Hello, Constable. Yes, we've opened the house for the summer. It's good

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (climbing out, protesting)
dialog: This is madness! of all places, you want to stop in a town where there's
dialog: a circus!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't want to stop because there's a circus, David. We have to have

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But you say your house is only a mile away. why can't you send back for

speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Oh sure! Elmer and me --
text: (then catches himself; sternly
dialog: Suppose there was fire, right now, with cars jammed in here this way.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, we could all get to it if we were polite about it.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (getting dizzy)
dialog: The firemen have to go get to the plug, lady. We don't care whether you
dialog: get to the fire.
text: His back is to the station wagon, but Susan's isn't.
dialog: [68]
speaker_heading: 95 CLOSE SHOT
text: Baby, who has been lying down in rear of station wagon, as he raises his
text: head and peers past CAMERA into Digby's car.
speaker_heading: 96 WHAT HE SEES
text: The two chickens on the back seat of the limousine, which nobody can deny
text: are fair game. The window is open.
speaker_heading: 97 CLOSE SHOT
text: Baby as he rears up and prepares to go hunting.
speaker_heading: 98 TWO SHOT
text: Susan and constable, with the two cars in b.g. The first lines should be
text: played over the CUTS to Baby.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Is there a fire?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then why are we discussing it?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You can't park in front of a fire-plug!
text: At that moment Susan sees what we see: Baby crawling from the station
text: wagon into the rear of Digby's car, which immediately conceals him from
dialog: view.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (Vaguely, her mind grappling with her new problem)
dialog: You said that before.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: I'm going to stop saying it. I'm going to give you a ticket.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, I'd love to go to the circus, Constable -- but you'd better keep your
dialog: tickets, because I'm going to be busy tonight.
dialog: [69]
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (finding force the only solution)
dialog: Listen, lady, you're under arrest! Does that mean anything to you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But why?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (in a low dogged tone)
text: Parking in front of a fire-plug!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (having a brain-wave)
dialog: That's not my car.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (completely at a loss)
dialog: Whose car is it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't know. I never saw it before.
text: She begins to sidle off, smiling sweetly. Slocum stands his ground,
text: watching her suspiciously. Still smiling at him occasionally, she goes to
text: Digby's limousine and with a proprietary air brushes off a bit of dust
text: from a fender and kicks the tires speculatively. Slocum moves out of
text: scene, looking back over his shoulder.
scene_heading: 99 INT. MARKET - DAY
text: A number of customers are there, among them Dr. Digby, who is at the
text: vegetable stand inspecting the day's selection. David has been awaiting
text: his turn at the meat counter. Now it comes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I want twenty pounds of sirloin steak.
text: Digby, as does every other customer in the place, turns his head and
text: stares at David.
dialog: (70]
speaker_heading: 100 TWO SHOT
text: David facing the flabbergasted clerk across the counter. David is
text: bedraggled and dirty.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Did you say -- twenty pounds?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. I said twenty pounds.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: How will you have it cut?
dialog: (as David hesitates)
dialog: I mean, are you going to roast it or broil it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (with dignity)
dialog: Neither. It's going to be eaten raw.
speaker_heading: 101 FULL SHOT
text: as the clerk begins sawing up a huge chunk of meat on the block. Digby
text: takes a step forward for a closer scrutiny. He knows he has seen David
text: somewhere before and is visibly searching his memory.
scene_heading: 102 EXT. STREET BEFORE MARKET - DAY
text: Susan is trying to get Baby back into the station wagon. She is keeping a
text: wary eye on the door of the butcher shop. Baby, engrossed in his feast on
text: the floor of the tonneau, is adamant.
scene_heading: 103 INT. MARKET - DAY
text: The Clerk is wrapping the twenty-pound package of meat. David and Digby
text: are staring at each other.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Your face is very familiar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (smiling foolishly as he reaches for the package which the clerk is
dialog: handing him)
dialog: oh, it's one of those faces -- I meet people every day -- lots of people
dialog: -- who look just like me.
dialog: (71)
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: (as David takes package)
dialog: Do you grind it up before you eat it, Mister, or do you just out it in
dialog: hunks?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (as he backs away from counter, smiling foolishly at Digby the while)
dialog: It's not for me. It's for Baby.
text: He makes his escape hurriedly out of scene.
scene_heading: 104 EXT. FRONT OF MARKET - DAY
text: David comes out, carrying the twenty-pound package of meat and his
text: intercostal clavicle. CAMERA PANS on him as he starts for station wagon
text: and then stops short at what he sees: Susan backing Digby's car out of
dialog: the parking space.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (hurrying to Susan in protest)
dialog: Susan!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Come on!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (getting on the runningboard as she backs clear)
dialog: Susan! What are you doing? This is not your car!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, but it's my panther!
text: She races the engine and clashes gears horribly as she tries to get into
text: first speed. David, still expostulating, is hanging on to the
text: runningboard, somewhat hampered by his two packages, as Constable Slocum
text: strolls back and stands watching them.
dialog: (72]
scene_heading: 105 EXT. DOORWAY OF MARKET - DAY
text: Dr. Digby comes out. His arms are full of parcels. He stops, aghast.
text: There is a horrible clashing of gears over this.
scene_heading: 106 EXT. STREET BEFORE MARKET - DAY
text: WHAT HE SEES: The limousine lurching forward, engine racing. Susan is not
text: visible from this angle. David, hanging to the runningboard, is
text: apparently urging on the driver.
scene_heading: 107 EXT. DOORWAY OF MARKET - DAY
text: Digby and Slocum looking off.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: That's my car!
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Your car?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (with a yell)
dialog: Go after him! Catch him! I remember that fellow now! He tried to steal my
dialog: wife's purse last night! Don't stand there, Slocum! Do something!
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Well, can you imagine that!
text: He runs out of scene without any idea where he is going.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
scene_heading: 108 INT. STABLE OF THE VANCE ESTATE - DAY
text: Susan drives Digby's car in, shuts off the motor and climbs out. She
text: opens the rear door as David climbs out wearily, still carrying the
text: precious fossil. David is in a lather. He has had as much as he can bear.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, stop yapping at me! We're here! The panther's here! Everything's all
dialog: right!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: Everything is not all right. On top of everything that's happened, we
dialog: have stolen a car!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't want the car. I'll send it back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (they start leading Baby toward a box-stall)
dialog: I suppose you'd like me to leave it with the constable -- on my way back?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, no, I don't think that would be safe. They might arrest you. It's a
text: hot car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: I know. You're going to file the numbers off the engine!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (as though he were suggesting it
dialog: Oh no, David -- that's dishonest. I'll send the gardener back with it
dialog: tonight -- after it's dark.
text: David is speechless. CAMERA FOLLOWS them. Susan unlatches the door of the
text: box stall and they lead Baby within, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Susan pats Baby
text: and straightens up as she looks at David.
dialog: (74)
dialog: Now, David, I would suggest --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: The only way you could get me to follow one of your suggestions is to
dialog: hold a bright object in front of a light! You see, Svengali, what I want
dialog: is to get married! To get married I have to leave here. To leave here
dialog: without being arrested I have to have a shower. Where is there a shower?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: A shower is just what I was going to suggest.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 109 INT. VANCE BATHROOM - DAY
text: David is under a shower. We can see his head above the frosted glass door
text: of the stall shower.
scene_heading: 110 INT. GUEST BEDROOM ADJOINING BATHROOM - DAY
text: Susan rings a bell and begins picking up David's clothes which are laid
text: over a chair. We can hear David splashing in the shower. The package
text: containing the fossil bone has been set carefully on the chair. Susan
text: fingers it curiously and calls off.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What's in this box?
speaker_heading: DAVID'S VOICE
text: It's the intercostal clavicle of a brontosaurus.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with new interest)
dialog: Is it really?
text: (unwraps it and looks indignant)
dialog: Why, it's only an old bone!
dialog: (75]}
scene_heading: 111 INT. VANCE BATHROOM - DAY
text: David splashing under the shower.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes, it's just a bone! Don't touch it, Susan. Put it down -- gently --
dialog: (vehemently)
dialog: -- and go away!
scene_heading: 112 INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: Susan shrugs and tosses the bone down on the chair as Mrs. Gogarty, the
text: housekeeper, enters in response to the bell. Susan hands her the clothes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hannah, I want Gogarty to take these into town. Have them sponged and
dialog: pressed.
text: Mrs. Gogarty looks at the clothes and then off at the shower, where
text: David's splashing is heard.
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
dialog: Do you want them right back?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (airily)
dialog: Oh, there's no hurry, Hannah -- no hurry at all.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S VOICE
dialog: (over the shower)
dialog: Susan!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (pushing Hannah toward the door hastily
text: But do get Gogarty off to town before he misses them.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S VOICE
text: (loud and impatient as the shower is turned off
speaker_heading: SUSAN!
dialog: [76]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (as Mrs. Gogarty exits)
dialog: Yes, dear?
text: (goes to bathroom door and calls around it sweetly)
dialog: Is there anything I can do for you?
speaker_heading: DAVID'S VOICE
dialog: Hand me my clothes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: Oh -- your clothes. I'm afraid you'll have to wait, David. They're being
dialog: pressed.
text: David's head and shoulders appear at the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: I don't want them pressed. I want to put them on. I must leave here
dialog: immediately.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But. you can't leave without your clothes, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: I know that! That's why I want them!
text: (looking past her around the room)
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: The gardener took them into town.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: Stop him! I can't wait!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now don't be impatient, David. We'll talk about it after I have a shower.
dialog: Everything's going to be all right.
dialog: (77)
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (through clenched teeth as she starts for the door)
dialog: Everything is all right except that my fiancee is waiting for me in New
dialog: York to be married -- and I'm not in New York.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (turning in the doorway and calling back)
dialog: Don't be selfish. You had a shower.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: But I have to have my clothes!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: And I have to have a shower. I'll be in Mark's room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wildly, as she exits)
dialog: Susan, you can't leave me here like this.
dialog: But Susan has.
scene_heading: 113 INT. VANCE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Susan crosses to Mark's bedroom, calling back as she goes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: How you do go on! You get one thing settled and you start worrying about
dialog: another. Don't you ever do anything but worry?
text: David's head and shoulders appear at the guest bedroom door, as he calls
text: after her, anguished.
dialog: (78]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You've heard about marriage, haven't you, Susan? Would it seem to be
dialog: asking too much on my part to be allowed to worry about this thing that
dialog: is going to influence the rest of my life?
dialog: (on a mounting note of hysteria)
dialog: And while I'm worrying, do you mind telling me how I'm going to get back
dialog: to New York without any clothes?
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
text: (as we hear the shower from Mark's room)
dialog: David, I want you to be married. I think you should be married. I think
dialog: every man should be married. But I think your suit ought to be pressed.
dialog: It wouldn't look well.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Miss Swallow doesn't care how I look!
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: (from shower)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouting frantically)
dialog: I said Miss Swallow doesn't care how I look!
scene_heading: 114 INT. MARK'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Susan in the shower. She calls over the door.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Oh, but that's silly!
dialog: (79]
scene_heading: 115 INT. VANCE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: David emerges from the guest bedroom, clutching a feather negligee of
text: uncurled ostrich, with a train, about him, and strides out infuriatedly
text: in pursuit of an argument.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will you come out of that shower and help me find some clothes -- or do I
dialog: have to come in and get you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, David! You wouldn't!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (striding up and down -- to himself
dialog: No, of course I wouldn't.
dialog: (yells toward Mark's door)
dialog: Susan Vance, come out of that shower this minute!
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: I can't hear you, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (striding up and down with growing frenzy)
dialog: You can hear what you want to hear.
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: Oh no, I can't! I can't hear a thing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (striding around like an animal
dialog: Oh, you can't? Well, I think you're a spoiled, conceited little
dialog: scatterbrain! The first time I looked at you I knew it. The more I see of
dialog: you the more I realize it: The man who's unlucky enough to get you is
dialog: going to have a lifetime of misery!
dialog: [80]
text: Near the end of this speech he yanks open the door and stands aghast. For
text: he sees what we see: a well-preserved woman of 60, who is Susan's Aunt
text: Elizabeth and, though David knows it not, is also Mrs. Carleton Random.
text: Behind her are a uniformed chauffeur and an English maid, their arms full
text: of luggage. Aunt Elizabeth holds a leash, to which is attached a growling
text: dog. This is George, who in his own way has as many possibilities for
text: trouble as has Susan. Through the open doorway we can see a limousine
text: parked in the driveway. David clutches the negligee about him and backs
text: off into the living room again, speechless.
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: Now, David, you're being perfectly ridiculous! Just calm down and wait
dialog: till I get out there.
text: There is a dead silence as Aunt Elizabeth stares at David. George growls
text: and strains on the leash to get at him.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: Where are your clothes?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (completely disorganized)
dialog: My clothes?... Oh -- you mean my clothes.
text: (as George growls and strains at the leash)
dialog: Why, I -- I suppose you think it's odd my wearing this. I realize it
dialog: looks odd. I don't usually -- I mean I -- don't own one of these things -
dialog: - this isn't mine -- I'm -- I'm merely looking for my clothes.
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: David! Don't go, David! I'm coming right out! Are you there?
dialog: (81)
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
text: (pointing off brusquely as she glares at David)
dialog: Is that my niece?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still disorganized)
dialog: I -- I don't know -- who is your niece?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (violently)
dialog: Answer me! Is that Susan?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (meekly)
text: Yes. She -- uh -- she's, taking a shower.
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: David, can I come out? Are you decent?
text: David, rooted to the spot, makes some fluttering motions
text: and his mouth moves soundlessly.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Susan! Hannah! HANNAH GOGARTY!
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
text: (yelling as Hannah appears from the dining room)
dialog: Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Who is this young man?
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: Does anybody know? SUSAN!
dialog: [82]
text: with his arms
text: Susan appears from the doorway to Mark's bedroom, wrapping a huge
text: toweling bathrobe about her, her dripping feet tucked into mules. She
text: knows she is in for it and she enters gingerly, thinking
dialog: fast.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (in a frozen voice)
dialog: Why, Aunt Elizabeth! How nice to see you! What in the world brought you
dialog: up to Connecticut? I expected you to stay in the New York apartment.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (with a snort)
dialog: In this heat?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (beguiling)
dialog: I never dreamed you would be coming here. But I'm so happy to see you.
dialog: And here's George. Bless his little heart.
dialog: (bends to pat the dog)
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: You haven't changed a bit, Susan. Whenever you're in a jam, you gush. I
dialog: know you. You're trying to get out of something. What is it? Who is this
dialog: young man?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (thinking fast)
dialog: Why -- that's David. He's a friend of Mark's.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: What have you done with his clothes?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: His clothes?
dialog: [83]
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
text: She knows very well where his clothes are. Gogarty's taken them into
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (turning on David)
dialog: Why are you here?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: I told you -- he's a friend of Mark's.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: You keep quiet, Susan!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan brought me here.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't doubt that -- but why?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stammering)
dialog: Well, it seems very complicated -- but she wanted to bring---
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (cutting in frantically and lying rapidly)
dialog: Don't David---
dialog: (turning on her Aunt)
dialog: I had a letter from Mark, and he asked me to bring David up here--for a
dialog: rest. He's been working very, very hard, Mark says, and he's apt to have
dialog: a breakdown. He mustn't be excited. Whatever he wants to do, he must be
dialog: allowed to do it, Mark says---
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (pointing with a snort)
dialog: Does he want to wear that thing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (violently)
dialog: No!
dialog: [84]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (hurriedly)
dialog: Mark says he should be allowed to do whatever he wants to do. If he wants
dialog: to wear a negligee, he should be allowed to wear a negligee, Mark says --
dialog: because there's no telling, Mark says, what will happen if we don't give
dialog: him his own way.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (violently)
dialog: There's no telling what will happen if I don't get my clothes! I want to
dialog: be married!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Susan! I forbid it! I absolutely put my foot down! I'll cut you off
dialog: without a penny!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: If you'd listen to me instead of listening to her---
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (with finality)
dialog: I'm not going to listen to either of you. Not another word, young man,
dialog: until you're well! And meantime, Hannah, there must be some of Mark's
dialog: clothes here. He can wear these.
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
text: (addressing David as she points toward Mark's bedroom)
dialog: They're in there.
text: David gathers his finery about him and stalks into Mark's bedroom with as
text: much dignity as he can muster. Susan, seeing her prey on the wing, calls
dialog: after him:
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: David-- wait!
dialog: [85]
text: The bedroom door bangs behind David, and Susan turns on Aunt Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now look what you've done! If he gets some clothes he'll go away. And
dialog: he's the only man I've ever loved!
text: She dashes madly for her bedroom. Aunt Elizabeth looks after her and then
text: looks at Hannah.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: It's so like Susan to fall in love with a lunatic! Well, it's a good
dialog: thing I came. Bring in that luggage.
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
text: (as the chauffeur deposits luggage and goes for more)
dialog: How long do you expect to be here, Mrs. Random?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (unsnapping George's leash)
dialog: Indefinitely. I'm here for a long quiet rest. George needs a rest, too.
dialog: [86]
scene_heading: 116 INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: Susan has hurried into slacks and is wildly combing her hair, which is
text: still damp from the shower. The door to the living room stands open.
text: George enters curiously. Susan grabs her lipstick and dashes out of the
text: room to intercept David. CAMERA STAYS on George, who has found David's
text: fossil on the chair. He regards it moodily for a moment, then takes it in
text: his mouth and with an air of ownership stalks out.
scene_heading: 117 INT. MARK'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Susan is confronting David, who is now dressed, stock and all, for
text: hunting. All David could find was white riding breeches, boots and a pink
dialog: hunting coat.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But, David, you can't leave me here with Aunt Elizabeth -- and a panther
dialog: right out there!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I am not responsible for you or your panther. It's your problem. I, too,
dialog: have a problem. I still have to see Mr. Peabody. And I have to get
dialog: married!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: But the way to get to Mr. Peabody is through Aunt Elizabeth. He has to do
dialog: everything she tells him. If she says so, he'll have to be nice to you--
dialog: because he's her lawyer.
text: David, on the point of fleeing, turns and eyes her strangely.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's your aunt's a name?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Elizabeth!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (hoping he's wrong but knowing he isn't)
dialog: But she has another one.
dialog: (87]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh yes, of course. Naturally.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've made a mistake. Don't tell me. I don't want to hear it.
dialog: (starts for the door)
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's Random. Mrs. Carleton Random.
text: David sinks wearily against the door jamb and groans.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Out of seven million people, why--why did I have to run into you
dialog: yesterday?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (plaintively)
dialog: What's the matter? What have I done now?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mrs. Carleton Random is going to give away a million dollars.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (as if talking to an idiot)
dialog: I want it for the museum!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You can't have it for the museum. She's going to give it to me.
text: David puts his hands on her shoulders, as if making a dying request.
dialog: [88]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan--could you concentrate for just a minute? It's important to me--to
dialog: my work-- that your aunt never find out who I am. Can you remember that?
dialog: Just that one thing?
text: Susan is melting at his touch.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (Limply)
dialog: Yes, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pulling her closer)
dialog: You do understand, don't you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (languishing)
dialog: Yes, dear.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm going away from here. I'll never see you again. But --
dialog: (in anguish)
dialog: --don't--don't ever tell her my name! Tell her I'm Mark's friend! Tell
dialog: her I'm a crackpot, if you like. But don't tell her I'm David Huxley!
text: Pushes her off and strides out. Susan groggily comes out of the fumes of
text: love and follows him.
dialog: [Scene Details]
scene_heading: 118 INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: David strides in to get his precious fossil. He goes to the chair and
text: picks up the empty box. With a horrified look he turns smack into Susan,
text: who has followed him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: Where is what?
dialog: [89]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (frantically)
dialog: My intercostal clavicle!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (still in a trance)
dialog: Your what?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The bone! It's rare, it's precious! It took three expeditions and five
dialog: years to find that bone!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: My!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shaking her)
dialog: Where is it? What did you do with it? Give it to me!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I--haven't--got it--David. I didn't--swallow it!
text: He lets go of her, drops on his knees and starts looking under the chair.

text: Under a rose bush, George is pawing dirt over the buried bone. He regards
text: his handiwork critically from several sides, and then ambles off.
scene_heading: 120 INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY
text: David and Susan are crawling around, looking under furniture--everything-
text: -in a frantic search for the bone. Both peer under the bed. Their gazes
dialog: meet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (agonized)
dialog: Susan--try to remember! You're quite sure you didn't carry it somewhere?
dialog: [90]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, David. Why would I be carrying a bone around?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wouldn't dare give a reason for anything you do!
text: They crawl out simultaneously from under the bed. David slumps dejectedly
text: on the corner of the bed. Susan sits down on the other corner with her
text: back almost against his.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, there's only one thing to do. You'll have to find another bone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (coldly)
dialog: It took three expeditions and five years to find that one.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're making an awful fuss, David. Now that you know where the place is,
dialog: just send them back to get another one.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (his hands clenching prayerfully
dialog: All right--we'll leave that. The point is, if I don't find that bone, I
dialog: can't go back to New York!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, I think that's pretty silly--that a man can't go home because he
dialog: can't find a bone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan! Please! There are some things you shouldn't try to discuss. What
dialog: an intercostal clavicle means to science--and to me--is beyond your
dialog: capacity. Where you can help is to remember where you put it.
dialog: (91)
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (plaintively, pointing)
dialog: I put it there--where I found it!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you see anybody else in here?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Nobody! Nobody but--
dialog: (with illumination)
dialog: --George!
text: They look at each other, speechless. Both rise on a common impulse and
text: start for the door.
scene_heading: 121 INT. VANCE LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Susan and David come dashing from the guest bedroom and encounter Aunt
text: Elizabeth in the entry. Aunt Elizabeth stares at David's weird attire.
text: David hurtles past them both and out the front door.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: Where's George?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Susan, I want to talk to you-- alone!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (looking after David)
dialog: But, Auntie, I have to find George.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: why?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: David wants him. David loves him. He thinks he's such a nice dog.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Nonsense! George is a fiend, as you perfectly well know.
dialog: [92]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I know. But David doesn't,
text: (and to her aunt's astonishment, she dashes on past in pursuit of David;
dialog: calling)
dialog: Da-vid! Wait for me!
scene_heading: 122 EXT. GARDEN - DAY
text: David is walking around a bush, snapping his fingers and whistling
text: luringly. Susan dashes in to him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't do that, David. If the nasty little beast knows you want him, he'll
dialog: hide.
text: She puts her finger to her lips and they start tiptoeing across the
text: garden, CAMERA FOLLOWING. George, who has been spying on them all the
text: while, appears from behind a hedge and follows at David's heels. His
text: muzzle and paws are covered with fresh earth. He keeps his nose an half-
text: inch from David's ankle, prepared to bite him if he walks too fast,
text: prepared to bite him if he walks too slow, prepared to bite him anyway if
text: the mood hits him. David stops suddenly in despair.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, this isn't getting us anywhere. We'll never find the worthless
dialog: brute!
text: Both start and turn as George growls at David.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (deceitfully)
dialog: Oh, here's the little doggie! Isn't he a dear David?
text: She and David drop on their hands and knees and Susan quickly snatches
text: one of George's paws so that he cannot get away. George growls.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (indicating George's earthy muzzle and paws with agitation)
dialog: Look! He's been digging! He's buried it!
dialog: [93]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh dear! There are twenty-six acres in this garden!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (sternly to George)
dialog: Come on now--where did you put that bono?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: Oh no, David, not that way!
dialog: (cooingly to George)
dialog: Now, George, we're not angry. Susan and David need that bone. It's a
dialog: nasty old bone. It's hundreds of years old. Susan will get you a nice
dialog: fresh bone, if you'll show us where it is.
text: George sits down and looks bored.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (bitterly addressing the dog)
dialog: You cur!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (warningly)
dialog: David, don't! You'll ruin everything. Spell it!
dialog: (sweetly to George)
dialog: Now, darling, don't be stubborn. Susan loves you. Let's dig. Come on,
dialog: George--let's dig.
text: She brushes the earth suggestively, showing George, who knows how to dig
text: better than she does, what she means by ‘dig.’ George seems to get the
text: idea. He rises and stalks off. Susan clutches David's arm excitedly as
text: they follow.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: See? You just have to know how to handle him. Everything's going to be
dialog: all right, David.
dialog: (94)
dialog: 123
text: The spot where we saw George bury the fossil. George comes stalking into
text: scene with Susan and David following expectantly. It is obvious that
text: George is leading them to his buried treasure. In a moment we see that
text: George has no such intention. He walks calmly over the spot and David and
text: Susan follow him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (in a hushed voice)
dialog: He's going to dig in a minute. I can tell.
text: Sure enough, George digs, but not in the right spot. Susan and David drop
text: on their hands and knees and help him dig with growing enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (talking to both David and George, in different tones)
dialog: Good George! That's right! Good George!... You see, David, it's all very
dialog: simple if you just keep your head... Don't stop digging, dear. That's a
dialog: fine dog... Isn't he a strong little man, David?
text: David is digging with silent determination. After a few minutes of
text: frantic digging, quite a nice hole has been made. George calmly lies down
text: in it, puts his head on his paws and shuts his eyes. For a moment Susan
text: and David, on their hands and knees, stare at him in hurt surprise.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (through clenched teeth)
dialog: You unfeeling beast!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (frightened)
dialog: Oh, David, don't!
text: (lifts George out of the hole and sets him on his feet; her voice
dialog: honeyed)
dialog: If you're tired, dear, just show David and Susan, and they'll dig.
text: George seems to get the idea and ambles off. They follow.

scene_heading: 124 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF GARDEN - AFTERNOON
text: Gogarty, perspiration dripping from him, is filling holes. He has a good
text: many to go, running in a zigzag line. Wearily and irritably he scoops
text: dirt into the gaping hole which he is working on, tamps down the earth,
text: leans on his spade and regards what lies ahead of him: holes stretching
text: in an interminable zigzag line. Aunt Elizabeth enters to him from the
text: house. She stands regarding the holes and Gogarty.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: What are you planting?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (straightening irritably
dialog: I would not be planting anything in a crooked line, ma'am. That you know.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Then why are you digging holes?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: I'm not digging holes. I'm filling up holes.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: But you can't fill up holes until after they've been dug. You must have
dialog: dug them first.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Mrs. Random, I dug nothing. I'm merely trying to repair the damage which
dialog: has been done to the finest garden in Westlake County. And I have it in
dialog: my mind, Mrs. Random, to say just one thing. If Miss Susan wants to dig,
dialog: why don't you get her a sandpile?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: What has Miss Susan to do with it?
dialog: [96]
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Miss Susan has everything to do with it. Miss Susan and that young man
dialog: and your dog, Mrs. Random, are careening around this garden just digging
dialog: wherever they see fit. Follow these holes and you'll find her. It will be
dialog: the work of years for me to repair this afternoon's foolish foolishness.
text: Aunt Elizabeth looks off-scene, puzzled, and goes in the direction in
dialog: which the holes lead.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (bending back to his task)
dialog: And, furthermore, I should say, Mrs. Random, if you want a gardener
dialog: who'll put up with anything you can just get another man. It's not
text: Gogarty who'll be the tool of every whim of a twenty-year-old girl.
scene_heading: 125 EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
text: Susan, David, and George. David has completed the hole. He leans on his
text: spade wearily and looks inquiringly at George. George, who is now tired
text: of digging or of seeing anyone else dig, puts the seal of finality on the
text: whole business. With a burst of energy he begins filling the hole.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (in a bitter voice as he leans unmoving on his spade)
dialog: Oh, don't exhaust yourself, George. Let me do it.
scene_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH'S VOICE
dialog: (calling peremptorily from off-scene)
dialog: Susan! Where are you?
text: George hears that well-known voice and ducks out. He's no fool. David
text: drops the spade in trying to catch George.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Follow him, David!
dialog: [97]
text: David exits hurriedly in pursuit of George.
scene_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH'S VOICE
dialog: (louder)
dialog: Susan?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: Here, Auntie!
text: She hurriedly brushes off her hands and pushes back her hair as Aunt
text: Elizabeth appears around some shrubbery and enters to her.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (with asperity)
dialog: Susan! What in the world are you doing?
dialog: (indicating the holes)
dialog: What are these?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (faintly)
text: Holes.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (explosively)
dialog: I know they're holes! How did they get here?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: David and George were digging.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (confronting her determinedly)
dialog: Now, young lady, we're going to get down to brass tacks. You're hiding
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with a wail)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Who is this David?
dialog: [98]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well--he's a friend of Mark's.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Is that all you know about him?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No. I know I'm going to marry him. He doesn't know it yet -- but I am!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: What is his name? What is his background? What does he do?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: His name? It's--uh--uh--Bone.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Bone? Can't you be more explicit? What does he do?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He--he hunts.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Hunts what?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why--uh--animals, I should think.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh. Is that how he met Mark? Big-game hunting?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh--very big.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, if you're planning to marry him on my money, you're mistaken. I
dialog: will not have a lunatic in the family. You and Mark are quite enough for
dialog: me to cope with. Furthermore, when Alexander comes tonight I shall speak
dialog: to him seriously about you. As your guardian, he should be informed of
dialog: the kind of company you're keeping.
dialog: [99]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (quavering)
dialog: You mean Boopie's coming here? Tonight?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Have you any objection to my seeing my lawyer? He's coming late, but he's
dialog: going to spend the night--and we'll settle this tomorrow.
text: Her gaze fixes off-scene with astonishment.
speaker_heading: 126 WHAT SHE SEES
text: David crawling through a hedge on his hands and knees after George.
scene_heading: 127 AUNT ELIZABETH AND SUSAN
dialog: They react.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (aghast)
dialog: Susan! We just can't have that man around!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: But, Auntie, he's only playing with George.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, he's not going to play with George any longer.
dialog: (calls peremptorily)
dialog: George!
scene_heading: 128 EXT. GARDEN - AT HEDGE - AFTERNOON
text: David crawling after George. The dog stops as Aunt Elizabeth's scream is
dialog: heard again.
scene_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH'S VOICE
dialog: George! Come here! This minute!
text: George starts out of scene toward the voice. David grabs at his leg and
text: falls face down, missing.

scene_heading: 129 EXT. GARDEN - AFTERNOON
dialog: Susan and Aunt Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Keep that man away from me, Susan. And mark my words, you're not safe

speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (sighing deeply and stretching out with her arms under her head)
dialog: Oh--how quiet it is! Isn't it nice, David--just to be quiet and-and-alone
dialog: this way? Without a lot of people talking to us, I mean.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (staring glumly ahead of him)
dialog: I can't think how he could have found a place where we didn't dig. We've
text: dug up practically twenty-six acres.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with sweet reasonableness
dialog: Now, David, everything's going to be all right. The bone's here
dialog: somewhere. George knows where. There's no point in our digging without
dialog: George. But we can't have George because Aunt Elizabeth won't let him out
dialog: of the house.
dialog: (her tone changes)
dialog: Wouldn't it be nice if we could just sit here forever and ever?
dialog: (101]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (glumly)
text: But she has to let him out of the house sometime.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I always say that people don't have time to fall in love in the city. Now
dialog: what could be nicer than just spending months and months getting
dialog: acquainted-- with somebody, of course, that you like--and maybe--could
dialog: fall in love with?
text: She rolls over and looks pensively at David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (hopelessly)
dialog: Of course it's just possible that he didn't bring it outdoors at all.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You're not even willing to relax for a minute, are you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (looking around at her bitterly
dialog: Relax? Do you realize that I've telephoned my fiancee twice and postponed
dialog: my marriage?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Yes. That's too bad. It must be terrible for a girl to realize that a
dialog: bone is more important than she is.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (violently)
dialog: I haven't told her I've lost the intercostal clavicle! I haven't dared!
dialog: It would be too great a shock to her!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: Oh, I wouldn't tell her I'd lost it, David---I'd just tell her it's been
dialog: mislaid.
dialog: [102]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sure you would.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now I would suggest that you tell her that you'll be married next week at
dialog: the same time. That will give you a week here. We're sure to find it ina
dialog: week.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, Susan, stop suggesting things!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: All right, David. I was only trying to help.
text: They sit bolt upright as the scream of the panther is heard from the

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Baby! We haven't fed him!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: If it weren't for my fossil, I'd feed him George.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

text: crouches over the meat there is a low growl from the doorway. George has
text: escaped the stern eye of Aunt Elizabeth and is spying as usual.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's George! Grab him!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You grab him. You know him better.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's why I won't grab him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (advancing on George)
dialog: Keep that panther back. We can't lose George--yet.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mark probably meant he eats dogs.

scene_heading: 132 OUTSIDE BOX STALL

scene_heading: 133 INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: David has changed back into his own clothes except for his coat. He has

text: telephone in the midst of an agitated conversation with Miss Swallow, his
text: agitation arising largely from Susan's jerking at his elbow.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But, Alice dear, I can't get in! I've been unavoidably detained!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (jerking at his elbow)
dialog: Tell her at the same time next week.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What, dear? What did you say? ...Yes, dear, I know it's unlike me.
text: There is a blast from the other end of the wire.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (jerking at his sleeve)
dialog: Don't be afraid of her, David. Say something funny.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (goaded beyond control, fairly shouts into phone as the blast ceases)
dialog: I might as well tell you, Alice, --I've lost the intercostal clavicle!
dialog: (105]
text: There is a piercing scream from the receiver and he turns it away from

speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (aghast as he indicates the drawer)
dialog: But you can't just leave Alice there!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Who can't?
text: David jerks open the drawer and takes out the receiver. He speaks tensely

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alice! Answer me! Alice!

dialog: of an operator.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: scene.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE

speaker_heading: APPLEGATE

dialog: Well, well, well, Elizabeth! How are you?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
text: (as CAMERA FOLLOWS them into the living room)
dialog: I'm a nervous wreck, as you very well know. I'm always a nervous wreck.
dialog: What I need is absolute peace and quiet and I never get it. It seems to
dialog: me all my life I've been searching for absolute peace and quiet and I've
dialog: always found exactly the opposite. Maybe that's what comes of being born
dialog: in my family. It does seem hard.
text: They run into Susan, who comes out of the guest bedroom, where she has
dialog: been helping David telephone.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Susan, I want you to meet a very dear friend of mine--Major Applegate.
dialog: (as Susan offers her hand)
dialog: He wants me to finance a most thrilling expedition and he's invited me to
dialog: go along.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't approve of expeditions. How do you do, Major Applegate?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: That needn't bother you. You're not going.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't think you should go either, Aunt Elizabeth.

speaker_heading: APPLEGATE

dialog: Oh--really, Elizabeth? You-- you didn't tell me that.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH

text: David, a bit ill at ease, enters from the guest bedroom. He stops short

speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I want you to meet Mr. Bone.
scene_heading: DAVID AND APPLEGATE
dialog: (extending their hands and speaking simultaneously)
dialog: How do you do, Mr. Bone!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH

dialog: You are Mr. Bone. This is Major Applegate.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (laughing uneasily)
dialog: Oh yes. Yes. Quite. I'm Applegate.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But there must be some mistake --
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh no, there isn't! I've known Horace Applegate for twenty years! Susan,
dialog: take him away!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with the sweet manner of a keeper)
dialog: Come, Mr. Bone. We'll go for a nice little walk before dinner.
dialog: [108]
text: David goes out in an utter daze. Applegate looks after him.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: What a pity! Such a nice-looking young man.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
text: Conversation may be a little difficult at dinner, Horace. The young man's
text: having a nervous breakdown. Talk to him about big game hunting. He's a
text: big game hunter, too. He can't talk sensibly about anything else.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Oh yes, Elizabeth. I can talk for days on that subject. Don't worry.
dialog: You'll find conversation flowing very freely once I start drawing him
dialog: out.
scene_heading: 136 INT. VANCE STABLE - NIGHT
text: Gogarty enters like a man who is in search of a bottle, which he is, goes
text: to the door of the box stall where Baby is, unlatches it and enters. He
text: walks past Baby in the dim light, reaches up to a rafter and finds his

scene_heading: 137 INT. VANCE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Aunt Elizabeth, Major Applegate, David and Susan are seated at dinner.
text: Conversation is slightly impeded because David will not look at anybody

text: already served soup to David, Susan and Aunt Elizabeth. Now she enters
text: through pantry door, bears down upon Major Applegate.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
text: (clearing his throat as she places the soup before him)
dialog: Have you ever been in Arabia, Mr. Bone?
text: Mrs. Gogarty marches back to the kitchen. David, engrossed in George,

dialog: again.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I say, Mr. Bone, have you ever been -- in Arabia?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (abruptly, without taking his eyes off George)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (desperately)

speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I think IT hit it.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (with a snort)
dialog: Do you think it's worth it?
speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Oh, I see... Don't worry, Elizabeth. I'll draw him out.
text: Through another door George comes into the room, David stalking after

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Really, Susan, imagine giving a dinner party, with your husband stalking

text: the stall and is padding silently toward him. The panther rubs lightly
text: against the nice man. Gogarty reaches down carelessly behind him and pats
dialog: Baby.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Hello, George, me boyo!
text: A funny expression comes over his face as he goes on patting Baby. He
text: begins to suspect this isn't a dog, because dogs don't purr. He screws up
text: his courage and looks around, then springs to his feet with an
text: inarticulate cry and rushes out of the stable.

scene_heading: 140 INT. VANCE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (ringing the bell violently)
dialog: What was that? Hannah! Hannah!
scene_heading: 141 INT. VANCE KITCHEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Hannah, this is no time for personalities. Where's my gun?
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
dialog: Gun? What would you be wanting with a gun?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Don't be asking questions in a crisis! Where's my gun?
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
dialog: It's where you left it -- in your room under the bed, the night you
dialog: thought you heard a burglar. What do you want it for now?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: A cat it was!

scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY

dialog: and breathed in my face!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: What nonsense!
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
dialog: That's what I said, ma'am.

speaker_heading: SUSAN

speaker_heading: GOGARTY
text: A cat -- with eyes like balls of fire.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Gogarty, you've been drinking again!
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Nary a drop have I had, Mrs. Random, as I live an' breathe. A gun is

text: Mrs. Gogarty enters from the pantry with a platter of roast squab.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (helping herself)
dialog: One reason why I'd like to go on this expedition, Horace, is that it
text: would make Drusilla Voorhies green with jealousy. She's always bragging
dialog: about her experiences -- but the only primitive life she's ever had was
dialog: when she was living with that fat tenor what's-his-name.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Oh! Was he -- primitive?
text: Susan enters and slides into her seat behind Mrs. Gogarty
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh. Squab.
dialog: (116]
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Ten years, off and on, I've lived with Drusilla -- and I've never seen
dialog: her stop acting. She can't forget that she once sang at La Scala and she
text: neglects to mention that it cost her third husband ten thousand dollars.
text: A voice like a crow -- and I can't give a party that she doesn't sing
dialog: after dinner!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Elizabeth, I shouldn't live with her.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: But, Horace, she's my dearest friend.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE

dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
text: And now that she has that moth-eaten cheetah she's insufferable.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Oh. A cheetah. You mean --
text: (making his four fingers walk on the tablecloth)
dialog: a cheetah?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
text: Oh, it's perfectly safe. Its teeth are all gone. But it walks, and crowds
dialog: follow her -- and that's all she wants. Attention! That's why I left

text: She is prattling to cover David's telephoning.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I know just how you feel, Aunt Elizabeth, about the Voorhies woman.
dialog: Cheetahs are nasty things to have around the house. Any big animal is a
dialog: lot of bother.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (brusquely)
dialog: Nothing of the kind! I'm going to have a panther. Mark's sending it from
dialog: Brazil.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: A panther?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: I'm not going to have Drusilla lording it over me any longer with her
dialog: cheetah. Mark cabled me that he had the panther. I can't think why it

dialog: Don't call the Zoo! Don't call the Zoo, David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've called the Zoo. It's all fixed!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Call them back and unfix it! Don't ask questions! Call them back!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I will not! I told the Zoo they could have the panther if they found him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You gave him Baby! You gave away my life's happiness -- my brother's
dialog: trust in me! You gave away my inheritance!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've had enough! I quit!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (thrusting receiver at him)
dialog: You can't quit!

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You told me the only thing standing between you and a million dollars was
dialog: that panther. Well -- now it's gone!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (wailing)
dialog: But, David, everything's changed. I just found out that panther belongs
dialog: to Aunt Elizabeth!
dialog: (dancing in a frenzy)
dialog: I'll explain later! Call them back and tell them you were mistaken.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've just spent fifteen minutes convincing them that I did see a panther.
dialog: They won't believe me!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (wrenching receiver from him)
dialog: I'll tell them you're a drug addict -- that you're always seeing things!
speaker_heading: DAVID

text: Aunt Elizabeth and Major Applegate have reached the dessert and coffee.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I'd like to finance your expedition, Horace -- but there is something to
dialog: be said for furthering science. Without science we wouldn't have plastic
text: surgery and the telephone.
dialog: (120]
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Without science, Elizabeth, we'd be free of this complicated
dialog: civilization. The primitive life is the richer life. Men and women --
dialog: untrammeled -- Think of it!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I also have to think of the responsibility of giving away so much money.
dialog: I'd like to have my name in the Museum. But before I make up my mind I
dialog: must talk to this young Dr. Huxley I've heard so much about. Then I'll be
dialog: able to decide between you -- the Museum -- and Susan.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I had my heart set on showing you the jungle, Elizabeth. Picture it! A
text: vast mysterious silence vibrant with life -- strange cries in the night -
text: There is a strange cry in the night, which we know is Baby but they
text: don't. They listen. George gets up and goes to the window.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Did you hear that, Horace?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: A loon!
dialog: (resuming his rhapsody
dialog: Once you got the jungle in your blood, Elizabeth, I wouldn't be able to

speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I'd have to come out every now and then for a permanent.

speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There's nobody there. The night watchman says they've all gone out
text: panther hunting.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then there's only one thing to do, David. We must catch him before they
dialog: do! What is the best thing to take when you're going to catch a panther.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (mad)
dialog: A bigger panther!
scene_heading: 151 INT. VANCE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Aunt Elizabeth and Major Applegate are at coffee as Susan and David
text: enter. David starts walking around the table, peering under it for
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: What are you looking for?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (agitated)
dialog: George! Where's George?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't know! What does it matter?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Matter?... Susan, you've lost George again!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Why this morbid interest in George?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He has my intercostal clavicle!
dialog: (122]
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh, Horace, take him away!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't be angry with David, Auntie. He's just overwrought.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I wish he'd go somewhere else and be overwrought!
text: They are diverted by the sudden outcry of the panther. Susan and David
text: look at each other.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Horace! Are you sure that's a loon?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I didn't hear anything.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I've heard many a loon, Elizabeth, and if ever I heard a loon that's a
dialog: loon. Isn't it, Mr. Bone?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Well, what would you say it was?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: Well, since you put it that way I'd say it's a panther!
text: Susan just moans. David is on the loose.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Nonsense! Major Applegate would know a panther if he heard one!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Of course I would. I'm an authority on animal cries.
dialog: (123]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right -- it's a loon!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: The panther cry is something you can never forget.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: It varies at different seasons. Now -- let me see -- what month is
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: June!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: this -
dialog: Oh yes, June. Now let me see. June. It would go something like this.
text: He cups his hands and lets out an unearthly scream.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's still a loon!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I haven't practiced the panther cry in a long time. I'm slightly out of
dialog: voice.
text: Carefully cups his hands, but just as he is about to cut loose Baby
text: screams from near the house. Everybody looks at Horace as if he were a
dialog: ventriloquist.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with a moan)
dialog: Ohhhhh!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (nervously)
dialog: I didn't do that.
dialog: (124]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Try again, Major. Maybe it will come in and we'll see what it is!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: It was probably an echo.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was a long time coming back!
text: Applegate cups his hands a gain, glancing over his shoulder dubiously,
text: then lets out a piercing yodel. All listen except Susan, who puts her
text: fingers in her ears. Back comes the answering scream of Baby.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: That's curious. There aren't any panthers in Connecticut, are there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
text: Susan, seeing that David is mad enough to tell the whole story, thinks
text: fast and frantically. She rises from the table weakly, her hands
text: fluttering uncertainly, her eyes in a fixed, unnatural stare.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I feel funny.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: Well, you're not, you little fiend! You're just plain vicious!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Susan, what is it? I don't like your saying that my niece is vicious, Mr.
dialog: Bone. She has very kind instincts.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She has all the kind instincts of a cobra. Only a cobra doesn't go
dialog: looking for you.
dialog: (125]
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: She's ill!
text: Susan is rocking back and forth, looking for a convenient place to fall.
text: She reels about until there are no chairs in the way.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: She's going to faint!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (faintly)
dialog: I'll be all right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You bet she'll be. All right! She'd be all right in a den of lions!
text: Susan totters gracefully and falls.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (running to Susan)
dialog: Hannah! Horace! Get me some water!
dialog: (Hannah enters)
dialog: The smelling salts, Hannah!
dialog: (Hannah scurries)
dialog: Do something, Mr. Bone. Don't just stand there!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She's shamming.
text: Applegate brings a carafe of water, tremblingly pours a glass and hands
text: it to Aunt Elizabeth, who props up Susan's head and tries to force it
text: between her lips.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Is she coming to, Elizabeth?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (despairingly)
dialog: No.
text: Hannah enters with the smelling salts. Aunt Elizabeth wrenches them from
text: her hand.
dialog: (126]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (calmly)
text: If the little beast knew how silly she looked, she'd revive soon enough.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (sitting up; indignantly)
dialog: Well, of all the heartless brutes!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe. But I'm not a fool. I know when people faint they don't fall
dialog: backward.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (getting to her feet with alacrity. Now she's mad)
dialog: All right, Mr. David Hux--
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (silencing her wildly by pushing motions through the air with his hands)
dialog: No! No, Susan! What do you want me to do? Whatever it is, I'll do it.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (at her wits' ant patience' end)
dialog: This is a madhouse! I need some air. Horace, take me for a walk in the
dialog: garden!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Why, of course, Elizabeth. Nothing like a stroll after dinner to quiet
dialog: the nerves.
text: They start for the entry.
dialog: (127]
scene_heading: 152 EXT. VANCE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Aunt Elizabeth and Applegate are strolling in the moonlight. Patches of
text: shrubbery throw deep shadows.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: You're very quiet, Horace.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I can't understand why that loon should answer a panther cry. There's
dialog: something wrong. I very rarely miss.
text: The urge is too much for him. He must prove to himself that he can cry
text: like a panther. He croons it softly.
scene_heading: 153 INT. VANCE KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Mrs. Gogarty is washing dishes. Gogarty, at one side of the room, is
text: busily cleaning his gun. We can see that he is cleaning his gun because
dialog: that will take time and the more time it takes the further away the cat
text: that he is going to hunt will be. Susan strolls in with an air of
dialog: innocence.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I have a little headache. if Aunt Elizabeth asks for me, tell her that
dialog: I've gone to bed. What's the gun for, Gogarty?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: If you'd seen what I saw, Miss Susan, you'd be lookin' your windows and
dialog: beggin' me on your knees to sit outside your bedroom door all night.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I -- I have an errand for you to do, Gogarty. There's a car out in the
dialog: stable. I want you to take it into Westlake and leave it in front of the
dialog: butcher shop -- later tonight.
text: (walks around him speculatively
dialog: Are you a -- good marksman, Gogarty?
dialog: [128]
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
text: He can't hit the broad side of a barn.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: There never was an Irishman yet, Hannah Gogarty, that didn't have the eye
text: of an eagle. And Aloysius Gogarty is no exception.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Guns are dangerous things, Gogarty. I shouldn't fool around with that one
dialog: too much, if I were you. You might shoot somebody.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: I'll shoot nobody. The responsibility of protectin' helpless women lies
dialog: heavily on me shoulders. Nobody could ever say that Aloysius Gogarty
text: wasn't on the alert.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You -- uh -- you won't forget about the car, will you, Gogarty? In front
dialog: of the butcher shop, mind.
text: (sets down the empty glass and starts out)
dialog: And, Gogarty, don't be conspicuous about it. Just take it in quietly, get
dialog: out quietly and catch the bus back at about -- oh, I should say -- at
dialog: about midnight.
text: (she drifts on out the door)
scene_heading: 154 EXT. VANCE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: Applegate and Aunt Elizabeth strolling.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't know, Horace. A loon and a panther sound very much alike to me.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: No, no, Elizabeth. A panther cry is like this!
text: And cupping his hands he lets out a fearful scream.
dialog: [129]
scene_heading: 155 EXT. VANCE GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: Baby loping across a lawn toward the two figures.
dialog: [Scene Details]
scene_heading: 156 EXT. VANCE GARDEN - NIGHT
text: STROLLING SHOT of Applegate and Aunt Elizabeth as Baby glides in and
text: slinks along contentedly behind them.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I learned it from a bushman in the Congo. It takes years of practice.
dialog: It's done largely with the palate. You curl the tongue so --
dialog: (curls his tongue)
text: Thus the sound comes up, and out. Also, the hands play an important part
text: in the resonance and carrying power. The thumbs must be together between
dialog: the cleft. And, Elizabeth, it's very important to keep the base of the
dialog: thumbs together -- so. In so doing you get a pear-shaped sound. Now,
text: having done this, one takes a very deep breath, and keeping an open
dialog: throat --
text: Again he rends the silence. At this moment they have passed some
text: shrubbery and Baby, who has slunk into the black shadow, answers him
text: enthusiastically. Baby's scream is better. Applegate whirls on Aunt
dialog: Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Elizabeth! Not so fast!
text: (as she stares at him)
dialog: But I must say that's remarkably good. I think you've got it!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Got what?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: The mating cry!
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Don't be rude, Horace.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: But you don't seem to realize what you've achieved.
dialog: (130]
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Horace! What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I'm talking about the way you screamed.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I didn't scream.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (looking around uneasily
dialog: I'm beginning to think there's something wrong here.
text: His gaze fixes on something behind her.
speaker_heading: 157 WHAT HE SEES
text: Baby standing in the clear moonlight.
speaker_heading: 158 TWO SHOT
text: as Applegate reacts.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I -- think -- it's time -- we went back -- to the house.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: We just left the house, Horace.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I Know -- but don't you think -- it would be a good idea --
dialog: back?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: If we went
dialog: No, I don't I think it would be a good idea if we continued our walk and
text: stopped talking about panthers and screams.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: But, Elizabeth -- don't you find it -- a bit chilly?
text: He is walking along beside her, CAMERA FOLLOWING, peering over his
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: (131]
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Chilly? Nonsense! It's positively balmy!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: Who's balmy?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (stopping)
dialog: Horace! What's come over you?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (pleadingly)
dialog: Elizabeth -- I think we ought to go in.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: But, Horace!, I don't want to go in, I like it here.
text: They start walking again, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Horace is still peering over
text: his shoulder. He is aware that it's up to him as a man to conceal from
text: Aunt Elizabeth the fact that Death is at this very moment stalking her.
text: He is also aware that Aunt Elizabeth, when she wants to walk, will walk,
dialog: come hell or high water.
text: He propels her through the door and pushes in after her in frantic haste.
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they catapult into the entryway. Aunt Elizabeth is
text: thoroughly bewildered. Applegate is thoroughly jittery.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Did I hear that man -- Gogarty- say that he -- had a gun?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't know whether you heard him say so, but he has.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Where will I find him?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: In the kitchen, I should think. Why?
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS Applegate as he rushes away from her without a word, in
text: the direction of the kitchen.
dialog: (132]
scene_heading: 159 INT. VANCE KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Gogarty is holding the gun up stock first, peering down the barrel. Mrs.
text: Gogarty has finished the dishes and is rinsing out the tea towels.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
text: ...and so I said to her, I said, ‘Mrs. Random, your niece is a nitwit!’
text: And she just looked at me. ‘Furthermore, Mrs. Random,’ I said, ‘if she
dialog: wants to dig holes she can fill up the holes. It's not Gogarty that's
dialog: going to do it.’
text: The kitchen door bursts open and Applegate rushes in. He snatches at the
text: gun. Gogarty resists manfully but is forced to surrender it.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: What did you say you saw?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (bristling)
dialog: I said I saw a cat as big as a cow, and I saw a cat as big as a cow -- a
dialog: small cow. And if you've come in here to insinuate --
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Come with me, my good man!

scene_heading: 160 INT. ENTRY, VANCE HOUSE - NIGHT

text: into dining room. Applegate comes dashing out of the kitchen, bearing the
text: gun, Gogarty behind him.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (pointing at gun)
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I want you to promise me that you'll stay indoors -- till I come back.
dialog: And keep the doors closed.
dialog: (133]
text: She watches him as he goes from window to window, closing and locking
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Why are you doing that?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I don't know. I just have a feeling -- that this is the best thing to do.
dialog: We've got to keep everything out -- we must be sure that nothing gets in
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Including air?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Yes, The night air -- is very dangerous, Nothing must get in!
text: Pantomiming the closing of windows, he motions Gogarty into the bedroom
text: to do likewise. Intent on barricading the house he heads for the dining
text: room, Aunt Elizabeth sinks into a chair.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Balmy! The lot of them!
scene_heading: 161 INT. VANCE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Baby pads around, looking for a place to curl up. He strolls behind a
text: chair as Applegate enters and goes to a window which looks out on the
text: garden. As he is bolting this window, Baby comes around the end of the
text: table and goes over to rub against the backs of his legs. With a
text: despairing moan Applegate trips and falls over the panther. Baby leaps
text: lightly through the second window and vanishes. Gogarty enters the room,
text: looks at the prone Applegate, closes and locks the open window.
text: Applegate, scrambling to his feet, seizes the gun, turns and dashes out
text: through the entry. Gogarty follows.
scene_heading: 162 EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
text: TRUCK SHOT Susan and David searching for Baby. Susan is singing, ‘I Can't
text: Give You Anything But Love, Baby.’ She breaks off and turns on David, who
text: is loaded down with the fish net and rope.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: David, you might sing. At least.
dialog: (134]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't sing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You can, too. You have a fine strong voice.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But not for singing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's not fair. You're just being stubborn! I'm doing all the work. I'll
dialog: bet if Miss Swallow told you to you'd sing. I'll bet if Miss Swallow told
dialog: you to do anything you'd do it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: I'd have to see her first. But I have a feeling I never will.
text: The bark of a dog is heard. David stops rigidly and looks across the
dialog: river.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's a dog!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (looking across)
dialog: It's George!
text: (squeals out as she points off)
dialog: And Baby!
scene_heading: 163 EXT. OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT
text: WHAT THEY SEE: SHOT of the panther and dog approaching on a rise of
text: ground, so that they show clearly in the moonlight. George is walking
text: stiff-legged, sidling up toward the panther, which crouches.
dialog: (135]
scene_heading: 164 EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
text: Susan and David watching this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (in a frozen tone)
dialog: In another minute my intercostal clavicle will be gone. Forever,
text: (putting his hand on her arm beseechingly)
dialog: Susan, now think! Is there any way to cross this river?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh yes. It's only about so deep.
dialog: (indicating a foot)
dialog: We can wade across.
text: They run down the bank, Susan in the lead, CAMERA TRUCKING with them. She
text: steps in the water and immediately disappears.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (with a yell as she comes up)
dialog: The river bed's changed!
text: She goes down again. David jumps in and pulls her out. She coughs and
text: chokes as he slaps her impatiently on the back.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (in a daze)
dialog: Did we get across?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: No, Susan we're right back where we started. Only we're wet.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, while you were about it, you might as well have gone to the other
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: While I'm wet I might as well go to the other side!
dialog: (dives in and starts swimming across)
dialog: (136]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (squealing to him)
dialog: David! Wait for me!

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 165 EXT. OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT
text: Susan and David emerge dripping from the water, climb the bank and look
text: at the rise of ground.

text: George and Baby playing.
speaker_heading: 167 SUSAN AND DAVID
text: yell simultaneously.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
speaker_heading: BABY!
speaker_heading: DAVID
speaker_heading: GEORGE!
scene_heading: 168 BABY AND GEORGE
text: - playing. Startled by the cries, they cut and run, together.
speaker_heading: 169 SUSAN AND DAVID
text: turn on each other accusingly and speak simultaneously.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now you've scared him away!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you have to yell like that?
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 170 EXT. FOOT OF DIRT BANK TEN FEET BELOW - NIGHT
text: Susan and David catapult into scene, land flat on their faces shoulder to
text: shoulder. For a moment they lie with their faces down, then turn their
text: heads and rest them on the earth, face to face.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Just because you're mad at me you didn't have to push me.
dialog: (137]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I regret to say, Susan, I didn't think of it.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: And it could be so nice. The moon and everything.... And we could have
dialog: such fun. I like being with you, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your powers of endurance are remarkable, Susan. Mine aren't so good. I
text: like peace and quiet.
dialog: (there is a long silence)
dialog: You know, I've been thinking. It's foolish of me to be following you
dialog: around, trying to find a panther that will bring you a million dollars I
dialog: want for the Museum.
dialog: (another thoughtful silence)
dialog: If you'd planned it, you couldn't have ruined my chances for getting that
dialog: bequest more thoroughly. You tell your aunt that I'm crazy. You tell her
dialog: my name is Bone and you don't tell me. You tell her I'm a big game hunter
dialog: and you don't tell me. You tell anybody anything that comes into your
dialog: head and you don't tell me!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: There's something else I forgot to tell you. Boopie's coming to the house
dialog: tonight.
text: Slowly David rears up on his elbows and stares off into space, stunned.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If Peabody sees me, he's going to tell your aunt who I am. He thinks I'm
dialog: crazy, too. He won't remember the four years I've spent on the
text: brontosaurus group. He'll only remember that I hit him on the head with a
dialog: rock -- he thinks.
dialog: (138]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: It's quiet here, isn't it... Peaceful.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. Let's stay here and let George and Baby look for us.
text: They lie in silence for a moment, both engrossed in their own thoughts --
text: hers of love, his of murder. Faintly from the distance we hear the circus
dialog: calliope.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: Listen to the music... Where's it coming from?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That is Westlake. There's a circus there. Can you remember -- away back
dialog: to this morning? That's where I'm supposed to be throwing knives -- and
dialog: you're riding a trapeze. And here we are. Just loafing.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 171 EXT. CIRCUS LOT - NIGHT
text: CLOSE UP SIGN, reading: SELLS-BAILY CIRCUS. The calliope is now loud.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to bring into frame a cage-truck containing an enraged
text: panther leaping against the bars. In b.g. is a suggestion of the Big Top
text: -- gasoline flares, etc? Several roustabouts stand beside the cage.
scene_heading: SECOND ROUSTABOUT
dialog: They should of shot him last summer when he ripped up Caldoni.
scene_heading: FIRST ROUSTABOUT
dialog: Well, he sure gave that new trainer a going-over tonight!
scene_heading: SECOND ROUSTABOUT
dialog: I told tem he'd do it again. Once a cat's bad, he's always bad. These
dialog: jungle-bred cats are hard to handle, anyway.
dialog: (139]
speaker_heading: CIRCUS MANAGER
dialog: (entering briskly)
dialog: What are you waiting for, Joe?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (truck driver)
dialog: Nobody's told me what to do with him, Boss.
speaker_heading: CIRCUS MANAGER
dialog: If I had my way we'd shoot him right here. Baily says for you to take him
text: into Bridgeport and put him in the gas chamber.
dialog: (to roustabout)
dialog: You go along with him, Mac.
scene_heading: FIRST ROUSTABOUT
dialog: Who? Me?
speaker_heading: CIRCUS MANAGER
dialog: You heard what I said.
text: (as Mac climbs in beside Joe)
dialog: And keep your mouths shut. There's a lot of dough invested in these
dialog: animals, and we can't afford to have this kind of thing get out!
text: Mac makes an okay gesture with his hand. The truck starts off.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 172 EXT. HIGHWAY OUTSIDE TOWN - NIGHT
text: The cage-truck slows down and stops at a fork in the road. The panther is
text: now quiet. In the moonlight we can see him silhouetted against the bars.
dialog: 173
speaker_heading: CLOSE SHOT
text: of Joe and Mac. They peer ahead.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: (pointing right)
dialog: I tell you Bridgeport's that way!

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: No,
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: All
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: it ain't. It's that way!
dialog: right. Go that way. But you won't get to Bridgeport.
dialog: Where's that road map?
dialog: 174
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH HEDGE AT ROADSIDE - NIGHT
text: Susan and David have built a small bonfire. Carefully laid out on rocks
text: before it are David's shirt and Susan's dress. She is wearing his coat,
text: which has already dried somewhat. He is clad only in his trousers.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: If there'd been a bathhouse we could have done this much quicker.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Next time I'll try and arrange one. Or perhaps there are portable
dialog: bathhouses for people like you. There must be.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Anyhow, I know how to build a fire without matches.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You probably had practice setting fire to the house when you were a
dialog: child.
speaker_heading: JOE'S VOICE
text: (through the hedge; he's mad and yelling now)
dialog: You see? It's that way!
dialog: (141]
speaker_heading: MAC'S VOICE
dialog: You've got the map upside down!
text: Susan and David cautiously push through into the hedge and peer over.
dialog: 175 WHAT THEY SEE
text: The halted cage-truck directly before them. Silhouetted against the moon
text: is the figure of the panther. The truck headlights illuminate the forked
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: 176 CLOSE TWO SHOT
dialog: Susan and David.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Look! The Zoo! They've got Baby!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, that's that. Is George with him?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't know! I can't see! But we have to get Baby away from them!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All I promised to do was help you find Baby. Well -- we've found him.
text: Susan begins to push David toward the front of the truck. CAMERA TRUCKS
dialog: with them.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: All you have to do is talk to those men! I'll do the rest!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But what can I talk about?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: They're from the Zoo! Tell them you're a zoologist! Talk about zoos!
dialog: (142]
scene_heading: 177 FRONT OF TRUCK
text: The truck just begins to move as David, sans shirt, steps into the glare
text: of the headlights with upraised hand. Joe puts on the brake again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good evening!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Do you know the way to Bridgeport?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not going to Bridgeport.
speaker_heading: MAC

dialog: We're going to Bridgeport. Do you know which way it is?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
dialog: They wait
speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: right)
dialog: it's that way.
text: David considers for a moment,
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. It is.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (protesting)
dialog: But you said it was that way.
dialog: (143]
dialog: gravely.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Gentlemen, if you doubt me why do you ask me?
dialog: (this holds them for a moment)
dialog: You can go that way --
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: or you can go this way --
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: but, as a matter of fact, I wouldn't advise either way. Why you should go
dialog: to Bridgeport when the quickest way to New York is straight ahead, I
dialog: don't know.
speaker_heading: 178 CLOSE SHOT
text: Joe and Mac. For a moment they are stunned.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: This guy ain't got all his buttons.
scene_heading: 179 REAR OF CAGE - MED. SHOT
text: Susan struggling with the hasp.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The poor li'l Baby. Did they lock him all up? Nassy ol' mans. Well, we'll
dialog: fix that.
text: (as panther strikes at her)
dialog: Stop that, you fool -- or I'll smack you!
text: She swings the door open. The panther leaps out beside her, stands
text: lashing his tail. She picks up the rope and approaches him coaxingly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now wait till Mummy gets his collar on.
text: The panther springs past her and over the hedge.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Baby! Baby! BABY!
dialog: (indignantly)
dialog: Oh, you brute!
dialog: (144]
scene_heading: 180 FRONT OF TRUCK
text: David is still blocking the way, being completely unhelpful.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Now, Bridgeport is a nice little town, but with a population of fifty
dialog: thousand you can't expect gaiety. New York, on the other hand, with seven
dialog: million people, naturally tends to have centers of entertainment. All the
dialog: best talent quite reasonably flows to a point where there will be more
dialog: people to appreciate it.
text: Susan flies around and clutches at David in the glare of the lights. She
text: is dragging the rope and looks equally nutty.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Ba-by!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Should we help you tie him up, lady?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No -- thank you. Just go away -- Everything will be quite -- all right.
speaker_heading: 181 CLOSE SHOT
text: Joe and Mac in the truck as Joe puts the truck in gear and starts forward
text: on his own left turn. Mac leans out, looking after Susan and David.
speaker_heading: MAC
dialog: Imagine being married to a guy like that! Poor kid! She's a neat number.
speaker_heading: 182 FULL SHOT

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
dialog: (145]
scene_heading: 183 EXT. AT TREE - NIGHT
text: The bad panther is climbing a tree. The next moment we hear Susan's
text: voice, calling sweetly, "Baby! Baby!" She and David trudge in and stop
text: directly under the panther, who is on a limb. They are now fully dressed.
dialog: Susan points.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He went that way.
text: They are arrested by the cry of a panther -- which is Applegate. The
text: panther above them lifts his head.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's Baby!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He couldn't have got that far.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, they can run very fast.
text: The cry comes wafting down the wind once more.
scene_heading: 184 EXT. OPEN MEADOW - NIGHT
text: Applegate, with Gogarty, comes wading through knee-deep grass. Gogarty
text: bears the gun. Applegate stops, cups his hands and cries like a panther.
text: Gogarty looks on in pleased admiration.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: That's a noble noise, that is.
scene_heading: 185 EXT. AT TREE - NIGHT
text: Susan, David and the panther above their heads, listening intently. Susan
text: points off excitedly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: There he is again! Come on!
text: She plunges off, followed by David.
dialog: (146]
scene_heading: 186 EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT
text: MED. SHOT -- Baby and George playing together. Applegate's luring call is
text: heard. Baby scrambles to his feet and listens.
scene_heading: 187 EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT
text: Applegate, followed by Gogarty, climbs the wall. Finding the wall a point
text: of vantage, he cups his hand and gives vent to the best cry of his
text: career. Then both he and Gogarty listen intently. Back on the night air
text: comes an answering cry. Applegate points to one side triumphantly. From
text: the opposite direction an even better cry is heard. Instinctively he
text: whirls and points in that direction. Gogarty, in a rage, throws the gun
dialog: down. The place is lousy with panthers!
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 188 EXT. THICKET - NIGHT
text: TRUCK SHOT -- Susan and David pushing their way through. As she parts the
text: springy bushes one by one they fly back in David's face. Susan lets go a
text: particularly strong limb and it gives him a terrific belt.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Ba-by! BA-by!... I've sort of lost my sense of direction. I wonder where
dialog: we are?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: My rough guess is somewhere near the Canadian border.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: The last cry came from about here.
text: She trips over a vine and falls with a crash and a moan. David lifts her
text: to her feet and sets her down with a jar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Watch where you're going!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Watch where I'm going yourself, you smart Alec!
dialog: (147]
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now, Susan, you're tired and I'm tired. I'd suggest that we go home.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Go home yourself, Quitter! Go on home! The idea, turning a wild animal
text: loose on an innocent countryside and then going home and sleeping -- with
dialog: lives in danger all over --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, Susan, do stop making a fool of yourself!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: So!
text: She stalks off. David follows. CAMERA FOLLOWS them. Susan stops and faces
dialog: David.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Please, David, I'd rather you didn't.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Didn't what?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Didn't come with me.
dialog: (injured)
dialog: After all I've gone through for you, that you can't come out and do a
dialog: simple thing like helping me find a panther -- I think it's pretty
dialog: shabby! I'd rather -- if you don't mind -- go on alone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, very well.
text: He sits down on a log and lights a cigarette. Susan pushes off through
text: the brush. Her blind crashing is heard. There is a terrific crash, then
text: silence. David listens as a gurgling cry rises to a wail. He calmly tamps
text: out his cigarette and starts in the direction of the wailing.
scene_heading: 189 EXT. IN BRUSH - NIGHT
text: Susan crying and rolling over as she tries to extricate herself from a
text: mass of vines. David stalks in. Once more he lifts her to her feet. Now
text: that she is no longer the managing Susan his tenderness comes to the
text: fore. He still knows that she is a menace but he realizes that there is
text: something soft and feminine in his arms.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, your natural instinct for being wrong astounds me. But somehow I'd
dialog: rather be with you wrong than with anyone else right.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, Da-vid!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (mopping her tears)
dialog: Your face is dirty.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (her mouth up)
dialog: I d-don't c-care.
text: David is gradually growing less interested in mopping her face than in
text: kissing it. He struggles manfully against the impulse but Susan lifts her
text: face higher. Just as he is about to kiss her there is the unearthly
text: scream of a panther, only a few yards away. David jumps and turns.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (dreamily)
dialog: Don't bother, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But it's Baby!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Of course it is. What of it?
text: (opens her eyes; he is gone)
dialog: Oh, blast Baby! I'll make him pay for this!
text: She starts after David.
dialog: (149]
scene_heading: 190 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Baby and George come prowling along. David comes dashing out of the
text: thicket, followed by Susan, who is now pursuing David, not the panther.
text: David reaches Baby and begins to stroke him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good Baby. Nice Baby.
text: (George growls; David looks at the dog grimly
dialog: I'll deal with you later.
text: (reaches toward Susan, behind him)
dialog: Quick -- give me that rope!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I -- T lost it!
text: David, in dull fury, stares straight ahead.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: All right. You take him home!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Come, Baby. Come home with Susan. Come, darling. Come, sweet.
text: Baby, to her astonishment, begins following her. CAMERA MOVES on them.
scene_heading: 191 EXT. THICKET - NIGHT
text: Applegate stands all poised for the mating call, Gogarty behind him.
text: Applegate cuts loose. Gogarty twitches at his sleeve.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: How do you make that noise?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: You couldn't learn it. It takes years of practice.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (defiantly)
dialog: I could learn it in a week!
text: He cups his hands and makes an awful bawling sound. Applegate does a
text: panther scream once more.
dialog: (150]
scene_heading: 192 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Susan and David leading panther and George. Applegate's scream rings
text: hideously. Baby jumps and takes refuge in the nearest tree.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: That would be Applegate.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (bitterly as he eyes the panther hanging over a limb)
dialog: Loon hunting, no doubt.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't you pay any attention to him, Baby. You come down to Susan. Susan
dialog: will take care of you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I suppose now you want me to climb up and push him down?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No. Shouldn't we try singing?
scene_heading: 193 EXT. THICKET - NIGHT
text: Applegate, followed by Gogarty, claws his way through the thicket.
text: Gogarty cups his hands and Applegate slaps his hands down.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Stop that! You'll have the whole countryside aroused!
scene_heading: 194 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Susan and David under the treed panther. Susan is singing, well into ‘I
text: Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby’. George sits beside them, his
text: feeling for music beginning to stir. David is picking up the song
text: wherever he can find a word that he knows. George, caught by the spirit
text: of the thing, lifts his muzzle and croons in unison -- he thinks. As the
text: chorus rises Baby lifts his voice in his own version.
dialog: (151]
scene_heading: 195 EXT. EDGE OF CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Applegate and Gogarty emerge from the shrubbery. Applegate stops and
dialog: stares.
scene_heading: 196 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: WHAT HE SEES: MED. LONG SHOT of the choral scene. To Applegate the
text: panther seems to be crouching, preparatory to springing on Susan, David
dialog: and George.
scene_heading: 197 EXT. EDGE OF CLEARING - NIGHT
text: TWO SHOT -- Applegate and Gogarty. Applegate reaches for the gun, which
text: Gogarty has already leveled and aimed, with a look of gladness in his
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Give me that! This has to be a dead shot!
text: He calls out to Susan and David encouragingly as Gogarty wrestles with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Don't move! Be quite calm! I'm here!
text: As Applegate wins the gun Gogarty speaks, a little mournfully.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: I'm a dead shot.
scene_heading: 198 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Susan, David, George and the panther. The singing ceases abruptly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't shoot! That's Baby! Stop him, David!
dialog: (152]
scene_heading: 199 EXT. EDGE OF CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Applegate aiming. Gogarty, his head tilted on one side, is shaking it
text: ominously. He knows that Applegate can't hit that panther. Applegate
text: pulls the trigger. There is a hollow click. For the first time Applegate
text: loses his head. He shakes the gun in front of Gogarty's face,
text: hysterically.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Where are the cartridges?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (triumphantly and with an air of superiority)
dialog: In the magazine, of course.
text: Applegate jerks the breech to pump a shell into the gun and as the shell
text: goes in it also goes off. There is a splitting explosion.
scene_heading: 200 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: Susan, David, George and Baby. At the report Baby leaps from the limb and
text: streaks away. David makes a flying tackle at George and comes up with an
text: armful of leaves. George too vanishes. Applegate, followed by Gogarty,
text: comes dashing in.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Susan! Mr. Bone! Are you all right?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh, we're fine. We're just dandy.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (eyeing Susan and David with suspicion)
dialog: Now if Aloysius Gogarty had been wielding that gun you'd have seen a dead
text: panther.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to Applegate)
dialog: Oh, why did you have to do that?
dialog: (153]
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I'm sorry, Susan. I wouldn't have missed if my gun hadn't jammed.
text: Gogarty sneers and looks up at the stars.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (savagely)
dialog: Major Applegate, we've spent the entire evening treeing that panther.
dialog: It's tame -- don't you understand? It's a tame panther!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: You, sir -- as everybody except you and Miss Vance seem to know -- are
dialog: crazy.
dialog: (turns to Susan)
dialog: I forbid you to go further with this man. The panther is the most
dialog: treacherous of animals. I will continue the hunt, but you must go home.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
text: (in an undertone, twitching at his sleeve)
text: It's just as well. He couldn't be any crazier than she is.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, don't you think that if we stopped trying to keep everything a
dialog: secret from everybody there might be less confusion and more chance of
dialog: getting the panther?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Do you think so?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I do.
dialog: (turns to Applegate)
dialog: You may have heard, sir, that Mrs. Random was expecting a panther from
dialog: Brazil -- a pet panther.
dialog: (points off)
dialog: That is the panther.
dialog: (154]
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: I quit! Yes, sir, be gob, I quit! Aloysius Gogarty is goin' to curry no
text: panther.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I don't believe it!
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (twitching at his sleeve)
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know it's hard to believe, but I can explain it.
text: Gogarty sneers again and looks up at the stars.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (to Applegate)
dialog: If I told Aunt Elizabeth that you shot at her panther, where do you think
dialog: you'd get with your old expedition?
text: Applegate, whipsawed, looks from one to the other.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The only thing to do, Susan, is to explain things.
dialog: (to Applegate)
dialog: It all started this morning when Susan telephoned me...
scene_heading: 201 EXT. VANCE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
text: An open car stands in front of the porch. There are three men with guns
text: in it, and a fourth man -- the same Zoo official we saw on the telephone
text: with David -- is confronting Aunt Elizabeth, who is in the open doorway.
speaker_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL
dialog: Lady, I'm trying to tell you we're from the Zoo. We had a telephone call.
dialog: It came from here. This house!
dialog: (155]
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
text: But there must be some mistake. The panther hasn't come yet.
speaker_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL
dialog: Do you expect it to walk up -- and in?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Naturally not! I expect to receive a notice from the Freight Office
dialog: first!
text: The Zoo Official looks at her and backs away.
speaker_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL
dialog: (pacifyingly)
dialog: Yes, lady. Don't get excited. Sure, you'll have a notice from the Freight
dialog: Office.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Obviously, my good man, what you're looking for is a loon.
text: (and she slams the door)
speaker_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: I don't have to look any farther!
speaker_heading: 202 AT OPEN CAR
text: as the Zoo Official comes back to his friends.
speaker_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL
dialog: Screwy!
scene_heading: 203 EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT
text: GROUP SHOT on David, Susan, Major Applegate and Gogarty. Applegate and
text: Gogarty are listening intently.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, sir, that's the story. We had him until you fired. Now the thing is
text: to find him again.
dialog: (156]
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: You're quite sure he's -- harmless?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, absolutely!
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (twitching at Applegate's sleeve)
dialog: I -- I patted him. I reached my hand out and patted him right on the
text: back. He's gentle as a kitten.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (to Susan and David)
dialog: The practical thing is to go in different directions. He can't be far.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: You stay with Susan. If you lose your way, halloo. I'll come for you.
dialog: (already lost,
dialog: Now let's see.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (pointing)
text: he looks around uncertainly)
dialog: .. Which way did he go?
dialog: That way.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
text: He's trying to throw us off.
text: And he starts off in the opposite direction, followed by Gogarty, who is
text: suddenly very brave. Applegate stops and raises his finger admonishingly
dialog: to Susan and David.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Don't forget now! If you get lost, halloo!
text: He vanishes. Susan and David have no choice but to take the other and
text: proper direction. They start out.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
dialog: (157]
scene_heading: 204 EXT. OPEN MEADOW - NIGHT
text: Applegate and Gogarty emerge from the bushes. Gogarty is bearing the gun.
text: Applegate peers off intently to left. Gogarty taps him on the shoulder
text: and points off to right.
dialog: 205 WHAT THEY SEE
text: The bad panther stalking along in the clear moonlight.
speaker_heading: 206 TWO SHOT
text: Gogarty and Applegate. Gogarty turns around without a word and starts in
text: the opposite direction. Applegate follows.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: There is nothing -- to be worried about. You -- just stand here. I'll
dialog: take care of this.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (doubt fully)
dialog: I just remembered an errand Miss Susan wanted me to do. Maybe I'd better
dialog: be gettin' about it.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: You -- say you -- patted -- this beast?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Well -- in a manner of speaking I -- yes, I patted him -- in a manner of
dialog: speaking. Yes, I patted him. But sometimes the dispositions of those --
dialog: things are subject to -- a quick change.
text: Applegate moves out of scene as Gogarty stands poised for flight. Gogarty
text: draws a bottle from his hip pocket and takes a healthy drag on it.
scene_heading: 207 MED. MOVING SHOT
text: Panther as it prowls along a rise of ground, stops and looks past CAMERA,
text: its eyes savage.
dialog: [158]
speaker_heading: 208 WHAT IT SEES
text: The approaching figure of Applegate. Applegate snaps his fingers as he
dialog: advances.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Come, Baby! Come, Kitty! Come, Puss! Kitty, kitty, kitty!
speaker_heading: 209 CLOSE SHOT
text: Panther as it snarls and lays back its ears.
speaker_heading: 210 MED. SHOT
text: Applegate advancing. Suddenly he stops, doubtful.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Kitty?
text: The panther snarls and lunges forward. For a hurt and astonished instant
text: Applegate stands his ground. Then we TRUCK with him as he turns and races
text: back toward Gogarty, who is already under way. At this point the gun has
text: become only an impediment to Gogarty, whose urgency to perform Susan's
text: errand has been too much for him. He is loping without regard for
text: Applegate or Applegate's safety, in the direction of the nearest thicket
text: of trees. Applegate overhauls him. Gogarty trips and falls on his face,
text: and the gun goes off. Applegate skids into Gogarty, grabs the gun and
text: pumps another shell into it, levels the gun in the direction from which
dialog: he has run.
speaker_heading: 211 REVERSE ANGLE
text: Bad panther, frightened by the explosion, bounding over the rise of
text: ground and vanishing.
speaker_heading: 212 TWO SHOT
text: as Applegate breathes for the first time. Gogarty is painfully regaining
text: his feet, attempting to find a reason for his lack of bravery.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: I thought -- if I ran -- over there -- I'd get a -- better shot -- at
dialog: him. Those -- those -- er -- that grass -- is a little -- high. I was
dialog: making -- for that rise over here.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: ‘Gentle as a kitten!’
text: Gogarty silently hands his bottle to Applegate. Applegate uncorks it and
dialog: drinks.
dialog: (159]
speaker_heading: 213 TRUCK SHOT
text: on Susan and David trudging along country road.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: You know, David -- I've been trying to figure out why you didn't kiss me
dialog: back there. You almost did.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, I think we won't discuss that.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: But, David, there's -- nothing really wrong in kissing a girl. I mean,
dialog: it's just that you have to get a point of view about it. If, for
dialog: instance, you were to touch my face -- this way --
text: (reaches out and pats him)
dialog: -- there wouldn't be anything wrong about that, would there? You could
dialog: even do it accidentally, couldn't you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I couldn't kiss you accidentally, Susan. If I kissed you it would be
dialog: quite deliberate.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (her brand of logic)
dialog: Well -- there wouldn't be anything wrong in your reaching out and
dialog: touching my cheek deliberately, would there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I suppose there wouldn't.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Then why would it be wrong for you to kiss me, deliberately? It's not --
dialog: much different, really -- is it, David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. It's quite different.
dialog: (160]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: Well, I'd like -- I'd like -- to try it and see -- why it's different. I
dialog: don't see any difference.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, I am an engaged man. If I hadn't lost my fossil, I would be a
dialog: married man.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Oh, I wouldn't kiss a married man.
text: She has edged up to him and is walking so close that she all but trips
text: him as she stares up hungrily into his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't intend to kiss you, Susan. You might as well put it out of your
dialog: pretty little head. I intend to go back to New York and be married.
text: They are passing a country house, when a low growl is heard. They stop
text: and stare off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's that?
text: There is another growl.
speaker_heading: SUSAN AND DAVID
dialog: (simultaneously)
dialog: George!
text: They dive in the direction of the sound.
scene_heading: 214 EXT. DIGBY'S LAWN - NIGHT
text: George on lawn in front of house. Susan and David come around a lilac
text: bush and bear down on him purposefully! George backs off. They follow.

scene_heading: 215 EXT. DIGBY VERANDA ROOF - NIGHT
text: WHAT THEY SEE: Baby outlined against the sky, on the veranda roof.
scene_heading: 216 EXT. DIGBY LAWN - NIGHT
text: Susan, David and George. Susan stands still, looking upward at Baby,
text: while David pursues the one being that knows where his intercostal
text: clavicle is. George trots off around the house. David follows. Susan
text: advances toward veranda.
scene_heading: 217 EXT. SIDE OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: George enters and crawls under the side porch. David drops on his hands
text: and knees and disappears after him.
scene_heading: 218 EXT. FRONT OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Susan looks up yearningly.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Please, Baby! I want to go home!
scene_heading: 219 EXT. DIGBY VERANDA ROOF - NIGHT
text: Baby, from Susan's angle. He hangs his paws over the edge of the veranda
text: roof contentedly.
scene_heading: 220 EXT. FRONT OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Susan realizes there is nothing for it but to sing.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: That's the only thing I've plenty of, Baa-by. Etc."
scene_heading: 221 EXT. DIGBY SIDE PORCH - NIGHT

scene_heading: 222 EXT. FRONT UPSTAIRS WINDOW - DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Singing.
scene_heading: 226 EXT. FRONT UPSTAIRS WINDOW - DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Dr. Digby in the window. He leaps to a conclusion.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: If you're paying a bet there must be somewhere else you can pay it!
text: His wife, in a nightgown, joins him at the window.
scene_heading: 227 EXT. FRONT OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Susan below.
speaker_heading: SUSAN

dialog: SHOT of Susan.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: There's a panther on your roof and it's my panther and I'm going to get

scene_heading: 233 EXT. FRONT OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Susan starts to sing all over again.
dialog: (164]
scene_heading: 234 EXT. REAR OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: George and David playing "Follow the Leader." George goes under rear
text: porch. David, wary, goes to other side and waits, ready to trap him.
text: George, who is no fool, comes out of the same opening and back-tracks at

scene_heading: 235 EXT. FRONT OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Susan is singing, as Dr. Digby comes out of the house and the screen door
text: bangs.
scene_heading: 236 EXT. DIGBY VERANDA ROOF - NIGHT
text: The bang of the door frightens Baby and he leaps lightly off and is gone.
scene_heading: 237 EXT. FRONT OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: MED. SHOT -- Susan, as Digby, in a bathrobe and slippers comes down and
text: steps to her. She stops singing and starts to run in pursuit of Baby. He
text: clutches her arm.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He went that way!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Hush, hush, it's all right.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: You've frightened him away and now I'll never see him again.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: See? He's still there. See him?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He's not! Let go of my arm! Let go!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: He'll come back, don't worry. Now you tell me where you live. Do you
dialog: know?
dialog: (165]
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Of course I know! That's not the point. I have to get my panther. Won't
dialog: you help me?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: I certainly will.
text: He draws her firmly up the steps, Susan resisting manfully.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Let go! You don't realize that there's a million dollars at stake!

scene_heading: 238 EXT. CORNER OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: David comes around corner of house after George. A look of horror comes

scene_heading: 239 EXT. DIGBY VERANDA - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SUSAN

text: Mac and Joe of the circus truck, in the driver's seat. Joe leans out and
text: looks at the hallooer.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Excuse me, Mister -- Have you seen a panther?
scene_heading: 243 REVERSE ANGLE: MED. SHOT
text: on Applegate and Gogarty. Gogarty by now has imbibed, shall we say, too
dialog: freely. His sense of direction has never been good. It is now completely
text: drowned. He is in a fogged and befuddled state. Applegate, who is about
text: to ask directions, is thrown for a loss by Joe's question. He points off
dialog: vaguely.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Why -- why -- how did you know?
speaker_heading: 244 GROUP SHOT
text: as Joe leans out further, nettled.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Don't joke, buddy. Our jobs depend on this. We had a killer panther in
dialog: this truck and he got away.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
text: (thickly, peering at Joe)
dialog: You mean -- he wasn't gentle as a kitten?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I mean there is a guy almost dying in a hospital right now, after being
text: clawed by him.
dialog: (167]
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I can tell you where to find him. I saw him right over --
text: (begins pointing around in various directions and can't remember the
dialog: right one because he is lost and has been for some time)
dialog: right over -- over -- No, it wasn't there -- it was --
dialog: (pointing in another direction)
dialog: No, it wasn't.
dialog: (puts it squarely up to them)
dialog: Do you know where I am?
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (twitching at his sleeve)
dialog: I think we're still in Connecticut.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (apologetically, to Mac and Joe)
dialog: You see -- we've sort of -- lost our sense of direction.
text: Mac and Joe look at each other blankly.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Another one!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (to Gogarty)
dialog: Well -- there's only one thing -- to do.
text: (cups his hands and bawls)
dialog: Halloooo!
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
text: (cups his hands and bawls)
dialog: Halloooo!
text: Applegate and Gogarty are standing back to back, hallooing like mad.
dialog: (168]
speaker_heading: MAC

scene_heading: 245 INT. DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT Mrs. Digby, now in a wrapper, on the telephone
scene_heading: MRS. DIGBY
dialog: Well, Constable, it's quite obvious that the girl is deranged. Dr. Digby
dialog: is working on her now -- mental cases are his specialty. Meanwhile, we
dialog: must find her people. I wish you'd come right over.
scene_heading: 246 INT. DIGBY STUDY - NIGHT
text: Dr. Digby has Susan in a chair under a strong light and is in the midst
dialog: of a psychiatric examination.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Obviously this is a love-fixation. Yesterday when I talked to you at the
dialog: Ritz-Plaza you thought you were pursued by a young man. Do you associate
dialog: that young man with a panther?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Um-umh... You have transferred his image to a panther. Now you are
dialog: pursuing the young man. Isn't that so?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No! I'm after the panther!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: But the panther is really the young man. You must understand that, my
dialog: dear young lady.
dialog: [169]
text: Susan fearfully starts to rise. Digby, recognizing the symptoms, pushes
text: her back into chair.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (soothingly)
dialog: All right -- Don't get excited. He's a panther.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Now we're getting somewhere... Now, when you were a little girl, your
dialog: mother wouldn't allow you to have a cat, would she?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I never wanted a cat.
text: This fixes him again. He takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Well, let's approach it from a different angle. One key to the
dialog: subconscious is association. When I say a word I want you to tell me
dialog: quickly the first thing that comes into your head. You understand?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I don't understand, but I'll do it.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (springing a trap)
dialog: Panther!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: George!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Ah! You're in love with George!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, don't be silly!
dialog: (170]
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Who are you to call me silly?
dialog: (springing another trap)
dialog: Money!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Baby!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Ah! Now we have it! You want to be a mother!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, really! I only met David yesterday.
text: David is a new one on Digby.
speaker_heading: DIGBY
dialog: David? George?

dialog: Man!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: George!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY

speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: George!
dialog: (171]
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: George!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Intercostal clavicle!
text: This throws Digby completely. Clavicle! This must be a new man. He runs
text: his fingers through his hair wildly.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: We're not getting anywhere!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't you think you should go to a sanitorium for a nice long rest?
scene_heading: 247 EXT. DRIVEWAY - FRONT OF DIGBY HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Two figures approach from a car. Ed Slocum and his fat deputy. The fat

scene_heading: 249 CONSTABLE AND DEPUTY

dialog: YOU!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (mechanically)
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: SLOCUM

speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
text: (his massive brain now comprehending)
dialog: He's a thief!
dialog: (turns on Susan)
dialog: And she is his accomplice! A very clever act, young woman! ... This is
dialog: the man, Constable, who stole my car. And before that he stole my wife's
dialog: purse!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (indicating Digby)
dialog: This man is crazy, officer.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (really going crazy)
dialog: Lock them up! Take them away! I can't stand any more!

speaker_heading: SUSAN

text: David lowers his handkerchief and we see a very black eye.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: They have no right to hold us here! We haven't done anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If there is any charge but murder that you haven't managed to hang on us,
dialog: I'd like to know what it is. We're not going to get out -- not for a
text: long, long, time.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Well, David, if you want to stay here, I can't do anything about it, but

speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Stop tugging at me, Horace. I'll talk to you in a minute.

scene_heading: 255 EXT. WESTLAKE STREET - FRONT OF MARKET - NIGHT
text: Gogarty drives Dr. Digby's ear into parking space in front of market. He
text: is lustily singing, "The Wearing of the Green." He snaps off the
text: ignition, admires himself in the car mirror, pulls a bottle from his hip
text: pocket and takes a swig. Then he hangs his arm importantly over the car
text: door and waits, hoping for one of his friends to pass. From the shadows
text: two men -- one a motorcycle cop and one in plain clothes -- emerge and
text: converge on the car. Gogarty gives them a cheery good evening.
dialog: (174]
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: It's a fine night!
text: The motorcycle cop walks around the car, inspects the license plate and
text: looks through the windshield at Gogarty.
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: (speculatively
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Yes, sir, it's a fine night!
text: The motorcycle cop goes to one side of the car, the plain-clothes man to
text: the other. They hang across the doors, staring at Gogarty. Gogarty is
text: pleased by their friendliness.
scene_heading: 256 INT. TOWNSHIP JAIL - NIGHT
text: THREE SHOT -- Now we see the faces of Digby and the fat deputy and
text: perceive that each has his share of black eyes. In fact, everyone in the
text: jail, except Susan, has a black eye.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
text: This woman says her niece is in bed.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: You didn't expect they were telling the truth, did you?
speaker_heading: FAT DEPUTY
dialog: There ain't any doubt about it. That fellow was desperate.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (in phone)
dialog: Well, lady, you definitely refuse to come down and identify this girl?
dialog: (175]
scene_heading: 257 INT. VANCE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT -- Aunt Elizabeth yelling, as Applegate tugs at her sleeve
text: urgently.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: My good man, if you persist in annoying me about this lunatic girl -- who
dialog: is no responsibility of mine -- I'll have you arrested!
dialog: (bangs up the phone)
dialog: Horace, stop twitching at me!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: But, Elizabeth, I think there's something you should know.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Well, what is it?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I have a feeling --
dialog: (points at phone)
dialog: that's Susan.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (impatiently)
dialog: Will you give me one good reason why Susan would be singing under a
dialog: gentleman's window?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Well, I can't give you a good reason -- but only an hour ago I saw her
text: singing under a tree.
text: She stares at him.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: There was a panther in the tree. The fact of the matter is, Elizabeth,
dialog: your panther has arrived.
text: We see that he is going to tell her the whole story.
scene_heading: 258 INT. TOWNSHIP JAIL - NIGHT
text: Digby, Slocum and Elmer turn as the motorcycle cop drags Gogarty in,
text: Gogarty is flailing his arms and protesting vehemently but
text: unintelligibly.
dialog: (176]
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: Here's your man, Dr. Digby. We caught him parking your car in front of
dialog: the meat market.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
text: (bawling at the top of his lungs)
dialog: It's a lie! Here I was sitting peaceful as anything and minding my own
text: business and passing the time of day with them. And suddenly they set
text: upon me and one holds my arms while the other calls me names.
speaker_heading: MOTORCYCLE COP
dialog: Besides that, Constable, he's drunk.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: (roaring)
dialog: It's a lie!
text: They drag him back and put him in the cell next to Susan, slam and look
text: the door. Gogarty is howling with impotent rage.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Hello, Gogarty.
text: Gogarty stops in the middle of his tirade, whirls and looks through the
text: bars at Susan. His fogged brain cannot grasp the fact that she is in the
text: next cell. He seizes the bars between them.
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: Oh, Miss Susan, you've come to get me out! It's ashamed I am you should
dialog: see me in here on so unjust a charge.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't worry, Gogarty. I'll get you out.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S VOICE
dialog: (from his cell)
dialog: No, Gogarty, don't worry. She'll fix it.
dialog: (177]
speaker_heading: 259 AT DOOR
text: Aunt Elizabeth and Major Applegate enter the Jail. Applegate is carrying

speaker_heading: 260 AT DESK
text: Constable Slocum, Digby and Elmer look up as Aunt Elizabeth bears down on
text: them, followed by Applegate.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (pounding desk)
dialog: What do you mean locking up my niece? I won't have it!
text: (her gaze fixes on Digby)
dialog: Where are your keys?
dialog: (snaps her fingers)
dialog: Come on, come on, come on!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (rising stiffly)
dialog: Madam, we'll pardon you because you are obviously hysterical. Now what do
dialog: you want?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I want my niece! Immediately!
text: (jabbing down with her forefinger)
dialog: Here!
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Now be calm. You give us a description of her and we'll find her.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: You don't have to find her! She's already here!
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Just a minute, lady. Quiet down. Who are you?
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: I am Mrs. Carleton Random.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (reprovingly)
dialog: Now, lady, I just talked to Mrs. Carleton Random on the telephone -- not
dialog: ten minutes age. We know that you are not Mrs. Carleton Random.
dialog: (178]
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: But you did talk to her ten minutes ago. I was there.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: And who are you?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: I am Major Horace Applegate.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (pointing at the gun)
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (with dignity)
dialog: I have been hunting a panther.
text: Slocum furtively makes a sign to the deputy, who sidles around behind the
text: two visitors, cutting off their exit.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Oh -- you've been hunting a panther.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: Yes.
text: Slocum advances toward Applegate and the deputy closes in behind him,
text: with menacing friendliness.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Any luck?
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: (beginning to realize that all is not well)
dialog: Why -- er -- no.
text: Applegate backs away and backs into Elmer.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Grab his gun, Elmer!
dialog: (179]
text: There is a wild scuffle as Elmer and Slocum struggle with Applegate.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (pounding the desk)
dialog: Stop it, you numbskulls! Take your hands off that man! This is the most
dialog: outrageous thing I ever heard of!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
text: (simultaneously; slightly impeded by his gun)
dialog: Gentlemen -- gentlemen -- please! There is no need for violence. This can
dialog: all be settled quietly!
text: From the cells come Susan's howls.
speaker_heading: SUSAN'S VOICE
dialog: Is that you, Aunt Elizabeth?
text: Constable Slocum and Elmer have Applegate down on the floor, trying to
text: wrest the gun from him. Digby dances around the three of them, looking
text: for a place on Applegate where he can get hold of him.
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
text: (trying to hold the gun out of reach; in an anguished voice)
dialog: Be careful, my good man! It might go off.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Idiots! Nitwits! Stop it! Do you hear me? Stop it!
text: Her hand reaches out for an inkwell and she hurls it with effect at
text: Digby. The fray grows more violent and she bores in, hitting anyone with
dialog: whom she can connect.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE
scene_heading: 261 INT. TOWNSHIP JAIL - NIGHT
text: TRUCK SHOT -- on cells. The occupants are, in order: David, Susan,
text: Gogarty, Applegate and Aunt Elizabeth. All but David are yelling
text: protests. He sits quietly in a corner of his cell with his head in his
dialog: hands.
dialog: (180]
speaker_heading: 262 GROUP SHOT
text: At Constable Slocum's desk. Digby, Slocum and Elmer are thoroughly
text: splashed with ink. Digby and the fat deputy listen tensely to Slocum on
dialog: the telephone.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: We just want to make sure, lady. This old battleaxe keeps yelling that
dialog: she's Mrs. Random.
scene_heading: 263 INT. VANCE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: CLOSE SHOT -- Mrs. Gogarty in a flannel nightgown, her hair in curlers,
text: as she snorts into the telephone.
scene_heading: MRS. GOGARTY
dialog: That's ridiculous! Mrs. Random is in bed. And don't ring up here again!
text: (bangs up the receiver
scene_heading: 264 INT. TOWNSHIP JAIL -- NIGHT
text: THREE SHOT -- at phone. Slocum hangs up the receiver.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: It's just like you thought, Doc. They're all lying.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Obviously a gang! I've no doubt you will find you've made a very
dialog: important haul.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Thanks to you, Doc.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: If you get their confessions, Constable, there'll be a lot of things
dialog: you'll turn up.
scene_heading: 265 EXT. LONELY ROAD -- NIGHT
text: FULL SHOT of the headlights of two cars approaching each other slowly.
text: They stop alongside each other.
dialog: (181]
speaker_heading: 266 CLOSER SHOT
text: the Zoo official and Joe, the driver of the cage-truck, lean toward each
text: other, speaking simultaneously.
scene_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL AND JOE
dialog: Have you seen a panther?
text: (both wait, taken aback. Then both speak again)
dialog: We're hunting for a panther.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (getting the jump on his opponent)
dialog: Say, who's going to talk first?
speaker_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL
dialog: (in same angry tone)
dialog: How did you know there was a panther loose?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I lost him.
speaker_heading: ZOO OFFICIAL
dialog: Is he bad?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: He's as bad as they come.
scene_heading: 267 INT. TOWNSHIP JAIL - NIGHT
text: Slocum and Elmer are outside David's cell with Dr. Digby behind them,
text: taking notes. We see Susan sitting on the floor, her elbows on her knees,
text: her two hands cupping her face, as she listens. Another of Susan's
text: horrible plans is forming. David leans against the bars dejectedly.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: So you stick to it that your name is Bone, huh?
dialog: (no reply)
dialog: You can't fool me. We know that's an alias.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
text: They're all impersonating somebody.
dialog: [182]
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: What about that bank robbery in Oldtown?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, what about it? How much did they get?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Five thousand --
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: Who's asking the questions here -- you or me?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: Keep calm, Slocum. Don't let him throw you off.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: What about Mrs. Cleghorn's jewels in Sunfield?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I tell you again I'm not a thief. You're wasting your time.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: He's a tough nut to crack.
dialog: (whirls on David)
dialog: What were you doing breaking into Dr. Digby's house?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was after a panther.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (turns to Digby)
text: He sticks to it, Doc.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: They've all agreed on one story.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: That's what I say.
dialog: (to the attack again)
dialog: Show me a panther!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you expect me to do, whistle him in here?
dialog: (183]
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Who was with you on that mail-truck job in Rockdale last month?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Charles Evans Hughes and Jim Farley.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Take those names down, Doc.
text: Dr. Digby lowers his pad and pencil. Slocum is getting to be a little too
dialog: much for him, even.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Why don't you ask me?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: I suppose you're going to hand me the same cock-and-bull story about
dialog: hunting a panther?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: No, Constable. I can see you're too smart to swallow it.
text: Slocum moves up on Susan. David rouses from his lethargy and stares at
text: Susan with apprehension. He can see another plan coming.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: Susan, it won't work out! Whatever it is, it won't work out!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (eyeing him sadly)
dialog: Oh, darling, why did you have to go for that dame in the dance hall?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to Slocum)
dialog: Don't believe a word that woman says! The truth isn't in her!
dialog: (184]
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Shut up, you!
dialog: (to Susan)
dialog: Is this guy's name Bone?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's Dapper David. You've heard of him, haven't you?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: You got that, Doc?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: I have it.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: And is your name Susan Vance, like you said?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: That's my society tag. The gang call me Susie the Slipwit.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She's making it all up out of motion pictures she's seen!
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: The jig's up, Dave. But I'll tell you one thing. I wouldn't-a ratted if
dialog: it hadn't been for... her. I'd-a-gone through anything for you.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: A ladykiller, is he?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: He knocks 'em over --
dialog: (snapping her fingers)
dialog: One, two, three, like that. I never caught him before.
dialog: (185]
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Then you're ready to make a clean breast of it and make it easy for
dialog: yourself?
dialog: (to Dr. Digby)
dialog: They always trip themselves up when they can't let the women alone.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: What's the percentage in me keeping quiet? He sold me out.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: All right, Elmer. Bring her out.
scene_heading: 268 ALL OF THE CELLS
text: as Elmer unlocks the door of Susan's cell and releases her. There is a
text: howl of protest uttered simultaneously, in a bedlam that make no sense.
speaker_heading: AUNT ELIZABETH
dialog: Susan Vance, you get right back in that cell!
speaker_heading: APPLEGATE
dialog: But she is Susan Vance!
speaker_heading: GOGARTY
dialog: But, Miss Susan, you said you were going to get me out!
dialog: vou don't know what you're letting yourself in for, Constable! She'll set
dialog: fire to the jail!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (now out of cell)
dialog: It's every man for himself now, boys. I'm not taking this rap.
dialog: (stares longingly at David)
dialog: Can I kiss him goodbye, Constable?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Go ahead.
dialog: [186]
text: Susan lunges at David and gets her arms around his neck through the bars.
text: She kisses him roundly. David struggles and finally shoves her, with an
text: open hand, in the chest. Susan staggers, loses her balance and lands,
text: sitting, livid with rage.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (pointing at him in a fury)
dialog: All right, you rat! You're tired of me! I'll show you! I'll teach you to
dialog: pick up tramps like that bird woman and toss me off like an old shoe!
text: Getting to her feet she marches with dignity between Digby and Slocum
text: toward the desk. Elmer follows.
speaker_heading: 269 DESK
text: as the group enters.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: You set down there, Doc, and get this. Elmer, you get behind that
dialog: typewriter. We got to have this confession in affidavit form.
dialog: (turns on Susan)
dialog: You stand right here, Miss.
dialog: (levels his finger)
dialog: Now talk and talk fast! You're all members of the same gang, ain't you?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (backing toward door
dialog: Yeah. They call us the Panther Gang. We organized in Buffalo.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Panther Gang. Got that, Doc?
text: Digby nods.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Elmer?
speaker_heading: ELMER
dialog: Wait a minute, Ed. I ain't so good at this.
dialog: (187]
text: Slocum looks over Elmer's shoulder.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Panther ain't spelled with a ‘u’...
text: (to Susan without looking around as Digby bends over his notes)
dialog: Go ahead, Miss. What about the Cleghorn jewels?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (backing toward door
dialog: That's hot ice, Mister. We're waiting for it to cool off.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: How about the mail-truck robbery?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I was the lookout on that job. Applegate shot the man.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (watching Elmer type)
dialog: Were you in on the bank job, too?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Sure! What do you think? Where my guy goes, I go, I mean I did, before he
dialog: crossed me. He'd, ‘a’ killed me if I hadn't. That woman who calls herself
text: Random is the brains of our mob. She picks out soft spots and gives us
text: our orders. Applegate's the finger. The drunk steals the cars.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: (as Digby writes furiously)
dialog: Have you got it, Doc? This is terrific!
text: As Elmer types feverishly, and all are too excited to notice, Susan backs
text: to the threshold, cuts and runs.
dialog: [188]
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Now how many murders has your gang committed?
text: There is a long pause and all look up. From outside comes the sound of a
text: car starting. Digby rises.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: She's got my car! Again!
scene_heading: 270 EXT. FRONT OF JAIL - NIGHT
text: The three men come rushing out as the car lurches off, Susan at the
text: wheel. A taxi rolls up and stops. Out of it climbs Mr. Peabody with a
text: briefcase, followed by Miss Swallow. They confront Digby, Slocum and
dialog: Elmer.
scene_heading: MR. PEABODY
dialog: I'm looking for Mrs. Carleton Random.
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Hunh?
scene_heading: MR. PEABODY
dialog: Her housekeeper tells me there was a mysterious telephone call from a
dialog: crazy man who said he was at the jail. Do you know anything about it,
dialog: Constable?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: Mrs. Carleton Random! Who are you?
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: I can identify this gentleman, Slocum. His name is Alexander Peabody.
dialog: (to Peabody)
dialog: You may remember, Mr. Peabody, I testified for you during the breaking of
dialog: the Borden will.
scene_heading: MR. PEABODY
dialog: Yes, I remember. I lost the case.
dialog: [189]
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: I'm looking for a man by the name of Dr. Huxley -- Dr. David Huxley. Is
dialog: he here with Mrs. Random?
speaker_heading: SLOCUM
dialog: No, Miss. All we got is a woman who's making out to be Mrs. Random -- a

dialog: by the name of Bone.
speaker_heading: DR. DIGBY
dialog: (jumping to a safe limb)

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You mean to say there's another panther? You lost a panther out of that
dialog: truck?
dialog: (194]
text: His frantic voice makes everyone turn and look.
speaker_heading: JOE

scene_heading: 287 EXT. JAIL - NIGHT

text: She makes a terrific jerk and the panther springs out beside her, tail

dialog: Will you get in there!
text: She gives him a kick. The bad panther starts in hurriedly. Susan is

text: She gets her back to the group now, trying to drag the resisting panther
text: to their midst.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, how can you act this way! Just when I want you to be nice for Aunt
dialog: Elizabeth!
text: Losing her temper, she kicks him viciously. The panther lunges and she is
text: dragged by the rope. Everybody, too paralyzed to move up to this point,
text: breaks and runs for the cells which are standing open.
speaker_heading: 289 CLOSE SHOT
text: Susan finally stops the panther. She looks past CAMERA in astonishment at
text: the flying figures.
speaker_heading: 290 CLOSE-VIEW
text: of cells, as our people leap into them and Start slamming doors. Mr.
text: Peabody and Miss Swallow get into one cell. Aunt Elizabeth and Digby clap
text: the door on another cell. Gogarty is in a cell alone. Applegate and
text: Slocum share a cell. Joe, Elmer and Mac are in another. There are two
text: cells still vacant, the doors standing open.
speaker_heading: 291 TWO SHOT
text: David and Susan, left alone in the middle of the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (anguished)
dialog: Susan!
text: points off toward desk weakly. Susan's gaze turns to where he is
dialog: pointing.
speaker_heading: 292 WHAT SHE SEES
text: Baby, terrified, standing on the desk. George, equally frightened,
text: peering under Baby's stomach. Suddenly both, seeing an empty cell, spring
text: from the desk and dash for it.
dialog: [196]
speaker_heading: 293 CLOSE SHOT
text: empty cell as Baby and George streak in, crowding for first place. Aunt
text: Elizabeth, who is in the next cell, reaches around and bangs the door
dialog: shut.
scene_heading: 294 SUSAN AND DAVID
text: - in the middle of the room. Susan is still holding to the rope, too
text: scared to let go. The bad panther, lashing his tail and snarling, stands
text: between her and David, crouching.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (facing the killer)
dialog: Susan -- let go of that rope -- and run!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (In a quivering voice)
dialog: No, David -- no matter what happens I love you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (clutching vaguely for a chair behind him)
dialog: Susan, I know that! I love you, too! But will you let go of that rope --
dialog: and get out!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (with a determination born of love)
dialog: No!
text: She quietly crumples in a faint, letting go of the rope. David, thinking
text: only of Susan, whips the chair in front of him and, as the panther
text: advances on him, gets between Susan and the panther, which seems less
text: interested in her than in the panther at the rear of the room.
scene_heading: 295 FULL SHOT PAST
text: David and the crumpled figure of Susan, toward the cells, as with a snarl
text: the bad panther charges toward Baby. David takes one agonized look over
text: his shoulder at the prostrate Susan and, holding the chair before him, he
text: starts toward the bad panther.
dialog: (197]
speaker_heading: 296 AT CELLS
text: The bad panther is striking and snarling viciously through the steel bars
text: at Baby and George, who cower in opposite corners at the back, looking
text: appealingly at Aunt Elizabeth for protection. David enters with the chair
text: before him, closing in on the bad panther, which turns and faces him with
text: a snarl, backing up. David yells frenziedly:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan! Darling! Are you all right? Susan! Answer me!
text: The panther backs slowly, menacingly in through the open door of the last
text: vacant cell and David bangs the door on it just as the panther springs.
text: In a state of collapse, not knowing what he is doing, he sinks weakly
text: into the chair which he has been carrying. The panther springs
text: ferociously at the bars behind him. But David no longer knows nor cares.
text: As he sits there, Susan comes crawling in to him on her knees. This act
text: of heroism has been too much for her. She puts her arms around his waist
text: as she thrills with love.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Da-vid! Are you all right?
text: Her voice rouses him even more than the snarling of the panther behind
text: him. He rises uncertainly to his feet.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No! I'm not all right I'll never be all right again! Susan Vance, you're
dialog: a menace to society. I never want to see you or your aunt or your panther
dialog: again! I'm going back to my Museum, and I'm going to be quiet!
dialog: (hysterically)
dialog: Quiet, quiet, do you hear? Did you ever hear the word?
text: And he staggers out, leaving her still on her knees with supplicating
text: arms reaching after him. She turns on the bad panther in a reproachful
text: wail.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Now look what you've done!
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE OUT
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE IN
dialog: [198]
scene_heading: 297 INT. BRONTOSAURUS ROOM - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY
text: MED. SHOT -- Miss Swallow facing David, who is at work once more. In the
text: b.g. we see the huge structure of the brontosaurus. David is dejected but
text: holding up. Miss Swallow is taking a ring from her finger. She will
dialog: always carry the picture of a man who has been foolish but is not bad.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: (with womanly bitchery)
dialog: David, I'm sorry, but for three days I've been trying to fathom your
dialog: infatuation for this woman. I realize that men must sow their wild oats,
dialog: but --
dialog: (wildly)
dialog: David, while they're sowing them they needn't lose an intercostal
dialog: clavicle!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Alice, I tell you I'm not infatuated!
dialog: (then regaining control)
dialog: I couldn't marry her. Multiply those two days by three hundred and sixty-
dialog: five! The result is unthinkable!
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: But you're quite right. I couldn't marry anyone else.
dialog: (facing a drab future without Susan)
dialog: I'm going to devote my life to science. If you'll work with me, we'll
dialog: complete the Brontosaurus Group.
scene_heading: MISS SWALLOW
dialog: (cruelly)
dialog: You can't even complete this one without an intercostal clavicle.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wish you wouldn't keep bringing that up. I feel bad enough as it is.
dialog: [199]
text: He puts the ring in his pocket and mounts the ladder. Miss Swallow, in
text: righteous indignation, goes to the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shouting after her)
dialog: I didn't mean to lose the intercostal clavicle! I didn't want to lose it!
dialog: But I lost it! Any woman would understand that!
speaker_heading: 298 AT DOORWAY
text: Susan bursts in, brushing aside Miss Swallow, who is coming out. Miss
text: Swallow sails past Susan, nose in the air.
speaker_heading: 299 SUSAN
text: her hat askew, barges into the room brandishing the intercostal clavicle.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I've got it, David! I've got it!
speaker_heading: 300 DAVID
text: on top of his stepladder. He looks down and sees Susan. He wants to come
text: down to her but he is afraid.
speaker_heading: 301 DOWNWARD SHOT
dialog: on Susan.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (brandishing bone)
dialog: I've followed George for three days, David! I dug holes with him! And
dialog: then he brought it and put it in my shoe! Darling, look! Don't be mad at
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: 302 DAVID
text: on top of his stepladder. He knows if he comes down he will take Susan in
text: his arms and that means the rest of his life.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan -- put it down and go away.
dialog: [200]
speaker_heading: 303 SUSAN
text: from the floor as she looks up at him.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: I won't. You know you love me!
text: She walks to a tall stepladder on the opposite side of the skeleton and
text: starts up it.
speaker_heading: 304 DAVID
text: David on top of his stepladder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan! I warn you -- don't come up here!
speaker_heading: 305 SUSAN
text: Susan mounts the ladder.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Don't worry, David! Everything's going to be all right.
speaker_heading: 306 DAVID
text: on top of his stepladder, alarmed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Something always happens when you say that. Susan, please go away! You
dialog: and your panther have cost the Museum a million dollars!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (rising into view)
dialog: No, it hasn't David. I've got the million dollars. Aunt Elizabeth has
dialog: given it to me. But I'll give it to you. I don't know anything about a
dialog: brontosaurus. But this is a lovely one!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan, there is a difference between science and love. I am devoted to
dialog: science. You are devoted to love.
dialog: (indicating skeleton)
text: There's a wide gap between us.
dialog: (reaching out)
dialog: I'm very grateful to you -- I mean to George -- no, to you -- to George.
dialog: I mean I'm very grateful. But give it to me.
dialog: (201]
text: Susan, on tiptoe on top of the ladder, tries to hand it to him. Her
text: stepladder begins to sway.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: David you saved my life. You owe me something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (fighting love)
dialog: Give me that bone!....And Susan -- do stop rocking!
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: (still rocking)
dialog: Darling, I'm not rocking! It's the ladder!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But, Susan -- this is four years' work!
dialog: (agonized)
dialog: Susan -- will you stop rocking?
speaker_heading: SUSAN
text: (wildly, trying to balance herself with the bone)
dialog: Don't worry, David. Everything's going to be all right!
text: David watches her, hypnotized. He closes his eyes as Susan's stepladder
text: sways wider, and into the skeleton.
speaker_heading: 307 FULL SHOT
text: As Susan clings to a rib.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Da-vid!
text: Slowly, slowly the giant skeleton -- and David's love of science --
text: collapses, as his beloved is buried beneath a bunch of old bones. She is
text: concealed from sight and we only hear inarticulate walls. David, more
text: worried about Susan than about his brontosaurus slides down the ladder
text: and begins excavating.
dialog: [202]
scene_heading: 308 MED. SHOT
text: On the pile of bones -- four years' work gone to hell -- as David
text: frantically throws precious ribs right and left, thinking at last only of
dialog: his love.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Susan! Susan! Are you all right? Speak to me!
text: He uncovers her face, close, to his.
speaker_heading: SUSAN
dialog: Oh, David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (exhausted with love, exertion and relief)
dialog: Darling, this is going to be terrible -- but will you marry me?
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
speaker_heading: THE END
