text: Woody ducks from behind the post, plunges his scissors into
text: a garbage bag.
text: Garbage spills out: wrong bag. He tries another. No luck.

speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Things got complicated. Where's
dialog: Potato Head?
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: We haven’t seen him!

speaker_heading: JESSIE (CONT'D)

dialog: Did you guys fix Buzz?
speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: Eh... Sort of.
scene_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD
dialog: Jessie, behind you! Someone’s coming!

scene_heading: MR. POTATO HEAD
dialog: You would not believe...! What I’ve
dialog: been through...! Tonight!
text: Mrs. Potato Head goes to him.

speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Almost there!
text: Jessie darts out, with others close behind. The lights of

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Back up, back up!
text: Woody backs into the shadows with Bullseye and the Aliens.
text: The Truck pulls up and stops.
text: Jessie looks back, sees Woody and the others still hiding.
text: Woody gestures “We’ll go around”. Jessie does a thumbs-up.
text: Woody and the Aliens ride Bullseye across the playground
text: swing set. They stop abruptly. Big Baby is sitting on the
text: last swing, CREAKING back and forth, gazing up at the moon.
text: Bullseye and Woody tip-toe behind Big Baby, approach the
text: wood siding for the swing set area. Bullseye leaps over
text: the siding but the last Alien falls to the ground. SQUEAK.
text: Big Baby swivels his head 180 degrees.
text: Woody, Bullseye, et al lie low behind the siding plank --
text: in the shadows, amid plastic shovels and buckets.
text: Big Baby dismounts, walks toward their hiding place.
text: Woody looks around desperately.
text: Big Baby reaches the wood siding, looks over.
text: No one’s there. Looks up and down. He walks off.
text: HOLD ON an overturned plastic bucket. Woody and Bullseye
text: peek out from underneath, share a relieved look.
text: Jessie, watching from the bushes, sighs with relief.
text: Abruptly, Spanish Buzz grabs her, yanks her to him. As
text: Jessie stands awkwardly, Spanish Buzz performs a solemn,
text: impassioned courtship dance around her.
text: Finally, Spanish Buzz takes Jessie in his arms.

text: Jessie leaves Buzz, runs and gives Woody an impulsive hug.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Woody! Thank goodness!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: C'mon! We’re almost there!
text: He and Jessie leads the Toys off, REVEALING Spanish Buzz --

speaker_heading: SPANISH BUZZ
dialog: El Vaquero...!!!
text: Mad with jealousy, he narrows his eyes and runs after them.
scene_heading: EXT. TRASH CHUTE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Buzz, c’mere, gimme a lift!

text: POV -- The grimy metal chute recedes into blackness.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Is it safe?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I guess I'll find out...
text: Woody begins a controlled slide down -- feet first, hand
text: bracing. He slips and it becomes an uncontrolled slide.
text: He scrambles for traction, eases to a stop at the bottom.
text: He gets up, stands at the edge of the slide’s precipice.
text: ANGLE -- An alley. The trash chute cantilevers over a half-
text: closed dumpster. Above him, stars twinkle -- freedom.
speaker_heading: JESSIE (0.S.)
dialog: Woody...! You okay?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Come on down. But not all at once.
speaker_heading: MR. POTATO HEAD (0.S.)
dialog: What’d he say?
speaker_heading: HAMM (0.S.)
dialog: I think he said, “All at once”.
speaker_heading: NOISES.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No...! No! No! No! No!
text: Too late. The Toys slide down together.
speaker_heading: TOYS REX
dialog: Whoa! Watch out! Geronimo...!!!

speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: SPANISH BUZZ

dialog: 103
speaker_heading: SLINKY
dialog: I might be old, but I still got a
dialog: spring in my step.
text: He backs up, then leaps over the open pit to the closed lid
text: of the dumpster. He lands hard, clutches a metal handle.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: He did it!
speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: All right, Slinky-kins!
speaker_heading: SLINKY
dialog: Okay! Climb across!
text: Suddenly, two pink paws step in front of Slinky. He looks
text: up. Lotso looms over him, grinning.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: You lost, 1i’l doggy...?
text: Lotso kicks Slinky’s paws. He retracts, falling from the
text: lid. The Toys pull him to safety.
text: Behind Lotso, his Gang hops off a wall and joins him on the
text: dumpster lid. Lotso notices Woody among the others.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, well...! Look who’s back!
text: A NOISE. The Toys turn. Lotso’s henchman -- Stretch, the
text: Octopus -- clambers down the chute, blocking an escape.
text: The Lifer Phone wheels into view -- wheels wobbling, one
text: eye broken, frayed phone dangling. His voice is hoarse.
speaker_heading: LIFER
dialog: (via handset)
dialog: I’m sorry, Cowboy! They broke me...!
text: Lotso turns to the Toys, as cheerful as ever.
speaker_heading: LOTSO

speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: Y’think you’re special, Cowboy?
dialog: You're a piece of plastic! You were
dialog: made to be thrown away!
text: VROOM! A garbage truck turns into the far end of the alley
text: and RUMBLES toward them. Lotso turns.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: Speak of the devil...!
dialog: (turns back)
dialog: Now we need toys in our Caterpillar
dialog: Room. And you need to avoid that
dialog: truck. Why don’t you come on back,
dialog: join our family again?
text: He smiles. Woody seethes -- at a loss for words. Jessie
text: steps past him, eyes burning.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: This isn’t a family, it’s a prison!
dialog: You're a liar and a bully and I'd
dialog: rather rot in this dumpster than join
dialog: any family of yours!
text: Barbie steps forward.
speaker_heading: BARBIE
dialog: Jessie’s right! Authority should
dialog: derive from the consent of the
dialog: governed! Not from the threat of
dialog: force!
text: Hamm and Potato Head share a glance -- Huh? lLotso grins.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: If that’s what you want...!
text: He bangs his cane. Stretch, the Octopus, begins to prod
text: the Toys toward the precipice. Abruptly, Ken bursts from
text: the shadows -- still in his underwear.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Barbie! Wait...!
text: Everyone turns. He runs to Lotso.
speaker_heading: KEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't do this, Lotso...!
speaker_heading: LOTSO

speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Not to me there’s not!
text: He glances at her. She sighs. Lotso picks up Ken.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Fine! Why don’t you join her?!
text: He tosses Ken across the dumpster chasm. The Toys grab
text: him, pull him to safety. Barbie hugs him.
speaker_heading: BARBIE
dialog: Oh, Ken!
text: Ken stands and addresses Lotso’s Gang, earnest and heroic.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Everyone! Listen! Sunnyside could
dialog: be cool and groovy if we treated each
dialog: other fair!
dialog: (points)
dialog: It’s Lotso! He’s made us into a
dialog: pyramid and he put himself on top!
text: Lotso’s Gang eyes each other. There’s a shift in sympathy
text: but no one wants to stick their neck out. Lotso is amused.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Anyone concur with Ken?
text: No one moves. The truck RUMBLES closer -- two dumpsters
text: away. Lotso turns to the Toys. His face hardens.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t throw you away. Your kid did.
dialog: Ain’t one kid ever loved a toy, really!
dialog: Chew on that when you’re at the dump!
text: He turns away. Woody steps forward.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Wait...! What about Daisy?
text: Lotso keeps a steely composure.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: I don’t know what you’re talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Daisy...? You used to do everything
dialog: with her!
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Yeah -- then she threw us out!
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No -- she lost you!
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: She replaced us!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: She replaced you! And if you couldn't
dialog: have her, no one could! You lied to
dialog: Big Baby and you been lying ever since!
text: Woody yanks something from his holster. It’s the rusty old
text: pendant, “My Heart Belongs To: DAISY”. Lotso is stunned.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Where’d you get that...?!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: She loved you, Lotso...
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: She never loved me!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: ..-As much as any kid ever loved a
dialog: toy!
text: Woody throws the pendant. It lands at Big Baby’s feet.
text: Big Baby stares, electrified, at the pendant -- a token of
text: his long-lost love. He picks it up. His lip trembles.
speaker_heading: BIG BABY
dialog: Mama...!
text: Lotso grabs the pendant. He pokes Big Baby like a bully.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: What -- you want your Mommy back? She
dialog: never loved you! Don’t be such a baby!
text: He throws it down and CRUSHES it with his cane. Big Baby’s
text: face crumples. Lotso turns, yells at Stretch the Octopus.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: Push ‘em in! All of ‘em!
dialog: (to his Gang)
dialog: This is what happens when you dummies
dialog: try to think!
text: He shoves Big Baby. Big Baby shrinks back, hurt.
text: Stretch advances on Woody and the Toys. They teeter at the
text: edge of the precipice. Lotso faces them, sneering.
dialog: 107
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: We're all just trash, waitin’ to be
dialog: thrown away! That’s all a toy is!
text: Abruptly, Lotso is lifted from behind by Big Baby.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: Put me down! What're you doing?
text: Big Baby carries him to the edge of the dumpster.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: Help me! Help!
text: Around the dumpster, no one moves. Big Baby tosses Lotso
text: into the dumpster. He lands in the shadows, looks up.
text: With a CREAK, the Big Baby tugs at the open dumpster lid.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: No...! Wait...!
text: KLOON! Big Baby watches -- blank-eyed, pitiless -- as the
text: lid SLAMS down, shutting Lotso in. No one can believe it.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: He’s gone!!!
scene_heading: MR. POTATO HEAD
dialog: Holy cow!!!
speaker_heading: BIG BABY
text: Ah-pppbbb11lmmmmmmm...!!!
text: He blows a RASPBERRY at Lotso. VROOOM! The Toys turn.
text: The garbage truck is only 100 feet -- 15 seconds -- away.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: C’mon! Hurry!
text: The Toys hop on the now-closed dumpster lid, rush to the
text: retaining wall, and help each other clamber onto it.
text: A SQUEAK. Woody turns. At the crack between the two lids
text: are the three Aliens. One Alien is stuck. He struggles
text: while the other two stand around ineffectually.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh...! For crying out loud!
text: Woody glances at the approaching truck, then runs back.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Woody...!
text: Woody yanks the Alien free. Spanish Buzz gestures.
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: SPANISH BUZZ
dialog: Vaquero, andale!
dialog: (Cowboy, hurry!)
text: The Aliens retreat to safety. Woody tries to follow, but a
text: pink paw grabs his leg. Woody tries to free himself, but
text: the paw drags him slowly into the dumpster’s depths.
text: The Toys watch, horrified, as Woody disappears.
text: The truck turns and approaches the dumpster, fork out.
speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: Oh, boy! Incoming!
text: BA-BOOM! The truck’s forks slide into the dumpster and
text: begin lifting it up. As it rises past the retaining wall
text: Jessie and Buzz fearlessly jump onto the rising dumpster.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: C'mon!
text: The other Toys follow. Barbie tries to follow too, but Ken
text: holds her back.
speaker_heading: KEN
dialog: Barbie, no...!
text: They all try to lift the dumpster lid. It won’t budge.
text: The dumpster rises up, up, up -- and begins to tilt.
text: As the dumpster tilts, they start to lose their footing.
text: As the dumpster nears vertical, the lid swings open and
text: trash begins pouring into the truck. Woody calls out...
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Jess!
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Woody!
text: Woody falls into darkness. A FLASH of pink goes by --
text: Lotso tumbles past. The dumpster LURCHES to a stop.

speaker_heading: BARBIE

text: A trickle of garbage begins to sprinkle down from above.
speaker_heading: SPANISH BUZZ
dialog: Senorita...!
text: Buzz runs through the falling trash until he finds her
text: pressed against the far wall -- terrified.
dialog: 110
text: CLUMP! Something large falls behind them. They look up.
text: Garbage is falling out of the dumpster directly above them.
text: Buzz takes Jessie’s hand and they run across the garbage
text: truck bay, dodging madly while trash rains down upon them.
text: Against the back wall, the Toys watch, aghast.
speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: They’11 never make it!
text: Buzz grabs Jessie and carries her -- dodging and weaving.
text: A SCRAPING sound above.
scene_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD
dialog: Look out!
text: Buzz and Jessie look up. An old TV set falls towards them.
text: Buzz lunges and tosses Jessie out of the way. She turns.
text: CRASH!!! The TV smashes down on Buzz. A deluge of trash
text: piles on top, burying him completely.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Buzz...!!!
text: As the dumpster above recedes, Jessie runs forward and
text: begins digging. The other Toys join her.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Anyone see him?!
speaker_heading: SLINKY
dialog: Over here, y'all! I found him!
text: They rush over and drag Buzz from the pile. Buzz’s eyes
text: are closed. Jessie pops his shield, shakes him.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Buzz, you okay?! Buzz! Buzz!!!
text: No response. Jessie shakes him again. And again.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: No...!
text: She hugs him, sobbing.
text: A BEEP. Buzz jack-knifes forward, then lurches back.
text: Jessie pulls away. Buzz sits up, eyes open -- disoriented.
text: He sniffs the air with distaste. Then he sees the others.
text: The Toys gape at him in open-mouthed wonder.
dialog: 111
text: Buzz frowns.
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: That wasn’t me, was it?
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Oh, Buzz! You’re back!!! You’re

speaker_heading: REX
dialog: (excitable)
text: In a garbage truck on the way to the
dialog: dump!
text: Buzz’s smile freezes.
scene_heading: EXT. TRI-COUNTY DUMP - NIGHT
text: The garbage truck drives in the entrance.
scene_heading: INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
text: The truck grinds to a halt. The BEEP-BEEP-BEEP backing-up
text: alarm begins to sound. The Toys look around.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Everyone -- stay together!
text: Everything lurches. The truck bay begins to tilt.
scene_heading: EXT. DUMP - NIGHT
text: The garbage truck tilts up -- higher and higher. Trash
text: begins pouring out the back, onto the dump below.
dialog: 112
scene_heading: INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
text: The back flap opens, allowing garbage to spill out. A
text: trash pit is revealed below. The Toys begin sliding out.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hold on! We’re going in...!
speaker_heading: TOYS
dialog: Whoa...!
scene_heading: EXT. DUMP - NIGHT
text: The garbage truck extends fully, tilting 70 degrees. The

scene_heading: INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - NIGHT
text: The Toys cling together, screaming, as they slide out into
text: the open night.
scene_heading: EXT. GARBAGE PIT - NIGHT
text: Woody lands on a trash heap -- Oooff! A plastic bag whips
text: by. He sits up. He’s in a vast, wind-blown landfill.
text: Nearby, Hamm and Rex unearth themselves. Mr. Potato Head
text: helps Mrs. Potato Head up.
scene_heading: MR. POTATO HEAD
dialog: You got all your pieces?
text: The Aliens pop up. One points to some heavy machinery --
text: with a giant claw -- in the distance.
speaker_heading: ALIEN
dialog: The Cla-a-a-aw!
text: They toddle off toward it.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Hey! Guys, no...! No!!!
text: Suddenly, the trio of Aliens is bathed in headlights.
text: Before anyone can react, a bulldozer passes over them...
text: Just like that, they’re gone.
scene_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD
dialog: My Babies...!!!
text: A blinding LIGHT pours over her and envelops the Toys.
dialog: 113
text: Woody turns. A bulldozer -- with giant, studded wheels and
text: a massive grate -- is heading right at them. Rex SCREAMS.
text: The Toys are pushed backward toward a trench.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on!
text: They tumble as the bulldozer pushes them over the edge.
scene_heading: EXT. CONVEYER BELT - NIGHT
text: The Toys land on a conveyor belt entering a dark tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. CONVEYER BELT - NIGHT

scene_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD
dialog: Woody! What do we do?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We'll be okay if we stay toge--...
text: VWOOSH! Slinky is pulled up OUT OF FRAME.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Slinky...!
speaker_heading: SLINKY
dialog: Woody...!
text: Slinky is fixed to a fast-moving conveyor belt above them.
text: Woody runs after him.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Slinky, get down from there!
text: A hammer shoots up and CLANKS on the belt, narrowly missing
text: Slinky. All around them, other pieces of metal begin
text: FLYING UP and sticking to the ceiling belt. Jessie yells.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: It’s a magnet! Watch out!
text: High above, Slinky looks around.
speaker_heading: SLINKY
dialog: Uh, you might wanna take a look at
dialog: this!
text: The Toys scramble up a pile of debris.
dialog: 114
text: Ahead is a Shredder -- two fast-spinning vertical cylinders
text: that shred everything on the belt. Buzz sees a lunch box
text: near him starting to quiver....
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Quick! Grab something metal!
text: He grabs it and is pulled up to the magnetic belt. Woody
text: grabs a metal handle and flies up, sticking to the ceiling
text: belt. Hamm dives into a nearby pot and is lifted upwards.
speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: You heard the guy...!
text: Each Toy grabs a metal object and lifts -- CLUNK! -- to the
text: ceiling. Rex, the last, grabs an aluminum can, a CD, etc.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: It’s not working!!!
text: Finally, he grabs a metal fan and sails up to safety.
text: Suddenly, a pink paw thrusts out from the belt below.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (0.S.)
dialog: Help...! Help me!!!
text: Woody turns. Lotso is pinned under a golf bag.
speaker_heading: LOTSO (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m stuck! Help!!! Please!
text: Woody looks at the approaching shredder. He lets go.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Woody...!
text: Woody lands on the belt, runs back to Lotso.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Thank you!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Don’t thank me yet.
text: Woody struggles to lift the bag. Buzz drops down next to
text: Woody. Jessie eyes the approaching shredder.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Buzz...!!! Woody...?!!!
text: Woody and Buzz push together. They still can’t move it.
text: Woody pulls out a golf club. The magnet tugs it upward.
text: Buzz grabs it. Together, they pull it down and jam it
text: under the bag for leverage. The bag finally lifts...
dialog: 115
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Go! Go!
text: ...and Lotso scrambles out.
text: Woody grabs Lotso. He and Buzz point the club skyward.
text: They're pulled up to safety as the golf bag is pulverized.
text: Lotso looks back at the shredder, then at Woody.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Thank you, Sheriff...!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: We're all in this together.
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Right guys...?
text: All the Toys have vanished.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys?!
speaker_heading: JESSIE (0.S.)
dialog: Woody! Down here!
text: Jessie and the others wave from a conveyer belt far below.
text: Woody and Buzz let go and plummet.
scene_heading: EXT. DUMP / STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN - NIGHT
text: Woody, Buzz and Lotso land on the bed of a big, fast-moving
text: conveyer belt with metal walls. The Toys gather around.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Woody!
text: The toothed belt begins to ascend upwards.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Woody! Look! I can see daylight!
dialog: We’re gonna be okay!
text: Rex points to a bright amber GLOW at the top of the belt.
text: The toys scramble forward. Woody’s smile drops.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I don’t think that’s daylight...
text: FAST TRACK -- At the end of the conveyer belt, garbage
text: falls into a burning, churning vortex.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Run!!!
dialog: 116
text: Unable to jump off, the Toys begin running down the belt.
text: They dodge, duck and hurdle over the coming trash, but
text: they’re no match for the speed of the rising conveyor.
text: Lotso trips, falls. A pulsing blue LIGHT. He looks up.
text: High on the wall ahead is an Emergency Stop button. A
text: ladder leads to the button. Lotso leaps up, grabs the
text: bottom rung. He can’t pull himself up.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Sheriff...! The button! Help me!
text: The Toys look back, see Lotso. As they pass, Woody, Buzz
text: and Jessie boost Lotso up.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Go!!! Go!!! Hit the button!
text: Lotso scrambles up the ladder toward the glowing button.
text: The Toys are carried up the conveyor belt toward the pit.
text: The Toys watch Lotso -- receding -- as he climbs.
text: Lotso stays focussed on the button above him.
text: The Toys reach the belt’s acme -- heels at the edge of the
text: waterfall of trash cascading to a melting, churning vortex.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hurry!!!
text: Lotso reaches the walkway where the blue button glows. He
text: turns and looks -- malevolent -- at the helpless Toys.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: Just push it! Push it!
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Push it!!!
text: Lotso smirks, gives a salute.
speaker_heading: LOTSO
dialog: Where’s your kid now, Sheriff?!
text: He turns, runs off down the walkway.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: No... No...! No...!!!
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: Lotso...!!!
dialog: 117
text: The Toys YELL as they tumble off the belt...
scene_heading: EXT. INCINERATOR HOPPER - NIGHT
text: The Toys land in a giant vortex of trash being sucked down
text: into the glowing eye of an incinerator.
text: It’s chaos -- trash tumbles over itself as sparks and ashes
text: fly through the air. The ROAR is overwhelming.
text: Woody stands and starts trying to climb out.
text: The Toys do the same, climbing desperately, fighting
text: against the trash tumbling into the vortex of fire.
text: They slip, fall, get up and slip again. It’s a nightmare --
text: no matter how fast they climb, they inexorably slide
text: backwards. Rex slides past Woody, towards the incinerator.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Ahhhhhh!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Rex!!!
text: Woody grabs Rex’s hand, slides further toward the inferno.
text: They are all being pulled inescapably downward.
text: There’s no way out. Jessie looks at Buzz.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: Buzz...! What do we do?
text: Buzz looks at her. He reaches out, takes her hand.
text: Jessie grabs Bullseye’s hoof. Slinky takes Hamm’s hand.
text: Hamm reaches out to Rex. The Potato Heads hold each other.
text: Mr. Potato Head grabs Rex.
text: Buzz reaches out to Woody...
text: Woody takes Buzz’s hand, and the circle is complete.
text: As they approach the vortex, heat waves blast their faces.
text: The Toys close their eyes, turn away.
text: Woody stares at the fire, shuts his eyes.
dialog: This is the end.
dialog: 118
text: A LIGHT from above shines in Woody’s face.
text: He opens his eyes.
text: A giant mechanical Claw lowers towards them.
text: The Claw plunges into the trash around them, closing them
text: in its grip, then raises them up.
text: They soar into the air, away from the ROARING incinerator.
text: Woody looks around in disbelief.
text: The Claw spins, passing in front of the crane booth.
scene_heading: INT. CRANE OPERATOR'S BOOTH - NIGHT
text: In the booth, the Aliens man the joysticks.
speaker_heading: ALIENS
dialog: The Clawwwww!!!
text: They lean into the joystick, steering the Claw to safety.
scene_heading: EXT. DUMP - DAWN
text: The Claw lowers and opens, dropping the Toys to earth. They
text: spill out, COUGHING and GROANING like shipwreck survivors.
text: Woody sits up, looks around. Rex pops up through trash.
speaker_heading: REX
dialog: Whew...!
dialog: They have faced death and survived, and are profoundly
text: shaken. Potato Head stares at the sky.
scene_heading: MR. POTATO HEAD
dialog: Y’know all that bad stuff I said
dialog: about Andy’s attic? I take it all
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: SLINKY
dialog: You’re darn tootin’!
speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: You said it!

text: Mrs. Potato Head takes Mr. Potato Head’s hand.
dialog: 119
scene_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD
dialog: Oh, darling! You were so brave!

speaker_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
dialog: You saved our lives...!
scene_heading: MR. POTATO HEAD
dialog: And we... Are eternally grateful!
text: Potato Head scoops them into his arms for a big, proud hug.
speaker_heading: MR. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)
dialog: My boys...!
speaker_heading: ALIENS
dialog: Daaddddyyyy...!!!
text: Hamm looks around.
speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: Hey! Where’s that furball Lotso?
speaker_heading: SLINKY
dialog: I'd like to loosen his stitching!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Forget it, guys. He’s not worth it.
scene_heading: EXT. GARBAGE DUMP, ELSEWHERE - DAY
text: Lotso limps toward the dump exit. A NOISE. He turns, then
text: drops, freezing.
text: A truck’s wheels SCREECH to a halt in front of Lotso. A
text: door OPENS and SHUTS. FOOTSTEPS. A hand picks him up.
speaker_heading: GARBAGE MAN ONE (0.S.)

scene_heading: EXT. GARBAGE DUMP - DAY
text: The truck exits the dump -- Lotso strapped to the grill.
text: He comes to life, panicked. On the grill are a couple of

speaker_heading: FROG
dialog: Hey, buddy...!
dialog: (Lotso turns)
dialog: ..-Y’might wanna keep yer mouth shut!
text: The others SNICKER. Lotso WHIMPERS. The truck RUMBLES off.
text: ANGLE -- The truck passes, REVEALING the Toys, unaware of
text: Lotso’s karmic comeuppance. Jessie sees Woody lagging.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: C’mon, Woody -- we gotta get you home!
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: That’s right, “College Boy”!
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: But... What about you guys? Maybe
dialog: the attic’s not such a great idea.
text: He glances at them, uneasy. Jessie steps to him.
speaker_heading: JESSIE
dialog: We’re Andy’s Toys, Woody...
speaker_heading: BUZZ
dialog: We'll be there for him. Together.
text: Woody smiles.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I just hope he hasn’t left yet...
scene_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD
dialog: Wait a minute! Wait, I’11 check!

speaker_heading: MRS. POTATO HEAD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HAMM

speaker_heading: REX
dialog: We'll never get there in time!
dialog: 121
text: The Toys glance at each other. Then, distantly, comes the
text: air-guitar WAILING of Andy’s Neighborhood Garbage Man.
text: The Toys turn, see him a dozen yards away. They brighten.
scene_heading: EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
text: Andy’s loading up his hatchback with boxes. Molly’s on the

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Is that it, honey? You got

scene_heading: INT. BACK YARD - DAY
text: TIGHT ON SPIGOT -- Woody’s hand comes in, turns it.

speaker_heading: HAMM
dialog: That’s enough, that’s enough, that’s
dialog: enough! !
speaker_heading: WOODY

scene_heading: EXT. GARAGE ROOF - DAY

scene_heading: INT. ANDY’S ROOM - DAY

speaker_heading: TRANSITION:
text: She pops her eye back in, blinks... And GIGGLES, tickled.
text: The Toys climb into a box marked “Attic”. Buzz helps them.
text: On the desk is a box marked “College”. Woody heads for it.
text: He reaches the box, turns. This may be the last time he

speaker_heading: WOODY

text: Buzz turns. Woody offers a hand. They shake.
speaker_heading: WOODY (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn’t good-bye.
speaker_heading: SLINKY (0.S.)

text: Woody smiles. He turns, runs to the desk.
text: Buzz climbs in the Attic box with the others.
text: On the desk, Woody jumps on the edge of the College box,
text: looks back at his friends. FOOTSTEPS climb the stairs.
text: Woody gives Buzz a salute. Buzz smiles, salutes back.
text: Woody lowers into the College box. The Toys duck in the
text: Attic box, pull the flaps shut just as Andy and Mom enter.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Did you say goodbye to Molly?
dialog: 124
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Mom, we've said goodbye like ten

text: WOODY POV -- His GAZE SHIFTS from Andy-holding-Woody to
dialog: Woody-with-the-other-Toys.
text: Suddenly, Woody half-smiles -- an epiphany. Sadness and
text: uncertainty are replaced by happiness and determination.
text: FOOTSTEPS and collar JINGLES approach. Molly steps to the
text: room’s threshold with Buster.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (0.C.)
dialog: Hey... Aren’t you gonna say goodbye

speaker_heading: MOLLY (0.C.)

speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...!
