scene_heading: INT/EXT. EXECUTIVE HELICOPTER, PAPUA NEW GUINEA - DAY
text: An out of focus light reflects the deep blue sparkle of the
text: ocean. The scene has a washed out, bright feel, as if froma
text: distant memory.
text: TIGHT on the face of JOSH MCGUIRE (17). He’s gazing through
text: the copilot window of an AUGUSTA EXECUTIVE HELICOPTER.
text: He’s tall, slightly built and slovenly dressed in skater-punk
text: gear. He has a wisp of a goatee beard and Optic Nerve shades.
text: He looks fidgety, apprehensive. His voice carries the trace
text: of an Australian accent.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: I took off. So what? I can do what
dialog: I want. I’m not a kid anymore. It
dialog: ain’t all about you.
text: Suddenly, the scene comes sharply into focus, snapping into
text: bright color as the ROAR of the engines grows louder.
text: The DELVENET.COM HELICOPTER banks sharply as it clears the
dialog: coastline of Papua New Guinea.
text: Lush rainforest as far as the eye can see. In the distance, a
text: range of mist-covered mountains. No sign of civilization. The
text: edge of the last great wilderness.
speaker_heading: CARL (AMERICAN ACCENT)
dialog: They're calling it what?
text: Flying the chopper is self-made billionaire CARL HURLEY
text: (30's). Faded jeans and a t-shirt with ‘MY OTHER HELICOPTER
text: IS A JET’ printed across the front.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
text: “Hurley’s Hole”.
text: Josh smirks at this. He turns around to see VICTORIA ALLAIN
text: (30's) sitting in the rear passenger seat, reading the WALL
text: STREET JOURNAL. She looks tired and jet-lagged in her
text: crumpled business suit, but still manages to retain a
text: natural, understated beauty.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Goddamn it!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (READING)
dialog: “Carl Hurley’s latest ‘ego tour’,
dialog: to dive the ‘Mount Everest’ of
dialog: underwater caves in Papua New

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: They can all go to hell.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (READING)
dialog: “The thirty-six year old CEO of

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Jeez, that’s old, man.
speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: VICTORIA (READING)
dialog: “,..whose previous stunts include
text: scaling Everest, diving Brittanic
dialog: and base jumping the Eiffel Tower,

dialog: yada yada yada. There’s a cartoon
dialog: as well...
speaker_heading: CARL (TO JOSH)
dialog: Take over. Keep the horizon above
dialog: the dash, like I told you.
text: Josh flashes a quick look at Victoria, lowering his shades as
text: he grabs the CYCLIC STICK. He’s obviously trying to impress
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No problemo.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (NERVOUS)
dialog: Carl!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Give me that piece of crap.
text: Victoria shakes her head wearily and tightens her seat belt.
text: Carl snatches the newspaper and gazes down at the headline:
text: DELVING INTO DEBT. A caricature of Carl, wearing SCUBA
text: EQUIPMENT as he studies a FINANCIAL FLOW CHART hung outside a
text: cave. Another DIVER informs him “That ain’t your dive
dialog: profile: it’s your share value”.
text: Josh glances at the cartoon and shares a smile with Victoria.
text: The chopper wobbles slightly. Josh blushes as he snaps his
text: attention back to flying.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: This expedition’s been a cluster
dialog: fuck from start to finish. No
dialog: disrespect, Josh, but your father’s
dialog: full of shit.
speaker_heading: JOSH (AWKWARD LAUGH)
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: CARL (SARCASTIC)
dialog: The world’s greatest cave diver.
dialog: All he can find down there are dead-
dialog: ends. No wonder we lost press
dialog: coverage
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You're insane. Frustrated
dialog: astronauts, all of you.
text: Carl gazes down at the rainforest.
speaker_heading: CARL
text: There could be miles of unexplored
dialog: passage down there. Just waiting to
dialog: be discovered.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Yeah, well. You'd better discover
dialog: it quick. Here’s your schedule for
dialog: next week.
text: She hands him a sheet of paper covered in colored bars.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Shit!
text: Carl RIPS up the schedule in frustration.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Shit! shit! shit!
text: A long and uncomfortable silence. Victoria leans forward
text: toward Josh, a smirk on her face.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (DRAMATIC VOICE)
dialog: Looks like ‘Hurley’s Hole’ may
text: remain forever...unprobed.
text: Josh cracks up LAUGHING.
text: VRRRROOM! The helicopter LURCHES VIOLENTLY as Carl grabs the
text: CONTROL STICK and flings them 500ft down a steep sided
text: valley. Victoria SCREAMS as Carl expertly puts the helicopter
text: through a 360’ BARREL-ROLL. Josh clings on for dear life as
text: the valley walls flash by.
text: Carl levels off, thirty feet above a huge river, the engine
text: WHINING in protest. Carl is LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (FURIOUS)
dialog: You reckless son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That was sweet! Do it again.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. RIVER VALLEY - DAY
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as the helicopter winds its way down the
text: valley, following the surging river. Victoria tries to engage
text: the recalcitrant Josh in conversation.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: How’d you wind up here, Josh?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Court makes me see my Dad twice a
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Bit like boot camp.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: What's Frank like? I’ve heard
dialog: conflicting reports.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: “Conflicting” pretty much sums him
dialog: up. (beat) Alright, folks. We're
dialog: here...
text: Suddenly, the ground falls away. The helicopter drops over
text: the edge of a waterfall that cascades 1000ft into a DOLINE, a
text: vast circular hole in the valley floor. A beautiful rainbow
text: hangs above the waterfall.
text: The helicopter powers forward toward BASECAMP: a cluster of
text: PORTACABINS and large MACHINERY perched at the far side of
dialog: the cliff.
text: Josh suddenly looks sad. He stares down at the base of the
text: waterfall, where the river disappears through a gaping
text: vertical crack in the rock.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: I can feel your hatred...
scene_heading: EXT. SERENITY CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: At the bottom of the cliff, a thick COMMUNICATION CABLE winds
text: its way into the darkness, following the river. BATS and
text: SWALLOWS flit and dart in the dark zone.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: ..-Taste it...
scene_heading: Every hundred feet or so, a HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE (HID)
text: LIGHT has been clipped to the wall, illuminating the tunnel.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: -.-Breathe it...
scene_heading: INT. SANTO CAVE SYSTEM.
text: HIGH SPEED as we follow the cable through miles of cave,
text: slowing occasionally at key points. The cable leads us
text: through tight tunnels, air-filled chambers, surging rivers
text: and over powerful waterfalls, rigged with rope bridges.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: ...through miles of rock...
text: Finally, at the end of the tunnel, a dance of light.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE
text: The river spills out into a vast chamber, three quarters
text: filled with water. An island rises above the water,
text: illuminated by powerful HID LIGHTS. Forward base looks like
text: an explosion in a dive store: SCUBA EQUIPMENT is littered
text: everywhere: WETSUITS hanging on a line, REBREATHERS and DIVER
scene_heading: PROPULSION VEHICLES.
text: In the center of the island sits a large TENT. The glow from
text: several COMPUTER MONITORS can be seen through the fabric. A
text: FIBER-OPTIC cable leads from the tent toward a DIVE PLATFORM
text: that extends into the water.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: ...I hope you never come out.
text: Australian cave diver FRANK MCGUIRE (early 40's) stands alone
text: in the gin-clear water. He wears a scuffed and worn WETSUIT.
text: Frank exudes a quiet confidence. A man who keeps his own
text: counsel. He's as hard and as cold as the caves he explores.
text: Frank’s eyes are closed in meditation as he rehearses
text: emergency BAIL-OUT DRILLS. He moves with fluid clarity, as if
dialog: practising Tai-Chi.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Focus on the dive. (beat) High
dialog: oxygen: close valve, diluent flush,
dialog: engage manual flight. Good. You
dialog: ain’t dying down there today. Low
dialog: oxygen...(beat) Shit! Low
dialog: oxygen.....-
text: Frank SIGHS and opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That damn kid.
text: Frank takes three deep BREATHS, closes his eyes and starts
text: the drills again. VOICES drift over from the far side of the
dialog: cave.
scene_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (0.S TEXAN DRAWL)
dialog: That's the third time you checked
dialog: that gauge. You sure you're okay?
speaker_heading: JUDES (0.S)
dialog: Yeah. (beat) Just tired. You know...
text: Sitting on the edge of the dive platform is CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (40's).
text: George is a tall and wiry Texan who looks like a hippy. He's
text: busy operating the joystick control of a CAVE MAPPING ROV.
text: JUDY 'JUDES' TREBLE (30's) stands in the water beside him.
text: She is wearing a CLOSED CIRCUIT REBREATHER and CAVE DIVING
text: EQUIPMENT. Judes is a serious-minded diver who likes to do
text: things by the book. She also looks great in a wetsuit.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: You wanna cancel the dive?
speaker_heading: JUDES
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: No one'1ll blame you, Judes. He’s
dialog: had you in the water seven days
dialog: straight now. When the hell did you
dialog: last see daylight?
text: Judes looks up at George and forces a smile.
speaker_heading: JUDES
dialog: Three weeks ago.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (LAUGHING)
dialog: Damn, girl. You’re starting to look
dialog: like Gollum.
speaker_heading: JUDES (LAUGHING)
dialog: Thanks, George.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Cave's still gonna be here next
dialog: year...
speaker_heading: JUDES
dialog: Try telling Frank that.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SERIOUS)
dialog: You dive for yourself. Not for
dialog: Frank. “Anyone can call the dive at
dialog: any time for...”
speaker_heading: JUDES
dialog: “,,.any reason.” I know.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: So. (beat) Why don’t you sit this
dialog: one out?
text: Judes deliberates. She looks yearningly toward her SLEEPING
text: BAG at the rear of the cave. She looks tempted when...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You all set?
text: FRANK wades toward them, zipping up his suit. His face is set
text: with an intense, determined look. He grabs his REBREATHER
text: from the dive platform and fires up the electronics.
speaker_heading: JUDES (FORCED CHEERFULNESS )
dialog: Sure...
text: She looks up at George and squeezes his hand.
speaker_heading: JUDES (WHISPERED)
dialog: Last time, George. Promise.
text: George hands Judes her mask.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: I’m gonna hold you to that.
speaker_heading: JUDES (TO FRANK)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ready as I'll ever be.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: George, you in position?
text: On George's LAPTOP, a DIGITAL IMAGE of the cave can be seen,
text: marked DEVIL'S RESTRICTION. Hundreds of BOULDERS stacked
text: high. A gaping TUNNEL beneath them. Frank studies the screen.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Hell, yeah. I still say she's
dialog: teasin’ us, Frank. Ain't no way
dialog: through that restriction.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Machines can't feel the cave,
dialog: George. (TAPS the screen) This one
dialog: goes. Trust me.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (WEARILY)
dialog: How many times have I heard that?
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! A RED LIGHT flashes above the communication
text: tent. Frank, Judes and George look at one another in concern.
text: Crazy George staggers to his feet and hobbles into the tent
text: to answer the call. He walks with a pronounced LIMP.
speaker_heading: JUDES (ANXIOUS)
dialog: Rain?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. We're good for a few weeks yet.
text: George pokes his head out of the tent.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: It's Carl.
text: Frank’s face registers annoyance.
speaker_heading: FRANK (SARCASTIC)
text: Hallelujah! “Rich Boy” returns.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: He wants a word with you.
text: Frank drags himself out of the water.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'll bet he does.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE COMMUNICATIONS TENT
text: Frank slumps down into a chair, surrounded by high tech
text: equipment and several MONITORS. Crazy George hovers in the
text: background. Carl’s face can be seen on the DIVE COM. He
text: doesn’t look happy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why are you using the emergency
dialog: line?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I want a progress report.
speaker_heading: FRANK (ANNOYED)
dialog: You got me out of the water for
dialog: that?
scene_heading: INT. BASECAMP OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: A bank of high tech electronics, including several MONITORS.
text: Frank's face fills the screen. Carl SLAMS the table.
speaker_heading: CARL (ANGRY)
dialog: Goddamn it, Frank! We’re running
dialog: out of time...
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: Alright, I’1l give you a progress
dialog: report: we’re down here, busting
dialog: our balls, while you fuck off to
dialog: pick up your girlfriend.
text: Victoria, Josh and the basecamp manager, JIM SERGEANT (36)
text: hover in the background next to an enormous CAVE MAP. Jim and
text: Josh exchange a look: this is typical Frank.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Four months, Frank. I could have
dialog: dug myself a bigger cave by now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, well. This cave don’t follow
dialog: your schedule. Put my son on the
dialog: line.
text: Victoria flashes Josh a sympathetic look. Josh SIGHS heavily.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE COMMUNICATIONS TENT
text: Carl casts a final murderous glance at Frank before he
text: disappears off screen. George shakes his head wearily.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (TO FRANK)
dialog: Nice. Keep on biting the hand that
dialog: feeds us...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We earned the right to dive here,
dialog: George. If that softcock wants a
dialog: piece of this cave, he should try
text: getting his hands dirty.
text: On screen, Josh slouches into the chair and stares sullenly.
speaker_heading: JOSH (HOSTILE)
dialog: (long beat) What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’re on my shitlist, mate.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You were assigned rope man. You’re
dialog: supposed to be working here as part
dialog: of the team, not off on some joy
dialog: ride.
dialog: 10
text: Josh stares at his feet and snorts derisively: it’s pretty
text: obvious he thinks his old man is a total dick.
speaker_heading: FRANK (FURIOUS)
dialog: Did you hear what I said!?!
text: Josh reaches forward and defiantly flicks a switch. The
text: screen suddenly goes blank. Frank stares in disbelief. Crazy
text: George tries hard not to laugh.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BASECAMP OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Josh storms out, furious and humiliated. Victoria follows him
text: a few seconds later. She finds Josh around the back of the
text: office, KICKING the wall. Josh slumps to the floor, head down
text: and BREATHING hard.
text: Victoria places her hand on his shoulder. He gazes up at her,
text: grateful for the attention. His eyes drift across her body.
text: Victoria catches him checking her out. An awkward moment.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE
text: Frank storms down to the water, Crazy George limping after
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CRAZY
dialog: Go easy on him, Frank. The kid
dialog: deserved a break.
text: Frank wades into the water and starts kitting up.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We’re all tuckered out. That don’t
dialog: mean he can sneak off whenever he
dialog: feels like it.
text: Frank SPITS into his mask and winks at Judes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ready to rock?
speaker_heading: JUDES (FORCED ENTHUSIASM)
text: First one to the tunnel “bags the
dialog: booty”.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In your dreams.
speaker_heading: JUDES (SIGHS)
dialog: Let's hope this is the one.
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This is the one. Trust me.
speaker_heading: JUDES
dialog: (beat) Then let's do it.
text: They insert their mouthpieces, then grasp hands as a gesture
text: of “goodluck”. Venting their WINGS, they sink beneath the
dialog: surface.
scene_heading: EXT. DECO HABITAT
text: The divers descend toward an UNDERWATER DECOMPRESSION
text: HABITAT, bolted to the walls at a depth of 30 ft. Each
text: diver's REBREATHER has their name boldly stencilled across
dialog: the back.
text: CLOSE-UP of Frank’s eyes behind his mask as he moves through
text: the water. His voice sounds tense and strained.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Focus. Forget the kid. This cave’1l
dialog: kill you in a heartbeat if you let
dialog: it. (beat) The cave always wins.
text: The DECO HAB looks like a high-tech lunar landing module.
scene_heading: DIVER PROPULSION VEHICLES (DPV's) and STAGE CYLINDERS have
text: been clipped to a DECO LINE that descends into the inky
text: depths. The DPV's look like miniature torpedoes, fitted with
text: handlebars. The divers collect their DPV's, clip on their
text: STAGE CYLINDERS and power away into the inky depths.
scene_heading: INT. SUMP ONE
text: VRRRRR! Powerful HID lights from the DPV's flit across the
text: walls of an enormous underwater cavern. Frank follows a thin
text: GUIDELINE that snakes its way across the calcite-covered
text: ceiling. The water is crystal clear: visibility a hundred
text: feet or more. The REBREATHER'S lack of bubbles give the
text: divers the appearance of astronauts, exploring inner space.
text: Frank's voice begins to relax, becoming deep and reverent as
text: he recites Coleridge’s famous poem.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: In Xanadu did Kubla Khan.
text: A stately pleasure dome decree.
dialog: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran.
text: Through caverns measureless to man.
text: Down to a sunless sea.
dialog: 12
text: They enter a room, where white FLOWSTONE covers the walls.
text: It's like a waterfall frozen in time. Stunningly beautiful.
text: Frank gazes in wonder as they pass amazing SPELEOTHEMS,
text: connecting the floor to the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. DEEP TUNNEL.
text: Frank and Judes power their DPV's into a long winding tunnel.
text: POV FRANK: the HEADS UP DISPLAY (HUD) clipped onto his
text: REBREATHER MOUTHPIECE bathes his face a ghoulish green glow.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: 70 meters...80...90...
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! A red light flashes across Frank's face as
text: his REBREATHER HUD ALARM sounds.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Oxygen spike. Add some helium.
text: PFFT! Frank calmly reaches down and pushes a button on his
text: COUNTERLUNGS. The HUD turns green again.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: No worries. Where’s Judes?
text: VRRRR! Judes overtakes Frank, aiming her DPV toward a narrow
text: gap in the tunnel. CRUNCH! Her REBREATHER clumsily scrapes
text: against the rock, bringing down a cloud of fine silt.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: C'mon, Judy-babe. Tighten it up.
text: Frank's eyes narrow in concentration as he follows her into
text: the tunnel. The whirling blades of his DPV PROPELLER slowly
text: DISSOLVE INTO...
scene_heading: EXT. BASECAMP — DAY
text: THUDDA! THUDDA! THUDDA! The whirling rotor blades of a
text: RUSSIAN KAMOV HELICOPTER as it hovers above basecamp.
text: Operations manager, Jim Sergeant is marching across camp,
text: trying to outpace Carl. Jim used to be a Royal Navy diver.
text: Right now, he wishes he was back defusing mines.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Do you think it’s worth me kitting
dialog: up and going down there?
dialog: 13
text: Basecamp is a hive of activity: LOCAL VILLAGERS unloading
text: OXYGEN CYLINDERS from a huge CRANE at the edge of the doline.
text: ENGINEERS inspecting an ELECTRICAL GENERATOR. BLENDING
text: TECHNICIANS operating two large COMPRESSORS.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I doubt it. You want my opinion,
dialog: Frank’s lost the fucking plot.
text: The KAMOV touches down, creating a huge cloud of dust. Jim
text: approaches one of the local villagers who is supervising the
text: unloading of OXYGEN CYLINDERS from the CRANE.
text: Luko (24) speaks in a heavily accented PIDGIN ENGLISH. We
text: catch maybe two words in three. He's a large, powerful man.
text: Respected among his tribe and feared as a fierce warrior.
text: Luko has a BEECH NUT CIGARETTE permanently glued to his
dialog: bottom lip.
speaker_heading: LUKO (PIDGIN ENGLISH)
dialog: Numato! Tamairi! Yu-two fala ee
dialog: kam long ples yia mo helpem me-
dialog: fala. Mix master blong Jesus
dialog: Christ!
text: Two more VILLAGERS rush over and start loading empty
text: CYLINDERS onto the KAMOV HELICOPTER. Jim removes the
text: cigarette from Luko’s lips and crushes it out, nodding toward
text: the FLAMMABLE STICKER on the OXYGEN CYLINDER.
speaker_heading: JIM (FLUENT PIDGIN)
dialog: Buy yu sackem-out cigarette blong

text: Jim marches over to the basecamp office, Carl doggedly
text: following him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: “Mix master blong Jesus Christ?”
speaker_heading: JIM
text: He means the helicopter.
text: Josh suddenly bursts out of the office doorway, with Victoria
text: in tow. They are both rigged in CLIMBING HARNESSES. Jim grabs
text: Josh in a friendly HEADLOCK on the bottom step.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Back in the doghouse, mate! Right
dialog: where you belong.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Surprised he even noticed I’d gone.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Oh, he noticed alright. Took hima
dialog: full day to get down there without
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JOSH (LAUGHING)
dialog: Must’ve been painful to watch.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Yeah, well. Don’t look so chuffed.
dialog: He’s put you on double rope duty
dialog: for the rest of the week. Starting
dialog: now.
text: Josh SIGHS heavily. Victoria places her hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: Josh was going to teach me how to
dialog: rappel...
speaker_heading: JIM (TO JOSH)
dialog: (long beat) Go on. I haven’t seen
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JOSE
dialog: Yesss!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (she winks at Carl) You gonna come
dialog: and hold my hand?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Not now!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Suit yourself. You have two-hundred
dialog: emails waiting for you in there...
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: They can all fuck off.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You should go with them, Carl. Try
dialog: and enjoy the last few days. I’1l

scene_heading: INT. BASECAMP OFFICE
text: Jim switches on the DIVE COM and gazes at the ROV MONITOR.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Where are they, George?
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (V.O.)
dialog: Devil’s restriction.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE COMMUNICATION TENT
text: Crazy George reaches forward and sharpens the digital image
text: from the ROV. The fuzzy picture shows Frank and Judes
text: arriving at the restriction.
scene_heading: CRAZY GEORGE(FLICKING A SWITCH)
dialog: And...let there be light.
scene_heading: INT. DEVIL'S RESTRICTION
text: WHOOMPH! Several HID lights fire up on the ROV, illuminating
text: the cave as far as the eye can see. Thousands of BOULDERS
text: cover the floor. The boulders have been ground smooth so they
text: resemble a pile of gigantic marbles.
text: Judes 'parks' her DPV beneath a natural bridge in the
text: boulders. A gaping black hole leading into the unknown. Her
text: DPV PROPELLER stirs up a cloud of SILT.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE COMMUNICATIONS TENT
text: On the monitor, the image is obscured by silt. Crazy George
text: grabs the joystick and powers the ROV upwards.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Bh, shit. Call the scuba police.
dialog: Amateur alert!
scene_heading: INT. DEVIL'S RESTRICTION.
text: The thick cloud of silt engulfs Judes and Frank, reducing
dialog: visibility to zero.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
text: Deep and slow. Panic kills. Clip on
text: a reel.
dialog: 16
text: POV FRANK: we can barely see his hands as he expertly
text: attaches a SAFETY GUIDELINE to a rock in front of him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Now rise above the situation.
text: PFTTT! Frank adds gas to his WING. LINE rattles off his REEL.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE COMMUNICATIONS TENT.
text: On screen, the ROV hovers patiently above the cloud of silt.
text: George breathes a SIGH of relief as he watches Frank rising
text: like a ghost, back into clear water.
scene_heading: INT. DEVIL'S RESTRICTION.
text: Frank can see Judes light in the cloud beneath him.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: She’s gonna be pissed about that.
dialog: Alright, Frank: focus. Master

dialog: There's your second heartbeat.
dialog: (glances at wrist

dialog: Depth 98 meters. Run time’s good...
text: Frank's eyes suddenly widen. He notices the silt cloud is
text: being sucked into a hole in the boulders, thirty feet away.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shit! That’s the way through!
text: The cloud of silt continues drifting toward the hole.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)

dialog: Oh man, that is strong flow!
dialog: (gazing around the cave)
dialog: Got you! Finally!
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: C'mon Judes, sort your shit out.

scene_heading: INT. DEVIL'S RESTRICTION.

speaker_heading: CARL (SMILING)

scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF AT TOP OF DOLINE

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. UNEXPLORED ABYSS
text: Frank pulls himself out of a crack in an underwater cliff and

dialog: 23
text: Sudden vertigo as his torch reveals a gaping black abyss, no

speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Yes! Yes! This is what it’s all
dialog: about! No-one has ever seen this.
dialog: No one! Here. Now. This is who you

text: A flash of light behind him. Judes pulls herself out of the

text: of rock from her REBREATHER and puts it back on.
text: VRRRRRR! The ROV pops out of the tunnel, filling the chamber
text: with light. The cave is monstrous. The ROV’s lights just

speaker_heading: FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Heh! Judy-babe, we have scored big
dialog: time. This place is...
dialog: 24
text: Frank’s eyes suddenly narrow in concern. BUBBLES are
text: streaming from Judes REBREATHER. Frank swims over to her.
text: Frank signals she has a small leak. Judes looks confused. She
text: spins around so Frank can take a closer look. Frank notices a
text: small tear in the BREATHING HOSE, where it attaches to the
text: COUNTERLUNGS. Frank reaches forward to examine the hose.
text: BADOOSH! The hose suddenly pops free from the REBREATHER.
text: Bubbles EXPLODE as Judes ALARM starts to scream. Red light
text: bathes the cave.
text: BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Judes starts to sink. She signals to Frank,
text: still relatively calm: “out of air”.
text: Frank duck-dives down to her. He removes his own mouthpiece
text: and offers it. Judes gulps down several BREATHS. They are
text: sinking fast, Judes struggling to locate her WING INFLATOR.
text: PFFFT! Frank starts pumping air into his WING to arrest their
text: descent. BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! His REBREATHER HUD ALARM flashes
text: red as his oxygen spikes. Judes now looks really scared.
text: By now, Frank is desperate to breathe himself. He gently
text: pulls the mouthpiece away from Judes. She's reluctant to let
text: it go. Frank pulls harder.
text: BLAM! Judes is suddenly all over Frank in a frenzy, a look of
text: blind panic on her face. She claws at Frank’s face, ripping
text: off his mask.
text: POV Frank: A blurred red nightmare as Judes attacks him.
text: Frank backs away, struggling to restrain her. Her attack
dialog: grows weaker and weaker until...
text: BLOOMPTH! A final exhalation of bubbles as she finally takes
text: water into her lungs. Frank releases her and pulls out his
text: back-up mask.
text: POV Frank: his vision clears as he empties the mask of water.
text: Frank watches Judes spiral down into the darkness. Her light

scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE COMMUNICATIONS TENT.

scene_heading: INT. CLIFF AT TOP OF DOLINE
text: EXCITED CHATTER as Carl, Josh, Victoria and Luko travel up in

text: Jim stands waiting for them, looking white as a sheet. Other

text: CRYING. In an instant, all the color drains from Josh's face.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: He's dead. I wished it. It's my

scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER DECO HABITAT - 8 HOURS LATER.

speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE

speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Alright. I reckon you're clear.
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: Jesus, Frank. What happened?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Breathing hose. Ripped clean out of
text: her counterlung. She must’ve
dialog: loosened it going through the
dialog: tunnel.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Or maybe she was too tired to check
dialog: it before the dive?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You think I killed her?
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Down here, it’s all about knowing
dialog: when to quit. You taught me that.

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE

scene_heading: EXT. KASTOM VILLAGE - NIGHT
text: A huge bonfire in the center of the village. DRUMS beat a

text: Scattered among them are several EXPEDITION MEMBERS, looking

text: Josh, Carl and Victoria sit inside an open hut. Luko sits

speaker_heading: CARL (TO JOSH)

speaker_heading: VICTORIA

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: VICTORIA (TO CARL)
dialog: You think Frank'1ll cancel the

speaker_heading: CARL

text: Luko SPITS into the shell and offers them the kava.
speaker_heading: CARL (DISGUSTED)
dialog: He expects us to drink that?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Kava. To honor Judes.
text: Josh takes the shell and gulps down the intoxicating brew.
text: Carl watches in horror as Victoria reaches for the shell. She
text: shrugs at Carl.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I’ve swallowed worse.
text: Victoria downs it in one.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Wow! I can feel my lips going numb
dialog: already.
text: Carl reaches forward and nervously takes the shell.
dialog: 29
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Just do it.
text: Carl sips it, gingerly, holding his nose as he does so.

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Lightweight.
text: Victoria staggers to her feet and follows Carl.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Oh man! That shit is really good.
text: Suddenly, the DRUMS stop beating. Silence descends upon the

dialog: turns to see:
text: Frank, stepping out of the shadows, looking utterly
text: exhausted. He is caked in mud and looks like a primordial
text: nightmare. George appears behind him. The villagers WHISPER
text: nervously as they watch Frank approach the expedition
text: members. Jim steps forward and offers his condolences. Other
text: team members walk away in disgust. Josh closes his eyes.
text: A shadow falls across Josh's face. He looks up to see Frank
text: standing above him. Josh tenses as Frank sits next to him. A
text: long awkward silence. The drums continue their mournful
text: heartbeat, building in intensity over the following:
speaker_heading: JOSH (FINALLY)
dialog: Look. If you're gonna bollock me,
dialog: just get it over with.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You wanna quit drinking that shit.
dialog: Makes you sound dopier than you

dialog: That's what Carl wants.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: And you don’t?
text: Frank looks at him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You dive caves for long enough,

speaker_heading: JOSH (MUMBLING)
dialog: She knew how much you wanted this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: CARL (MOANING)
dialog: Please, baby. D-don’t leave me!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Quit whining.
text: Victoria stumbles her way through the thick jungle. She’s

text: startling her. She listens again. Silence. Then a twig SNAPS.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Who's there?
text: The CHANTING starts again. Victoria nervously pushes forward.
text: She emerges into a clearing at the edge of the doline.
text: At the edge of the doline, the KASTOM SHAMAN is surrounded by
text: several villagers performing an ancient PURIFICATION RITE.
text: The Shaman’s grotesque DEATH MASK glints in the moonlight as
text: he incants a solemn PRAYER. Victoria turns to leave.
text: BLAM! Luko suddenly looms over her, swaying in a kava-induced

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: CARL (EXPLODING)

speaker_heading: FRANK (SNARLING)
dialog: Don’t you worry, Hurley. When I

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Don't get me wrong, Frank. What
dialog: you've achieved here is remarkable.
text: He studies the new cave on the ROV MONITOR.
speaker_heading: CARL (REVERENT WHISPER)
dialog: She's the mother of all caves. No
dialog: one's ever broke her. Until now.
text: Carl turns to Frank with a gleam in his eye. He TAPS his
text: finger against the question mark on the screen.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Put my name on a piece of this,
dialog: Frank. And I'll die a happy man.
text: Carl leaves. Frank continues staring at the frozen image of
text: the cave. Huge. Inviting. Irresistible.
scene_heading: EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY
text: VARIOUS ESTABLISHING SHOTS as the sun edges its way over the
text: rainforest. Mist rising from the doline. Parrots preening
text: their plumage. Chickens and pigs in the kastom village.
scene_heading: EXT. KASTOM VILLAGE - DAY
text: Embers from the dying fire rise slowly in the pre-dawn air.
text: Josh lies fast asleep outside Luko's hut. He's still fully
text: clothed from the night before. A BOOT rudely KICKS him awake.
text: Josh's eyes fly open. Frank stands looking down at him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Get up. I want everyone assembled
dialog: in twenty minutes.
text: Frank marches off. Josh gazes after him, still hungover.
scene_heading: INT. BASECAMP CONTROL ROOM - DAY
text: Frank and George are huddled around the computer. Frank TAPS
text: his fingers absently along to an AC-DC TUNE that’s playing in
text: the background. He’s studying a SATELLITE IMAGE of a STORM.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: I reckon you got three days.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If she changes direction, Jim can
dialog: give us a shout on the blower.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 36
speaker_heading: FRANK (cont'd)
text: She’1l hit the backside of the

text: eight hours before the river starts
dialog: to flood. Plenty of time to leg it
dialog: back up.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: I can help you get Carl and
text: Victoria down to Forward Base.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cheers, George. We'll take the
dialog: yuppie for a quick paddle around
dialog: “the great unknown”. Let him name
dialog: his fucking rock so we can all get
dialog: the hell out of here.
text: Jim walks in, Josh trailing behind him.
speaker_heading: FRANK (TO JIM)
dialog: Is everyone ready?
speaker_heading: JIM (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
text: Luko’s men are too spooked to go
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (beat) We can manage without them.
dialog: What about the others?
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Sorry, Frank. They don't want
dialog: anything to do with this.
dialog: Frank considers this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They’re scared.
speaker_heading: JOSH (ANGRY)
dialog: Of course they’re scared! Aren't
dialog: you?
text: Crazy George and Jim exchange a look. They decide to leave.
speaker_heading: FRANK (TO JOSH)
dialog: Yes, I am. Every time.
text: Josh looks surprised.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The day you ain’t scared before a
dialog: dive is the day you stop diving.
dialog: 37
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It's a sphincter of fucking rock!
dialog: You think that’s worth dying for?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Stop being a drama queen.
text: Frank heads toward the door. Josh blocks his path.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Step aside, Josh!
text: A moment of tension between them. Josh eventually allows
text: Frank to pass. Frank marches outside.
text: TIGHT on Josh: a worried expression on his face. He glances
text: at the CAVE MAP on the wall. Frank has already pencilled in
text: the section where Judes died. The new cavern is marked ‘Judes
text: Jewel’. The final strains of the AC-DC SONG drift from
text: Frank's old CASETTE PLAYER.
speaker_heading: AC-DC (V.0.)
dialog: “I’m on a highway to hell...”
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF AT TOP OF DOLINE - DAY
text: A loud ARGUMENT rages between several VILLAGERS, including
text: Luko. MACHETES have been drawn and tempers flare.
text: Frank, Crazy George, Carl and Victoria watch the argument
text: from the edge of the doline. They are kitted up and ready to
text: rappel. Frank looks up to find Josh standing there, wearing
text: his waterproofs and climbing harness.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: JOSH (SULLEN)
dialog: What you said. You need a rope man.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You made your position clear. We
dialog: don't need your help.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Jesus, Frank. Give the kid a

text: Frank flashes Carl a murderous look.
dialog: 38
speaker_heading: FRANK (MENACING GROWL)
dialog: I suggest you stay the fuck out of
dialog: this.
dialog: (to Josh)
text: The chopper leaves at ten o’clock.
dialog: Give my regards to your mother.
text: Josh stares at his father. Bristling in pure hatred. Then
text: turns and marches away.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Josh...
text: Frank shoulders his pack and threads his FIVE BAR RACK into
text: the descent rope.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Frank, stop.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If he leaves now, you'll never see

text: Frank ignores her and leans back over the edge of the cliff.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm going back for him. Okay?
text: A long pause.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Okay?
text: Frank looks up at Victoria. Then nods his head,
text: imperceptibly.
text: ZIIIIP! Frank disappears over the edge of the cliff.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Jesus. It's a wonder the boy's not
dialog: in therapy.
scene_heading: EXT. BASECAMP
text: Victoria chases after Josh. She sees him storm away into the
dialog: jungle.
dialog: 39
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Josh! Josh, come back!
text: But Josh has gone.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY
text: The river CASCADES into the cave across a series of
text: treacherous rocks, breached by a rickety ROPE BRIDGE. Mist
text: fills the air.
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as the team enter the cave:
text: Luko waits for them by the entrance. He MUMBLES a quiet
text: PRAYER as he scoops RED MUD from a shell and paints each team
text: member's face.
text: Crazy George accepts the ritual solemnly.
text: Carl follows. He can't take the ritual seriously.
speaker_heading: CARL (TO VICTORIA)
dialog: I guess they do this for all the
dialog: tourists?
text: Victoria next. As Luko paints her face, she glances nervously
text: up at the blue sky framing the entrance to the cave. Acutely
text: aware this might be the last time she sees it.
text: Frank brings up the rear. He gazes reverently around the cave
text: as Luko performs the ritual. He is about to step into the
text: shadows when he notices a TINY FIGURE perched on the edge of
dialog: the doline.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF AT TOP OF DOLINE
text: Josh sits dejected on the edge of the cliff, watching Frank.
text: A moment passes between them. Then Frank steps into the
text: darkness. Josh closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT/EXT. JOSH'S TENT - NIGHT
text: Josh lies in his sleeping bag, fast asleep. The distant
text: rumble of THUNDER jolts him awake. Josh sits up. A dull ROAR
text: can be heard, like a far-away train. He sticks his head out
text: of the tent.
dialog: 40
text: Josh's eyes widen in alarm: the sky CRACKLES as a fierce
text: ELECTRICAL STORM rages on the horizon. Josh staggers out
text: toward the lights of the basecamp office.
scene_heading: INT/EXT. BASECAMP OFFICE
text: As Josh approaches the office, it’s clear that something is
text: very wrong. The remaining team members are crowded anxiously
text: around the open doorway, whispering nervously to each other.
text: RAISED VOICES can be heard coming from within. Jim is
text: shouting into the DIVE COM.
speaker_heading: JIM (0.8.)
dialog: Forward Base, forward base, this is
dialog: basecamp, over. Do you read?
dialog: Christ, Frank pick up!
text: Josh peers in through the window. The team are huddled around
text: the MONITOR watching a satellite image of the approaching
text: STORM. Everyone looks really scared.
scene_heading: EXPEDITION MEMBER # 1
dialog: I’m telling you, the comms are
dialog: down!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: There's plenty of signal. Just no
text: one’s answering.
scene_heading: EXPEDITION MEMBER # 2
dialog: Send someone down, for Christ’s
dialog: sake! Before it’s too late!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: It's too risky! The river’s already
text: up two feet.
scene_heading: EXPEDITION MEMBER # 2
dialog: Goddamn it! You can’t just leave
dialog: them down there!
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: They’re probably on their way back
dialog: up...
scene_heading: EXPEDITION MEMBER # 1
dialog: It's been over six hours now. If
dialog: they don't leave soon...
text: The sentence hangs in the air. Everyone is fully aware of the
text: implications. Jim grabs the DIVE COM.
dialog: 41
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: Forward Base, forward base, this is
dialog: basecamp, over...
text: Josh slips back into the shadows before anyone notices he was
dialog: there.
scene_heading: INT. JOSH’S TENT - NIGHT
text: Josh sits in the entrance to his tent, unable to sleep. He
text: gazes toward the basecamp office, where several team members
text: continue to ARGUE with each other. Others hang around,
text: impotent and useless.
text: Josh gazes at the approaching storm and glances nervously at
text: his INDIGLO DIVEWATCH. A sudden CRACK of thunder startles
text: him. The storm is clearly getting closer.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Fuck it!
text: Josh sits up and angrily starts pulling on his boots.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Fuck him. Fucking idiot.
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF AT TOP OF DOLINE — NIGHT
text: A thousand stars splinter the night sky. A full moon casts a
text: ghostly pall over the camp. Josh stands at the edge of the
text: doline wearing his waterproofs and climbing harness.
text: The ROAR from the waterfall has increased dramatically. No
text: longer a gentle cascade, the powerful torrent CASCADES far
text: out over the cliff wall, plunging violently into the cave
text: below. Josh deliberates. He stares down at the maelstrom of
text: white-water CRASHING its way into the cave. It looks scarey
dialog: as hell.
text: Looking up, Josh notices a figure watching him from the
text: opposite side of the doline. The grotesque MASK of the Shaman
text: glints in the moonlight.
text: A serene look suddenly spreads across Josh's face. In an
text: instant he’s calm and confident.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: “Only those pure of spirit”.
text: Josh steps off the cliff and drops into the darkness.
dialog: 42
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE
text: Victoria's flashlight flickers on. Her eyes dart around in
text: confusion as she tries to figure out what woke her.
text: The NOISE from the stream has increased dramatically. The
text: level of the water in the lake has risen to the point where
text: it's drenched the bottom of her sleeping bag. She KICKS Carl
text: awake and stumbles across to Frank. Frank sits bolt upright
text: as Victoria’s light flits across his face.
speaker_heading: FRANK (URGENT WHISPER)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Wake the others. Quickly.
text: Frank pulls on his boots, grabs his flashlight and scrambles
text: toward the flooded communication tent.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD BASE - COMMUNICATION TENT
text: All the electronics are dead, submerged under two feet of
text: water. Frank grabs the DIVE COM.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Basecamp, basecamp...
text: Frank flicks a switch. FZZZT! A burst of SPARKS as the system
text: shorts out. Frank races back outside.
scene_heading: EXT. FORWARD BASE.
text: Frank marches toward the sump. The other team members are
text: already gathered on the shoreline. Their combined lights
text: reveal a disturbing sight: the cave is flooding, the water
text: level rising so fast, they can actually see it creeping up
text: the shore. Frank has to SHOUT to be heard above the noise of
dialog: the water.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We can't stay here! Secure the
dialog: equipment!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Fuck the equipment! Let's just get
dialog: out of here!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're assuming we can.
text: Silence as the team considers this. Luko looks terrified.
dialog: 43
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Start kitting up. All of you.
text: The team race around the camp, securing gear and pulling on
text: their WETSUITS. Frank feeds rope through a CEILING BOLT.
text: George helps secure the REBREATHERS to the rope.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: What the hell happened to the early
dialog: warning system?
speaker_heading: FRANK (FURIOUS)
dialog: Christ knows. Those fuckers had
dialog: better not be asleep up there!
dialog: Stand clear!
text: Frank HEAVES on the rope and hauls the REBREATHERS toward the
text: ceiling of the cave, where they are tied off and secured. The
text: team start donning their climbing harnesses. George passes a
text: rope and CLIPS everyone together.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All right, listen up. This is gonna
dialog: get real nasty. Keep a close eye on
text: the person in front.
text: Frank starts tearing excess gear off Carl and Victoria’s
text: harnesses.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Stay on the rope. Three points of
dialog: contact at all times.
speaker_heading: CARL (NERVOUS)
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sure. Try not to fuck up.
text: The team wade out into the river.
scene_heading: EXT. FLOODED RIVER
text: The raging river surges through miles of narrow passageway. A
text: living force of water that threatens to destroy all in its
dialog: path.
text: Chest deep in the icy flow, the exploration team battle their
text: way upstream. Tethered by a single rope, each team member
text: braces themselves against the torrent.
dialog: 44
text: Water POUNDS their bodies, threatening to dash them against
text: the sharp rocks lining the riverbed walls.
scene_heading: EXT. FIREHOSE CLIFF
text: The team pull themselves out of the surging river, onto a
text: wide ledge at the base of a 50ft Cliff.
speaker_heading: CARL (BREATHLESS)
dialog: W-Where to now?
text: Frank flicks his light upwards: the COMMUNICATION CABLE
text: disappears into a narrow tunnel at the top of the cliff. The
text: tunnel is half-flooded. A powerful GEYSER of water shoots
text: several feet out over the cliff edge, before crashing into a
text: deep pool below them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Through there.
speaker_heading: CARL (DESPAIRING)
dialog: We'll never make it!
text: Luko starts muttering a PRAYER. He’s clearly terrified.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wait here.
text: Frank scrambles up the cliff face and cautiously approaches
text: the water-filled tunnel. His feet slip and slide on the
text: treacherous rocks. Bracing himself against the tunnel walls,
text: Frank sneaks a look upstream: the tunnel is impassable, the
dialog: flow too strong.
text: Frank sags. Then he sees a FLASH of light on the other side
dialog: of the tunnel.
speaker_heading: FRANK (BELLOWING)
dialog: Who’s there?!
text: No answer. Then a familiar voice, barely audible against the
text: ROAR of the water.
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.8.)
dialog: Dad?
text: Frank's expression changes from shock, to fear, then to
dialog: anger.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Josh? What the hell are you doing?
dialog: 45
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S.)
dialog: I came to tell you...the cave’s
dialog: flooding!
text: Frank shakes his head in disbelief.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No shit! (furious) Why didn’t they
dialog: call us?
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S.)
dialog: They've been trying all night! Your
dialog: comms are switched off!
text: Frank's eyes narrow in confusion. He casts a suspicious
text: glance at Carl, far below.
speaker_heading: CARL (CALLING UP)
dialog: Is someone up there?
scene_heading: INT. ABOVE FIREHOSE CLIFF.
text: Josh is surrounded by a THUNDERING mass of white-water
text: rapids. He is sheltering behind a GIGANTIC ROCK wedged
text: midstream. Plumes of water jet high around him: it’s all he
text: can do to avoid being sucked down into the gaping tunnel.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.8.)
dialog: Feed us the rope!
text: Josh removes a 50 METER ROPE from around his neck. He glances
text: around for an anchor point and loops the rope around the
text: boulder he’s sheltering behind.
scene_heading: INT. FIREHOSE CLIFF
text: Frank catches the rope as it shoots out of the tunnel. He
text: hoists it out of the water.
text: ZIIIP! Josh slides two JUMARS down the rope to Frank.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Luko pushes past Carl and Crazy George and starts scrambling
text: up the cliff toward Frank. Blind panic in his eyes.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Frank!
text: Before Frank can stop him, Luko has grabbed the rope and
text: pulled himself into the tunnel.
dialog: 46
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Luko! No!
speaker_heading: LUKO
dialog: Me mus run way out long ples yia!
text: PFFFFFT! The water hits Luko like a sledgehammer, knocking
text: the wind out of him and causing him to CRY OUT in pain.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CREAK! The BOULDER that Josh has lashed the rope around
text: suddenly lurches forward an inch. Josh's eyes widen in fear.
text: He YELLS down the tunnel.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Stop! There’s too much weight!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Luko uses brute force to pull himself up the tunnel, his body
text: takes the full brunt of the flow.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Luko! Use the jumars! Streamline
dialog: yourself!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CREAK! Josh sees the BOULDER tilt toward him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Luko! Go back!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Luko braces himself and HEAVES on the rope.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Josh! Look out!
dialog: cur To:
text: Josh spins around just in time to see the BOULDER come
text: CRASHING toward him. The force of the water, combined with
text: Luko’s weight has turned it into a fearsome projectile.
text: Josh leaps forward to escape being crushed. The river sucks
text: him down into the tunnel. CRUNCH! The BOULDER slams into the
text: tunnel entrance, sealing it shut.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 47
text: Luko and Josh fly out of the tunnel like champagne corks.
text: They SLAM into Frank, knocking him over the edge of the
text: cliff. BADOOSH! All three plunge into the pool below.
text: The waterfall suddenly ceases to flow.
text: Luko surfaces, COUGHING and SPLUTTERING. He scrambles to the
text: base of the cliff and drags himself out of the water.
text: George and Victoria help pull Frank toward shore. He's badly
text: winded.
text: Josh fights his way back to the surface at the far side of
text: the pool and is almost sucked downstream. He grabs a rock at
text: the edge of the pool and pulls himself out of the flow.
text: VARIOUS REACTION SHOTS as the team gaze up at the tunnel
text: where the waterfall used to be. An eerie silence fills the
text: cave. Then a strange GROANING sound, like a human voice. The
text: cliff wall starts CREAKING, as though trying to communicate.
text: Frank's eyes widen in alarm.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Everyone back down the tunnel!
dialog: Move!
speaker_heading: CARL (TERRIFIED)
dialog: W-What's happening?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s punching a way through!
text: BLAM! A fist-sized section of the cliff wall flies toward
text: them as the water blasts a new route downstream.
text: POP! POP! POP! More sections of the cliff wall explode around
text: them. A large STALACTITE falls from the ceiling, narrowly
text: missing Josh. The cave fills with SPRAY and NOISE. Luko
text: starts scrambling back up the rope just as...
text: BADOOM! A HISSING, MALEVOLENT geyser of spray SMASHES into
text: him like a thousand firehoses combined. He is blasted through
text: the air and SLAMMED into the far cave wall. Luko crumples and
text: falls into the river. He is immediately washed downstream.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Josh! Grab him!
text: Josh is frozen in shock and unable to move. Luko breaks the
text: surface and reaches toward him, barely conscious.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Josh! Help him, for fuck's sake!
dialog: 48
text: Josh watches helplessly as Luko is washed away into the
dialog: darkness.
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as the team react to Luko’s death.
text: All eyes eventually turn from Josh to Frank. Frank gazes
text: around the cave, sizing up his adversary. The chamber is
text: quickly filling with water.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're heading back down.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What? No!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We stay here, we'll be drowned like

dialog: higher ground.
speaker_heading: CARL (DESPAIRING)
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (long beat) Through the
dialog: restriction.
text: VARIOUS REACTION SHOTS as they take this in.
scene_heading: INT. FORWARD CAMP
text: The entire cavern is almost underwater. The team wade, chest
text: deep, through the muddy water, pushing their way through the
text: floating debris.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Grab anything that looks useful.
text: George, prep the ‘breathers.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Victoria's hands are SHAKING in fright as she practices
text: opening and closing the REBREATHER MOUTHPIECE. Frank is busy
text: adjusting her harness.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ...Try and think of it as a normal
dialog: night dive. George’ll be with you
dialog: every step of the way...
dialog: 49
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I thought George can’t dive
dialog: anymore?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We're taking him out of retirement.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (NERVOUS)
dialog: Just how tight does it get down
dialog: there, Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's a body tube. Same as you've
dialog: done in dry cave, but with

speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: (beat) I guess I’1l have to be.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Frank reckons it’s clear. That’s
dialog: all you need to know.
text: Crazy George eyes the rising water.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: One thing's for sure: stay here and
dialog: y'all better start growing gills.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: In the far section of the cavern, Josh wades through the
text: water, grabbing anything that looks useful. Suddenly, he
text: freezes: in front of him, wrapped around a rock, is Luko's
text: body. It's a ghastly sight. The river has broken every bone
text: in his body. His jaw is almost hanging off. Josh shudders.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: I’m sorry...I’m sorry...I’m
dialog: SOrry...
text: Luko opens his eyes. Josh jumps in fright.
dialog: 50
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Over here! Someone bring the
dialog: medical kit!
text: The others wade over and stand horrified. Frank takes one
text: look at Luko and throws the medical kit away. He leans
text: forward to examine him. Luko tries to speak. Bloody froth
text: pours from his broken jaw.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Easy. Don't try to talk.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: How bad is it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (long beat) Leave us alone.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's nothing we can do.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: George, take Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, wait. What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm going to take care of it.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (HORRIFIED)
dialog: Oh, Jesus, no. No!
text: Carl puts his arm around Victoria. She shrugs him off.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You have to help him!
text: Josh turns to the others.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Tell him! He has to do something.
dialog: 51
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What do you want me to do? He's
text: broken every bone in his body. He
text: can't hold a reg in his mouth.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You can't just leave him to die.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't intend to.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No! You have no right to do this!
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: C'mon Josh, let’s go...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Get your fucking hands off me!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: George, get him away from here!
speaker_heading: JOSH (TO FRANK)
dialog: You're going to kill him, aren't

speaker_heading: FRANK (FURIOUS)

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: George. I'm begging you. Please
dialog: don't let him do this!
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Come away, Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH (PLEADING)
dialog: There must be something we can do?
dialog: Anything.
dialog: 52
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: There is: you can do as Frank says.
text: Josh stands helpless. After a few seconds, he follows Crazy

text: Though barely conscious, Luko seems to understand what must
dialog: be done.
dialog: cur TO:
text: Josh flashes his light back toward his father. Frank is

scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER DECO HABITAT - ONE HOUR LATER
text: The team float upon the surface of the moon pool, wearing

dialog: So I finally managed to get you
dialog: into one of these...
speaker_heading: JOSH (FLINCHING)
dialog: Get the fuck off me!
text: An awkward silence. Frank reaches forward and tugs on Josh's
text: harness, tightening his straps. Josh avoids eye contact.
scene_heading: FRANK CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Keep hold of the line at all All gasses on? Okay. Start
dialog: times...I taught you how to callin' the numbers...
dialog: clear your mask?
speaker_heading: JOSH CARL
dialog: Yeah. A hundred times. Oxygen 200. Trimix 220.
scene_heading: FRANK CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Show me. Buoyancy and bailout?
dialog: 53
text: Josh SIGHS and demonstrates the technique.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Good. You keep your
text: mouthpiece in at all times.
dialog: Flood the breathing loop and
dialog: it’s all over...
speaker_heading: JOSH (PROVOCATIVE)
dialog: Like Judes, you mean?
speaker_heading: FRANK (NOT BITING)
dialog: Yeah. Just like Judes.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Look, I remember how to dive!
dialog: Carl has already taken me
dialog: through it...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well now you get to hear it
dialog: twice. Green light's good,
dialog: red light's bad. I'11 monitor
dialog: your PPO2 and decompression.
dialog: You remember what I told you
dialog: about decompression sickness?
speaker_heading: JOSH
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Check.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (TO VICTORIA
dialog: Close your mouthpiece.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Here, let me...
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ANNOYED)
dialog: I’m fine!
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Trimix set to 10/80? Gradient
dialog: factors 15/85? High setpoint
dialog: at 1.2? Bubble checks? Okay
dialog: folks, we’re good to go...
dialog: No, ‘cause I'm stupid.
text: Crazy George suddenly leans over and grabs Josh.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Hey! You wanna end up like me?
text: Josh says nothing.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Then you better smarten up. You get
dialog: bent down here, it’s gonna ruin
dialog: your whole day.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (SARCASTIC)
dialog: And our day was going so well.
scene_heading: FRANK (TO JOSH AND VICTORIA)
dialog: We'll have about four hours of
dialog: decompression to do once we reach
dialog: the other side. Stay at the same
dialog: depth as me, or your blood'll start
text: fizzing like a dropped soda.
dialog: 54
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Nice.(acid to Carl) You actually
dialog: choose to do this?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: All right, let's visualize the
dialog: dive. Visibility’s gonna be stirred
dialog: to shit, so we can’t use the DPV’s.
dialog: We have a long swim to the
dialog: restriction. Stay behind me at all
dialog: times and pace yourselves. The
dialog: tunnel gets real tight in places.
dialog: Don't freak out if it silts up.
dialog: Just stay on the line and wait for
dialog: it to clear.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: You want me to bring up the rear?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'll lead, followed by Josh, then
dialog: Carl, then you. (beat) Victoria at
dialog: the back.
text: Victoria glares at Frank. The implication is clear: Frank's
dialog: worried she'll panic.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
text: Focus on breathing. Deep and slow.
dialog: One person loses it down there, we
dialog: all die.
text: Victoria looks sick with fright.
speaker_heading: CARL (PATRONIZING)
dialog: You can do this, baby. Be brave.
text: Victoria glares at him murderously.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Everyone clear on the plan?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Basically, we follow you, keep
text: breathing and hope nothing beeps.
text: Frank and Crazy George exchange a look.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: That's about the gist of it.
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Any questions?
text: No one says a word.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’1l see you on the other side.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (DEADPAN)
dialog: Not literally, I hope?
text: Frank flashes the “down” signal. They sink beneath the
dialog: surface.
scene_heading: INT. UNDER THE DECO HABITAT.
text: The water turns a dirty, blood-red ochre as the divers follow
text: Frank into the 'mixing zone'. Their powerful HID LIGHTS
text: barely penetrate the thick clouds of silt that dance and
text: swirl across their face masks. A surreal descent into a
text: pinkish cloud of ghostly shadows.
text: Frank locates the GUIDELINE and wraps Josh's hand firmly
text: around it. Josh follows Frank’s fins into the murk.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER SUMP
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as a thick shroud of silt cocoons the divers:
text: Frank appears out of the gloom, his thumb and forefinger
text: circled around the GUIDELINE. He sweeps his arm up and down
text: through the murk, like a blind man using a cane. He passes
text: several plastic CAVE ARROWS, clipped to the line at
text: intervals, pointing the way back out. Suddenly, the cave wall
text: materializes in Frank's HID LIGHT.
text: Josh jumps in fright as Frank’s face suddenly looms out of
text: the dark. They exchange “okay” signals and descend along the
text: cave wall.
text: CRUMP! Carl bangs into the cave wall, dislodging a huge
text: STALACTITE. He YELLS a muffled warning into his mouthpiece.
text: Crazy George CURSES as the STALACTITE whizzes by, narrowly
text: missing him. Victoria tightens her grip around Crazy George’s
text: wrist. They continue onward.
dialog: 56
scene_heading: INT. DEVIL'S RESTRICTION
text: Frank leads the divers along the GUIDELINE until they reach
text: the claustrophobic tunnel. It’s barely visible through the
text: milky white-out.
text: Victoria's eyes widen when she sees how tight the restriction
text: is. We hear her BREATHING increase as she fights the rising
text: wave of panic. Frank circles his flashlight: ‘okay?' He
text: receives a shaky signal back from her.
text: Frank and George remove the EQUIPMENT PACKS from their
text: harness and clip them around their ankles, so they can be
text: dragged through the tunnel. Silt swirls.
text: Frank removes his REBREATHER and holds it in front of him.
text: The others nervously do the same. Frank signals for Josh to
text: ‘buddy up’ with him. Pushing his REBREATHER ahead of him,
text: Frank disappears into the hole. After a few seconds, Josh
text: follows.
scene_heading: INT. BODY TUBE - DEVIL'S RESTRICTION.
text: POV Josh: He follows Frank into the tunnel, keeping his hand
text: on the line at all times. Frank's pack and fins can just be
text: seen scraping along the tunnel ahead. Breathe. Push. Breathe.
dialog: Push.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Stay green. Please stay green.
dialog: Don’t beep. Please. Don't fucking
text: beep.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER TUNNEL - DEVIL'S RESTRICTION
text: Back at the entrance, Carl disappears into the tunnel. Crazy
text: George turns toward Victoria and taps her on the shoulder.
text: She jumps. George shows her a message on his WRIST SLATE:
text: "YOU CAN DO IT", next to a SMILEY FACE. Victoria nods her
text: head, grateful. Crazy George squeezes her hand reassuringly.
text: Then he disappears into the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. BODY TUBE - DEVIL'S RESTRICTION.
text: A nightmarish sequence as the divers crawl down the body tube
dialog: in near-zero visibilty:
text: Frank glances behind him. The dull orange glow of Josh's
text: light approaches. They exchange ‘okay’ signals.
dialog: 57
text: Further back in the tunnel, Carl wedges stuck. He tries to
text: turn around but can't move. His BREATHING skyrockets. Carl
text: braces himself and STRAINS against the ceiling. White
text: fragments of rock break free and dance like snowflakes
text: against his helmet. He eventually manages to pull himself
dialog: forward.
text: Crazy George freezes as the ceiling starts to CREAK and
text: GROAN. He glances back and sees Victoria waiting patiently
text: for him. They exchange ‘okay’ signals. After a few seconds,
text: George continues, his eyes glued nervously to the ceiling.
text: Victoria claws her way forward, following Crazy George's
text: EQUIPMENT BAG. Her eyes are fixed with dogged determination.
text: She’s HUMMING a tune: “ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS”, to calm
dialog: herself down.
scene_heading: INT. UNEXPLORED ABYSS.
text: Darkness. Then the hazy glow of approaching lights. A thick
text: cloud of silt billows from the tunnel in the cliff wall. Like
text: free-fall parachutists emerging from a cloud, the divers
text: break through into the gin-clear waters of the abyss.
text: Victoria finally appears, a victorious grin on her face.
text: Crazy George swims over, shakes her hand and then helps her
text: back into the REBREATHER. Frank shows Josh his VR3 DIVE
speaker_heading: COMPUTER:
scene_heading: DEPTH 102M. TOTAL DECO: 245 MINS
text: Josh nods his understanding. Frank flashes everyone the ‘up’
dialog: signal.
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as the team slowly work their way up the cave
text: walls, decompressing every few feet.
text: Frank swims over to check on the others periodically. The
text: TOTAL DECO TIME slowly ticks down on their DIVE COMPUTERS.
text: Crazy George hovers next to Victoria, adjusting her buoyancy
text: as required. Victoria is SHIVERING from the cold. George rubs
text: her hands, trying to warm her up.
text: Carl swims away from the others, far out into the abyss. He’s
text: busy exploring the far side of the cave.
text: Frank signals for Josh to ascend to the next deco stop. His
text: eyes narrow in concern when he sees Josh isn’t moving. He
text: swims over and catches him playing the 'OCTOPUS' video game
text: on his VR3 DIVE COMPUTER. Frank MUMBLES angrily into his
text: MOUTHPIECE and signals “up”.
dialog: 58
text: Finally, Crazy George flashes his beam to get everyone's
text: attention: the team visibly relax as their lights reflect off
text: the surface, far above them.
scene_heading: INT. UNEXPLORED CAVERN
text: VARIOUS REACTION SHOTS as the team surface.
text: They remove their MOUTHPIECES and gratefully suck down great
text: gulps of air. Then they gaze around them in wonder. The
text: cavern is huge: an endless dessert of sand dunes rising from
text: the water and disappearing into the darkness. A sunless
text: Sahara, with no sign of the walls or ceiling.
text: Crazy George throws back his head and emits a WHOOP of
text: delight. His voice ECHOES into the darkness.
scene_heading: INT. UNEXPLORED CAVERN - THE NEXT DAY
text: Blackness. Josh wakes with a start and stares up at the cave
text: ceiling. It takes him a moment to remember where he is.
text: Frank is busy changing the batteries in the FLASHLIGHTS.
text: George is filling a DRIED FOOD PACK with water. Carl is sat
text: alone on a rock, staring out into space. Victoria lies
text: SHIVERING inside her SPACE BLANKET: she’s hypothermic and
text: utterly miserable. GEORGE offers her some food.
text: Josh crawls toward the EQUIPMENT BAGS and starts rummaging
text: through the SUPPLIES. He pulls out a food bag and walks down
text: to the water. Frank crouches by the shoreline, his flashlight
text: fixed upon a submerged rock far out in the water. He’s
text: watching, listening, feeling the cave.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How are the supplies looking?
text: Josh is still angry. He ignores his father.
speaker_heading: FRANK (ANGRY)
dialog: I said...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: There's food for a couple of days.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This place will be underwater in a
dialog: couple of days.
speaker_heading: JOSH (DERISIVELY)
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 59
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: See that rock? Last night it was
text: above water.
text: Frank marches over to the EQUIPMENT BAG and pulls out several
text: items: A ROPE, COMPASS and VERTICAL GEAR. Carl shuffles over.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: How long before they come and get
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CARL
text: The rescue party.
text: Frank smiles at this.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's no rescues down here, mate.
text: Only body recoveries.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: But when word gets out I'm
dialog: missing...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Then what? No amount of money is
dialog: gonna save you now. Folk up there
dialog: already think you're dead.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (DEADPAN)
dialog: Reckon I should of sold my Delvenet
dialog: shares.
text: Frank smiles as he shoulders the rope.
speaker_heading: CARL (FUMING)
dialog: I just want to know what the plan
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No plan ever survived contact with
dialog: the enemy. And this cave just shat
dialog: out every plan I had.
speaker_heading: CARL (SHOUTING)
dialog: Then what, pray tell, do you
dialog: suggest we do!?!
text: Frank marches over to him.
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You could try calling your lawyers,
dialog: so they can sue me. Oh, no. I
dialog: forgot...
text: Frank lowers his voice to an angry whisper
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Some fucker switched the comms off!
text: Carl goes white as a sheet as Frank storms off.
speaker_heading: FRANK (TO JOSH)
dialog: Stay here. I’m going to scout
dialog: ahead.
text: Carl shouts after him.
speaker_heading: CARL (CALLING AFTER HIM)
dialog: I still think we should sit tight
dialog: and wait a few days!
speaker_heading: FRANK (OVER HIS SHOULDER)
dialog: For what? The lights to go out?
dialog: Batteries won't last forever.
text: Carl considers this. Then reaches up and switches his HELMET
text: LIGHT off.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Fucker.
text: Josh watches his father's light disappear into the distance.
text: After a few moments, he decides to follow him.
scene_heading: INT. SUNLESS SAHARA
text: An expanse of sand dunes stretch along the banks of an
text: underground lake. Frank follows the shoreline, flashing his
text: light around the cave. Josh follows, keeping out of sight.
text: Frank pauses to take a compass reading. Josh ducks as Frank’s
text: light swings toward him. When Josh looks up, Frank is gone.
text: Josh considers following. Then gazes nervously around him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Fuck it.
text: He stumbles back the way he came.
dialog: 61
scene_heading: INT. UNEXPLORED CAVERN
text: Back at the sump, Victoria is still SHIVERING uncontrollably.
text: A single light casts gloomy shadows across the walls.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (TO VICTORIA)
dialog: How you doing?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (SHIVERING)
dialog: I-I still can't feel my feet.
text: Crazy George lifts the space blanket and pulls off Victoria's
text: soaked WETSUIT BOOTEES.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
text: They're like blocks of ice.
text: Crazy George starts rubbing Victoria's feet and legs. Carl
text: casts a glance but decides to say nothing.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: T-Thank you, George.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Ain't nothin’.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I mean back there. The way you
dialog: h-helped me. It was...was...
text: Victoria stops herself before she gets upset.
speaker_heading: CARL (TO GEORGE)
dialog: Pity our illustrious leader doesn't
dialog: share your humanity.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Frank’s got Josh to think about
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: That man only thinks about himself.
dialog: He'd leave us all to die if he had
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Don't go sayin' that. (trying to
dialog: convince himself) Frank's gonna get
dialog: us out of here.
dialog: 62
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Christ, George. Wake up. You saw
dialog: what he did to Luko. What makes you
dialog: think he values our lives any
dialog: differently?
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
text: He just lives by a different set of
dialog: rules, that’s all. He did what
dialog: needed to be done. None of us had
dialog: the stomach for it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Precisely. And that's what makes us
dialog: human beings.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ANGRY)
dialog: Spare us the morality lessons,
dialog: Carl. You have no right to judge
dialog: anyone, least of all Frank. It was
dialog: a mercy killing.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah? Let's see if the authorities
dialog: agree when we get out of here.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You can be such an asshole.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I can't believe you're taking his
dialog: side in this!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (BITTER)
dialog: He's not the one who got us into
dialog: this mess!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You know damn well.
speaker_heading: SUNLESS SAHARA
text: Josh scrambles BREATHLESSLY to the top of a boulder pile. He
text: looks confused and scared when his light fails to reveal the
text: others waiting on the other side. Instead, a vast GAPING
text: TUNNEL leads further into the cave.
dialog: 63
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Fuck! (beat) Keep going, you ain’t
dialog: lost.(beat) They have to be through
dialog: there...
text: Josh stumbles on, deeper into the cave.
scene_heading: INT. UNEXPLORED CAVERN
text: Victoria pulls herself to her feet and staggers towards Carl.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: You turned off the comm
dialog: system. (beat) Didn’t you?
text: Crazy George looks up.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Why the hell would I do that?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (EXPLODING)
dialog: “Uncontactable until further
dialog: notice!” Well, we're pretty un-
dialog: fucking-contactable now!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You're delusional!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Delusional? Look where we fucking
dialog: are! You may have just killed us
dialog: all.
text: A voice from the shadows.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It don't matter now.
text: Frank steps out of the darkness. He's overheard everything.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: None of it. What matters now is
dialog: survival.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You're enjoying this aren't you?
dialog: Making life or death decisions.
dialog: Playing God.
dialog: 64
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's no God down here, mate.
dialog: This cave doesn't give a flying
dialog: fuck about you, me, or Christ-all-
dialog: mighty. We're specks of dust to
text: her, passing through.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What the hell was I thinking:
dialog: letting you talk me into this?
dialog: You're a fucking animal. Even your
dialog: son can't stand the sight of you.
text: Frank glances around.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where is Josh?
scene_heading: INT. SUNLESS SAHARA
text: Josh reaches the top of another dune. A vast expanse of
text: nothingness lays before him.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Fuck it. Give them a shout, they’re
dialog: bound to hear you.(beat) You'd
dialog: never hear the last of it. (beat)
dialog: Admit it: you're lost. (beat)
dialog: Alright, retrace your steps...
text: Josh turns and flashes his light back the way he’s come.
text: Three identical-looking tunnels lead into the rockface behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank and George are following Josh's footprints. They end
text: abruptly at the edge of a shingle collapse.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Josh! Josh!
text: His voice ECHOES eerily around the walls of the cave.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Quit freakin’ out. He’ll be fine.
dialog: 65
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Goddamn it, George! You were
dialog: supposed to watch him!
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: The boy wanted to go off
dialog: exploring. (grinning) Remind you of
dialog: anyone?
text: Frank scowls and storms away. Crazy George smiles as he
text: watches him disappear into the darkness.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (IN PAIN)
speaker_heading: Gnnnt
text: George suddenly winces in pain. He lifts his arm and flexes
text: it, a concerned look on his face.
speaker_heading: CuT TO:
text: Josh is about to enter the largest tunnel when...
speaker_heading: FRANK (DISTANT 0.S.)
dialog: Josh!
text: He freezes as he hears Frank’s voice. But he can’t tell which
text: direction it’s coming from.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m through here!
text: A few seconds of silence.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CLOSER 0.S.)
dialog: Don’t move! Keep talking!
speaker_heading: JOSH (SLOWLY CIRCLING)
dialog: What do you want me to say? (beat)
dialog: I think I’ve found the way forward!
dialog: (beat) I was just coming to tell
dialog: you...
text: BLAM! A hand shoots out of the dark and grabs Josh by the
text: shoulder. Frank spins him around and shakes him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I thought I told you to stay with
dialog: the group?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I-I...
dialog: 66
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You get lost down here and it’s all
dialog: over. Don't ever wander off again!
dialog: Understand?
text: Josh bristles in anger and SLAPS Frank’s hand away.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Get off me!
text: Josh's voice ECHOES into the far distance. Frank’s head snaps
text: up: it sounds like the cave goes on forever. Crazy George
text: steps out of the shadows, still flexing his wrist. He grins
text: through the pain and slaps Josh on the back.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Shoot, I reckon the boy's done
dialog: found the way forward!
scene_heading: INT. FOOTBALL FIELD CHAMBER
text: A vast chamber, larger than several football fields. No sign
text: of the walls or ceiling. Three specks of light appear in the
text: distance. Two more lights trail behind them.
text: Josh plods along next to Crazy George. They both struggle
text: under the weight of their REBREATHERS and also carry a heavy
text: EQUIPMENT BAG between them. Crazy George keeps flexing his
text: hand every few seconds, a worried expression on his face.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Asshole. He's a fucking asshole.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Hell, he's just tryin’ to look out
dialog: for you. Easy enough to get lost in
dialog: a place like this.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nothing's ever good enough. I
dialog: remember writing a school project
text: for him once. A cave diving
dialog: adventure. He hands it back to me
dialog: with a list of technical notes...
scene_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (A KNOWING SMILE)
dialog: Yeah. Frank sure likes to give a
dialog: lotta notes...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I was seven years old, George!
dialog: 67
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Did you hear about the time Frank
dialog: really fucked up?
text: Josh tries to conceal his interest.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Couple of years ago, he’s in the
dialog: outback, checking out this massive
dialog: hole, name of...
text: Crazy George grinds to a halt, confused and then a little
text: scared as he struggles to remember the name.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Damn, what was that place called?
text: He drops the EQUIPMENT BAG and leans, exhausted, against a
text: large rock. Josh looks at him, bemused.
scene_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
dialog: Anyhow, he backs his truck right up
text: to the water, so he can tie off his
text: line. Then he does his dive.
text: Crazy George takes a long pull of water from his flask.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
text: On the way back out, he sees the
text: entrance is blocked by a vehicle,
text: sixty feet underwater. And he's
dialog: like: "Shit, that licence plate
dialog: looks familiar". (beat) He'd only
dialog: gone and left the handbrake off!
text: Josh smiles.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (continuing)
text: Had to smash open his back window,
dialog: just so he could swim out!
text: Josh LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (CHUCKLING)
dialog: And then he has to haul his sorry
dialog: ass back over 60 miles of desert!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He's a hell of a guy, your old man.
dialog: Once you get to know him.
dialog: Josh considers this.
dialog: 68
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (beat) Take the bag will ya? Go on,
dialog: I'll catch up directly.
text: Crazy George waits until Josh has gone, then starts
text: scribbling numbers onto his WRIST SLATE. His hand is SHAKING
text: uncontrollably as he writes: 101-7=
text: Crazy George struggles to do the math. After a few seconds,
text: he realizes he can’t work out the answer.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SCARED WHISPER)
dialog: Ah, shit...
text: He opens the MOUTHPIECE on his REBREATHER and flushes the
text: loop with the button marked OXYGEN. Breathing from the
text: REBREATHER, he staggers after Josh’s light.
scene_heading: INT. BOTTOM OF BOULDER PILE, FOOTBALL FIELD CHAMBER
text: Football Field chamber ends in a huge mountain of rubble that
text: disappears into the higher reaches of the cave. Victoria
text: collapses, SHIVERING on a rock. She watches Carl’s light
text: ascending up the debris slope, far above her.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (ANNOYED)
dialog: Carl! Wait for me!
text: A voice in the darkness startles her. Frank steps out of the
dialog: shadows.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (SHIVERING)
dialog: Hot bath and a brandy and I'd be
dialog: fine.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We’1l camp here.
text: Frank nods toward Carl’s distant light.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I'm guessing this is a little more
dialog: adventurous than his usual
dialog: excursions?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Next year we're sticking to
dialog: Disneyland.
dialog: 69
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How'd you ever wind up with a guy
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I ask myself that question every
dialog: day. (beat) I was one of his guides
dialog: on Everest. (smiling) Bastard had
dialog: me fired so I’d come and work for
dialog: him. How about you? How’d you get
dialog: involved with the dot-com devil?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Usual sponsors would have turned
dialog: this into a circus. Twenty guys,
dialog: all with different agendas. I've
dialog: dealt with enough of those
dialog: fucksticks to last a lifetime.
text: Rocks CLATTER down the slope as Carl reaches the top.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I figured your boy up there was the
dialog: best way to get some real
dialog: exploration done. (beat)
dialog: This wasn’t quite what I had in
dialog: mind.
text: Victoria smiles as she gazes into Frank's eyes.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Well. I’m glad you’re here to look
dialog: after us.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t go fooling yourself. Down
dialog: here, you’re on your own.
text: A voice from the darkness above them.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Victoria! You have to see this.
dialog: It's incredible!
text: Victoria shakes her head sadly and starts climbing the
text: boulder pile.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF BOULDER PILE.
text: Carl stands on top of the highest boulder. The team stagger
text: up the final few yards to join him.
dialog: 70
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Welcome to 'Carl's Cavern’.
text: Frank and Crazy George exchange a withering look. FLASH!
text: Carl’s powerful CAMERA STROBE reveals the vastness of the
text: chamber they have just walked through. The walls and ceiling

dialog: Hey, Josh! Get up here. We’ll make
dialog: the cover of ‘National Geographic'
dialog: yet!
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (TO FRANK)
dialog: National Lampoon, more like.
text: Josh scrambles up to the highest boulder and poses for Carl.
text: Frank storms over and snatches the camera off Carl. He hurls
text: it far over the edge of the boulder slope. After a few
text: seconds, we hear it SMASH apart below.
text: A moment of tension as Carl and Frank face each other.
text: Suddenly, Carl launches himself at Frank. George stumbles
dialog: between them.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Whoa! Let's calm it down!
speaker_heading: CARL (SCREAMING)
dialog: You fucking asshole! You fuck,
dialog: fuck, fucking asshole!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Why the fuck would you do that?
dialog: What gives you the fucking right to
dialog: do that? To me?
text: Frank pushes past George and grabs Carl by the throat,
text: SLAMMING him against the boulder.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You listen to me! When they pull
dialog: our bodies outta here, they ain't
dialog: finding no Goddamn tourist shots.
dialog: Not of me and not of my son,
dialog: grinning like an idiot! Understand?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Let him go!
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Jesus, Frank. You're choking him.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Frank, please. Let him go.
text: Frank releases Carl. Carl slumps to the floor, clutching his
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: They’1l1 find us with our tanks
text: empty and our fingers scraped to
dialog: the bone.
text: Frank turns to Josh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: They ain't handing your mother a
dialog: Goddamn photograph.
text: Frank storms away, back down the boulder slope.
scene_heading: INT. BOTTOM OF BOULDER PILE - NEXT MORNING
text: TIGHT on Frank: looking grim as he fits the last set of
text: BATTERIES into the flashlights. He shoulders his pack and
text: starts KICKING everyone awake.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: C’mon. Let’s move.
text: Various GROANS as everyone rolls over in their SPACE BLANKETS
text: in a vain attempt to go back to sleep.
speaker_heading: FRANK (ROARING)
dialog: Now!
scene_heading: INT. TUNNELS
text: VARIOUS SHOTS: Frank leads the team along a series of narrow
text: tunnels, winding ever upwards. Several smaller tunnels branch
text: off. Frank ignores them and continues moving forward.
scene_heading: INT. THE DROP
text: The tunnel ends abruptly at the edge of a sheer drop. No way
text: forward. The team collapse to the floor, utterly exhausted.
text: Frank crouches at the edge of the precipice and launches a
dialog: rock.
dialog: 72
text: After six seconds, we hear a distant SPLOSH!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Maybe we missed something? We could
dialog: always go back...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We ain't going back.
text: Frank tosses the rope down into the drop and secures it.
speaker_heading: FRANK (TO VICTORIA)
dialog: I want you to start ferrying the
dialog: others down as quickly as
dialog: possible...
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (SHIVERING)
dialog: I-I’'ll try. I’m just not sure I c-
dialog: can hold a r-ope anymore...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’1l do it. Give it to me.
text: Frank casts a quick glance at Carl.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No!
text: Josh sags and slouches away. Frank calls after him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I need a good rope man below.
text: Josh swells slightly at this veiled compliment and starts
text: eagerly prepping his vertical gear. Victoria flashes an
text: approving smile at Frank. Frank shrugs as if to say “yeah,
dialog: yeah”.
text: Carl ambles over to Crazy George, who is resting further down
text: the tunnel, breathing oxygen from his REBREATHER. He quickly
text: conceals his SHAKING ARM as Carl approaches.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONCERNED)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Hell, yeah. Just catchin’ my
dialog: breath.
speaker_heading: CARL (WHISPERING)
dialog: Why the fuck is ‘Captain Caveman’
dialog: taking us deeper? Makes no sense at
dialog: all.
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SHRUGS)
dialog: Guess he’s following the river.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: All the way to the ocean?
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: If that’s what it takes.
text: Crazy George goes back onto OXYGEN. Carl calls over to Frank.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We've been climbing for six hours
dialog: now! Surely we must be close to the
dialog: surface?
speaker_heading: FRANK (STUDYING THE ROCK)
dialog: I reckon we are about...thirty feet
text: from the surface.
text: Carl gazes up in astonishment. And hope.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But unless you brought some
dialog: dynamite, that ain’t gonna help us
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We could at least split up and
dialog: search those passageways we passed?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: They’re too small. We go back down.
dialog: And hope the lower cave ain’t
dialog: flooded yet.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I say we vote on it.
speaker_heading: FRANK (LAUGHING)
dialog: You wanna wake up and have a word
dialog: with yourself. This ain’t no
dialog: democracy.
text: Frank steps off the edge of the drop and rappels down into
text: the darkness. Josh clips himself onto the rope.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Josh. Help me search those tunnels.
text: Josh deliberates.
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You don’t have to do everything he
dialog: says, Josh. You and I can find our
dialog: own way out of here.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: Josh! Get down here!
text: Josh glances down at his father’s light far below. He shrugs
text: and casts Carl an apologetic look. Josh disappears over the
text: cliff. Carl glowers after him.
speaker_heading: CARL (ANNOYED)
dialog: Idiots.
text: Carl shoulders his pack.
speaker_heading: CARL (TO VICTORIA)
dialog: C'mon. Let’s go.
text: Victoria glares up at him, shivering and miserable. She
text: slowly shakes her head.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: I-I’m staying with them, Carl.
text: TIGHT on Carl: an angry and betrayed look upon his face as he
text: struggles to deal with this rejection.
scene_heading: INT. BELOW THE DROP
text: Frank stands waist deep in an underground lake, holding onto
text: the bottom of the rope. He gazes up at Josh's light far above
text: him. ZIIIIIIP! Josh zooms down the rope and breaks hard,
text: bouncing to a halt only inches above Frank's head. Frank
text: shoots him a disapproving look.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Quit showin’ off. Wait here and
dialog: help the others. I’1l scout on
dialog: ahead.
text: Frank shoulders his EQUIPMENT BAG and wades out into the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: JOSH (DISAPPOINTED)
dialog: When do I get to scout?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Soon as you stop getting lost.
dialog: 75
scene_heading: INT. THE DROP
text: Crazy George is rappeling down a particularly steep part of
text: the shaft. His REBREATHER dangles several feet below him,
text: acting like a pendulum. His face is screwed up in pain as he
text: edges his way down the sheer cliff wall.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Gnnnng!
text: His body suddenly spasms, his fist clamping up into a tightly
text: balled fist.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SCARED WHISPER)
dialog: Oh, Christ. Not now. Please not
dialog: now...
text: A SHOUT from above causes him to look up. Victoria peers down
text: at him, a concerned look on her face.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: I-I'm fine!
text: Momentarily distracted, he doesn't notice his LONG HAIR
text: slipping into the FIVE-BAR RACK. George pushes himself weakly
text: off the wall. ZIIIP! He plunges several feet down the rope,
text: his hand too weak to operate the brake. His hair gets YANKED
text: VIOLENTLY into the rack, almost scalping him. In extreme
text: pain, he grits his teeth and remains silent, reluctant to let
text: the others know he is in trouble.
scene_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (ANNOYED, TO HIMSELF)
dialog: That’s just great, George. Call the
dialog: fucking rope police.
text: He swings himself painfully toward a rocky ledge. Tries to
text: transfer his body weight. Success! A SIGH of relief. Reaching
text: toward his DIVE KNIFE, he carefully starts sawing away at his
text: trapped hair.
scene_heading: INT. BELOW THE DROP
text: Josh spots something floating on the surface of the water.
text: Fishing it out, he realizes it is a clump of HAIR. Curious,
text: he flashes his light up the shaft.
dialog: 76
scene_heading: INT. THE DROP
text: Crazy George has almost freed himself from the tangle. As he
text: goes to cut the final strand of hair...CRACK! The rock ledge
text: supporting him suddenly crumbles.
text: SHNICK! His knife SLICES clean through the descent rope.
text: Crazy George starts to fall, his hands scrambling to find
text: purchase, his fingernails SCRAPING the rock until...
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Unnnng!
text: His fingers wedge into a ledge. He clings precariously to the
text: edge of a 300ft drop, his legs and REBREATHER dangling above
dialog: the void.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Shit shit shit!
scene_heading: INT. BELOW THE DROP
text: Josh gazes up in horror as the rope coils into the water
text: around him.
scene_heading: INT. THE DROP
text: Victoria feels the rope go slack. She shouts down the drop.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: off rope?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Crazy George shakes his head at the irony.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: No shit, I'm off rope!
text: A SHOUT from below.
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S.)
dialog: Rig another drop line! Now!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 77
text: Victoria leans over the edge and sees Crazy George clinging
text: to the ledge far below. The severed rope hangs several feet
text: above his head. No way he can reach it.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (TO CARL)
dialog: Fetch the rope! Quickly!
text: Carl scrambles toward the EQUIPMENT PACK. As he tears through
text: it, a dreadful realization hits him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Frank has the rope bag!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Crazy George’s hand SHAKES uncontrollably as he tries to pull
text: himself back up. It's impossible. He peers down and sees
text: Josh’s light far below him. He closes his eyes in terror and
text: mumbles a quiet PRAYER.
scene_heading: EXT. BELOW THE DROP
text: Josh yells out into the darkness.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Dad! Dad!
text: No reply. Josh’s eyes narrow in fierce determination. He
text: steels himself, grabs the end of the severed rope and ties it
text: to his harness.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hold on! I'm coming up!
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (0.S.)
dialog: No! Josh! Stay where you are!
text: Josh starts to free-climb the sheer walls of the shaft.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: In a last desperate effort, Crazy George swings his legs
text: toward a narrow crevice. Transferring his body weight, he
text: manages to unclip the carabiner supporting his REBREATHER. It
text: falls away into the darkness below.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Josh navigates his way up a vertical crack in the rock, his
text: feet slipping on the treacherous walls of the shaft. He leans
text: precariously toward a handhold just out of his reach...
dialog: 78
text: SMACK! The rebreather smashes into him, spinning him off the
text: wall. Josh starts to fall. Lightning reflexes as Josh manages
text: to grab a narrow ledge. The rebreather SMASHES apart on the
text: rocks below. Josh spots a ledge on the opposite side of the
text: shaft and LEAPS toward it, just managing to cling on.
speaker_heading: JOSH (GASPING)
dialog: This is tough enough without you
dialog: throwing things at me!
text: A voice from below.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Josh! There's a ledge to your left!
text: Josh gazes down at his father's light far below him. Then he
text: starts to climb.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Victoria and Carl can see Josh edging his way up the walls
text: toward Crazy George.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA
dialog: He's nearly there! Hold on!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Crazy George's grip is finally about to give way.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: I-I can't hold on!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Two more seconds, while I rebelay!
text: Crazy George peers down and sees Josh HAMMERING a BOLT into
text: the smooth cliff wall several feet below him.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: I'm slipping!
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: No! Josh is right beneath you!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Below!
text: Josh lets the hammer fall into the darkness.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 79
text: Frank leaps to one side as the hammer SPLASHES into the
text: water. He gazes up at Josh, flinching with every movement the
dialog: boy makes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Josh CLIPS his COW'S TAIL into the BOLT, then reaches out
text: toward Crazy George. Crazy George swings tantalizingly out of
text: his reach. Adjusting his footing, he leans out further.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I-I've...got you!
text: Josh grabs Crazy George's harness. Just as George’s grip
text: gives way.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Ahhbhh!
text: Crazy George tumbles away into the darkness, taking Josh with
text: him. Josh keeps a firm grip on George’s harness and after a
text: few feet...TWANG! His COW'S TAIL snaps taut, SLAMMING them
text: both violently against the walls of the shaft.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Gnnn!
text: Crazy George spins inverted, Josh clutching his harness. He
text: looks up at him, clearly terrified.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Pass your safety!
text: Crazy George’s hand shakes as he reaches below him and grabs
text: his cow's TAIL.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Now pull yourself back up! Quickly!
text: Crazy George slowly inches the rope toward Josh's
text: outstretched fingers. Josh finally grabs his carabiner
text: and...CLICK! Snaps him into his own harness.
text: With a GRUNT of relief, Josh releases his grip. They both
text: swing free, hanging suspended in mid air. BREATHLESS and
text: exhausted.
scene_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SMILING GRATEFULLY)
dialog: And I thought they called me crazy!
dialog: 80
text: Josh threads the severed rope into the bolt and rappels down
text: with George dangling below.
scene_heading: INT. BELOW THE DROP
text: Frank is performing a full NEUROLOGICAL EXAM on Crazy George,
text: who is breathing oxygen from Frank’s REBREATHER. His own
text: REBREATHER lays smashed on the rocks around him. Crazy George
text: is having trouble focussing on Frank’s finger as he waves it
text: in front of his face. Josh watches from a few feet away,
text: supervising the rope as the others rappel down.
speaker_heading: FRANK (TO JOSH)
dialog: See how his left eye is tracking
dialog: much slower than the right?
text: Josh nods his head.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Helium bubble. Wedged in his spine.
dialog: (to George) You’ve bent yourself
dialog: good and proper this time.
text: Crazy George takes the MOUTHPIECE out and pats the OXYGEN
text: CYLINDER in the REBREATHER.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Ah, quit worrying. Couple more
dialog: hours of this shit and I'll be
dialog: right as rain. (beat) Just remind
dialog: me not to smoke.
speaker_heading: FRANK (SMILING)
dialog: Soon as we find some deep water,
dialog: we’ll recompress you.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: (beat) That was a hell of a thing
dialog: your boy just did, Frank.
text: Frank walks over to Josh and places a hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. It was.
dialog: Josh can’t believe it. A compliment? From Frank? Frank
text: shoulders one of the REBREATHERS and wades out into the
text: darkness. He pauses below the drop and gazes up.
dialog: 81
scene_heading: FRANK (WITH A WINK TO GEORGE)
dialog: Course, I‘d have stuck to the left-
text: hand side of the shaft. Much better
text: hand-holds.
text: Josh and Crazy George exchange a look. Josh rolls his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. RIVER TUNNEL
text: The deafening ROAR of a waterfall can be heard close by.
text: Frank and Josh are busy rigging the easiest route downstream.
text: Josh looks back to see Crazy George staggering through the
text: waist-deep water.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONCERNED)
dialog: What's gonna happen if he can’t
dialog: walk any more?
speaker_heading: FRANK (DEADLY SERIOUS)
dialog: I’1l have to kill him.
text: Josh looks shocked. Then realizes Frank is joking. Frank
text: casts an admiring glance back toward Crazy George. Badly
text: injured, yet still helping Victoria navigate the river.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: We’1ll stick the poor bugger on
dialog: oxygen at 10 meters. He'll be right
dialog: as rain.
text: They walk on for a few paces.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You think we could do something
dialog: safer next year? Like climb the
dialog: North face of the Eiger?
speaker_heading: FRANK (GRINNING)
dialog: Yeah, sure. I reckon I owe you
dialog: that. (beat) No ropes though?
text: Josh walks on. Frank watches him for a few seconds.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I haven’t been the greatest father,
text: Josh. I realize that.
text: Josh stops in his tracks.
dialog: 82
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I guess I just got too hooked into
dialog: all of this.
text: Josh turns and stares at him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But it was never really about
dialog: exploration. This place is my
dialog: church.
text: Frank gazes reverently around the cave.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My sanctum. The only place I get to
dialog: hold a mirror to my soul.
dialog: (beat) I do this because I have to.
speaker_heading: JOSH (BITTER)
dialog: Yeah? (beat) Must be real nice for
dialog: you.
text: Josh walks off. Frank sags visibly as he is overcome with an
text: enormous sense of guilt and loss. He reaches out and grabs
text: the cold cave walls for support. Then gazes sadly after his
dialog: son.
scene_heading: INT. WATERFALLS
text: The river suddenly disappears over a series of three
text: waterfalls. A steep cliff borders the edge of the falls: no
text: easy way down. A thick MIST fills the air. Frank has to SHOUT
text: to be heard above the ROAR of water.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Reckon you can find the way down?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Piece of piss!
text: Frank flashes him a disapproving look.
speaker_heading: JOSH (WEARILY)
dialog: I'll be careful.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We'll rig the zip line!
text: Frank wades back over to the shallows at the edge of the
text: falls and pulls a 50 METER ROPE out of the equipment bag.
dialog: 83
text: Victoria sits on a rock a few feet away, SHIVERING
text: uncontrollably. She's helping Crazy George keep his
text: MOUTHPIECE in place.
text: Frank's eyes register concern: Crazy George's condition has
text: worsened considerably. He’s turning blue and his facial
text: muscles now droop like a stroke victim.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: How you doing, tough guy?
text: George weakly flashes him an "okay" signal.
speaker_heading: FRANK (POINTING)
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Looks like there’s a deep pool
text: below the falls. Hang in there.
dialog: Won’t be long now.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: On the far side of the river, Josh navigates his way down the
text: treacherous rocks lining the falls. It's a torturous descent.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank and Carl brace themselves against the flow and wade
text: toward a rocky island that sits midstream above the
dialog: waterfall.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Pass the cams!
text: Frank slips a large CAM into a crack in the ceiling while
text: Carl prepares the drop rope.
dialog: cur TO:
text: Josh arrives at the pool below the last waterfall: it’s deep
text: and crystal clear. Josh quickly fixes a CAM into the wall and
text: flashes his light up toward Frank.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank receives the signal and throws the rope far over the
text: falls. Josh grabs the rope as it floats past him. He secures
text: it to the CAM and ties it off.
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
text: Carl and Frank HEAVE on the rope. The rope tightens, forming
text: a ZIP LINE above the three waterfalls.
dialog: 84
speaker_heading: CARL (TO FRANK)
dialog: I have it! Start sending the
dialog: equipment down!
text: Frank clips the REBREATHERS and EQUIPMENT BAGS to the rope.
text: The first REBREATHER is launched over the waterfall and ZIPS
text: down the line, SPLASHING into the plunge pool beside Josh.
text: Another REBREATHER zooms down the line seconds later. The
text: EQUIPMENT BAGS soon follow.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: George! You’re next!
text: Victoria helps Crazy George to his feet. They stagger
dialog: forward.
text: POV Crazy George: as he wades through the water toward Frank,
text: his world starts to SPIN. Vertigo assaults his senses. He
text: lurches toward the edge of the falls.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Frank...I...
text: His world continues to kaleidoscope until...SPLASH! Crazy
text: George faceplants the water and is washed toward the edge of
text: the falls. Victoria is dragged into the water with him.
speaker_heading: CARL (POINTING)
dialog: Frank!
text: Frank leaps into the water. As Crazy George sweeps by, Frank
text: grabs him and heaves him toward a BOULDER midstream. Crazy
text: George clings weakly to the boulder as Frank flashes his
text: light around, looking for Victoria.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Over there!
text: Victoria is clinging to a rock at the edge of the falls,
text: buffeted by the cascade of water. Frank wades out toward her,
text: bracing himself against the ferocious flow. He manages to
text: grab her SAFETY ROPE, just as her grip gives way.
text: Victoria disappears over the edge of the falls. She hangs
text: inverted from her harness, engulfed by the torrent of water
text: that pounds her against the rock. Frank struggles to keep
text: hold of her safety rope.
speaker_heading: Curt TO:
dialog: 85
text: At the bottom of the falls, Josh is about to unclip the
text: REBREATHERS from the rope when he hears Victoria SCREAM. Josh
text: races back up the waterfall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank is slowly being dragged over the edge of the falls, his
text: hands and feet scrambling to find purchase. Carl releases the
text: ZIP LINE and staggers over to help them.
speaker_heading: FRANK (TO CARL)
dialog: No! Stay on the rope!
text: Carl turns back but it’s too late. TWANG! The ZIP LINE
text: whiplashes through the ANCHOR BOLT and disappears downstream.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Josh is climbing the waterfall below Victoria when he sees
text: the ZIP LINE suddenly go limp. A glance downstream confirms
text: his worst fear: the two REBREATHERS clipped to the end of the
text: rope are being washed away. A shout from above.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: Josh! Grab the rope! We’re losing
dialog: the equipment!
text: Josh spots the rope in the pool below him. It’s slowly being
text: washed downstream. Josh glances up at Victoria, still hanging
text: inverted fifty feet above him. He deliberates: does he help
dialog: Victoria or save the equipment?
text: Josh makes his decision. He continues to climb up toward
dialog: Victoria.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank CURSES in despair as both REBREATHERS disappear
dialog: downstream.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Josh! Goddamn it!
dialog: cut TO:
text: POV Victoria: Through the savage jets of water, she can see
text: Josh’s light approaching from below. She manages to pull her
text: head out of the ferocious flow and into an airspace behind
text: the waterfall. Gasping for breath, she calls down to Josh.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (HALF DROWNING)
dialog: Josh..! No!...!
dialog: 86
text: Josh draws level with Victoria. He edges his way toward her,
text: clinging perilously to a narrow ledge behind the falls. Water
text: pounds his body. His foot slips and he only just manages to
text: save himself. Josh glances down fearfully at the rocks, fifty
text: feet below him.
text: Victoria pulls her head back up toward Frank, COUGHING and
text: SPLUTTERING as the water pounds her face.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (PLEADING)
dialog: Frank! Let me go!
text: Frank gazes down at Victoria, a cold look on his face. Carl’s
text: grip tightens on the rope.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No! We have to save her!
text: Victoria SCREAMS at the top of her lungs as she sees Josh’s
text: light edging it’s way toward her. Frank spots it too.
speaker_heading: VICTORIA (TO FRANK)
dialog: Y...got to....et me go, Frank!
dialog: You’ll...lose us both!
text: TIGHT on Frank as he coldly accepts her decision.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Victoria swings her head back into the airspace behind the
text: falls. Josh has reached the point of no return. He’s reaching
text: precariously toward Victoria. Eye contact is made.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: G-Give me your hand!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank releases the rope. It is violently ripped from Carl's
text: hands and disappears over the falls.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Josh is left staring at the space where Victoria used to be.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nooocoooce!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Victoria plunges 50 feet into the 'washing machine', a
text: ROARING cascade below the falls. Buffeted from all sides, she
text: is unceremoniously spat over the second waterfall.
dialog: 87
text: BLAM! She hits the water hard and is immediately dragged down
text: by the cascade of water. CRACK! Her head dashes against a
text: rock below the surface. Blood clouds the water.
text: BADOOSH! Victoria is thrown over the second waterfall and
text: dragged below again.
text: Beneath the water, Victoria struggles weakly toward the
text: surface but cannot move. Looking down, she sees her SAFETY
text: ROPE has jammed between two rocks, trapping her underwater.
text: A wave of euphoria washes over her as her hypoxic brain
text: starts to shut down. Victoria desperately tugs on the rope,
text: weaker and weaker until... BLIP! A final cloud of bubbles is
dialog: exhaled.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Josh is slipping and sliding his way back down the rocks
text: toward the bottom of the falls.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Victoria! Victoria!
text: He reaches the final 30ft drop. His flashlight reflects off
text: Victoria's body beneath the surface. There is no quick way
dialog: down.
text: SPLOOSH! Josh leaps off the cliff into the pool below. His
text: light flicks through the water to reveal Victoria’s lifeless
text: body floating a few feet away.
text: She is suspended in mid-water, hanging by her safety rope.
text: Josh tries to swim toward him but the current is too strong.
text: He claws his way across the bottom, RAGING in anger and
text: frustration. With a CRY of despair, Josh is forced to
text: release himself. He floats back to the surface.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A DREAM-LIKE SEQUENCE as the team react to Victoria’s death:
text: Carl is hysterical. Sobbing uncontrollably. Punching the
text: water in anger and frustration and CURSING Frank.
text: Crazy George looks utterly defeated. He crawls weakly to the
text: edge of the river and collapses next to Frank.
text: Frank gazes down at Josh from the top of the falls.
dialog: 88
text: Josh drags himself out of the water and clings to a rock,
text: GASPING for breath. He stares up at his father. A murderous

scene_heading: INT. RIVER RAPIDS
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as the team stumble their way downstream,
text: following the raging river.
text: Frank leads the way. A grim look on his face as he navigates
text: the best way downstream. He is wearing the last remaining
scene_heading: REBREATHER.
text: Carl flashes his light back toward Crazy George and Josh. He
text: considers returning to help them, but is too exhausted. He
text: staggers downstream past Frank, his face set in stone.
text: Crazy George is in a bad way. Josh has to support him as he
text: stumbles across the rocks. Frank waits for them.
text: Frank helps drag Crazy George across a set of rapids. He
text: reaches back to offer Josh a helping hand. Josh refuses. A
text: moment of tension as they confront each other. Josh pushes
text: past him, into the darkness.
text: Four lights, continuing steadily downstream until finally...
scene_heading: INT. SUMP BELOW CHIMNEY
text: The tunnel ends abruptly at another sump: a shallow pool
text: where the river disappears beneath a cliff. A small entrance
text: beneath the surface marks the continuation of the underwater
text: cave. The team wearily pull themselves out of the water and
text: crawl up the muddy shoreline.
text: Everyone is physically and emotionally exhausted. A depressed
text: silence engulfs the group. Josh gently eases Crazy George to
text: the floor. Crazy George curls himself up in a ball, feverish
text: and MOANING in pain. Josh lifts his head clear of the mud.
speaker_heading: JOSH (ANGRY TO FRANK)
dialog: He can’t go any further. He needs
dialog: oxygen, Goddamn it!
text: Frank lifts the REBREATHER off his back and shoots Josh an
text: accusing look.
dialog: 89
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I already told you. This is all we
dialog: have left. Now.
speaker_heading: JOSH (BRISTLING)
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (beat) It means, we need it to get
dialog: out.
text: Frank flashes his light around. A dry tunnel leads upwards.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Up there. We’ll be safe up there.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: From what? A nuclear fucking
dialog: attack?
speaker_heading: CARL (EXCITED)
dialog: Over here!
text: Frank staggers forward. Carl's light has revealed several
text: FOOTPRINTS in the entrance to the tunnel. Carl begins to SOB
text: with relief and excitement.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Footprints! This must be the way
dialog: out!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: A-Are you sure?
text: Carl races back and starts shaking Josh.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We're getting out of here! You
dialog: hear? We’re gonna live!
text: Carl staggers drunkenly back up into the tunnel.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Oh thank-you. Thank-you Jesus thank-
dialog: you, thank-you, thank-you...
text: Frank continues to examine the footprints, a grim look on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: JOSH (TO FRANK)
dialog: You look disappointed. Pissed off
dialog: someone beat you to it?
dialog: 90
text: Frank glares at Josh. Then turns his attention to Crazy
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Help me get him somewhere dry.
text: Frank hauls Crazy George to his feet. He gazes at Frank ina
text: half-conscious daze.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: S-Sorry to be such a b-burden,
dialog: Frank.
text: Frank smiles sadly at his old friend.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY
text: Frank and Josh drag Crazy George up the narrow tunnel. The
text: river has become a DISTANT ROAR below them. They stagger out
text: of the tunnel and emerge inside a tall, dry, chimney-like
dialog: room.
text: Carl is kneeling in the center of the Chimney. Josh staggers
text: forward, flashing his light around the walls.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Don’t bother. There’s no way out.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: How can you be sure?
text: Carl directs the beam of his light toward the back of the
dialog: cave.
text: Josh reels in horror: The skeletal remains of TWO DIVERS lay
text: on the floor, their bones held together by their WETSUITS.
text: The bodies are arranged to suggest a violent struggle took
text: place. DRIED BLOOD stains the wall and floor. One of the
text: diver’s skulls has been SMASHED apart by the others STAGE
speaker_heading: CYLINDER.
speaker_heading: JOSH (HORRIFIED WHISPER)
text: The missing divers.
speaker_heading: CARL (RESIGNED)
dialog: We’re all going to fucking die.
dialog: 91
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY
text: Frank is on the far side of the cavern, busy checking over
text: the remaining REBREATHER. His FLASHLIGHT casts ghostly
text: shadows over the cavern walls.
text: Crazy George lays in Josh's arms, MOANING in a feverish
text: sleep. Carl glances down at his cracked TAG HEUER DIVE WATCH.
text: Broken now.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why’d you keep looking at that?
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I’m wondering when it stopped.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It's been four days now. It'll just
dialog: be getting dark outside.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I should be flying home right now.
text: Josh and Carl hear the faint wisps of COLERIDGE echoing
text: around the cave.
speaker_heading: CARL (URGENT WHISPER)
dialog: He's out of his mind, Josh.
dialog: Just listen to him. We should
dialog: have checked out those
dialog: tunnels. We could have been
dialog: out of here by now, instead
dialog: of being forced on some
dialog: suicide mission...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He’s convinced there’s dry
text: cave on the other side of the
dialog: sump.
speaker_heading: CARL (SNEERING)
dialog: Yeah? Well buddy-breathing
dialog: through, two at a time is
dialog: insane.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You got a better plan? (beat)
dialog: We can make it. If it’s not

dialog: 92
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: And what if there is no air pocket,
dialog: Josh? What then?
text: Josh glances toward the macabre SKELETONS. And shudders.
text: TIGHT on Carl: he can't take his eyes off the remaining
scene_heading: REBREATHER.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY - NEXT MORNING
text: Frank sleeps, tucked inside a rocky crevasse. He looks like
text: he’s part of the cave walls. Josh shakes him awake, a
text: concerned look on his face.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: INT. SUMP BELOW CHIMNEY
text: Frank and Josh stand by the water. The last REBREATHER is
text: missing. No sign of Carl.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Son of a bitch!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Maybe he's scouting ahead?
text: Frank flashes him a look.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: The tunnel could choke? Then he’d
dialog: have to head back.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Either way, we lose.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What are we going to do?
text: Frank gazes around the cave. Then marches back up to Chimney.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We find another way out.
dialog: 93
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY
text: Frank sits in a depressed trance, CLICKING his fading
text: FLASHLIGHT on and off repeatedly as he stares at the SKELETAL
text: REMAINS of the two divers.
text: Josh watches him from a distance as he tends to Crazy George.
text: Crazy George’s condition has worsened overnight. He lays in
text: Josh's arms, barely conscious.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (DELIRIOUS)
dialog: F-Frank?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It's Josh.
text: Crazy George suddenly starts to CRY.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: I-I can’t move my legs anymore.
text: Josh says nothing. He glances over at his father.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Suddenly, Frank's eyes narrow as he notices something unusual
text: about the SKELETONS. Scrambling like a crab, he clambers over
text: the rocks to investigate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Josh scrutinizes Frank's unusual behavior from a distance.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SCARED WHISPER)
dialog: L-Luko was here. Last night. I
dialog: reckon he came for me, Josh...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Don’t talk like that. Try and rest.
text: Crazy George suddenly grabs Josh.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Don’t let them...come for me, Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (TERRIFIED)
dialog: Them...
dialog: 94
text: Crazy George points into the dark. Macabre shadows dance
text: across the walls. Sinister shapes Josh's imagination prefers
text: to ignore. Josh shudders.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nothing’s going to hurt you. I
dialog: promise.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Crouching down, Frank examines a curious DARK STAIN on one of
text: the SKULLS. His fingers come away dirty. He SNIFFS his
text: fingers and casts his beam toward the ceiling.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Crazy George lapses into unconsciousness. Josh checks to see
text: he is still breathing, struggling to fight back his tears.
text: Suddenly, Frank looms over him, a manic look on his face. He
text: throws the SKULL down into Josh’s lap. Josh jumps.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INTENSE)
text: A Samurai prepares himself each day
dialog: for his own death. That’s what
text: makes him invincible.
text: Josh gazes up at him, a worried expression on his face. Frank
text: suddenly grins at him.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: c'mon. We're getting out of here.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: H-How?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We'll float up through the ceiling.
text: Josh suddenly looks scared. His father is clearly insane.
text: Frank wipes the DARK STAIN off the skull with his finger and
text: waves it in front of Josh's face. Josh wrinkles his nose.
speaker_heading: JOSH (DISGUSTED)
dialog: What the fuck is that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Bat guano. Follow me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Frank and Josh focus their beams high on the ceiling of
speaker_heading: CHIMNEY.
dialog: 95
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You're saying there’s a tunnel up
dialog: there?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah. Trust me.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: We lost all the vertical gear. How
dialog: are we going to climb up?
text: Frank hands Josh a large BOULDER from the floor of the cave.
text: Then grabs one for himself.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We don’t climb. We float.
scene_heading: INT. SUMP BELOW CHIMNEY
text: Frank and Josh carry the boulders down toward the sump.
text: BADOOSH! Frank heaves his boulder into the water and watches
text: it sink toward the entrance of the underwater tunnel.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You're going to dam the river?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We'll flood the cavern. The water
dialog: will carry us right up to the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: That‘ll take forever!
text: Frank is already on his way back up to Chimney.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You got something better to do?
text: SPLOSH! Josh throws his rock into the water and reluctantly
text: trudges after his father.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: VARIOUS SHOTS as Frank and Josh carry rock after rock down
text: toward the river. It's backbreaking work.
text: Josh seems determined to select bigger rocks than Frank.
text: WETSUITS are removed as the sweat starts to pour down their
dialog: bodies.
dialog: 96
text: Josh crawls over to check Crazy George’s condition.
text: Frank collapses at the edge of the sump and starts GULPING
text: down the muddy water like a parched beast. Josh gazes down at
text: him in revulsion.
text: Frank gazes guiltily at Crazy George as he staggers past him:
text: but he’s too focussed on the task at hand to stop.
text: Frank and Josh are soon caked in mud. They look like primal
text: beings, barely human.
text: Josh starts GULPING down the muddy water along with his
dialog: father.
text: The pile of rocks continues to grown until...
text: SPLOSH! Josh tosses the last rock in place and collapses into
text: the mud next to Frank. A massive pile of boulders now seals
text: the underwater cave.
speaker_heading: FRANK (GRIM SATISFACTION)
dialog: It’s working.
text: Frank shines his fading beam toward the shoreline. The water
text: is already creeping up toward them. Josh rolls over onto his
text: back and WHOOPS for joy.
speaker_heading: JOSH (LAUGHING)
dialog: Not bad. (beat) For an old man.
text: Frank's face almost cracks a smile. Almost. Frank offers Josh
text: a shaky handshake. Josh is about to grasp his hand when...
text: BADOOSH! The river SMASHES it's way through the dam,
text: scattering their efforts downstream. Josh gazes in horror as
text: his world collapses.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No. Nononononononono!
text: Josh sags to the floor and starts to SOB. He's finally
text: reached his breaking point. Frank gazes at the cave walls, a
text: resigned look on his face. Suddenly he bursts into HYSTERICAL
text: LAUGHTER. Josh explodes into a fierce rage.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Goddamn you! You made me believe!
text: Josh starts hurling rock after rock at the uncaring cave
text: walls. Frank can’t stop laughing. Josh starts throwing stones
text: at him instead. It only makes Frank laugh more.
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You...made...me...believe!
text: Josh collapses onto the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Frank
text: eventually calms down. He approaches his son, wiping the
text: tears from his eyes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: C'mon, get up.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why did I ever listen to you? Why?
dialog: We're never getting out of here.
dialog: Why can't you just admit that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We are getting out of here.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No we're not! And that's okay! We
dialog: fucking tried! We gave it our best
dialog: shot!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Quit whining. Engage rational
dialog: thought.
scene_heading: JOSH (FINALLY LOSING IT)
dialog: Fuck you!
text: Josh hurls another rock at Frank. This time he really means
text: business. Frank ducks as the rock SMASHES against the wall.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Fuck you, fuck Carl and FUCK THIS
speaker_heading: GODDAMN CAVE!
dialog: (screaming)
text: FUCK IT! FUCK-IT-ALL!!!
text: Josh rolls onto his back and lies there GASPING for breath.
text: Frank watches him dispassionately.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Finished?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Just let me die. That's all I want.
dialog: Just let me die.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We don’t have time.
dialog: 98
text: Frank disappears into the darkness, leaving Josh in the mud.
text: After a few moments, Josh starts CRYING. Great wracking SOBS
text: shudder through his body, leaving him a quivering mess,
text: devoid of all humanity. Josh closes his eyes.
dialog: cur TO:
text: Josh open his eyes. They are caked in mud, tears and sweat.
text: He sits up and gazes around him, unsure of his surroundings.
text: His vision blurs as a DIM LIGHT falls across his face. He
text: watches the light approach. Holds out his hand in fear.
speaker_heading: JOSH (TERRIFIED)
dialog: L-Luko?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You ain't dead yet.
text: It's Frank. Carrying a rock toward the water. SPLOSH! Frank
text: heaves the rock into the sump and turns back toward Chimney.
text: Josh can see a fresh pile of rocks in the bottom of the sump:
text: Frank has been busy rebuilding the dam.
text: Josh staggers to his feet. His vision WHIRLS as he staggers
text: after his father. He’s in a state of nervous exhaustion.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A HALLUCINOGENIC NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE as Josh helps Frank re-
text: build the dam. The COLERIDGE POEM repeats itself over and
text: over, laying siege to Josh’s mind.
scene_heading: JOSH{ INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: In Xanadu...did Kubla Khan...a
dialog: stately pleasure dome
dialog: decree...where Alph...the sacred
text: river ran...down to a sunless
dialog: sea...
text: The tunnel WHIRLS in and out of focus as he carries each rock
text: down to the sump.
text: POV Josh: the rock TRANSFORMS into a SCHOOL BOOK: “DAD‘S
text: DIVE” by Josh Mcguire aged seven. A hand-drawn picture of a
text: diver, with Frank's NOTES scribbled in the margin.
text: The COLERIDGE POEM becomes an annoying nursery rhyme,
text: building in intensity over the following...
text: Frank gazes up at Josh. Josh lifts the rock and SMASHES it
text: into Frank's face. SPLOSH! The water shatters as Frank’s
text: reflection disappears.
dialog: 99
text: Luko’s reflection appears in its place. Then Victoria’s. They
text: are both SCREAMING as they drown. Josh reaches for them just
speaker_heading: ASwee
text: Frank's reflection returns. He reaches toward Josh.
text: FLASHBACK to 25 YEAR-OLD FRANK, dressed in shorts and a
text: t-shirt, picking up 5 YEAR-OLD JOSH and playing “AIR-GUITAR”
text: with him while an AC-DC TUNE blasts in the background.
text: Frank spins Josh around and around in the brilliant sunshine.
text: They are in their back garden. Josh is LAUGHING as they spin
text: faster and faster. Josh’s MUM (20's) can be seen in the
text: background, barbecuing. Her eyes are filled with love. Then
text: concern. She’s pointing into Josh's PADDLING POOL.
text: Luko and Victoria's lifeless bodies float below the surface.
text: The young Frank suddenly starts SHAKING Josh like a rag doll.
text: His face a mask of ANGER. Suddenly, his face transforms into
text: the DEATH MASK worn by the Shaman. Josh starts to SCREAM
dialog: as...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: REAL TIME: Frank shakes Josh awake.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ..ear what I said? We've got to get
dialog: out of here. Now!
text: Josh blinks and gazes around him. He’s standing in waist-deep
text: water. The light from their FLASHLIGHTS has dimmed
text: considerably: the batteries are almost dead.
text: The dam is completed. The water level has already risen
text: several feet and is working its way into the Chimney tunnel.
text: Josh and Frank are unrecognizable: covered from head to foot
text: in mud, their fingers and faces cut and bloody.
text: They collapse into each others arms, sharing a significant
text: moment of accomplishment and achievement.
text: Then they stagger back up toward Chimney.
scene_heading: INT. CHIMNEY
text: Crazy George sits slumped against the far wall, his head
text: resting against his chest. Josh races toward him and
text: excitedly shakes him awake.
dialog: 100
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: George! We have to go now...
text: Josh freezes. His hand comes away covered in blood. George's
text: eyes flutter open.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (BARELY AUDIBLE)
dialog: So c-c-cold...so v-very cold.
text: Josh lifts Crazy George's arm. His DIVE KNIFE clatters to the
text: floor. Josh realizes in horror that he's used the blade to
text: open his own wrists.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What have you done? We were getting
dialog: out of here! What have you done!
text: Frank races over. He coldly asses the situation.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE
dialog: Reckon I’‘d s-save you the trouble,
dialog: F-Frank.
text: Frank nods and kneels next to his friend, holding his hand.
speaker_heading: CRAZY GEORGE (SMILING)
dialog: Don't look so...sad, Josh...You
dialog: can'’t...get buried...deeper...
text: The sentence hangs in the air. Crazy George is dead.
text: A ROAR of water. Frank turns and flashes his light towards
text: the tunnel. The river is already pouring into the chimney. In
text: seconds they are waist deep.
text: Josh and Frank stand in silence and watch Crazy George’s body
text: disappear beneath the water.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: You have no control over this.
dialog: Accept it.
text: Frank and Josh stare long and hard at each other as the water
text: continues to rise.
text: Then Frank starts grabbing their remaining items of DIVE
scene_heading: EQUIPMENT: MASKS, FINS.
text: A wave of water hits them. They start spinning around the
text: cavern, carried higher up the walls.
text: The ceiling suddenly looms close: sure enough, a small exit
text: tunnel can be seen above their heads.
dialog: 101
text: Frank reaches up and makes a grab for the ceiling. He can’t
text: reach. He tries again. Fails.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s no good. I-I can’t reach it.
text: Suddenly, Frank’s FLASHLIGHT flickers and dies.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Pass me your light!
text: As Josh passes Frank the final FLASHLIGHT, Frank’s eyes
text: narrow in concern. The dull beam reveals a black TIDAL MARK
text: around the walls of the chimney, left by the falling water.
speaker_heading: FRANK (SCARED WHISPER)
text: The dam’s giving way.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: H-How can you tell?
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Tidal mark. The water’s dropping.
text: The same thought crosses their minds at the same time: they
text: reach up toward the ceiling. It’s already further away.
text: Suddenly, a grotesque GURGLING SOUND fills the air. In the
text: center of the Chimney, a mass of floating debris suddenly
text: starts to spin.
text: Josh sees it too: a BLACK WHIRLPOOL is steadily forming
text: around them as the water subsides.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Quickly!
text: Josh swims over to Frank, who wedges himself into a crack in
text: the cave wall. Josh clambers up onto his father’s body and
text: manages to grab an outcrop of rock on the ceiling.
text: Clinging to the ceiling like Spiderman, Josh inches his way
text: across the roof and up into the escape tunnel. He reaches
text: down toward his father. Frank is already fighting to stay
text: afloat as the whirlpool spins him around the cavern.
text: Josh goes to grab his father. Misses. Grabs again. Just
text: manages to clutch his hand. Neither of them speak. A simple
text: look indicates the sudden shift of power.
text: Josh hauls his father up out of the water. They gaze down as
text: the water in the chimney gets NOISILY flushed away.
dialog: 102
text: Then their final FLASHLIGHT flickers out. Total darkness. A
text: long unbearable silence.
speaker_heading: FRANK (DEADPAN)
dialog: Christ. It’s blacker than the
text: inside of a dog.
text: After a few seconds, Josh starts to CHUCKLE at Frank’s line.
text: Then he LAUGHS out loud. This causes Frank to burst out
text: LAUGHING. Their hysterical gales of laughter fill the cave,
text: ECHOING off the walls.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT: BATS BELFRY ENTRANCE TUNNEL
text: TIGHT on Josh’s face as he crawls along a narrow tunnel. The
text: only light now comes from his cheap INDIGLO DIVE WATCH. Josh
text: pauses and points his watch back down the tunnel. Frank’s
text: face eventually appears in the dim BLUE GLOW.
speaker_heading: JOSH (PANTING)
dialog: We...we can...rest here. There's
dialog: not much battery left...
text: Frank nods understanding. The light snaps out. Suddenly, we
text: hear Frank SNIFFING the air.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fresh air!
text: After a few seconds, Josh realizes he can dimly see his
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Is that...daylight?
text: The sound of them both SCRABBLING forward in the dark.
text: GLIMPSES of elbows, hands, then their faces appear, as the
text: light in the tunnel grows steadily brighter.
scene_heading: INT. BAT'S BELFRY.
text: Josh reaches a small body tube in the cave wall. Dim light
text: can be seen through the tunnel. Josh SHIVERS in delight as a
text: gust of wind HOWLS through the hole, ruffling his hair. Josh
text: closes his eyes and INHALES deeply. He smiles at his Father.
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: After you, son...
text: Josh crawls into the hole.
scene_heading: INT. BAT'S BELFRY - DAY
text: Josh pulls himself out of the body tube and gazes in
dialog: disbelief.
text: An enormous dome-shaped cavern, the size of an Olympic
text: stadium. Sunlight pours in through a skylight in the ceiling,
text: 200 feet above their heads. A tantalizing glimpse of blue sky
text: as the Godly shafts of light pierce the gloom. Swallows and
text: bats SWOOP around Josh, dancing in and out of the sunlight.
text: Josh flashes his light around the walls and ceiling: they are
text: sheer, smooth and impossible to climb.
speaker_heading: JOSH (DEVASTATED)
dialog: There’‘s no way out.
text: Frank appears next to him. He notices Josh’s expression of
text: bitter disappointment.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: C'mon. Let’s check out the other
dialog: side.
text: They stumble forward into the light.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Josh and Frank scramble up the pile of debris that’s formed
text: directly below the skylight. As they clear the top they
dialog: freeze:
text: A M4-A2 SHERMAN TANK lays at the bottom of the slope, resting
text: on its side. It’s covered in 60 years of bat guano but
text: otherwise it’s perfectly intact.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Now there’s something you don’t see
dialog: every day.
text: They scramble down to investigate.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There was a tank battalion
dialog: stationed here during the
dialog: war.(beat) We must be close to the
dialog: ocean.
dialog: 104
text: Josh glances up at the skylight far above them.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Christ. D’'you think anyone survived
dialog: the fall?
text: Frank HEAVES open the turret hatch. The SKELETAL REMAINS of a
text: crew member falls out. The SKULL rolls toward Josh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Guess not.
text: Frank reaches inside the tank and pulls out a pack of
text: S-RATIONS. He throws the pack to Josh with a big grin on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hungry?
speaker_heading: cuT TO:
text: A ROARING FIRE burns brightly in the center of the cavern,
text: illuminating the walls and casting a cheery glow. Frank
text: douses another FALLEN BRANCH with gasoline from the Tank’s
text: JERRY CAN and hurls it onto the flames. WHOOMPTH!
text: Josh sits on top of the tank, wolfing down a bar of
text: CHOCOLATE. He SIGHS at the indescribable pleasure of each
text: mouthful as he basks in the heat from the fire.
speaker_heading: JOSH (MOUTH FULL)
dialog: This. Is. Fucking. Amazing.
text: Josh glances up at the skylight. Billowing smoke rises up
text: into the blue sky.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You think someone will see us?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hope can be a dangerous thing. We
dialog: find our own way out.
text: Josh gazes at the cave walls.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: It's almost like it’s teasing us.
speaker_heading: PRANK
dialog: Caves do that.
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah? This one’s really starting to
dialog: take the piss.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't take it personally. We’re
dialog: here, now. And that’s all that
dialog: matters. Until we accept that,
dialog: we're never getting out of here.
scene_heading: INT. BAT‘’S BELFRY - NIGHT
text: Darkness. A dim BLUE LIGHT bathes Josh’s face. He snaps awake
text: and gazes around him, a confused look on his face.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: D-Dad?

dialog: What?
text: Josh spots the STARS and MOON shining down through the
text: skylight.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Nothing. Just checking.
text: Josh gazes up at the stars. After a while he closes his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. SHINGLE SLOPE. BAT’S BELFRY - DAY
text: Josh’s improvised TORCH splits the darkness. Narrow strips of
text: uniform, soaked in gasoline and wrapped around a RIFLE BUTT.
text: Josh is searching the shadows at the far side of the cavern.
text: Frank’s torch can be seen in the distance. Early morning
text: sunlight pours down through the skylight. Josh arrives at the
text: bottom of a steep shingle slope and scrambles up to
dialog: investigate.
scene_heading: INT. BELFRY EXIT TUNNEL
text: At the top of the slope, Josh finds a small tunnel in the
text: cavern wall. It leads steadily downwards.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Dad! Over here!
dialog: 106
scene_heading: INT. BODY TUBES
text: The tunnel soon narrows. Sweat beads Josh’s brow as he
text: squeezes his way down the tight body tube. The torch SINGES
text: his hair and almost burns his face.
text: Josh turns back toward his father. Frank is crawling through
text: the tunnel a few feet behind him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Listen!
scene_heading: INT. CONNECTING SUMP.
text: The sound of RUNNING WATER. Josh's head pops out of a small
text: hole in the ceiling of a medium-sized cavern. He throws his
text: torch to the floor before gracefully easing himself down.
text: Josh stands on the shoreline of a small lake. The river
text: GUSHES out of the deep pool and disappears down a half-
text: flooded tunnel. Josh eagerly starts exploring the room while
text: Frank struggles to get down from the hole.
text: CRUMP! Frank enters the room far less gracefully than Josh.
text: Josh’s torch reflects off an object laying on the muddy
text: shore: Carl's REBREATHER. Josh bends down to inspect it. Both
text: GAUGES read “EMPTY”.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Carl's.
text: Frank nods grimly. Shining their torches ahead of them, they
text: cautiously enter the tunnel.
scene_heading: INT. DEBRIS TUNNEL
text: Josh and Frank wade through the waist deep water, following
text: the sluggish river. Their torches reflect against the
text: obsidian black walls.
text: Josh wrinkles his nose in disgust. Floating in the water
text: around them are dozens of DROWNED RATS. Josh pushes them
text: aside and continues onward.
text: The tunnel becomes filled with debris that has been washed
text: down by the river: TREE BRANCHES, VEGETATION and the rotting
text: carcasses of several DEAD ANIMALS. Josh starts recognizing
text: REBREATHER PARTS and DIVE EQUIPMENT, smashed and broken along
text: the rocks lining the tunnel.
dialog: 107
scene_heading: INT. DANTE’S NIGHTMARE
text: Rounding a corner, the tunnel ends abruptly in a small room
text: filled with half-submerged rocks. The rocks act as a drain:
text: collecting any debris that’s been flushed into the cave. Josh
text: covers his nose and fights the urge to retch: the stinking
text: effluent has formed a festering lake. A MOAN in the darkness
text: causes them to spin around.
text: Cari sits SHIVERING in the darkness. He is almost
text: unrecognizable: his face is covered in blood, mud and
text: bruises. Madness rages in his eyes as he raises his hands to
text: protect himself from the harsh glare of their torches.
text: Half-eaten RAT CARCASSES litter the shoreline around him. A
text: pile of dead FLASHLIGHTS lay discarded at his side. Carl
text: staggers toward them, as if in a drunken stupor.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Y-You came for me. I-I knew you
dialog: would...
text: Carl lifts his hand toward the torch and caresses the flame.
speaker_heading: CARL (HYPNOTISED )
dialog: So..-beautiful. Beyond price. I’d
dialog: have given...anything. Everything.
dialog: Just to see again.
text: Josh pulls the flame away from him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: H-How long have I been in the dark?
dialog: A week? A month?
text: Frank and Josh exchange a glance.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You left us three days ago.
text: Carl's face registers confusion. Then fear. He slumps to the
text: floor and starts to CRY.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You...have to help me. We have
dialog: to...-help each other...help each
dialog: other get out of here...
text: Carl grabs Josh’s leg. Frank observes, stony-faced.
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I only went to...scout ahead, Josh.
dialog: I was...going to come back for you.
dialog: But the current was...too strong.
text: Josh kicks Carl away from him.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You...-you have to believe me. Ask
dialog: the others...if you don’t believe
dialog: me...ask the others...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What others?
speaker_heading: CARL (MANIC WHISPER)
dialog: Them!
text: Carl backs up against the cave wall, SHIVERING in fear. He
text: casts a terrified glance toward the far side of the cavern.
speaker_heading: CARL (TERRIFIED)
dialog: They're here...All of them...
text: Following Carl’s gaze, Josh and Frank shine their torches
text: into the dark reaches of the chamber.
text: It’s a scene from Dante’s own nightmare.
text: Scattered among the debris are the hideously mangled remains
dialog: of Judes, Luko, Crazy George and Victoria.
text: The river has pummeled them into a twisted mass of skin and
text: bone. Their lifeless eyes stare accusingly at them. Carl lies
text: in the mud, ranting at the darkness
scene_heading: CARL (MUTTERING INCOHERENTLY )
dialog: Now...we’re all here, I should
dialog: call....the office...
text: Frank ignores Carl. He wades toward Judes and starts tearing
text: her REBREATHER apart, so he can salvage both her CYLINDERS.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Tell...Tell them we're delayed. You
dialog: brought the phone with you? I have
dialog: a meeting in just over an hour. We
dialog: should arrange a press conference?
dialog: Send photos...
text: Frank coldly sifts through Judes DIVE RIG. He finds four
text: CYLUME CHEMICAL LIGHT STICKS, tucked behind her WRIST SLATE.
dialog: 109
text: He coldly reads the words he had written onto her slate:
text: “TRUST ME!”. Frank throws the LIGHT STICKS over to Josh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: C'mon. We're getting out of here.
text: Carl crawls over to Josh and grabs his hand.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Take...take me with you. Please.
text: Josh pulls his hand away..
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You are not to leave me here! I
dialog: demand you take me with you!
text: Josh and Frank cast a final glance down at Carl. They look at
text: each other. Then turn and walk down the tunnel.
speaker_heading: CARL (0.S.)
dialog: Josh! Josh!
scene_heading: INT. CONNECTING SUMP
text: Frank and Josh are kneeling by the shoreline, fitting Judes
text: cylinders into the REBREATHER.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I reckon we're only a couple of
dialog: miles from the ocean...
text: Frank nods toward the water.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We can buddy breathe through the
dialog: sump. Follow the river. That will
dialog: lead us out...
text: Suddenly, a strange look crosses Frank’s face. He glances
text: down in confusion and fear.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh...fuck...
text: Josh reels back in horror. The tip of a DIVE KNIFE is
text: sticking out of Frank's ribcage. Frank slumps to the floor.
text: Carl kneels behind Frank holding the bloodied knife. He lifts
text: it toward Josh’s throat.
dialog: 110
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Give me those fucking lights...
text: Carl grabs the CYLUME LIGHT STICKS off Josh.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We...we can still get out of
dialog: here...alive, Josh. You and me. Now
dialog: we have these...I want you to
dialog: fit....fit the oxygen tank...
text: Josh stares down at his father’s body in shock. Carl pushes
text: the knife hard against Josh’s throat. A sliver of BLOOD
text: appears.
speaker_heading: CARL (SCREAMING)
dialog: DO IT!
text: Josh nods obediently. He reaches down and grabs the OXYGEN
text: CYLINDER. Lifts it into the REBREATHER.
speaker_heading: CARL (A GLANCE AT FRANK)
dialog: That...son of a bitch...had it
dialog: coming, Josh. He’d have...killed us
dialog: all. Even you. You realize
dialog: that...don’t you? I was acting
dialog: in...self defense...
text: Josh slowly nods in agreement.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Life’s...not a dress rehearsal,
dialog: Josh. Sometimes...you...you have
dialog: to...
text: Suddenly, Frank MOANS. Carl’s eyes narrow in concern. He
text: lifts the BURNING TORCH to take a closer look.
speaker_heading: JOSH (COLD)
dialog: Seize the day?
text: Josh cracks open the OXYGEN CYLINDER VALVE.
text: WHOOOMPH! A SHEET OF FLAME engulfs Carl. Carl is on fire. He
text: reels backwards SCREAMING in pain.
text: Carl flails around the cavern floor in agony, his skin
text: blistering.
text: FSHHHHHH! A cloud of steam as Carl rolls into the sump to
text: douse the flames. Carl surfaces, gazing around in fear and
dialog: confusion just as...
dialog: 111
text: BADOOSH! Josh leaps onto him in a primal, brutal fury.
text: VARIOUS QUICK CUTS as they roll through the muddy water,
text: reduced to animals in pure, savage survival mode.
text: Biting. Clawing. Gouging. It's ugly. Visceral. Almost
dialog: unbearable to watch.
text: Carl sees the DIVE KNIFE laying in the mud where he dropped
text: it. He crawls toward it. Josh drags him deeper back into the
dialog: sump.
text: Carl SCREAMS in fear, clawing the mud. He KICKS Josh in the
text: head. Josh releases him.
text: Carl grabs Josh by the throat and forces his head under the
dialog: water.
text: SMACK! Josh’s knee thuds up into Carl’s ribcage, winding him.
text: Carl slumps into the water, GASPING for breath. He turns
dialog: around just as...
text: CRACK! Josh smacks Carl in the face with the rock. Carl drops
text: to the floor.
text: Josh SCREAMS in rage as he leaps onto Carl and starts
text: pounding his head with the rock.
speaker_heading: JOSH
scene_heading: PUT...YOUR..-FUCKING...NAME...ON...-
speaker_heading: THIS!
text: Suddenly, blood spatters Josh’s face. Josh gazes down in
text: horror and drops the rock. He collapses to the ground and
text: crawls through the mud to check if Frank is still breathing.
text: Josh starts RESCUE BREATHING. Frank's gaping chest wound
text: HISSES noisily with each breath. Frank eventually COUGHS up
text: blood and opens his eyes. Gritting his teeth in pain, he
text: reaches toward Josh.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The-the rebreather?
text: Josh glances toward the sump. The REBREATHER is smouldering
text: by the water’s edge: the oxygen cylinder still on fire. Josh
text: shakes his head sadly.
text: Frank MOANS in despair and pain. Josh uses the knife to cut a
text: strip from his WETSUIT. He starts padding Frank's wound.
text: Frank gazes toward Carl’s unconscious body.
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: FRANK (IN PAIN)
dialog: Is he...dead?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I-I don’t think so.
text: Frank suddenly grips Josh’s hand and looks him dead in the
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Kill him. Do it. Quickly. Before he
text: wakes up.
text: Josh considers this. Then heaves Frank toward the sump.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Let’s just get out of here.
text: Josh pulls the DILUENT CYLINDER from the smouldering remains
text: of the REBREATHER and clips it onto his harness.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: T-There’s not enough gas for...both
dialog: of us. Take it, Josh. Leave me
dialog: and...ahhhhh!
text: Frank cries out in pain and fear.
scene_heading: JOSH (FIGHTING BACK TEARS)
dialog: I‘m-I'm not leaving you here, Dad.
text: Frank gazes around at the cave walls. He's suddenly fighting
dialog: for breath.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen...listen to me...You have
dialog: to...trust me on this. Trust the
text: cave..follow the river. It’1l lead
dialog: you out...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’ll lead us out.
text: Josh drags Frank out into the water. As he pulls Frank's mask
text: into place, a GROAN from the shadows causes Josh to look up.
text: Carl is crawling through the mud toward the dying torch. His
text: face is covered in blood and burns. He reaches for the flame.
text: Just as it flickers out.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No! Noooooooce!
dialog: 113
text: Carl is plunged into eternal darkness.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBERS
text: An eerie YELLOW GLOW fills the underwater sump as Josh CRACKS
text: open a LIGHT STICK.
text: Frank and Josh bounce their way down the underwater cliff
text: wall, into the depths of the sump. As they hit the sandy
text: bottom, they see a small tunnel disappearing into the dark.
text: PFFT! Josh cracks open the DILUENT CYLINDER and snatches a
text: breath directly from the valve. Bubbles EXPLODE and POP
text: around him. He offers the cylinder to Frank, cracking the
text: valve open so he can take a breath. Then Josh grabs Frank's
text: harness and pulls him into the tunnel.
text: Josh swims directly above Frank, orchestrating the task-
text: loading job of BUDDY-BREATHING from the DILUENT CYLINDER,
text: while pulling them both along the wall.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
text: Open. Breathe. Close. Pull. Open.
text: Breathe. Close. Pull. Open.
dialog: Breathe...
text: After a while, the routine becomes fluid, like a beautifully
text: choreographed ballet. Two people, working as one.
text: VARIOUS SHOTS: The tunnel soon narrows into a tight
text: restriction. Josh swims through, then reaches back and pulls
text: Frank after him.
text: A lazy current carries them down a widening passageway.
text: They drift through a huge chamber: spectacular speleothems
text: connecting the ceiling to the floor.
text: Frank's RATTLED BREATHING is growing steadily weaker as they
dialog: continue.
text: Josh and Frank ascend up an underwater cliff wall.
text: They surface inside a tiny air bell: only six inches of
text: airspace. Josh tilts his head back and gulps down several
text: DEEP BREATHS.
speaker_heading: JOSH (BREATHLESS)
dialog: You...You got water in your
dialog: mask..Here...let me...
text: Josh removes Frank’s mask. Frank lolls, unconscious.
dialog: 114
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Dad? Dad!
text: Josh has to SHAKE his father back to consciousness. Frank
text: blinks, spits blood and gazes around weakly.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You gotta stay with me!
speaker_heading: FRANK (WEAK)
dialog: N-no more. Please. Leave me
dialog: here...It...hurts so bad...
text: Josh drags his father’s mask back in place.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Just hang on. It can’t be much
dialog: further now...
text: Josh CRACKS open another LIGHT STICK with his teeth. They
dialog: descend.
text: They enter another beautifully decorated room, breaking
text: through the shimmering HALOCLINE, from fresh water to salt
dialog: water.
text: Josh glances up: their exhalation bubbles break the glassy
text: surface of an air-filled chamber. Josh kicks weakly toward
text: the surface.
scene_heading: INT. DRY CAVE
text: Josh drags Frank high up the shoreline and collapses into the
text: thick black clay covering the floor. Josh gazes around:
text: another vast and featureless air-filled cavern: his LIGHT
text: STICK barely pierces the dark.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hello!
text: Josh sags wearily as his voice echoes into the far distance.
text: The cavern is huge. No obvious way forward. Frank suddenly
text: COUGHS up more blood. He’s struggling for breath and
text: SHIVERING in pain. Josh gazes down at him numbly.
text: Josh shuffles over and opens Frank’s WETSUIT ZIP to inspect
text: his chest wound. His eyes widen in fear as he removes the
text: blood-soaked dressing. Frank’s lost a lot of blood: a red
text: river trickles down the shoreline. Frank MOANS in pain.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: J-Josh. L-L-Leave me!
dialog: 115
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Shhh! Easy now. (obviously lying)
dialog: Can you feel it? There’s a breeze
dialog: coming from somewhere. We must be
dialog: close.
text: Josh staggers to his feet. He CRACKS the third CYLUME STICK
text: and hands Frank the old one.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I'm going to scout ahead. (smiling
dialog: grimly) Don’t worry. I won’t get
dialog: lost.
text: Josh wades his way along the shoreline, his feet SUCKING and
text: OOZING into the knee-deep clay. After a hundred yards,
text: something makes him stop and look back. Josh suddenly looks
text: very frightened. He retraces his footsteps to find...
text: Frank has gone. Josh follows the trail of blood down to the
dialog: waters edge.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Dad!
text: Frank is laying with his face in the mud, desperately trying
text: to suck water into his lungs in an attempt to kill himself.
text: Josh races over and pulls Frank's face clear of the water.
text: Frank RAGES in anger and frustration as Josh drags him back
text: up the shoreline.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Unnng! Goddamn it! Kill me! Do this
dialog: for me. Josh. Kill me. Please...
dialog: You have to...have to...
text: Frank suddenly reaches up and touches Josh's face.
speaker_heading: FRANK (INTENSE)
dialog: .+-Forgive me...
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What for?
text: Frank lapses into unconsciousness. His head lolls against
text: Josh’s knee, only inches from the water. Josh stares down at
text: his father, shaking in fright.
text: Suddenly, Josh grabs Frank’s head and holds it above the
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Do it! Do it! Do it!...
dialog: 116
text: Josh stares at his hand, transfixed as it inches Frank's
text: mouth down into the water. The water is about to cover
dialog: Frank’s nose when...
text: Josh pulls Frank's head back up into his lap. He throws back
text: his head and WEEPS openly, cradling his father’s head in his
text: arms. He can’t bring himself do it.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LONG CONTINUOUS SHOT as we follow a set of muddy footprints
text: along the shoreline of the river. Next to the footprints can
text: be seen the deep imprint of an object being dragged. The
text: footprints go on for what seems like miles. We hear a MANTRA
text: echoing across the distant walls. Spoken lyrics from an old
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S.)
dialog: “It ain't easy...Livin’ free...
dialog: Season ticket on a one-way
dialog: ride....Askin’ Nothing...leave me
dialog: be...Takin’ everything in my
dialog: stride...”...Shit...How...How’s...
dialog: the next bit go?
text: We follow the footprints over a huge DEBRIS SLOPE. Then down
text: the other side, back into the river.
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S)
dialog: “Don’t need reason...Don’t need
dialog: rhyme...Ain’t nothing that I'd
dialog: rather do...” Goddamn it!. Help me
dialog: out...This was your...stupid
dialog: song...
text: Finally, the dim yellow glow of Josh's LIGHT STICK can be
text: seen in the distance. Josh staggers along the knee-deep
text: river, his father hoisted across his back in a fireman’s
text: carry. The DILUENT CYLINDER drags in the water behind them.
dialog: It’s backbreaking work.
text: Josh is mumbling to himself, close to a complete emotional
text: and physical breakdown. The sound of a WATERFALL can be heard
text: directly ahead.
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S.)
dialog: “Going down...Party time...My
dialog: friends are going to be there
dialog: too..I’m on a...”
text: Josh emerges into...
dialog: 117
scene_heading: INT. CRYSTAL PALACE.
text: A cavern of magnificent wonder and beauty. The chamber is
text: finely decorated with millions of delicate CALCITE STRAWS,
text: hanging from the ceiling. Josh's LIGHT STICK reflects the
text: exquisite crystal formations that cover every inch of the
text: walls. A fine mist fills the air.
text: The river disappears into a vast circular pit in the floor of
text: the cave. Around the pit, several other rivers cascade out of
text: the cavern walls to form one great one big circular waterfall
text: plunging into infinity.
speaker_heading: JOSH (HUSHED WHISPER)
dialog: “,..Highway to hell”.
text: Josh gently lowers his father to the edge of a shallow pool.
text: Then stumbles to the edge of the precipice and gazes down. He
text: throws his fading CYLUME STICK over the edge and watches it
text: disappear into the darkness.
text: A bottomless pit. No way down. No tunnel leading on.
text: Josh CRACKS open the final LIGHT STICK and falls to his
text: knees. Josh smiles as he gazes around the cavern, finally
text: accepting his reality. His face reveals a peaceful reverence.
text: He's breathing the cave in. Feeling it. Finally getting it.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Josh sits in a shallow pool overlooking the falls. Frank is
text: cradled in Josh’s arms, unconscious. Josh gazes around at the
text: cavern. Then leans over and kisses his father.
text: Frank's eyes flicker open. He gazes up at Josh, a serene look
text: on his face. Frank closes his eyes. Then nods, once.
text: Josh gently lowers his father’s head beneath the surface of
dialog: the water.
text: There’s no panic. No drama. Josh watches his father die as if
text: it's the most natural thing in the world. After a few seconds
text: it's over.
speaker_heading: JOSH (WHISPER)
dialog: I love you, Dad.
text: Josh closes his eyes. Darkness engulfs us.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 118
text: Josh stands confidently at the edge of the cliff clutching
text: the DILUENT CYLINDER and the LIGHT STICK. He turns and takes
text: a final look at his father’s body, floating lifeless in the
text: pool. Josh steels himself, turns and steps out into the
dialog: darkness.
scene_heading: INT. FREE FALLING CLIFF
text: POV Josh: staring at the yellow glow from the LIGHT STICK as
text: he falls through the darkness. The occasional glimpse of the
text: CLIFF WALL and the WATERFALL flashing by. The sinister HOWL
text: of wind as the air rushes past him.
speaker_heading: JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
dialog: Here. Now. This is who I am. Who
dialog: you made me.
scene_heading: INT. FINAL RIVER
text: BADOOSH! Josh plunges into a deep pool of water at the base
text: of the falls. He breaks the surface, COUGHING and SPLUTTERING
text: before being whisked away by a fast flowing river.
text: Boulders loom in the dark. Josh steers himself around them as
text: best he can. A cliff wall suddenly materializes. The river is
text: being sucked underground at a ferocious rate. Josh takes a
text: final deep BREATH just as...
scene_heading: INT. OCEAN TUNNEL
text: Josh is sucked down into the inky blackness. He allows the
text: river to sweep him along. CRUNCH! He is slammed against the
text: side of the tunnel. DING! His DILUENT CYLINDER scrapes along
text: the ceiling. CRACK! His facemask shatters. Josh rips it from
text: his face.
text: Josh tumbles head over heels, bouncing off the walls on a
text: roller-coaster ride into hell itself. Josh grabs a desperate
text: BREATH from the DILUENT CYLINDER and waves his LIGHT STICK
text: around. POV Josh: in the dim beam, he can see the hazy
text: outline of MARINE CORAL covering the tunnel, suggesting he
text: may be close to the ocean wall.
scene_heading: INT. OCEAN ENTRANCE
text: The current suddenly subsides and Josh finds himself drifting
text: down a wide tunnel, filled with beautiful CORAL SPONGES. He
text: allows himself to be carried by the current. He has a calm
text: look upon his face. No fear at all.
dialog: 119
text: PFFFT! Every few seconds, he reaches down and takes another
text: BREATH from the DILUENT CYLINDER. Bubbles dance and POP
scene_heading: against the ceiling of the tunnel. PFFFT..FFF..F..T......
text: Suddenly, the DILUENT CYLINDER is empty. Josh smiles, shrugs
text: and lets it fall.
text: Inverting himself so he’s staring up at the ceiling, Josh can
text: see BUBBLES from his previous exhalations forming a tiny AIR
text: POCKET in the ceiling of the cave. He sees his hazy
text: reflection in the bubble. Josh takes a SIP of air from the
text: bubble and watches it trickle further down the tunnel, like
dialog: mercury.
text: Josh follows the bubble, gazing in wonder as it gets smaller
text: and smaller with each breath he takes. His reflection
text: steadily reduces until...SHLOOP! A final breath...and the air
text: pocket has gone.
text: Josh turns away from the ceiling. A school of YELLOW-TAILED
text: JACKS suddenly darts into his light. The fish CIRCLE him,
text: becoming temporary escorts as they lead him further down the
dialog: tunnel.
text: POV JOSH: a DREAM-LIKE AURA clouds his vision, slowing his
text: every movement. He’s suffering from hypoxia: severe lack of
text: oxygen. His HEARTBEAT can be heard hammering in his chest.
text: Josh’s vision finally starts to narrow. Shapes WARP and SPIN
text: around him. The sound of his HEARTBEAT grows steadily louder
text: until... BLOOMPTH! Josh exhales his final breath.
text: Josh relaxes. He releases the LIGHT STICK and watches it
text: float away into the darkness. As he sinks to the floor of the
text: cave, he is convinced he can see his father gazing at him
text: from the shadows.
text: Josh reaches toward him.
text: Then blackness engulfs him.
scene_heading: INT. SEA CAVE — DAY
text: Darkness. The distant echo of waves SHUSHING against a shore.
text: Another sound, less defined. The sound of CHILDREN’S
scene_heading: LAUGHTER.
text: Suddenly, a tiny shaft of brilliant white light pierces the
text: gloom. The dime-sized beam tracks slowly across a rock and
text: illuminates Josh’s hand. The light moves slowly up his arm
text: and across his chest until it finally caresses his face.
text: Josh's eyes flicker open.
dialog: 120
text: Staring down at him is the smiling face of six-year old LOCAL
text: BOY wearing a SNORKEL MASK. The boy LAUGHS and waves a YELLOW
text: TAILED SNAPPER in Josh’s face.
speaker_heading: LOCAL BOY (PIDGIN ENGLISH)
dialog: Yes Mista. You wantem pem sum blue
dialog: fish? Hem ee good tu-mahs!
text: Josh slowly sits up. He’s laying on the shoreline of a sea-
text: cave: a dome-shaped room connected directly to the ocean via
text: a gaping underwater entrance. Blue shafts of light from the
text: ocean flicker across the walls.
text: Josh gazes up: a skylight in the ceiling casts a brilliant
text: beam of sunlight down into the cave. It’s stunningly
text: beautiful. Josh smiles.
text: The local boy takes Josh by the hand and leads him back into
text: the water. Other children can be seen in the ocean entrance,
text: SPEAR FISHING with snorkeling gear.
text: The boy continues to LAUGH and CHATTER as he pulls Josh
text: across the surface toward the blue window.
text: Josh ducks beneath the surface.
scene_heading: EXT. PAPUA NEW GUINEA COASTLINE - DAY
text: The glassy ocean is rent asunder as Josh breaks the surface.
text: A LOCAL FISHERMAN gazes down at him from his DUGOUT CANOE, a
