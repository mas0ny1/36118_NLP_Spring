scene_heading: EXT. PALM DESERT - MORNING (D12) 701
text: The sun is almost up. Smog clearing. A small PRIVATE PLANE
text: comes in for a landing.
scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER (D12) 702
text: As the plane touches down, we see A BLACK SUV, A THUG on a
text: MOTORCYCLE (we'll call him PONCH), and two other men
dialog: awaiting.
text: As the three men on the ground look on, the plane taxis to a
text: stop, kills its engine. Silence, then --
text: We hear SOMETHING - is that MUSIC? Ever so faint. It sounds
text: a little like Pantera’s “Cowboys from Hell.” The bodyguards
dialog: turn to see --
text: Across the airfield, in the distance - TAYLOR'S CAR.
text: Screaming towards them. And we can really start to hear it
text: now, the PANTERA.
text: We stay behind THE BODYGUARDS as they raise SCOPED ASSAULT
text: RIFLES; shoulder them. The car shrieks closer. The
text: bodyguards take AIM and FIRE off a volley of shots.
scene_heading: BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
text: The CAR gets HIT! It flips over several times, lands on its
text: side in the dirt, a couple hundred yards away.
text: The bodyguards and Ponch look to each other, as, BEHIND
speaker_heading: THEM --
text: A bodyguard emerges from the plane, holds the door open
text: for...CRISTOBAL SIFUENTES. He looks intimidating, but
text: there's something about his demeanor that's a little Zen.
speaker_heading: CRISTOBAL
dialog: That was a rough one. I hate these
dialog: little planes. Guys! You're not gonna
dialog: believe this. The pilot is from the

scene_heading: EXT. AIRFIELD, TAYLOR’S CAR — MOMENTS LATER (D12) 703
text: Ponch peers into Taylor's wrecked car. In the front seat;
text: two bodies, TAYLOR and VAUGHAN. Dead.

dialog: This guy is next level. Plus we have
