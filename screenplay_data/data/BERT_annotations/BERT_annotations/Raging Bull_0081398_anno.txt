scene_heading: INT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)
dialog: 
text: JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
dialog: 
text: We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
text: shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the
text: balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
text: canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
text: bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: It's a thrill to be standing here
dialog: talking to you wonderful people. In
dialog: fact, it's a thrill to be standing!
dialog: I haven't seen so many people since
dialog: my last fight at Madison Square
dialog: Garden. After that fight, a
dialog: reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do
dialog: you go from here?' I said, 'To a
dialog: hospital!' I fought one hundred and
dialog: six professional fights and still
dialog: none of them bums figured out how
dialog: to fight me -- they kept hitting me
dialog: in the head! And that's why I'm
dialog: here tonight...
dialog: (starts to sing)
dialog: 'When the fighter's not engaged in
dialog: his employment, his employment,
dialog: although he was Champ and quite the
dialog: rage, he must go somewhere else to
dialog: seek employment, seek employment.
dialog: But a fighter's life is not a bowl
dialog: of cherries, still I'd rather have

scene_heading: INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)
dialog: 
text: Bam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,
text: 19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter
dialog: how hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always
text: staggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.
dialog: 
text: Battered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.
dialog: 
text: It's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.
text: Young SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --
text: each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER
text: and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.
dialog: 
text: AND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits
text: blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for
text: him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: You didn't have to come to
dialog: Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan
dialog: yan," Jake!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TONY
dialog: He's got you, Jake! You're
dialog: outpointed! You're coming up for
dialog: the tenth. You gotta knock him out!
dialog: 
text: The bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and
text: charges at REEVES.
dialog: 
text: REEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.
dialog: 
text: In JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: A grand apiece! We got a grand
dialog: apiece on this, Jake! A fucking
dialog: grand!
dialog: 
text: JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild
text: alley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.
dialog: 
text: The SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.
dialog: 
text: REEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: The REFEREE counts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REFEREE
dialog: One, two, three, four...
dialog: 
text: The GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the
text: underdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and
text: steps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending
text: not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a
text: few seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but
text: not enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the
text: count of nine, ending the match.
dialog: 
text: Boos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to
dialog: get their money.
dialog: 
text: JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting
text: them toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER

dialog: Boxing Commission, after ten
dialog: rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy
dialog: Reeves.
dialog: 
text: The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to
text: lift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS
dialog: bring in a stretcher.
dialog: 
text: JAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to
text: figure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and
text: the FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting
text: with the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.
text: PEOPLE go into the ring.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, I can't wait. You know when I
dialog: wait? When it's important to wait.
dialog: It's not important to wait for no
dialog: steak. It's important to wait for
dialog: Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't
dialog: important to wait for no steak! I
dialog: won that fight. So, I stayed in the
dialog: ring, and that way I made sure

scene_heading: INT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A neighborhood dance is in progress. A small BAND is playing
text: while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance. There are TWO PRIESTS
text: present. The younger people are divided into two groups --
text: the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most
text: of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in
text: evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing
dialog: together.
dialog: 
text: Some of the more popular GIRLS are surrounded by "WISE-GUYS."
text: There are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles
text: of Scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. These tables
dialog: are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood
text: groups, as if they were street corners.
dialog: 
text: JAKE and JOEY are walking toward a table. VERA, a young
text: neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk
text: to some GUYS at a table. VERA's well-built, and knows it.
dialog: 
text: JOEY tries to move one way; VERA again blocks his way. This
text: little game goes on for a few seconds, then:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY

dialog: All right, darling, I'll just stand

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Jake, you're the one who said you

dialog: do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (angry)
dialog: Well, sometimes you shouldn't
dialog: listen to me! Now I don't know if I

dialog: trouble making 160, and without
dialog: telling me, you sign me for a fight
dialog: at 155 pounds, and if I don't make
dialog: 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're
dialog: supposed to know what you're doin'.

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: they're afraid to fight you.
dialog: This Janiro's up-and-coming. He
dialog: don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart,
dialog: wipe him out! What are you worried
dialog: about? Your weight? Look, even if
dialog: you lose they're gonna think you're
dialog: weak; they're gonna think you're
dialog: not the fighter you used to be.
dialog: They'll match you with guys they
dialog: were afraid to match you with
dialog: before, and then you'll kill them
dialog: and you'll get your title shot. And
dialog: if you beat this kid Janiro, they
dialog: gotta give you a shot at the title

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE

dialog: you know this is not his wife.
dialog: 
text: The lounge is very crowded. The COMEDIAN interrupts his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMEDIAN
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SALVY
dialog: Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin'?
dialog: Vickie...
dialog: 
text: They respond. JAKE is cold towards SALVY.

speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't tell me "No." I saw you

speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: I'm not interested in him.

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're not interested in him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: In other words, you're not

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (turns to Joey, referring

dialog: Look at this, all of a sudden

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: Nah, she would never...

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: Didn't you just see her lookin' at

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEY
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (sarcastic)

dialog: 
text: JOEY goes to COMO's table in the rear of the lounge. JAKE

speaker_heading: JOEY

speaker_heading: TOMMY

speaker_heading: TOMMY (CONT'D)

dialog: Fuckin' kid! You're the best
dialog: fuckin' fighter around. Loved what

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: How's the weight? Ok?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah, the weight's Ok.
dialog: 
text: Another pause. TOMMY smiles and moves closer to JAKE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: All right, lemme ask you something.
dialog: Let's say I was a good friend of
dialog: yours. And I was telling you I was
dialog: gonna bet a lot of money on you in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: What did I say?

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That he's got a pretty face.

speaker_heading: VICKIE

speaker_heading: JAKE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: Positive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You're the one who said he was good
dialog: looking. You think he's good
dialog: looking 'cause I know you think
dialog: he's good-looking. I'll smash his
dialog: face inside out. I'll make him into
dialog: dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's
dialog: good-looking when I get through

dialog: 
text: FOX lands a solid blow to JAKE's jaw, but LAMOTTA is unfazed.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
dialog: It's a thrill to be standin' here
dialog: talking to you wonderful people. In
dialog: fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.
dialog: I haven't seen so many people since
dialog: my last fight at Madison Square
dialog: Garden. After that fight a reporter
dialog: asked me, "Jake, where do you go
dialog: from here?" I said, "To a
dialog: hospital."
dialog: 
text: About HALF THE PATRONS are listening; of them, HALF are
text: laughing, SOME a little too loud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I fought one hundred and six
dialog: professional fights and none of
dialog: them bums figured out how to fight
dialog: me -- they kept hitting me in the
dialog: head!
dialog: (calls to the bar)
dialog: Will somebody at the bar -- Linda?
dialog: - get me a drink. I figure if I'm
dialog: gonna work to drunks I might as
dialog: well be one of 'em! I like this
dialog: place. It's a family type club...
dialog: every night I see a lot of fathers
dialog: sitting out there with their young
dialog: daughters! That's nice.
dialog: 
text: LINDA hands him a drink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific.
dialog: The kinda girl you wanta take home
dialog: to meet your father. Especially if
dialog: your old man's a degenerate! --
dialog: Here's a toast! "To your health!
dialog: You only live once. But if you play
dialog: it right, once is enough." I
dialog: shouldn't be drinkin' like this
dialog: 'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight.
dialog: I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm
dialog: allowed to eat anything I want. As
dialog: long as I don't swallow it! Well, I
dialog: never had much luck with my weight.
dialog: In fact, -- I never had much luck
dialog: with anything -- until about a few
dialog: years ago, when this happened --
dialog: 
text: He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,
dialog: of which there is some.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... thanks, I'm glad to see you
dialog: remember. For those of you that
dialog: don't... that's me takin' the title
dialog: from Cerdan.
dialog: You know, the tough thing about
dialog: winnin' the title... the next thing
dialog: you gotta do is have a rematch...
dialog: just to show it wasn't no fluke. So
dialog: what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a
dialog: really great champ, after I beat
dialog: him... he gets himself killed in
dialog: that airplane crash... a pretty
dialog: rotten break for him. That's why I
dialog: don't like to fly. People say to
dialog: me, "Look, Jake, when your time is
dialog: up, your time is up." And I say,
dialog: "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane
dialog: and the pilot's time is up?" As
dialog: good as Cerdan was, I could've
dialog: taken him again. But I never got
dialog: the chance to prove it wasn't no
dialog: fluke. He got killed but he got to
dialog: be what they call a legend. I don't
dialog: know what's worse -- bein' a fluke
dialog: or bein' a legend. -- That's the
dialog: kinda luck I got. That's why I quit
dialog: the ring and moved down here from
dialog: New York. My wife said, "You gotta
dialog: get outa this town, Jake." Come to
dialog: think of it... the boxing
dialog: commission said the same thing! But
dialog: I don't miss New York. Give me
dialog: Miami any day.
dialog: 
text: The AUDIENCE applauds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Miami's a great place. I get along
dialog: with everybody in this town... even
dialog: the police force... They got the
dialog: best cops here money can buy! --
dialog: Only kiddin'. By the way... me and
dialog: my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to
dialog: celibrate our eleventh wedding
dialog: anniversary.
dialog: 
dialog: More applause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: We get along real great. We fight a
dialog: little but I never really belted
text: her on purpose. Once in a while
dialog: I'm standin' there doin' little
dialog: shadow-boxin' and she happens to
dialog: walk right into the shadow... I
dialog: can't help that.
dialog: She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?"
dialog: I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a
dialog: love tap." She says, "It's a good
dialog: thing you're not crazy about me!" --
dialog: I am crazy about her. I heard her
dialog: talkin' to a friend on the phone
dialog: and she was sayin', "After eleven
dialog: years, I'm still in love with the
dialog: same guy." -- If I ever find out
dialog: who the bum is, I'll kill him!
dialog: Women. You can't live with 'em, you
dialog: can't live without 'em.
dialog: 
text: Then, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's
text: speech in Othello.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: "'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.
text: It is the green-eyed monster, which
dialog: doth mock the meat it feeds on.
dialog: That cuckold lives in bliss who,
dialog: certain of his fate, loves not his
dialog: woronger; But O, what damned
dialog: minutes tells he o'er who dotes,
dialog: yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly
dialog: loves!" -- That's from somethin'
dialog: called "Othello" --
dialog: 
scene_heading: OR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is whispering nothing? Is leaning
dialog: cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
dialog: Kissing with inside lip? Stopping
dialog: the career of laughter with a sign?
dialog: -- A note infallible of breaking
dialog: honesty -- horsing foot on foot?
dialog: Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks
dialog: more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,
text: midnight? and all eyes blind with
dialog: the pin and web but theirs, theirs
dialog: only, that would unseen be wicked?
dialog: Is this nothing? Why, then the
dialog: world and all that's in't is
dialog: nothing; The covering sky is
dialog: nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife
dialog: is nothing; nor nothing have these
dialog: nothings, if this be nothing." --
dialog: That's from something called "The
dialog: Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You
dialog: all remember Shakespeare.
dialog: He wrote all them famous plays one
dialog: after the other, then he went into
dialog: a big slump and he ain't done
dialog: anything good in years. That speech
dialog: is about jealousy -- jealousy's a
dialog: bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot
dialog: of guys... take me... I almost
dialog: killed my brother... I love him...
dialog: he's my family... I mean, there's
dialog: nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And
dialog: that's the way we been goin' thru
dialog: life -- doin' nothin' for each
dialog: other! Anytime he got in trouble
dialog: when we was kids, I got him out of
dialog: it. You know, he used to steal
dialog: little things when we was growin'
dialog: up. But he was particular... only
dialog: stole things that begin with an 'a'
text: -- a watch, a car, a suit, a
dialog: ring... But I was wrong... I
dialog: shoulda never hit my brother.
dialog: Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every
dialog: time I need somethin' I gotta go
dialog: shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
dialog: once told me, "When you hit your
dialog: brother you're really hittin' your
dialog: mother, but you can't admit it to
dialog: yourself." He's really crazy. I
dialog: woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
dialog: only in self-defense!

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: I'm sick of it. I can't watch you
dialog: this way. You're too drunk all the

dialog:

dialog: 
text: In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a

dialog: 
text: VICKIE appears in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I need ten thousand dollars. My
dialog: lawyer says if we can spread ten
dialog: thousand bucks around, we can get
dialog: the case dropped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: But they don't have a case against
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (digging at the belt)
dialog: Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a
dialog: 14-year-old testify in court? Did
dialog: you see the papers? "LaMotta on
dialog: Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot
dialog: at the Champ.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: Jake, be careful! What're you doing
dialog: to the belt?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Don't make no difference no more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKIE
dialog: Can't you get the money from your
dialog: friends?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What friends?
dialog: 
text: JAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers
text: at it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor.
text: JAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY
dialog: 
text: JAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The
text: JEWELER examines the stones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: Didn't you also wish to sell the
dialog: Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That's it. Those are the jewels
dialog: that were in the belt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: But where's the belt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You want the jewels or the belt?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEWELER
dialog: Both. These stones are worth about
dialog: fifteen hudred dollars, but the
dialog: belt of a champion is a very rare
dialog: item. The belt with the stones
dialog: untouched would have been worth
dialog: near five thousand dollars.
dialog: 
text: JAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the
dialog: attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.

scene_heading: EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

dialog: Same as Scene 1.
dialog: 
text: JAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated
text: across from a mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So there I am in the can... and not
dialog: the one that says "gentlemen" on
dialog: the door. I'm talkin' about jail!
dialog: Down south!
dialog: I mean, jail up north is gotta be
dialog: like summer camp compared to jail
dialog: down in cracker country. And if
dialog: you're a guy like me, you ain't got
dialog: a chance in a place like that.
dialog: Especially if you're Italian... you
dialog: come from the Bronx... and you're
text: an ex-champ. As soon as they saw
dialog: me... soon as they heard me... I
dialog: know I'm in trouble. To me, they
dialog: got an accent, and to them, I got
dialog: an accent! You gotta get the
dialog: picture -- I'm big, I got small
text: hands, I walk like I'm still in the
text: ring... the balls of my feet pop up
dialog: and down, you know... and whenever
dialog: I get the chance, I read a lot. So
dialog: naturally, takin' all this into
dialog: co
dialog: sideration, they figure it adds up
dialog: to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I
dialog: didn't mind too much when they
dialog: called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough
dialog: Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one
dialog: day these screws got to me... I was
dialog: workin' on the work gang, pickin'
dialog: up some trees that were knocked
dialog: down by a storm or somethin' and
dialog: puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a
dialog: sudden... one of the trees slipped
dialog: and fell on me and pinned me to the
dialog: ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree
dialog: across my chest! This screw walks
dialog: over, takin' his time, he looks
dialog: down at me and says, "Well, Champ
dialog: Pimp... you lyin' down on the job
dialog: again?"! They got a great sense of
dialog: humor when they're standin' there
dialog: with a gun in their arms and you
dialog: got a tree on your chest! So I look
dialog: up at him and say, "Oh, this
dialog: tree... it fell on me." And he
dialog: says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have
dialog: known, I would've yelled 'timber'"
dialog: I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I
dialog: think maybe I broke somethin'!" He
dialog: says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ
dialog: PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then
dialog: I got as stupid as him. I said, "If
dialog: I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'
dialog: me the money you made last night?"!
text: Then another screw comes over and
dialog: says, "This Yankee creep givin' you
dialog: trouble?" -- What kind of trouble?
dialog: What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with
dialog: the tree? Now anybody else in their
dialog: right mind would've said, "No sir,
dialog: I wouldn't think of giving any of
dialog: you gentlemen trouble... I just
dialog: want to serve my time and get the
dialog: hell out of here as soon as I can."
dialog: That's anybody else. When I said
dialog: it... it was a little different.
dialog: "You stupid cracker... take your
dialog: hands off me or I'll get up and
dialog: kick your brains out -- but first
dialog: you gotta bend over so I can find
dialog: 'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the
dialog: hole. Solitary confinement. All my
dialog: life I had guys in my corner
dialog: yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill
dialog: 'em! You're the greatest." Now
dialog: there's nobody rootin' for me. But
dialog: it wasn't so bad. I learned things
dialog: there. I learned how to scratch a
dialog: calendar on the wall. I never knew
dialog: how to do that before. Now I know.
dialog: Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is
text: two scratches. Wednesday is three
dialog: scratches. And so on. Except for
dialog: Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.
dialog: Sundays rested.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)

dialog: bit. You shoulda taken care of me
dialog: just a little bit so I wouldn't
