scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE
text: A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely
text: highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through
text: the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The
text: sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO
text: into the mist.
text: She runs, and runs.
text: She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway.
text: Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a
text: tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.
text: She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE OF "DEATHWATCH AUSTIN" - SUNRISE
text: A clock on the wall: 6:11.
text: Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin."
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
dialog: It's probably been about seven
dialog: minutes...
text: The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled
text: with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates.
text: About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces.
text: Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with
text: a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer
text: screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs
text: quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a
text: phone to one ear.
text: The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12.
text: CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE
text: (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at
text: nothing. She bites her lip.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GUY
dialog: Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement.
text: 6:12. Roughly eight minutes.
dialog: (a beat as he records
dialog: the time)
dialog: Number 36 this year for the Great
dialog: State of Texas.
text: They all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: David, don't start throwing things.
text: A PHONE RINGS. David controls himself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm going home. Let's do the press
dialog: fax tomorrow.
text: Another PHONE RINGS. Constance stands.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Go. I'll do it.
text: He nods to her, exits.
text: She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she
text: marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male.
text: The wall clock reads 6:13.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE
text: The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going
text: to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty
text: parking lot to Volvo station wagon.
text: As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the
text: capitol building in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE
text: David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE
text: David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop
text: inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE
text: He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind
text: him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the
text: reflection of the rising sun.
dialog: BACK TO DAVID
text: He stares, then:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey!
text: The cop ignores him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yo! Officer!
text: The cop looks over; his face says he expects a confrontation.
text: David points to the seat belt buckle.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your seatbelt.
text: The cop nods, weary, embarrassed. He reaches back for the
text: belt. David takes a sip and drives on.

text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN:
scene_heading: INT. NEWS MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY
text: KRUGER (47) watches with a leg up on her messy desk, eating
text: low-fat tortilla chips and massaging a knee with an electric
text: massager. A name plate on her desk reads "Barbara D. Kruger,
dialog: Crime and Courts Editor." News magazine covers are on the
text: walls. Kruger is black, short, overweight, wears an old
text: jogging suit and new oversized athletic shoes. She has half-
text: frame granny glasses on a cord around her neck.
speaker_heading: ROBERTS (V.O.)
dialog: Gale had sought a review of his 1993
dialog: conviction for the rape and murder
dialog: of University of Texas colleague,
dialog: Constance Harraway.
text: Kruger reaches for a phone, hits four numbers, takes a chip.
speaker_heading: ON TV
text: A book-jacket photo of Constance.
scene_heading: BACK ON ROBERTS
speaker_heading: ROBERTS (V.O.)
dialog: Defense lawyers had hoped to argue
dialog: that Gale's former activism against
dialog: capital punishment unduly
dialog: prejudiced...
speaker_heading: ON KRUGER
text: She waits impatiently, munching, swallowing.
speaker_heading: ROBERTS (V.O.)
dialog: ...the Texas judicial system. Citing
dialog: 'discriminating purpose' --
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Hey, they're not gonna stay Gale.
dialog: It's on Court TV right now, listen.
text: She holds the phone out in the direction of the TV, uses the
dialog: opportunity to eat another chip.
speaker_heading: ON TV
text: We see old footage of David on a TV talk show.
speaker_heading: ROBERTS (V.O.)
dialog: ...clear political gain in executing
dialog: its leading opponent of the death
dialog: penalty...
speaker_heading: ON KRUGER
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: (into the phone,
dialog: swallowing)
dialog: So, what's it gonna be? Belyeu said
dialog: to call after the decision... No,
dialog: they said only Bitsey.
speaker_heading: ROBERTS (V.O.)
dialog: (in b.g.)
dialog: ...Further failed to consider that
dialog: the victim was herself an abolitionist
dialog: activist...
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: It means only Bitsey. Bill, I don't
dialog: get to make the rules, I'm a fat
dialog: black woman.
text: Bitsey Bloom (The runner from the opening) enters. She wears,
text: as always, a tailored suit.
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: ...What we need is to put her on a
dialog: plane to Houston.
speaker_heading: BITSEY (WOMAN)
text: Gale's going down.
text: Kruger shushes her with a we-know-already gesture.
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Why do you always get lordosis around
dialog: legal? She's here.
text: She puts him on SPEAKER, and reaches for a chip.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (to the phone)
dialog: Hi. What's lordosis?
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
text: Female ape's posture when preparing
dialog: for intercourse. Hello, Bitsey.
text: Bitsey shoots Kruger a look, mouths "you're sick."
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
dialog: Look, kids, setting aside the cost
dialog: issue, though half-a-million dollars
dialog: for three two hour interviews is not
dialog: only illegal it's obscen--
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: Market value. Guy's never talked.
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
dialog: That aside, I, we are still
text: uncomfortable with the arrangement.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
dialog: Meaning you've just spent a very
dialog: public seven days in jail for a very
dialog: public contempt of court citation.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Protecting sources, even kiddie porn
dialog: scumbags, is magazine policy.
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
dialog: And I, we continue to appreciate
dialog: your decision. We're just concerned.
dialog: A rapist slash murderer, five days
text: before he's executed, demands a
dialog: reporter known for protecting sexual
text: deviants. A reporter who is also a
dialog: very attractive woman --
text: Bitsey and Kruger moan in unison.
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: This is disparate treatment.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I could go if I were an ugly blabby
dialog: guy?
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
dialog: There's an agenda issue here which
text: would be diffused with an older
dialog: male...
speaker_heading: KRUGER
text: I hear lawyers gleefully saying the
dialog: words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: 'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice
dialog: that my assignments were evaluated
dialog: on the basis of my sex.'
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: You've gotta let her go now.
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
dialog: That's not quite what I meant.
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: He's gotta let you go.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: 'Certain references were made -- '
speaker_heading: BILL (V.O.)
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: All right. All right. Enough. The
dialog: intern is with you at all times?
text: Bitsey vehemently shakes her head "no" to this idea.
speaker_heading: KRUGER
dialog: Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye.
text: Kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I'm not baby-sitting.
text: Kruger reaches for a chip.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
text: ZACK (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and
text: looking at a case file in his lap. He holds the cigarette
text: just outside the slightly open window. Zack has a bohemian
text: grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses. As Bitsey
text: drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel.
text: We hear strained patience in her voice.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: Gale was seen leaving the house.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE 45 - NIGHT
text: The car's lights move past a sign: "Huntsville 27 Miles."
speaker_heading: BITSEY (V.O.)
text: His sperm was inside her.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: His prints were all over the kitchen,
text: including one on the bag.
text: Zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor,
text: hands handcuffed behind her. Over her head is an opaque white
text: plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape.
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: Half-a-thumb print.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Okay, half-a-thumb print.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Could have touched it before it was
text: a murder weapon.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Do you fondle your friends' garbage
dialog: bags?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Yeah, I get very touchy around
dialog: household plastics. 'Hello, everybody --
dialog: ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just
dialog: saying the bag could have been out
text: on the counter or something.
text: She looks at him a beat.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Hey, Zack?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: He did it.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: But the murder's way too fucking
dialog: clumsy. And this guy's a major
dialog: intellectual. Top of his Yale class,
dialog: a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two
dialog: books. He's an academic stud.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: And, empirically speaking, a
text: psychotic.
text: Zack picks up another file photo: Christmas shot of the Gale
text: family: David (31), his wife (Sharon, beautiful, 29), and
dialog: son (Chase, 6).
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Look at his wife, she's a regular
dialog: Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father
dialog: was Ambassador to Spain --
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: (looking at the car's
dialog: instrument panel)
text: Shit! The light's on again.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - OVERHEAT LIGHT
text: is on.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Ignore it. It's a rental.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Thanks, Zack. Do you smell anything?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: No. Besides the guy's a flaming
dialog: liberal.
text: Bitsey keeps looking down at the light.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: A person's politics has nothing to
dialog: do with their propensity to commit
dialog: crime.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Aren't we supposed to smell it if
dialog: it's overheating?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Wrong, seventy-three percent of all
dialog: serial killers vote republican.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Throw the cigarette out so we can
dialog: smell.
text: Zack reaches for the car ashtray.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No! You'll stink up the car. Throw
dialog: it out!
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I'm not gonna fucking pollute.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Zack!
text: Zack pinches the cherry off, lets it drop out the window.
text: He shows her the filter, animatedly puts in the ash tray.
text: She gives him a look. They ride a beat in silence.
text: Bitsey sniffs.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: We better pull off. Shit, this is so
text: irritating.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: How far to Huntsville?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Look.
text: She points to an approaching rest area exit sign. They share
text: a glance, then a laugh. Zack affects an evil, maniacal cackle.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: ('Hard Copy'
dialog: announcer's voice)
dialog: 'NEWS Magazine reporters Bitsy Bloom
dialog: and Zack Stemmons entered the rest
dialog: area with car trouble...
scene_heading: EXT. REST AREA EXIT - NIGHT
text: The car exits for the rest area.
speaker_heading: ZACK (V.O.)
dialog: Little did they know their troubles
dialog: were just beginning.
text: Zack mimics the OPENING MUSIC to "Dark Shadows."
scene_heading: EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT
text: Well lit and empty. The rental car is parked with the hood
text: up. They stand looking at the radiator.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Is it hot?
text: He puts his hand on it.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Oww! Jesus, yes. Isn't it always?
text: Bitsey shrugs.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: So what do I do?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I don't know, something male.
text: Zack animatedly adjusts his balls, spits.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Now what?
text: Bitsey's not paying attention. She's watching headlights
text: coming toward them.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Company.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I hope whoever it is never saw
dialog: Deliverance.
text: A late model pickup pulls up behind them. They shade their
text: eyes from its headlights. The lights go off. An OLDER COWBOY
text: (mid-60's, Stetson, lizard skin boots) steps out.
speaker_heading: OLDER COWBOY
dialog: You folks need some help?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Actually yes.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NIGHT
text: The motel lies adjacent to Interstate 45 and a Kettle
text: restaurant. The rental car pulls up to the reception building.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNTSVILLE MOTEL SIX - NEXT DAY
text: The rental car is parked in front. The morning is overcast,
text: it's sprinkling. Bitsey emerges from one of the rooms on the
text: second floor carrying an umbrella.
scene_heading: INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - DAY
text: Bitsey enters and sees Zack in a booth, smoking and reading.
text: The hyper-smiley TEENAGE HOSTESS approaches her.
speaker_heading: HOSTESS
dialog: How are you this morning?
text: Bitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment. She goes
text: and sits across from Zack; he's reading Dialogical Exhaustion
dialog: by David Gale.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Little early, isn't it?
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: The non-smoking section's over there.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I meant the book.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Oh.
text: Bitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: 9:15. The waitress says the Ellis
text: Unit is about fifteen minutes out of
dialog: town, so we've got like five and
dialog: half hours. I --
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Never eat where the menus have
text: pictures of the food.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I was thinking we should drive to
text: Austin, check out the crime scene.
dialog: Could be some story stuff for us.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (without looking up)
dialog: First, this isn't a story. It's an
dialog: interview. We come, I listen, you
dialog: watch, we go home. Second, there is
dialog: no 'us' in the assignment.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Okay, what do I watch you do for the
dialog: next five hours?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (closing the menu)
dialog: Drive around looking for decent
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You know, your reputation as Siberian-
dialog: Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you
dialog: justice.
text: She's unsure how to interpret his comment. He smiles.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: My reputation got us invited here. I
dialog: play by the rules. It's called
dialog: objectivity.
text: They stare at each other. Zack picks up his book, starts to
dialog: read, affects a shiver.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY
text: Drizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a
text: few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse
text: is a sign: "TDC Ellis Unit. All visitors must report."
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: "DAY ONE"
text: The rental car ENTERS the FRAME, brakes briefly for the empty
text: guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY
text: Bitsey and Zack get out of their car. She has an umbrella.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: So where do we report?
text: Three razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers
text: rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building
text: with a sign: "REPORT HERE."
text: Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the
dialog: building.
text: Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny
text: Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty
text: yards away. He watches them neutrally.
text: CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a
text: series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building.
text: Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's)
text: stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim
text: skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside
text: him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back
text: against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white
text: guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the
text: building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger
text: (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the
text: chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS RECEPTION OFFICE
text: As Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is
text: on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a
dialog: wait-just-a-second finger.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Well, I don't rightly know one
dialog: fraternity from another. But if we
dialog: catch any those boys out here again,
dialog: we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute...
dialog: You do that, Susan... Bye now.
text: The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet.
text: A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the
text: wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other.
text: At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's).
text: Grover hangs up.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (to the Woman)
dialog: Thank you, Margie.
dialog: (turning to Bitsey
dialog: and Zack)
dialog: Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I
dialog: presume.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Yes, hello.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Stemmons.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again.
dialog: I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community
dialog: relations.
text: Grover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach,
text: his suit suggests J.C. Penny. He speaks quickly.
speaker_heading: MARGIE (WOMAN)
dialog: He's usually real good with names.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (to Bitsey)
dialog: And these days I always like to ask,
dialog: now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Bitsey.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin'
dialog: your umbrella.
speaker_heading: MARGIE
dialog: Okey dokey.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS UNIT ENTRANCE
text: Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the
text: Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows,
text: turns his collar up.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Bitsey, you ever been in a prison?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Yes.
text: Zack smiles to himself.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: On death row?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Well, we house 422 inmates here.
dialog: Average stay with us is nine years.
dialog: Some get commuted, move on, most get
dialog: killed. It'll put you off your supper,
dialog: but then it's supposed to.
text: The unit fence gate parts as they enter. The older gate guard
text: nods as they pass.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (to the guard)
text: Afternoon, Earl.
dialog: (back to her)
dialog: We've got three concerns here: safety,
dialog: safety and safety. The visitation
dialog: area is entirely secure -- we just
dialog: ask you don't touch the glass. Windex
dialog: gets expensive.
text: They come to the door of the entrance area.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Rules say seven days prior to
dialog: execution inmates must be interviewed
text: in a cage.
text: The DOOR BUZZES, Grover opens it.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS ENTRANCE LOBBY - DAY
text: The lobby has institutional chairs and few vending machines.
text: To one side is a guard's counter and a walk through metal
text: detector. They enter and make their way toward the counter.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: This changes for no man. You're not
dialog: carryin' a weapon are you?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Mr. Stemmons, you packin'?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: No, sir.
text: They arrive at the counter. Behind it are two GUARDS, one
text: male, one female.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (to the guards)
dialog: Clarence. Karla. New York guests for
dialog: Mr. Gale.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE (GUARD)
dialog: May I see your purse, ma'am.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (to Bitsey, indicating
dialog: the metal detector)
dialog: Go on and walk through.
text: Grover keeps talking as he walks around the detector and
text: waits for her.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Now, should any kinda of
dialog: unpleasantness occur in the visitation
dialog: area, we ask that you stay put. Come
dialog: on through, Mr. Stemmons. And please
dialog: follow the instructions of these
dialog: fine correctional officers should
dialog: they see fit to give you any.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: (handing her the purse)
dialog: Here you go, ma'am.
text: He leads them down the hall.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Anythin' you say can be overheard.
dialog: And any discussion of criminal activity on your part is
dialog: admissible. Not plannin' a jailbreak are you, Bitsey?
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
text: The door guard gets up from his small table and opens the
dialog: door for them.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: Here we are.
text: The visitation hall has the linoleum-and-fluorescent feel of
text: an empty school cafeteria. It is seamlessly intersected by
text: curved wall of sheer glass. Across the hall a guard's booth
text: is built into the concrete wall; the two guards inside look
text: like they are in a sound booth.
text: Every fifteen feet, the glass has small sound holes. On the
text: visitors' side, chairs (with lap desks) cluster at each
text: section. Just getting up from a chair in the hall's center
text: is a big man wearing an expensive suit and black cowboy boots.
text: This is David's lawyer, BENJAMIN BELYEU (late 30's).
text: On the prisoner's side of the glass, a row of ten chairs
text: trace the outline of its curve. Above each chair a microphone
text: hangs from the ceiling. The center chair is in a stainless
text: steel cage. Inside sits David Gale.
speaker_heading: GROVER
dialog: (calling out to Belyeu)
dialog: All yours, Mr. Belyeu.
dialog: (to Bitsey and Zack)
dialog: You folks have safe visit now.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Thank you.
text: He exits as Bitsey and Zack make their way toward Belyeu and
text: David; it's a walk of about twenty-five feet.
text: Belyeu's voice is a thick combination of Cajun and Harvard
dialog: Yard.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Miss Bloom?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Yes.
text: Belyeu speaks as slowly as Grover did quickly. David stands
text: up politely in his cage -- he's too tall and has to hunch.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Did that P.R. man validate your
dialog: parkin'?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: He said the gift shop could do it.
text: Belyeu laughs, smiles pure Old New Orleans charm.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: (to David)
dialog: She's a smart one.
text: Belyeu takes a few steps toward them, extends his hand.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
text: Benjamin Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: This is Zack.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Pleasure.
dialog: (turning)
dialog: And this is the man of the hour.
text: They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really
text: loudly) interrupts:
speaker_heading: GUARD (V.O.)
dialog: Sit down, Gale.
text: All wince. David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Now, why can't they turn that thing
dialog: down?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to the microphone
dialog: above him)
dialog: My lawyer respectfully suggests you
dialog: adjust the speaker-system volume.
text: A beat. They all look over at the guard's booth. One of the
text: guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They're practicing being cruel and
dialog: unusual.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin'
dialog: at the bit.
text: Belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts
text: to stuff them into his antique carpetbag.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Now, it is our understanding that
dialog: you are to have three two-hour
dialog: sessions. Today, tomorrow and
text: Thursday, all at three in the P.M.
dialog: I'm sorry we can't afford you more

dialog: we have not yet begun to fight.
dialog: Furthermore, it's our understanding
dialog: that you will do this with no
dialog: recording equipment of any kind.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: You have my Gregg book?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I need it for Billy's appeal.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: (to Bitsey)
dialog: My client's got a ten pound bass on
text: the line and he's worried about
text: baitin' his neighbor's hook.
dialog: (takes out his planner)
dialog: Now, I have some papers for which I
dialog: need your Jo Ann Hancock.
dialog: (handing her a business
dialog: card)
dialog: Come by my Austin office at your
dialog: earliest convenience. Thursday
dialog: mornin', say.
text: Bitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up
text: at the microphone. She understands, nods.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Fine, till Thursday then.
text: Belyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the
text: door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Good luck, Miss Bloom.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: I'll come by later. We can play a
dialog: game of hangman, take up smokin'.
text: David waves "get lost." Belyeu turns.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Bye, ya' all.
text: They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking
text: at the floor, caught in a thought.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sorry. Have a seat.
text: She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile,
text: sincere, charming, vaguely devilish.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: He's a character.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met
dialog: the summer after 4th grade, spent
text: the day burning ants with his dad's
dialog: magnifying glass. We called it playing
dialog: 'Execution.'
text: David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the
text: air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Since I grew up in foster homes,
dialog: he's become the only family I have.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Where's your ex-wife?
text: Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We agreed minimal contact would be
dialog: easier. Please don't mention her, or
dialog: my son.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: All right. Anything else, just clearly
dialog: say, 'off the record.' I'll take it
dialog: to my grave. But then you know that
dialog: about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be
dialog: here.
text: David smiles, nods.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (referring to the pen)
dialog: Is this recording equipment?
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How should we start?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I'd say you're a man with a story to
dialog: tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the
dialog: magazine, the format. You chose me.
text: She sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Go.
text: David looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile.

scene_heading: E) FROM BEHIND TWO GRADUATE STUDENTS
text: attending class in an U.T. lecture hall -- they are laughing
text: as David entertains from a mike at the podium.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: Thirty animated students (circa 1992) are listening to David
text: lecture. He's younger (31), vibrant -- looks like a grad
text: student himself. On the white board behind him are phrases:
dialog: "Lucan," "objet petit a," "Fantasy Theory."
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Think. What do you fantasize about?
dialog: World peace?
dialog: (as no one responds)
dialog: Thought so.
dialog: (light laughter)
dialog: Money-Fame-Ferrari?
dialog: (as some guys applaud
text: loudly; others then
dialog: boo them)
dialog: A Pulitzer? Nobel? M.T.V. Music Award?
dialog: (applause)
dialog: A genius hunk -- ostensibly bad but
text: secretly simmering with noble
dialog: passions, and willing to sleep on
dialog: the wet spot?
dialog: As women applaud...
speaker_heading: LARGE WOMAN
dialog: (yells)
dialog: I'll take two!
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A Victoria's Secret model -- just
text: slumming between law school and
dialog: running her family's Vastly Endowed
dialog: Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed
dialog: Children?
text: The crowd laughs, David changes tone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, good, you see Lucan's point.
dialog: Fantasies must be unrealistic. The
dialog: minute you get something, you don't,
dialog: you can't, want it anymore. To exist,
dialog: desire needs absent objects. So desire
dialog: supports itself with crazy
dialog: fantasies...
text: The over-dressed Sexy Grad Student enters loudly from a side
text: door, out-of-breath and discombobulated. The crowd laughs at
text: the timing. David pauses.
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Sorry.
text: He animatedly gestures to the seats, waits a beat as she
text: moves towards them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is what Pascal means when he
dialog: says the only time we're truly happy
text: is when day-dreaming about future
dialog: happiness.
text: The Sexy Student sits, adjusts herself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Or why we say, 'The hunt is sweeter
dialog: than the kill' or 'Be careful what
dialog: you wish for.'
text: A guy behind the Sexy Student taps her on the shoulder, she
text: turns and he hands her letter from the registrar's office.
text: It's from a girl friend two rows back. The girlfriend mouths,
dialog: "It came today?"
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Not because you'll get it, but because
dialog: you're doomed not to want it if you
dialog: do. Think about it next time you're
text: at a wedding.
text: Laughter. The Sexy Student turns back around, throws the
text: letter in a book.
scene_heading: INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Students pour out of the double doors leading from David's
text: class. The hall is crowded. Standing waiting for him against
text: the wall is Constance (glasses, granola clothes).
text: She's looking at a document, holds a file.
scene_heading: INT. U.T. LECTURE HALL - DAY
text: The students are leaving. David is quickly erasing the white-
text: board. The Sexy Student approaches him (her name is Berlin).
speaker_heading: BERLIN (SEXY STUDENT)
dialog: Sorry about being late. There was,
dialog: you know, a thing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There usually is, Berlin.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Look, I know I'm not doing well.
text: He turns, nods, takes his books and papers from the podium.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: And to torture a cliche, I'd do
dialog: anything to pass.
text: He looks at her a beat, starts to walk toward the door.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Anything, Professor Gale.
text: He stops, turns.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Anything, huh?
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: (suggestively)
dialog: Anything.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (the smile)
dialog: Anything?
text: She affects a solicitous shyness -- then goes all sex.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Any thing.
text: He checks the room, then comes over to her, close.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tell you what, I'll give you good
dialog: grade, a really good grade, if you
dialog: will...
text: (leans down to her
dialog: ear, whispers
dialog: sensually)
dialog: ...study.
text: He smiles, turns, walks away. As she watches, anger builds.
scene_heading: INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY
text: David comes out the room. Constance sees him, hurries to
text: him. She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with
text: absolute authority. They talk as they walk down the crowded
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: David!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: The T.A. finished transcribing the
text: Governor's radio and TV comments.
dialog: Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why
dialog: I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The
text: woman breathes in soundbites.
text: She hands him a copy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pretends to read a
dialog: quote)
dialog: 'Yes, Virginia, the people of this

dialog: the reality of Santa.'
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You might can use some of her pre-

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tell me again why you aren't doing

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: Ten o'clock!

scene_heading: EXT. GALE HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
text: The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian,
text: far better than what a university professor can afford.
text: The grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway,
text: his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front
text: sits a new VW Beetle.
scene_heading: INT. KID'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: David's son -- CHASE -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep
text: in the air. David turns off the light in the adjacent
text: bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. David
text: wears a t-shirt which says "Evil-Doer &amp; Curious Person." The
text: room is over-decorated with boy stuff.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Did you mark your calendar?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (looking up at it)
dialog: Yep.
scene_heading: INSERT - KID'S CALENDAR
text: hangs above the bed, opened to the month of March. It has a
text: felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it.
text: Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are

text: fourth. The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley
text: face in an adult's.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (counting on his
dialog: fingers)
dialog: Only... three more Spain days.
text: David puts the jeans and shoes away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Only three. That's great, huh?
text: David comes and sits beside his son. Points to an African
text: statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's he doing in here?
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Mommy said I could. Just till she
text: gets back.
dialog: (touching the spear)
dialog: That's a special-duper monster laser
dialog: knife.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where's your laser gun?
text: Chase reaches under the sheets, searches, finally pulls out
text: a laser pointer.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Here.
text: He "shoots" some toys in the corner with the red laser dot.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Tussshh, tusssshh, tussshh. I never
dialog: shoot them in the eyes, Daddy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's 'cause you're a special-duper-
dialog: super-quadruper boy. Who's now going
dialog: to sleep.
text: He tucks his son in.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who loves you?
text: Chase giggles, points at his dad, then pokes his nose.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ooooh.
dialog: (kissing him)
dialog: Good night, son.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (holding up his stuffed
dialog: sheep)
dialog: Do Cloud Dog.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (kissing the sheep)
dialog: Good night, Cloud Dog.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Obsessively cool, full of designer furniture and rough
text: fabrics. The art is mostly contemporary and conspicuously
text: lit -- a Damien Hirst piece sits in one corner. A few African
text: antiquities are scattered throughout.
text: A BABYSITTER sits on the couch reading a school textbook,
text: holding lip gloss and absentmindedly applying it as she reads.
text: David passes on his way to the door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Back before midnight.
speaker_heading: BABYSITTER
dialog: It's cool, Mr. Gale.
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: Don't do anything I wouldn't.
speaker_heading: DAVID (O.S.)
dialog: Rest assured.
text: He exits. When she hears the DOOR CLOSE, the Babysitter
text: reaches for the TV remote.
scene_heading: INT. DUPLEX - LIVING AREA - NIGHT
text: The duplex is upscale, two-story with a vaulted ceiling.
text: Scattered about are forty party-goers, mostly grad students.
text: Some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool.
text: Everyone has a t-shirt with a philosophic idea ("Yawnic,"
dialog: "Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know," "[Philosophic t-shirt]".)
scene_heading: LEONARD COHEN MUSIC PLAYS.
speaker_heading: FROM FRONT DOOR
text: GREER (late 20s, Persian, "Host" t-shirt) escorts David into
text: the living room.
speaker_heading: GREER
dialog: The guy's the Immanuel Kant of the
dialog: N.F.L. Consistent, accurate,
text: effective, and boring, boring, boring.
text: Greer leaves him at the sofa where an OLDER PROFESSOR (60s,
text: homemade t-shirt -- "Pre-Socratic" -- over his shirt and
text: tie) stands speaking with ROSS (late 40s, "Homosexualist" t-
dialog: shirt).
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Meinen Herren.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (has an Oxford accent)
dialog: Hello, David.
speaker_heading: OLDER PROFESSOR
dialog: Professor Gale. Where's your better
dialog: half?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Spain.
speaker_heading: OLDER PROFESSOR
dialog: Again?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Well, I was just off for air.
text: He moves to the patio. They watch him go.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (under his breath)
text: Looks like Sharon's affair is an
dialog: open secret.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Hermeneutical bias: the only fun
dialog: truths are the ones someone's trying
dialog: to hide.
dialog: (normal tone)
dialog: Have a seat.
text: They sit on the sofa.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Listen, Berlin's here -- and livid.
dialog: Probations suspended her. She received
dialog: the letter today, took the opportunity
dialog: to throw a fit in my office. You
dialog: should --
speaker_heading: BERLIN (O.S.)
dialog: Talking about me?
text: She's standing behind them. David tilts his head back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yep.
text: She's tipsy, brings her face down between their heads.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: (to David)
dialog: He tell you I said when you were
dialog: circumcised they threw away the wrong
dialog: part.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He mentioned it.
text: An uncomfortable beat. She reaches over and takes Ross's
text: drink from his hand, drinks the rest, puts it back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's called schmuck.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: The part of the foreskin that gets
dialog: thrown away. I think it's called
text: schmuck.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Aren't we so fucking clever.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (standing, escaping)
dialog: I suppose I should get us another.
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Black Bush.
text: Ross walks to the bar. Berlin comes around and sits in his
text: seat. Her mid-drift T-shirt reads "Sex is Power."
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: You were a jerk this afternoon.
text: A beat. She's turned facing him, he looks forward.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For what it's worth, I didn't know
dialog: about the suspension.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Is that supposed to be an apology?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: More like a conciliation.
text: ON FOOD AND DRINKS TABLE
text: Ross has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's
text: Black Bush. He moves away. The table is neatly laid with
text: snacks and bottles. The flower arrangement is perfect.
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - LATER
text: The table is now in mid-party chaos. Food spilled, bottles
text: empty, the flowers in disarray. "I'M TOO SEXY" PLAYS LOUDLY
text: in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from
dialog: the table.
text: CAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people
text: now dance, and out onto the patio.
text: A crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool.
text: They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one
text: with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish
text: drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: (slurring a bit)
dialog: All right.
dialog: (clears his throat)
text: As the poets have mournfully sung,
dialog: Death takes the innocent young, The
dialog: screamingly funny, The rolling in
dialog: money, And those who are very well
dialog: hung.
text: Laughter, a few animated moans. David raises his glass to
text: Ross and downs a whiskey. Someone starts to chant: "Gale!
dialog: Gale! Gale!"
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (feeling good but
dialog: very much in control)
dialog: There once was a lesbian from Canjuom,
text: Who took a young man to her room,
dialog: And they argued all night, As to who
dialog: had the right, To do what, how, and
dialog: to whom.
text: Laughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: One more. C'mon, one more.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Enough. That's enough.
text: The crowd wants more. Someone makes chicken sounds.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Do you bow to the Queen?
text: David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his
text: glass out for a refill. The crowd applauds.
scene_heading: FULL SHOT OF PATIO
text: The crowd is chanting: "Ross! Ross! Ross!"
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - LATER
text: The crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse.
text: Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS.
text: Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: David is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC
text: downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the
text: towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm done.
text: She locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed.
text: He folds the towel.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: I'm not a student anymore.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't think I want to know what that
dialog: means.
text: David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink --
text: they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: There once was woman named Berlin,
dialog: Who liked a bit now and again. Not
dialog: now and again, But Now! And Again!
dialog: And Again! And Again! And Again!
text: He laughs.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Cute, huh?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Cute.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: I have a secret. But I have to come
dialog: over there to tell you.
text: He makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Here I come.
text: She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose
text: to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I wasn't after the grade.
text: She stands with her body against him, looks into his eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Berlin, this, this is not...
text: She puts her fingers over his mouth, keeps them there.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Ssshhhh.
text: With her free hand she takes one of his, rubs it against her
text: face and lips as she speaks.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: We'll just talk, analyze, contemplate.
dialog: Or... you can put your mouth on my
dialog: body.
text: She moves his hand down, brushing it against her breast and
text: to her groin. She brings her mouth toward her fingers --
text: which are still against his lips.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: (softly, vulnerably)
dialog: Don't reject me. Please.
text: With her eyes open, she kisses the back of her own fingers,
text: runs her tongue between them, opens them to reach his mouth.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: A Hispanic woman (T-shirt: "DerriDa-Da") bee-bops to the
text: bathroom door. Tries the handle, then dances away.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: About eight dancers dance to the TECHNO MUSIC -- its pace
text: increasing. A couple them are really into it.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Berlin and David are against the sink, kissing in full
text: passion. The MUSIC from downstairs seems LOUDER. Her T shirt
text: is off. Panting, he turns her against the sink.
text: Pulls her skirt up, reaches for her panties.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Rip them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Rip them off.
text: He does so.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Ross sits at the kitchen table, holding his throbbing head
text: against the POUNDING MUSIC. Greer sets a cup of coffee in
text: front of him, sits across. A long beat. They seem like parents
text: waiting out a teenager's party.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Berlin is back against the sink, undoing David's fly as he
text: takes his T-shirt off. The MUSIC from downstairs seems even
text: LOUDER. His pants and underwear fall. He starts to penetrate
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
text: No. From behind.
text: She turns, faces the mirror. He positions himself behind,
text: enters her.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Yes.
text: He moves against her.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Do it hard.
text: He looks at her in the mirror, then continues. She watches
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ON PATIO
text: A guy sits alone at the far end of the pool on a lounger.
text: The dancers can be seen in the living room behind him.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: David thrusts against Berlin, her thighs pound against the
text: edge of the sink. The MUSIC is as LOUD as it is downstairs.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Harder.
text: He looks at her in the mirror, unsure.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Harder.
text: He thrusts harder.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Yes.
text: They continue in rhythm. She reaches back and pulls him into
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: BERLIN
dialog: Bite me. Bite my shoulder.
text: She watches him do so in the mirror.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: The dancers dance -- the TECHNO PACE has INCREASED even more.
text: One dancer is a blur.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax.
text: She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC
text: STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from
text: the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks."
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily
text: into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the
text: mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes
text: into her bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: She turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine
text: cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly,
text: she turns to the toilette, vomits.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. BARNES &amp; NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
text: David and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the

text: She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire.
text: She has stacks of paper spread in front of her.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Okay, let's say we find an innocent
dialog: on death row. Wouldn't matter.
dialog: Corrections would let him go. Governor
dialog: Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks
dialog: to the good people at DeathWatch,
dialog: the system works.' Yeah, if they
dialog: executed an innocent, and we had
dialog: absolute, undeniable, in-your-face
dialog: proof, we could demand abolition.
dialog: Just like happened in England. Are
dialog: you okay?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (coming out of it)
dialog: Sorry. Yeah.
text: He makes an effort, plays the "good listener."
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: But it hasn't happened, not since
dialog: '76. And won't happen.
text: David nods.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Dead men can't make a case.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Just keep it rational. The death
dialog: penalty is expensive and ineffective.
dialog: No one wants to see a murderer as a
dialog: victim.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Um-hum.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: And stop that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Active listening. I hate active
dialog: listeners. Makes me feel like I'm
dialog: with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares
dialog: more about appearing to listen than
dialog: actually listening. Did you bring
dialog: the Amnesty fax?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can listen and appear to listen at
dialog: the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I
dialog: left it home.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I have a copy.
text: She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack
text: beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is
text: looking out the window, caught in a thought.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You want to tell me what's up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing. Everything. Something
dialog: profoundly stupid happened last night.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (teasing)
dialog: I hope you used a condom.
text: A beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of
dialog: yours?
text: A longer beat. He holds her eyes.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was Berlin.
text: She's stunned, then genuinely angry.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Oh, that's great, great. I can hear
text: the grapevine now. They suspended
dialog: her so Gale could dick her with a
dialog: clear conscience.
text: He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: A power differential equals coercion.
dialog: Great. You are so weak.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Constance, you're not my wife. Thank
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I know you can tell yourself it's a
dialog: position I aspire to, but believe
dialog: me, I would rather...
text: She trails off. They stare at each other a beat. Then, she
text: starts to collect the papers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn't mean --
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Let's go.
text: As she collects, she winces, grabs her side.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Yes, let's just go.
scene_heading: INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - DAY
text: Two people sit in front of monitors displaying various angles
text: on sound stage. The main monitor is playing the end of the
text: show's signation.
scene_heading: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
dialog: In three, two...
scene_heading: ON SOUND STAGE
text: A camera operator cues the host (50s, male, bow tie). The
text: host is flanked by David and Governor Hardin.
text: The set has an upscale regional television look. The Governor
text: has the rare ability to look comfortable while David fidgets.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Welcome back to 'Batter's Box.'
dialog: Tonight we continue our very special
dialog: four-part series with the Governor
dialog: Hardin. Arguing capital punishment
text: with her is DeathWatch coordinator,
dialog: Professor David Gale. Governor, you're
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: Alan, let me say somethin' I always
dialog: say.
text: Constance stands behind the cameras. She motions to David --
text: something about the papers in front of him.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: And I'm gonna keep on sayin.' And
dialog: that is I hate killin.' That's why
dialog: my administration is willing to kill
dialog: to stop it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So you don't subscribe to the idea
dialog: that 'a good state is one that
dialog: protects its most despised members'?
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: It's a nice liberal idea, but like
dialog: most nice liberal ideas, naive.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's a quote from you, Governor,
dialog: from your first state attorney
dialog: campaign.
text: Constance is biting her lip, breaks into a smile. The Governor
text: is unsure how to react, then laughs. The host chuckles with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: You've got me, Professor. But let
dialog: me, in my defense, give you a quote.
dialog: Winston Churchill: 'If you're not a
dialog: liberal at twenty, you've got no
dialog: heart, if you're still a liberal at
dialog: thirty, you've got no brain.'
text: The host's laughter is overdone. David smiles. Constance
text: bites her lip.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So, basically you feel, to choose
dialog: another quote, 'society must be
dialog: cleansed of elements which represent
dialog: its own death.'
text: The Governor makes an animated thinking face.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: Well, yes. I would have to agree.
dialog: (chuckles again)
dialog: Did I say that, too?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, ma'am. That was Hitler.
text: Constance makes a "Yes!" gesture with her hands. The Governor
text: is surprised into silence. The host laughs and, noting her
text: reaction, trails off. David becomes more confident, his tone
dialog: more sincere.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Governor, can't we examine the
dialog: possibility that capital punishment
dialog: isn't working. That murderers aren't
dialog: deterred by the law because they
dialog: have about as much forethought as
dialog: lemmings. That it's expensive,
dialog: inequably administered, that...
text: David cuts his eyes briefly to Constance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: ...that we may even be killing
dialog: innocents.
text: Constance rolls her eyes. The Governor is ready for this.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: All righty, Mr. Gale, I'll play your
dialog: game. Name one. Name one innocent
dialog: man Texas has put to death in my
dialog: tenure. One.
text: A beat. David doesn't respond.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: Name one in the last twenty years.
dialog: In any state in this country.
text: A long, miserable beat.
speaker_heading: HOST
dialog: Well, Mr. Gale?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dead men can't make a case.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: Well, as my daddy used to say: If
dialog: you can't find a problem, there
dialog: probably isn't one.
text: Constance shakes her head in irritation.
scene_heading: BACKSTAGE - LATER
text: The show is over. David and the Governor are shaking hands.
text: Constance stands nearby.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: Well, you certainly had me on that
dialog: Hitler quote.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you, Governor.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: These debates are awfully good for
dialog: the state, don't you think?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: Well, I've got to buzz.
text: She moves toward her handlers.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR HARDIN
dialog: You folks keep up the good work. We
dialog: need that opposition.
text: Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her.
scene_heading: EXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY
text: Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the
text: parking lot.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Your exact words were, 'Just tell me
dialog: when my ego gets in the way of the
dialog: work.' Now I'm telling you: Your
dialog: ego's in the way of work.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (indicating the station)
dialog: Look, I wanted you to do this anyway.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You put up precisely two seconds of
dialog: protest at the thought of a televised
dialog: debate.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: It means DeathWatch suffers because
dialog: you're so anxious to finger authority,
dialog: to publicly prove that David Gale is
dialog: so much fucking smarter than the
dialog: powers that be. Learn to work without
dialog: an audience. Try squeezing money
dialog: from the donor list. Have you ever
dialog: licked one single mail-out envelope?
text: They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are
dialog: standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s).
speaker_heading: MAN #2 (SUIT)
dialog: Mr. Gale?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look, guys, there's not much more to
dialog: say --
speaker_heading: MAN #2
dialog: Rameriz, Austin police. This is
dialog: Officer Haslinger.
text: The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine
text: it more closely.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What, arguing with the Governor is a
dialog: crime?
text: The officers exchange a look.
speaker_heading: MAN #3 (SUIT)
dialog: No, sir, rape is.
text: Constance and David look at each other, stunned.
speaker_heading: OVERHEAD SHOT
text: CAMERA QUICKLY CRANES UP and ROTATES.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

text: she listens to David.
speaker_heading: GUARD (V.O.)
dialog: (over the loudspeaker)
dialog: Gale, time's up.
text: The speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey. David nods over
text: to the guard's booth.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Berlin had my bite marks, bruises,
text: ripped clothing. My skin was beneath
text: her nails. It didn't look like
text: anything but rape. Two days later
dialog: she called the D.A., said she wouldn't
dialog: testify, too drunk to be sure, etc.
text: On the plane home, Sharon read about
text: her husband's rape case being dropped.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Why'd she do it?
text: A guard approaches. David stands up and moves to the back of
text: his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the
text: back to be handcuffed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Finger authority, show she was smarter
dialog: than the powers that be.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Do you know where I can find her?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: First year in here I received a card
dialog: postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't
dialog: signed, but I suspect it was from
dialog: her -- the front had the text 'Sex
dialog: is Power.'
text: Cuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Anything written on it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you
dialog: can know.'
dialog: (exiting the cage)
dialog: See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms.
text: Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the
text: lot is wet.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Try phone records, a net search.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fucking better than watching you
dialog: work.
text: They walk a beat in silence.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You think he's telling the truth?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Don't ask me that. I don't know.
text: There is no truth, only perspectives.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Can't say that. If you say 'there is
dialog: no truth,' you're claiming it's true
dialog: that there is no truth -- it's a
dialog: logical contradiction.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Working on our philosophy merit badge,
dialog: Zack?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I, on the other hand, think Gale's
text: telling the truth.
text: They come to the stairs and start up.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: This you know telepathically?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: It's just my perspective.
text: In a dark corner of the parking lot sits the pickup from the
text: rest area. The older cowboy watches Bitsey and Zack climb
text: the stairs. On his STEREO, PUCCINI plays. Once they are in
text: their rooms, he TURNS UP the opera, closes his eyes, feels
text: the music.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
text: The car moves through an older Austin suburb with wood framed
text: houses (circa 1950) in varying states of repair.
text: It's an overcast day. Zack drives, slowly, searching.
text: Bitsey has the passenger seat fully reclined, lies with her
text: eyes closed.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: DAY TWO.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Thirty-three o what?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Seven.
dialog: (then)
dialog: 'Check out the crime scene in Austin.'
dialog: You made it sound so close. Shit,
dialog: two and half hours and that damn lig --
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Bitsey.
text: She looks up. Zack is pointing at house 3307, which needs
text: paint and a lawn mower. In front of the house is a homemade
text: sign which reads, "David Gale Death House and Museum" See
text: where it happened!" Beneath are the opening hours (12-8);
text: someone has marked them out and scribbled "ring bell."
text: They share a look.
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH OF HOUSE 3307 - DAY
text: Bitsey rings the bell. Zack stomps out a cigarette, points
text: out a worn "Block Home" sign in the window, raises his
text: eyebrows. As Bitsey straightens her skirt, the door is opened
text: by a GOTH GIRL, probably not quite eighteen.
text: She has jet-black hair, nose piercings, tattoos, a Nine Inch
text: Nails T-shirt. METAL MUSIC comes from within.
text: The Goth Girl just looks at them. After an uncomfortable
text: silence, Bitsey extends her hand.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom and this is
dialog: Zack Stemmons. We --
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: You want the tour?
text: Her voice is slacker monotone.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Uh, yes.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: There's a twenty-dollar mandatory
dialog: donation, apiece. But you get a re-
dialog: enactment photo packet. It's got
dialog: five pictures.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Okay.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: I gotta collect first.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Oh, sure.
text: Bitsey reaches in her bag.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: They enter. The room is dark, messy, with an old couch and
text: TV/VCR. A kitchen is adjacent. The walls are full of Goth
text: bric-a-brac: London Batcave poster, one from Burton's
text: Frankenweenie, a couple of fan-zine pictures of Siouxsie and
text: the Banshees. In one corner is a very expensive STEREO, from
text: which THE CURE plays. In another, a dead plant. The Goth
text: Girl turns the MUSIC DOWN.
text: A table near the door has numbered photos beneath a torn and
text: curling sheet of plastic. Small packets of snapshots sit on
text: the table along with a few hand-labelled videos and a book
text: of clippings. There's also a guest book.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: You gotta sign the book. Doesn't
dialog: have to be your real name, though.
text: Bitsey signs in.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: First page says you're here to do
dialog: research on violent crime. The state
dialog: requires it for nonprofit shit.
text: Zack signs in.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: Take a re-enactment photo packet.
text: Bitsey does so. As does Zack.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: If you guys could share one, it would
dialog: be really cool. The butt wipes where
dialog: I do prints kinda jerk my chain.
text: Zack puts his back. Bitsey is looking at a photo: the Goth
text: Girl in her panties and bra laying on the floor with plastic
text: wrap over her head. She's handcuffed and wearing a platinum
text: blonde wig. The pose is half-corpse, half-pinup.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: That's me. My boyfriend took it. We
dialog: also did a video. It's fifty bucks
dialog: 'cause you can see my tits. There's
dialog: a version without tits, that's thirty-
dialog: five.
text: Zack looks at a video, hand-labelled: "Constance Harraway
dialog: Murder (with breasts)! Copyright 1997! Svengali Productions!"
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Do many people take the tour?
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: Not so much anymore. We thought this
dialog: would be like a busy week -- Gale
dialog: gettin' the prune juice and all.
dialog: Prune juice is what death row dudes
dialog: call the poison, 'cause it gives you
dialog: the shits. Most jerks just take a
text: photo from the street. They shot a
dialog: 'Real Crimes' episode here, but the
dialog: owner didn't give us dick.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You don't mind living here?
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: I'm cool with ghouls. Beats livin'
dialog: with my dickwad parents. It starts
dialog: over here.
text: She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a
text: dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler
text: (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has
text: been outlined on the table with white shoe polish.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: She let him crash here sometimes. He
dialog: was like constantly wasted. Drank
dialog: Black Label religiously.
text: Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into
text: the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various
dialog: areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed --
text: the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the
text: patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty
text: pots with dead plants lying around.
text: By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined
dialog: and indexed (#2).
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: This is where the tripod was. My
dialog: boyfriend borrowed the one we usually
dialog: show folks. They never found a camera,
dialog: photos, or videos or anything. Gale
dialog: must have buried them. These serial
text: killer dudes take photos to whack
dialog: off to later.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: He's not exactly a serial killer.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: Whatever.
text: She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of
text: Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are
text: a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing
text: tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on
text: the sink counter (#6).
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: She was like totally naked right
text: here. The meter man saw her through
text: the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped
text: her mouth, then taped a bag over her
dialog: head so she couldn't breathe. My
dialog: boyfriend says that's probably when
dialog: he fucked her. Your muscles tense up
dialog: when you die -- the sex is better.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: He used those housewife gloves so he
dialog: wouldn't leave prints. They found
text: sticky stuff from the tape on them.
text: Zack picks up the gloves.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: We ask folks not to touch the exhibit.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Right.
text: He puts them back.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: The totally sick part was where they
dialog: found the key --
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: We know, you can save that.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: What? Where was it?
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: It was in her stomach, dude. He made
text: her swallow it before he bagged her.
text: A beat. Zack's shocked.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: That's pretty much the highlight.
dialog: Got questions?
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
text: Bitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville.
text: Zack smokes out the window.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: It was in the case file.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder
dialog: than Wisconsin.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (looking in the
dialog: rearview mirror)
dialog: Zack, open your vanity.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: The vanity mirror, pull it down.
text: He does so.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: See that truck behind us?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Isn't that the cowboy from the rest
dialog: area?
text: They look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind
text: them is the older cowboy in his pickup.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Same truck.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Weird coincidence, huh?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Coincidences are always weird, that's
dialog: why they're coincidences.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
text: Bitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the
text: day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking
text: in hushed tones.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Off-the-record?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Alright, we're off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Constance was murdered with what's
dialog: called the Securitat Method. You're
text: hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the
text: key, taped at the mouth, a bag's
dialog: sealed over your head and you're
text: left to suffocate. The Securitat did
dialog: this to Romanians who wouldn't inform
dialog: or confess. Sometimes the bag was
dialog: ripped off at the last second, you
dialog: got a second chance. If not, you die
dialog: knowing the 'key' to your freedom
dialog: was inside you the whole time. A
dialog: cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem
dialog: is I mentioned the method in an early
dialog: article. The prosecution never knew.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: You're telling me someone's framing
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's more than that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: There was a tripod.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Right, facing her body. Are we on?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (nods agreement)
text: Not a single print was found on it.
dialog: Someone brought it, wiped it, left
dialog: it. Why? It's as if they wanted me
dialog: to know that somewhere there's a
dialog: record of what really happened that
dialog: afternoon. As if they wanted me to
dialog: die knowing the key to my freedom
dialog: was... out there.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Maybe you're being paranoid?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ms. Bloom. I'm an anti-death row
dialog: activist on death row. Doesn't that
dialog: strike you as odd?
text: A beat. She nods.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Any ideas who 'they' are?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But I have someone on it, someone
dialog: I'm hoping will one day find an
dialog: answer.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Belyeu's hired a detective?
text: He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A journalist.
text: It takes Bitsey a second to understand. David smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (mimicking Belyeu)
dialog: 'She's a smart one.'

text: ACCELERATED ROTATING ZOOM IN.
text: David and Constance stand by the double doors. He's
text: concentrated; she's biting her lip. They're looking onto a
text: large parking lot.
text: The lot is practically empty except for Sharon and Chase,
text: who stand near their Jeep. It's packed with various household
text: items, things not entrusted to movers.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I'll drop by your office after.
text: He nods and goes out.
scene_heading: EXT. U.T. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: As David approaches them, Chase runs to them -- still carrying
text: Cloud Dog. He jumps on his dad.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Wear me like a fur, Daddy! Wear me
dialog: like a fur!
text: As he walks, David drapes the boy sideways over his shoulders
text: (like a fur). Chase squeals with pleasure.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who's your hero?
text: Chase bonks him on the nose. David sets Chase down when he
text: reaches his WIFE. He kiss him goodbye as the boy struggles
text: to move on to something else. A long beat as David and his
text: wife stand uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Call me when you get to Boston?
speaker_heading: SHARON (WIFE)
dialog: Yeah.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wish you --
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Don't.
text: She turns and walks to the Jeep. The door's open.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Chase, get in, Sweetie.
text: Chase climbs in, sits in the driver's seat.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: (turning to his dad)
dialog: See ya later, Alli-gator.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: After awhile, Crocodile.
speaker_heading: CHASE
dialog: Take it easy, Japa-ne-se.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okey-dokey, Artichokey.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (to Chase)
dialog: Scoot.
text: Chase scoots over to the passenger seat. Sharon gets in the
text: driver's seat.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: I sent you an e-mail.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: Just read it.
text: She closes the door. Suddenly, Chase opens the passenger
text: side door, runs around the Jeep carrying Cloud Dog. He runs
text: to his dad, hugs him one last time.
speaker_heading: SHARON
dialog: (cracking her window)
dialog: Come on, Chase.
text: Chase starts to go back, turns and hands David his Cloud Dog
text: without comment. He then quickly runs back around the Jeep
text: and gets in.
text: David watches them drive away. Chase's hand waves out the
text: window until they are out of the parking lot.
scene_heading: INSERT - COMPUTER SCREEN

scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S U.T. OFFICE - DAY
text: David sits in front of his computer, staring into space.
text: The office is institutional, cramped. Books line the walls,
text: fill the desk.
text: There's a framed poster (Warhol-style) of Socrates. He reaches
text: into his desk for a bottle of Black Bush and fills his glass.
text: There's a KNOCK on the door. Constance enters.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You could at least hide the bottle.
text: David closes the e-mail. She collapses in the chair opposite
text: his desk, exhausted.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Officially, you're on sabbatical.
dialog: Unofficially, they want you to look
dialog: for another position. It was four to
dialog: two.
text: A beat as he absorbs the information.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How did Ross vote?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You're not supp... Against you.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So, I wanted to get your feedback on

text: The Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread.
speaker_heading: IVY LEAGUER
dialog: Look, Professor Gale, I could sit
dialog: here, as I'm sure others have, and
dialog: plead departmental cutbacks. Claim
dialog: you need more publications, or I

dialog: geschichte. Your record's brilliant.
dialog: You're an original voice worth -- in
dialog: the scarcity-defines-value capitalist
dialog: system under which we toil -- your
dialog: weight in gold. Hell, it's not even
dialog: the alcohol. It'd be nice to have
dialog: faculty whose crutch wasn't Prozac.
dialog: But, to speak plainly, if I hire
dialog: you, in the eyes of the regents,
dialog: alumni and every freshman with an

scene_heading: EXT./INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: David stands on the balcony of a sparsely-furnished 420-a-

speaker_heading: DAVID'S POV
text: A horribly-tanned man in his seventies (wearing a Speedo)
dialog: attempts to do Tai Chi.
speaker_heading: CHASE (V.O.)
dialog: (on his mom's answering

dialog: We aren't home. Please, tell us a

speaker_heading: SHARON (V.O.)
dialog: (cueing him in the

text: At the beep.
speaker_heading: CHASE (V.O.)
text: At the peep.
speaker_heading: ON DAVID
text: David lets the PHONE BEEP, just stares down at the man, saying
dialog: nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT - DAY
text: As David gets out of his Volvo, a SORORITY PLEDGE (funny
text: clothes, Greek letters on her cheek) quickly approaches.
text: She takes his picture with a Polaroid camera.
text: She runs to a waiting convertible, where two other girls
dialog: sit.
scene_heading: SORORITY PLEDGE
dialog: I got it! I got it!
text: She jumps in the car and they speed away.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH-RISE OFFICE - DAY
text: The office is Philip Stark chic with large window walls --
text: Austin stretches into the distance. David sits on a sofa
text: across from an exceedingly ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (early 40s).
speaker_heading: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dialog: What exactly attracts you to the
dialog: bond market?
text: He's staring into space.
speaker_heading: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dialog: Mr. Gale?
text: He looks at her. She forces a strained smile.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Dark. David lies on the floor, his head propped against a
text: wall. He's in his underwear and drinking from a Black Bush
text: bottle. The phone's beside his ear and Chase's MESSAGE on
text: his wife's MACHINE TWEAKS out of the receiver speaker. After
text: the BEEP, David hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches re-
text: dial. The MESSAGE STARTS again.
text: After the BEEP, he hangs up, gets a DIAL TONE, and punches
dialog: re-dial.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY
text: David is in the office of an overdressed YUPPIE BLACK MAN

speaker_heading: YUPPIE MAN
dialog: (over-articulating)
dialog: Now, Mr. Gale, I want you to tell me
dialog: three personal qualities you have
dialog: that would make you a successful
dialog: Radio Shack manager.
scene_heading: EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
text: David and Belyeu approach a ball fifty feet from the green.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Because divorce proceedings do not
dialog: require her presence in the country.
dialog: For a custody hearin', yeah, she'll
dialog: have to return.
text: David chooses a club.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: But without successful completion of
dialog: an alcohol treatment program, you'll
dialog: be lucky to get the odd Thanksgivin'.
text: David walks to the ball.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So my chances of getting partial
dialog: custody aren't good?
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Roughly the same as you sinkin' that
dialog: from here.
text: David looks at him, then concentrates on the ball -- suddenly
text: it has meaning. He swings. The ball lands in a water trap.
scene_heading: INT. PICTURESQUE MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY
text: David's Volvo winds up the road, enters through a gate. A
text: sign beside the gate: "The Go lightly: A Recovery Clinic."
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - DAY
text: It's a beautiful day. The house looks much different than in
text: the Goth Girl's care -- flower bed, well-manicured lawn,
text: fresh paint. The "Block Home" sign is in the window. David's
text: Volvo pulls up in front.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CONSTANCE'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY
text: Constance opens the door for David. He's wearing a short
text: sleeved Radio Shack shirt and tie. She's taken aback.
text: Looks at him a beat, bites her lip, suppresses a laugh.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: He plays hurt, then they both burst out laughing.
scene_heading: LONG SHOT - CONSTANCE AND DAVID
text: She hugs him as they laugh on the porch.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: The living room is now Laura Ashley cozy. The sliding door
text: is open so the room's sunny, breezy. Constance leads David
text: in. She looks tired but is animated, a bit too much so. Her
dialog: hair is different.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You look good.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I feel... washed.
text: She smiles at him maternally, touches his face. They hug
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (lightly, in his arms)
dialog: I need you. DeathWatch needs you,
dialog: now more than ever.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Nothing like I need you, both. You're
dialog: all I have.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Look.
text: She moves from him, takes a photo from a case file on her
text: kitchen table.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: Jo Ann Johnson's been re-scheduled.
scene_heading: INSERT - PHOTO
text: of a young black women -- pleasant, timid.
scene_heading: BACK ON SCENE
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I've got a call with Hawkins tonight,
dialog: and if national will commit emergency
dialog: funds...
text: She lifts a small plant, moves to the porch.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jo Ann will be commuted and you'll
dialog: only prove the system works.
text: He notices she has bruises on her arms.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: But I'll save a life.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (referring to the
dialog: bruises)
dialog: Where'd you get those?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Spring cleaning.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTANCE'S PORCH
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: She went up at 18, she's 26 now.
text: She sets the plant down among others. At the very back of
text: the yard, the Older Cowboy spades in a vegetable garden.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (calling to the Cowboy)
dialog: Hey! She ever not make you work when
dialog: you come by?
speaker_heading: OLDER COWBOY
text: (raising his spade in
dialog: greeting)
dialog: Mornin', David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (turning to Constance)
dialog: What's her story?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I really want us to get behind this
dialog: one. She's articul --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Constance, who did she kill?
text: Constance looks at him a beat, sighs.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: A cop.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She admit to it?
text: Contance sheepishly nods.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're a crazy woman. Not your medium
dialog: grade thinks-she's-Teddy Roosevelt's-
text: bathrobe, but stark-raving-loose-
text: screws-in-the-belfry insane.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You're mixing metaphors.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A real danger to flora and fauna.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Are we gonna do this?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (the smile)
dialog: And how.
text: He kisses her on the forehead -- he's surprised.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're burning up.
scene_heading: EXT. STARBUCKS - NIGHT
text: David exits the store carrying four large coffees in a cup-
text: container, tries to sip one without spilling the others.
text: He's still wearing the Radio Shack shirt, seems happier.
text: In the parking lot, a hip high schooler jumps out of his
text: Camero and moves toward the store. As David comes in front
text: of the car, he sees his former baby-sitter sitting in the
text: passenger seat. Their eyes meet. He smiles. She smiles back,
text: waves. As he passes, he hears the girl hit the car's automatic
scene_heading: DOOR-LOCK BUTTON.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE OF DEATHWATCH (AUSTIN) - NIGHT
text: David enters carrying the coffee. The matron sits on a desk
text: licking envelopes. The college guy is on the floor beneath a
text: desk rewiring a computer terminal.
speaker_heading: COLLEGE GUY
dialog: (calling from beneath
dialog: a desk)
dialog: Howdy, Mr. Gale.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello, folks.
text: David goes to the Matron, gives her cup and three Sweet &amp;
dialog: Lows.
speaker_heading: MATRON
dialog: Hello. My, this is service. Thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Gladly.
text: He takes one of the unsealed envelopes from her stack, then
text: puts a cup beside the legs of the College Guy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Latte on your left, partner.
text: David makes his way to the back office. The College Guy gives
text: the Matron a look -- they're surprised, pleased.
scene_heading: INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY
text: Constance sits at a spartan desk. Nothing is on the walls,
text: though a window opens onto the alley behind. She's talking
text: on the SPEAKER PHONE with the DeathWatch national director --
text: a social gathering is going on behind him.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.O.)
dialog: ...and see what kind of resources
dialog: the religious groups can deliver.
text: David comes through the door. She waves him in.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I'm sure we can get some pulpit time,
dialog: maybe cable.
text: He sets her coffee in front of her. Then sits across from
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.O.)
dialog: Cable's good. Listen, I need to run.
dialog: For now, I agree the first press
dialog: release should focus on the woman's
dialog: youth.
text: David holds up the envelope for Constance to see, then
text: animatedly licks and seals it. He then, literally, pats
text: himself on the back.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.O.)
dialog: I'll have the Washington people look
dialog: into counsel competency, though I'm
dialog: almost sure she's exhausted this
dialog: issue on appeal.
text: She smiles at him, shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (to the phone)
dialog: John, David's going to --
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, I almost forgot. He's not around,
dialog: is he?
text: Constance hesitates, looks at David. He shakes his head no.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.O.)
dialog: Good, keep it that way. His
text: relationship to DeathWatch is over,
dialog: terminated. Last thing we need is
dialog: this rape thing coming back to bite
dialog: our butts.
text: Constance is not sure how to react. David just stares at
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.O.)
dialog: These guys don't stay on the wagon
dialog: for very long.
text: David stands up and leaves the room, quickly. His coffee
text: spills. Constance can only watch.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR (V.O.)
dialog: I'm serious, Constance. Ban him from
dialog: the premises. I realize you two...
scene_heading: EXT. DEATHWATCH OFFICE (AUSTIN) - NIGHT
text: Constance comes anxiously out the front door.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE'S POV
text: David's Volvo pulls out of the parking lot.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: She stands watching it drive away, breathing heavily. She
text: winces, grabs her stomach, vomits on the sidewalk.
scene_heading: EXT. AUSTIN STREET - NIGHT
text: The Volvo is parked on a seedy Southside street. David stands
text: at a phone booth and dials a long-distance number and a
text: calling code. He waits, impatiently, looks across the street:
dialog: There's a liquor store.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - RECEIVER
text: at his ear, Chase's MESSAGE BEGINS.
speaker_heading: BACK ON DAVID
text: He speaks into the PHONE after the BEEP.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sharon, pick up. For once just pick
dialog: up the goddamn phone! If you keep
dialog: him in Spain, I'll... I'm begging
dialog: you. He's my son! Please! Please....
dialog: Please.
text: David starts to put the receiver back, then suddenly starts
text: smashing it against the phone's body; he smashes it long
text: after there is anything left to destroy, long after his hand
text: bleeds.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NEXT DAY
text: Constance walks with car keys and a large stack of mail toward
text: her front porch. She looks like she hasn't slept in weeks.
text: David is sitting on the porch beneath the Block Home sign,
text: holding Cloud Dog. He wears the Yale sweatshirt, the Radio
text: Shack shirt is wrapped around his injured hand. He's sloppy
dialog: drunk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're seeking refuse, refuge, uge.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Come on, come inside.
text: She opens the door as he stands.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We fell off our wagon.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: David enters rambling, stands leaning against the back of
text: the couch, holding the sheep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Know why Saint Jude is the patron
dialog: saint of lost causes? 'Cause his
dialog: real name was Judas. There were two
dialog: Judases, Judai, the saint guy and
dialog: the bad Judas who ratted on Jesus,
text: and tried to kiss him. Medievalers
dialog: wouldn't pray to good Judas for fear
dialog: of getting bad Judas on the line by
dialog: mistake. Ergo, they only gave him
dialog: business when really desperate. That's
dialog: why. Then they changed his name.
text: She's not in the room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Constance?
text: He looks back toward the entry hall. A small flyer lightly
text: blows along the floor into the living room.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your mail's blowing.
text: He looks in the entry hall.
speaker_heading: ENTRY HALL
text: Constance lies unconscious on the floor near the open door.
text: The mail is scattered about her.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: David sleeps in a chair, on the floor beside him is a stack
text: of vending-machine coffee cups. A typical hospital INTERCOM
text: can be heard throughout the scene.
text: A female DOCTOR (mid-30s) sits beside him, lightly shakes
text: his shoulder. He wakes, groggy.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: How we doing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fine. How's Constance?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Sleeping.
text: A beat as he collects himself, sits up.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
text: Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's
dialog: condition is highly susceptible to
dialog: external stress. While we don't want
dialog: to totally restrict Constance's life --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Constance's illness requires a degree
dialog: of regularity.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Constance has leukemia?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Acute. She was diagnosed last fall.
text: A beat as the situation clarifies for both of them. David is
text: stunned, the doctor embarrassed.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Have I created a problem?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, no.
text: They sit in silence. The hospital intercom seems to say:
speaker_heading: GUARD (V.O.)
dialog: Gale, time's up.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - DAVID
scene_heading: CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
speaker_heading: WHITE.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - CLOSEUP - BITSEY - DAY
text: CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. Bitsey stares at David, engrossed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: When I asked why she hadn't told me,
dialog: she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess
dialog: she figured as long as death was
dialog: chasing her, she could help others
dialog: escape.
text: He stands, goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Constance left the world better than
dialog: she found it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's a small, difficult thing.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as
text: far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
text: Zack waits in the driver's seat, smoking. He looks nervously
text: through the windshield toward the pens. Bitsey raps on the
text: window, startling him.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fuck.
text: Zack unlocks the door, throws his cigarette out. Bitsey opens
text: the door and gets in.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: (waving her hand at
dialog: the smoke)
dialog: For God's sake, Zack.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You're not a happy camper.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: It's not a happy place.
text: He STARTS the CAR.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Talked to the Austin prosecutor.
dialog: Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he
dialog: fucked up the penalty phase, says
dialog: Gale probably would have gotten life
dialog: on mitigating factors. Gale stuck
dialog: with him, though, all through appeals,
dialog: despite major pro bono offers.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: What else?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money
dialog: in Houston tonight, overheat light
dialog: came on twice, and you're about to
dialog: get a surprise.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I don't want a surprise.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (pointing ahead)
dialog: Too late.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY
text: The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down.
text: Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car.
text: All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked
text: in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where
text: another Highway patrol car is stationed.
text: The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only
text: vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people
text: in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive.
text: The rental car ENTERS the FRAME.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR
text: Bitsey and Zack approach the guardhouse.
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: This is mostly an Oklahoma caravan.
dialog: I got stuck behind them on the way
dialog: in.
text: The guardhouse attendant looks in, waves them through as the
text: crossing guard lifts.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Execution's not for another 36 hours.
dialog: It's gonna be a zoo. There's the
dialog: P.R. guy.
text: Standing among the six people in ponchos is Duke Grover.
text: They pass him in SLOW MOTION. He sees them, smiles, makes a
text: "Hello" shooting-gesture.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: What a life, waiting around for
dialog: someone to die.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fuck, look.
text: The next-to-last vehicle on the left is the Older Cowboy's
text: pickup. He sits inside talking with another man. The Older
text: Cowboy sees them, touches his hat as they pass.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: This is a little too coincidental.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The rental car passes a farmhouse.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR
text: Bitsey and Zack are headed to Huntsville.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: 'Cause I couldn't see the license
dialog: plate.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Forget it. What time is it?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: 6:05. Why don't you have a watch?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: It's a long story.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The rental car passes a black teenager hitchhiking in front
text: of an abandoned vegetable stand.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY
text: Bitsey and Zack make their way to their rooms. Zack's is
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Give me an hour.
scene_heading: INT. ZACK'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY
text: Zack unlocks his door, enters. The room's a mess, papers
text: everywhere. He walks toward a portable computer sitting on
text: the room desk.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Zack!
text: Zack runs from the room.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DAY
text: Zack runs towards Bitsey. She stands outside her room.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: It's open.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: So? Maybe the maid forgot.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Look!
text: As he comes to her door, he sees what she's indicating:
text: Between the door and its frame, someone has stuck a roll of
text: duct tape.
scene_heading: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - DAY
text: Bitsey pushes the door open, looks in and around. She sees
text: something, enters. Zack enters behind her, sees what she
dialog: sees.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I'll check the bathroom.
text: He goes. She approaches the middle of the room.
text: The room, in contrast to Zack's, is perfectly neat. It has
text: two twin beds. The nightstand has been moved to the center.
text: On it is a lamp, turned on. Suspended just above the lamp, a
text: VHS cartridge hangs from the ceiling by fishing line.
scene_heading: BITSEY'S BATHROOM
text: Zack checks behind the shower curtain.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Clear in here! Don't touch it!
scene_heading: BACK IN BEDROOM
text: As Zack enters, he sees Bitsey holding the VHS Cassette.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fuck, Bitsey, there could have been
dialog: prints.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Look.
text: She holds up the cassette. It has a label typed from an old
dialog: typewriter: "For Bitsey Bloom."
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX RECEPTION - DUSK
text: Zack runs out the front door carrying a VCR, the cables drag
text: the ground behind him. He runs toward the rooms.
scene_heading: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK
text: Bitsey unlocks the door, lets Zack in.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: She says no one asked for you. And
text: all the room keys are different.
text: He goes to the TV.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Just she and her husband have masters.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: What did you tell her?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: That you have a jealous boyfriend.
text: He starts to hook up the VCR.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Thanks. How about the V.C.R.?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: She didn't ask. I think she assumed
dialog: it had something to do with why he
dialog: was jealous. I still say we should
dialog: do this in my room -- this one's a
dialog: fucking crime scene.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Whoever got in here -- without a key
dialog: in broad daylight -- was probably
dialog: smart enough not to leave prints. I
dialog: have the remote.
text: He turns ON the TV.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try
dialog: three.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (hitting the remote)
dialog: They don't look for D.N.A. when
text: someone breaks in to deliver, Zack.
dialog: Here.
text: She hands him the tape. He starts to put it in, hesitates,
text: looks back at her.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: You sure you want to see what's on
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No. Start it.
text: He puts it in, pushes play. She sits on the bed. He sits
text: beside her. They watch the black leader appear.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I hope this isn't what I think it
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - TV
text: An image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen
text: floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera.
text: An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the
text: neck with duct tape. Her hands are handcuffed behind her.
text: She appears dead.
speaker_heading: BITSEY (O.S.)
dialog: God, no.
speaker_heading: ZACK (O.S.)
dialog: Fuck. Is it her?
speaker_heading: BITSEY (O.S.)
dialog: Turn it up.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: They stare at the screen, she bites a thumbnail. He turns
text: the sound up.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE 3307 - KITCHEN - DAY (ON TV)
text: Hi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner
text: than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged.
text: Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside
text: out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on
text: the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner
text: of the screen is part of what looks like a towel.
text: The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR
text: contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so
text: can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER.
text: Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to
text: life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then
text: jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the
text: counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her
text: stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She
text: desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip
text: the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her
text: covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to
text: rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK
text: Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate
text: and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon.
text: After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Belyeu says to bring the tape first
dialog: thing tomorrow. Also said you were
dialog: right about not calling the police.
text: A beat, she keeps looking straight on.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Are you gonna be okay?
text: Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes.
text: She shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts
text: his arms around her as she starts to cry.
scene_heading: INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes.
text: The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack
text: of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the
text: distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they
text: wait until she leaves. Hushed tones.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Let's say Gale's right. Some sick-
dialog: fuck-Agatha Christie-wannabe set him
text: up, arranged like the perfect murder.
dialog: Why send a magazine journalist proof
dialog: a few hours before he's won? Doesn't
dialog: make sense.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No, it's perfect. He knows News
dialog: Magazine won't give the scoop to the
dialog: dailies or nightly news, not after
dialog: having paid for it. Probably guessed
dialog: we wouldn't call the cops. And, most
dialog: importantly, knows I'll tell Gale
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Why does he give a shit?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Zack, what if Harraway's murder was
dialog: just a means to getting Gale. I mean
text: sending him through hell, a sick cat
dialog: and mouse game. You kill the one
dialog: person he has left. Make sure he
dialog: sits six years on death row for the
dialog: murder -- a place he's made a public
dialog: career of loathing. And then just
dialog: let him die, die knowing everyone
dialog: will remember him with disgust. You
dialog: destroy his loved ones, his life's
dialog: work, his memory -- and you make him
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: That's a lot of hate. You're talking
dialog: beyond sadism.
text: Bitsey gestures to the tape, makes a need-I-say-more face.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Then why release it?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: If the mouse dies the game's over.
text: Maybe the cat's enjoying himself.
dialog: Or...
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Or?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (picks up the tape)
dialog: Imagine walking to the chamber knowing
dialog: this exists.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: The 'cat' is a fucking psychopath.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Yeah, but smart.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT
text: The storm batters the motel. We see Bitsey's dark front
text: window. Lightning. A figure stands looking out. More
text: lightning. It's Bitsey, intently watching the night.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: DAY THREE
text: On the back seat is an aluminum suitcase. Zack sits beside
text: it looking out the back window. Bitsey drives.
text: It's still raining, hard. They're on the two-lane highway to
dialog: Austin.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Why do they call it check-book
dialog: journalism if we always pay cash?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON DASH
text: The over-heat light is on.
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Woa, woa. Sadist at six o'clock!
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Is it the truck?
speaker_heading: ZACK'S POV
text: The cowboy's truck can be seen through the tire mist fifty
text: yards behind them.
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: Yep, and doing a lousy job of hiding.
text: Bitsey watches in the rearview mirror. Zack out the back
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: He must think we're idiots. You think
dialog: he's our fucked-up feline?
text: Bitsey doesn't respond, just watches in the mirror, then:
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Is he gaining?
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: No. Just sitting back there.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Can you see the license?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Too much mist. What the fuck does
dialog: this guy want?
scene_heading: INT. LAW OFFICE OF BENJAMIN BELYEU - DAY
text: The office has a view of the rain-soaked capital.
text: Expensively decorated. Dark woods and deep carpets --
text: Belyeu's practice is clearly thriving. A sharp-looking CLERK
text: sits at a corner table counting money from the aluminum
text: suitcase. Bitsey sits on a huge sofa. Belyeu stands just
text: outside his door.
speaker_heading: BELYEU (O.S.)
dialog: Fine. Oh, and bring in Miss Bloom's
dialog: original when that's done.
dialog: (entering, to Bitsey)
dialog: Don't blame you for not watching
dialog: that twice.
text: He goes to his desk and starts sifting through papers.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I couldn't sleep afterwards.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: I understand. I generally tell folks
dialog: I'm no more afraid of the grim reaper
dialog: than I am of a Presbyterian on
dialog: Mother's Day. But watching your
dialog: tape... well. I had to keep tellin'
dialog: myself 'that's not Constance' just
dialog: to get through.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Unfortunately, others may argue the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Yeah, but it's her kitchen, in her
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Currently home to Weirdos
dialog: Incorporated. Arguably, that tape
dialog: could have been made by anybody with
dialog: twenty dollars and a tolerance for
dialog: vulgarity.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: But it will at least get us a
dialog: postponement?
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: I hope so, Miss Bloom, I certainly
dialog: hope so. But you've got to remember
dialog: that there's a machine a runnin'.
dialog: And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin'
dialog: that machine wants to be fed.
text: The Clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: All here, Mr. Belyeu.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: (to the Clerk)
dialog: Thank you, Joshua.
dialog: (to Bitsey)
dialog: To add to our troubles, your own
dialog: credibility may come into question.
text: The Clerk exits.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: You've been fraternizin' with the
text: condemned. In the court's eyes, he's
dialog: the most likely candidate to have
dialog: put you onto the tape. He's a
dialog: persuasive man, you're a out-of-state
dialog: woman -- it don't look good on paper.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: But someone put it in my hotel room.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: A fact for which we have no evidence.
text: A very professional-looking assistant enters, hands Bitsey
text: her video.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Thank you, Bobbi.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Well, let's not start readin' Kafka
dialog: just yet. Could we find a sympathetic
dialog: judge. I'll file within the hour.
dialog: You headin' back over to Ellis?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Fine. I'll call over at the motel
dialog: later and give you an update.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY
text: Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold
text: "Belyeu and Crane" sign. She turns a corner.
text: At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator,
text: pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an
text: adjacent window at the capital in the rain. She remembers
text: something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Shit.
text: She heads back toward Belyeu's office.
text: As she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the
dialog: Belyeu and Crane office.
scene_heading: EXT. AUSTIN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
text: Bitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental
text: car parked in the loading zone.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY
text: Bitsey opens the door. Zack's in the passenger seat. She
text: doesn't bother to sit.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Did you see the cowboy go in?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: He went in Belyeu's building?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: Into his office. Just saw him.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fuck!
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: Follow him. Find out who he is, where
dialog: he lives -- what he --
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: How are you gonna get to Ellis?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: A taxi.
text: Zack makes a face.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE - DAY
text: A taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and
text: press that now gather along the drive.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY
text: Bitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David.
text: She's upset.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to
dialog: sit.
text: Over the loudspeaker:
speaker_heading: GUARD (V.O.)
dialog: Visitors need to stay seated.
text: She sits.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to the microphone
dialog: above)
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: (to Bitsey)
dialog: Look at me. He's not your man. His
dialog: name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch
dialog: Director before Constance. He's a
dialog: 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a
dialog: good demonstration has to end in a
dialog: riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs
dialog: don't mean shit.' They fired him.
dialog: Constance kept him in the
dialog: organization, and he loved her for
dialog: it. The man adored her.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Then why was he following us? Why
dialog: was he at Belyeu and Crane?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U.
dialog: cases together, until Dusty punched
text: a clansman in a federal court. Benny
dialog: sometimes still gives him work,
dialog: probably had him follow you.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Why?
text: A beat. David looks up at the microphone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: To make sure you honored your
dialog: agreement, one for which there's no
dialog: contract.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: He would've said something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He's a lawyer, Ms. Bloom.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Maybe Dusty was jealous because you
dialog: were seeing Constance.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wasn't 'seeing' Constance.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: She died... she had your sperm --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's more complicated than that.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - MED. SHOT - DAVID - SUNRISE (ROTATING CAMERA)
text: David sits in a lawn chair beside his Volvo. The tailgate's
text: down, serving as a makeshift table for a coffee thermos and
text: whiskey bottle. David stares off down the alley, clearly in
text: pain. He holds a child's drawing.
scene_heading: INSERT - DRAWING
text: Has Gaudi's church and a matador in background. Prominent in
text: the foreground are three labeled figures: Sharon ("Mommy"),
text: Chase ("Me") and a dark-haired man ("Papa Jorge"). Jorge is
text: dressed in a tux, Sharon seems to wear a bridal gown.
scene_heading: INT. DEATHWATCH AUSTIN OFFICE - SUNRISE (6:09)
text: The atmosphere is tense. Dusty Wright sits on a deskholding
text: a red Magic Marker, the matron sits behind it.
text: They look at the college guy, who closely watches a computer
dialog: screen.
text: In the center of the room, a middle-aged priest sits and
text: quietly prays while holding the hands of an overweight woman,
text: she murmurs quiet affirmations.
text: Finally, the college guy looks up at Dusty, nods. The room's
text: occupants all exchange glances.
text: Dusty walks to the photo wall, marks a cross through the
text: photo of Jo Ann Johnson, then walks to the back office.
scene_heading: INT. BACK OFFICE - SUNRISE
text: Constance, wrapped in an afghan, sleeps on a futon. She's
text: shockingly anemic.
text: Dusty kneels beside her, watches her sleep. After a beat,
text: she wakes with a slight jolt -- like someone whose been
text: fighting to stay awake. She looks at him, then sees the marker
text: in his hand. She looks away.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: All I can feel is envy.
text: Dusty stands, goes to the alley window.
speaker_heading: DUSTY'S POV
text: David's Volvo is parked just outside the window. David sits
text: in a lawn chair behind it. David looks awful.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - SUNRISE
text: In the window, Dusty holds up the marker. David nods.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE 3307 - CONSTANCE'S BACK YARD - DUSK
text: David sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of Black
text: Bush in the chair beside him. He's staring at nothing.
text: Constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a
text: turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. She goes to
text: the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. They
text: silently survey the yard, the sunset. She hugs the bottle,
text: he sips his drink.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Remember those Kubler-Ross stages,
dialog: the ones the dying go through?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Denial, anger, bargaining, depression,
dialog: and acceptance. Where are you?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Denial.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Denial's my personal favorite.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: The whole idea of there being a
dialog: process makes me tired. I'm not up
dialog: to the job of Dying Person. Marveling
text: at blades of grass. Lecturing
text: strangers to relish every moment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Mending bridges.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: Mending bridges. Confessing regrets.
dialog: Uuuggh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No regrets?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Nope.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Take that back. I wish I had a child.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I'm sorry, David.
text: She reaches over and puts her hand on his arm.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I guess I just wish I would have
dialog: risked more.
text: She has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a
dialog: swig.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: (making a face,
dialog: swallowing hard)
dialog: Uumm, also not enough sex. Should
dialog: have had more sex.
text: She puts the bottle down beside her chair.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much... how many lovers have you
dialog: had?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Including college?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Including college.
text: Her hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, it's... not every... yeah, you
dialog: should have had more sex.
text: She laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off
text: into the yard. He takes her hand in his.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: You work hard not to be seen as a
dialog: sex object. Before long, you're not
dialog: seen at all.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I see you.
text: They are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs'
text: armrests.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Want to make it five? Finish the
dialog: hand?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: A pity lay. No thanks.
text: A beat. They watch their fingers lightly play with one
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It wouldn't be pity.
text: They turn, their eyes meet, hold.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Constance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one
text: hand supports her head, the other strokes her face.
text: They tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Don't worry.
text: He kisses her neck.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: It's good.
text: Moves up to her ear.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Talk to me. Let me hear your voice.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (in her ear)
dialog: I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy.
text: He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm.
text: Her moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless
text: whispers, meld into one another.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Hold me tight.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm here.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Tight... I'm scared.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's okay.
text: She's begun to cry.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay.
text: He stops moving, kisses her tears.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay
dialog: in me.
text: He moves again, slowly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shhh. I'm staying.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I need to feel you inside.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I'm so tired.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know, I know.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: Tired of being afraid.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: CONSTANCE

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shhh. I'm here. I'm here.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTANCE'S HOUSE (3307) - NIGHT
text: The house is dark. A light in one of the rooms comes on.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: She's awake as David enters. He opens the curtains, sets a
text: glass of water beside bottles on the nightstand. He crawls
text: on top of the covers, spoons her, nuzzles the back of her
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: How do you feel about last night?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Rescued. You?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Like I have a reason to get out of
dialog: bed. Ironic, huh?
scene_heading: EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - DAY
text: David goes to the pay phone against the building.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Constance stands in a bathrobe beside her shower. Turns the
text: water on. She's caught in a thought, bites her lip.
text: She turns the water off.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT POOL AREA - DAY
text: David sits in a lounger speaking to someone on his right.
text: He's sober.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let's say they move back from Spain,
dialog: that I somehow got my one weekend a
dialog: month. Would it matter? By high
dialog: school, I'd be his weak spot, the
text: focus of locker room jabs, embarrassed
dialog: pride. In college there'd be late-
dialog: night angst: 'What if I turn out
dialog: like the old man?' Holidays would be
text: forced smiles and unscheduled exits.
dialog: I mean, what girl comes home with
dialog: you if there's talk that Pops is a
dialog: rapist?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't stand the idea of being his
dialog: model of failure. Without him, I
dialog: drink. To cover the hole. To prove
dialog: to myself he's better off without
dialog: me.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Dusty Wright sitting in the
text: lounger beside him.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Constance, still in her robe, puts an armful of sheets in
text: the washing machine. She feels faint.
scene_heading: EXT. FORMER GALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
text: David sits in a swing set, rocks slowly. He's simply looking
text: at the house. A yuppie woman opens the back door.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (standing)
dialog: Sorry, just leaving.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Constance is quickly sorting through a box of memorabilia, a
text: photo catches her attention.
scene_heading: INSERT - PHOTO
text: Constance on vacation in a Caribbean resort. She sits alone
text: at a dinner table, looks to camera, seems surprised to be
dialog: photographed.
scene_heading: BACK ON SCENE
text: As Constance contemplates the photo, she hears the DOORBELL
dialog: ring.
scene_heading: EXT. LAWN - FROM ABOVE - DAY
text: We see David lying in the grass of recently-cut lawn.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - DUSK
text: David in the car in a mall parking lot, staring at nothing.
text: On the seat beside him is Cloud Dog and a half empty Black
dialog: Bush bottle.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S VOLVO - NIGHT
text: David's asleep, using Cloud Dog as a pillow. The bottle is
text: empty.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - BITSEY AND DAVID - DAY
text: ROTATING CAMERA. Bitsey's agitated. David's drained.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: But there has to be someone. Someone
dialog: with a motive, who knew you both.
dialog: Someone who visited that morning.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: If I could answer... we wouldn't be
dialog: having this conversation. It's why I
dialog: need you, why I chose you. You have
dialog: my story, now...
dialog: (mimicking her delivery)
dialog: 'Go.'
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: There's not enough time.
text: The guard approaches.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You'll find time.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: You know that's not what I meant.
dialog: You should have done this earlier.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're not here to save me. You're
dialog: here to save my son's memory of his
dialog: father -- that's all I want.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: You're going to let them kill you.
text: David moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We live to stop death. Eating,
dialog: inventing, loving, praying, fighting,
dialog: killing -- choose a verb. All to
dialog: stall this evil, Job's 'king of
dialog: terrors.' But what do we really know
dialog: about it? Nobody comes back. There's
dialog: a point, when your mind out-lives
dialog: its obsessions, when your habits
dialog: survive your dreams, when your
dialog: losses... You wonder, maybe death is
dialog: a gift. All I know is that by this
dialog: time tomorrow, I'll be better off.
dialog: What I don't know is why.
dialog: (exits the cage)
dialog: Goodbye, Bitsey.
text: The guard escorts him away. When he's out of earshot:
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Goodbye, David.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY
text: A guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here?
text: Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters
text: flank the drive.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No thanks.
text: She turns and walks toward the highway.
text: The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers.
text: The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists:
text: They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint
dialog: signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder
text: doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large
text: black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey.
text: The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty
text: activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs:
dialog: "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's
text: Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours."
text: At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign
text: leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain;
text: its letters run.
scene_heading: INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s)
text: eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simple:
dialog: You Kill, You Get Killed."
text: In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners
text: largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS
text: at a table not far from theirs.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #1
dialog: I got it. I got it. You could have
dialog: corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for
dialog: Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The
dialog: David Gale Execution, brought to you
dialog: by...'
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #2
dialog: '...Hefty.'
text: They find this hilarious. Bitsey looks away.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: What time is it?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (checking his watch)
text: Nine hours, 52 minutes.
text: A beat.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Pouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms,
text: they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries
text: Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Belyeu!
text: He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over
text: her head, Zack slouches.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Did you have Dusty Wright follow us?
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: I employ Mr. Wright from time to
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: You could have said something.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: (opening her umbrella)
dialog: That would have defeated the purpose.
dialog: Apologies if I caused you unnecessary
dialog: anxiety, but I'm paid to be
dialog: suspicious.
dialog: (handing it to her)
dialog: Thought I'd return this.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Any word on the writ?
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Denied. Tape went to a federal judge
dialog: two hours ago. Your videographer
dialog: friend made contact?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: What you got was definitely a snippet.
dialog: Could be he has more previews
dialog: scheduled. Best stick close to your
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: How's David?
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Holdin' up. I'm headed back over.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Tell him I'll take care of it, about
dialog: his son, I mean.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Will do. We'll talk later?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: BELYEU
dialog: Watch yourselves.
text: They turn from one another. Bitsey turns back.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (calling after him)
dialog: Mr. Belyeu.
text: He turns.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Were Dusty and Constance close?
speaker_heading: BELYEU

text: Bitsey nods.
scene_heading: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT
text: Dark. Bitsey and Zack sit on either side of the room's table

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX AND KETTLE - LONG SHOT - FROM ACROSS
scene_heading: INTERSTATE - NIGHT
text: The rain's lightened up. The motel's full. Lights are on in

dialog: another.
scene_heading: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - NIGHT
text: Zack sleeps at the end of one bed, fully dressed. Bitsey,
text: lost in agitated thought, neatly packs a suit into her
text: perfectly arranged suitcase. She stops, thinks. She goes to
text: her purse and takes out the VHS cassette, a pen and a note
text: pad. Hesitating a beat, she puts the tape in the VCR. She
text: turns on the TV and waits for an image.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL SIX - NIGHT
text: Rain. All the rooms except Bitsey's are dark. From within
text: comes a TV glow.
scene_heading: INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL SIX ROOM - INSERT - BITSEY'S
scene_heading: NOTEPAD - NIGHT
text: She's sketched a flow-chart of the tape with major elements
dialog: timed out.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: has her shoes off, sits on the floor with her back against a

text: Finally, she turns the TV OFF, rubs her eyes. She stands,
text: looks at the radio alarm clock on the nightstand: 11:33.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Bitsey brushes her teeth. Looks down and sees a towel on the
text: floor. Picks it up, starts to hang it on the towel rack,
text: stops, looks at herself in the mirror. A beat. An idea hits
text: her, first as something odd, then as a freight train. She
text: spits, hurries into the bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (putting on her shoes)
dialog: Zack! Wake up! Get up!
text: He starts to pull himself awake.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Did you throw the towel on the floor?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: The towel on my bathroom floor. Did
dialog: you put it there?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Yeah, I guess. It's a hotel room.

speaker_heading: BITSEY

speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: No. Fuck, Bitsey. I'm sorry, it's
dialog: not like it's --
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Get up.
text: She disconnects the VCR.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (sitting up)
dialog: What the fuck's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Grab the T.V. I want to check
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: We're taking a tour.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Where?
text: She has the VCR. Grabs her purse on the way to the door.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Austin. Get the T.V.
text: She opens the door, exits.
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE 3307 ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
text: The DOORBELL RINGS over BAUHAUS MUSIC. The Goth Girl, wearing
text: only the Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, opens the door.
text: Bitsey barrages past carrying the VCR, Zack follows with the
dialog: TV.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Wanna make a hundred bucks?
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: What do I gotta do?
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE 3307 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bitsey, Zack and the Goth girl enter.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: We're going over the crime scene.
text: Bitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other
dialog: exhibit pieces haven't changed.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: And for the next hour I want you to
dialog: do exactly what I say when I say to
dialog: do it. If I say suck Zack's dick,
dialog: all I want to hear from you is 'May
dialog: I swallow.'
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: You want me to suck his dick?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: It's just a patriarchal figure of
dialog: speech.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Is your boyfriend here?
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Well is his video camera here?
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Get it.
text: She starts to leave, turns back.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: I gotta collect first.
text: Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse.
scene_heading: CLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK
text: reads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC
speaker_heading: DOWN.
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
text: Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a
text: perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit
text: pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or-
text: less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame,
text: she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.
speaker_heading: ZACK (O.S.)
dialog: Move those index cards, too.
text: She picks up the index cards.
text: Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is
text: on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the
text: hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning,
text: freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the
text: Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by-
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: Zoom in a hair.
text: He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV
text: (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance).
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: Put the gloves on a dish rack.
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: I don't have one.
text: Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter
text: as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Turn them inside out.
text: He does so.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Move the tape roll about a foot to
dialog: the left. And get rid of the
text: handcuffs.
text: Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the
text: handcuffs.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Come check this, Zack.
dialog: (to the Goth Girl)
dialog: Could you... what's your name?
speaker_heading: GOTH GIRL
dialog: Nico's cool.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: Nico, lie down on the floor, facing
text: the counter.
text: Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits
text: on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: We can imagine that part.
dialog: (to Bitsey)
dialog: I'll position her.
text: He goes to Nico, arranges her in the position of Constance
text: (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the
dialog: floor).
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: That's fine. Just straighten her
dialog: legs.
text: Zack comes back behind the tripod. He and Bitsey look at the
text: two TV images -- roughly the same. The Constance tape,
text: however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower
text: right-hand corner. Bitsey points to it.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Towel or something.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Okay, look at this.
text: She plays the tape of Constance for eight seconds.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I noticed this back at the hotel.
dialog: See?
text: Bitsey touches the TV screen by one of Constance's feet.
text: The foot moves ever so slightly. She hits pause.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: She moves her foot. Why?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fucking good question.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: It's another fifteen seconds before
text: she comes to. If she had passed out
dialog: once, without fresh air she wouldn't
dialog: come back. There was no head trauma,
dialog: her blood tested normal --
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping
dialog: he would go away.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Or...
text: Bitsey looks up at Nico.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: We've got to bag her.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Woa. Not a good idea.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: All right, I'll do it.
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
text: Nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen. Bitsey and
text: Zack stand by the sink. A white plastic bag is now on the
text: sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape.
speaker_heading: NICO
dialog: I found it.
text: Nico hands Zack the key to the handcuffs. He tests them,
text: then lays them on the counter.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (to Zack)
dialog: Okay, I want you to wait three minutes
dialog: before you take it off.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Bitsey, I'm not so sure about this.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: Three full minutes. Just stand behind
dialog: the tripod. Both of you.
text: Zack and Nico move behind the tripod. Bitsey puts the bag on
text: her head, rips off a long length of tape. She seals the bag
text: around her neck. She then handcuffs herself from behind,
text: with some difficulty.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - KEY
text: is on the sink counter while she does this.
speaker_heading: BITSEY (O.S.)
dialog: (through the bag)
dialog: Have you started?
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: Twenty-two seconds.
text: Bitsey sits on the linoleum, then lies on her side.
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: Thirty seconds.
speaker_heading: NICO
dialog: Fuckin' wicked.
text: Bitsey lies perfectly still.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Thirty-five... Forty... Forty-five...
dialog: Fifty.
speaker_heading: NICO
dialog: Maybe she shouldn't...
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: Fifty-five... one minute... five...
dialog: ten... one-fifteen...
text: Bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Fuck. Twenty... twenty-five...
dialog: thirty...
speaker_heading: NICO
dialog: This isn't cool.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: ...thirty-five... Fuck... one-forty...
dialog: one-forty fi...
text: Bitsey panics, fights like hell against the cuffs.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (through the bag)
dialog: Zack!
text: Zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. He rips the bag
text: open. She sucks air.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (ripping at the tape)
dialog: Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You
dialog: okay? What if I'd've waited?
text: She tries to catch her breath. Nico releases the handcuffs.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: No more fucking experiments, all
dialog: right? Just tell me what's going on.
dialog: You okay?
text: Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something.
text: She takes his arm, looks at him.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (still breathing
dialog: heavily)
dialog: She... she did it herself.
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER
text: Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking.
text: Nico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline,
text: paces in front of them, thinking out loud.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: She used the gloves to keep
text: fingerprints off the tape and bag.
text: Then she put them back on the dish
text: rack, but upside down and inside
text: out, a housewives' habit. A murderer
dialog: would have just tossed them aside --
dialog: like they were the first time we
dialog: were here, like you do a towel in a
dialog: hotel.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Maybe, all right, maybe.
dialog: (indicating the cuffs)
dialog: But why wear these?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: They threw me. I forgot you have to
dialog: have the key to put them on. But she
dialog: needed them. She knew she would
text: instinctively try to rip the bag
dialog: off, that at some point automatism
dialog: would kick in.
speaker_heading: NICO
dialog: Fuckin' A, like when people hang
text: themselves. At the last second they
dialog: go chicken, claw at the rope and
dialog: shit. The police find their own skin
text: beneath their nails.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: And she swallowed the key so she
dialog: couldn't get to it. She made sure
dialog: there was no way out.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang
dialog: yourself, or take pills. Why take
dialog: your fucking clothes off? Why make
dialog: it look like a murder?
text: A beat. Bitsey contemplates.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
text: It's so calculated. She's handcuffed,
text: taped at the mouth. The gloves. The
dialog: damn tripod.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Motive's like a major issue here.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Thanks, Zack.
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: It doesn't make sense. The woman's a
dialog: bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why
dialog: frame an innocent man? Why send Gale
dialog: to the chair for what looks --
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: What'd you say?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: She had to know some innocent fuck
dialog: would take the fall.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's
dialog: why! To prove it happens. To have
dialog: absolute proof that the system
text: convicts innocents.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Get the fuck out of here.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: No, that's how she thought. She lived
dialog: for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die,
dialog: why not die for it? That's why the
dialog: tripod was here. To record proof,
dialog: undeniable proof, the tape. That's
dialog: why we got an out-take.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: A dead woman put the tape in your
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Of course not. She needed help,
dialog: someone to keep it, release it.
dialog: Someone she could trust, someone
dialog: dedicated to the cause...
text: They stare at each other a beat. The same thought:
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: (mimicking Belyeu)
text: Thick as thieves.
scene_heading: INT. DUSTY WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
text: Dusty looks up at a wall clock: 4:23. He sits fully dressed
text: in his living room, listening to an OPERA. He closes his
text: eyes.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK OUT of his window and into:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS BESIDE WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
text: Behind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and
text: Zack hide watching him.
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: Hairy.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Come on.
text: She turns back into the woods.
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT
text: Bitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car.
text: They walk and speak quickly in the light rain.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: ...Because of the Berlin thing,
dialog: Constance knew the police would go
text: straight to Gale. In a way, he's
dialog: perfect. A high profile alcoholic
dialog: whose life was shit anyway. But...
speaker_heading: ZACK
text: She was in love with him.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I don't know. Something. They were
dialog: close. She wouldn't want him dead.
text: They come to the car, get in.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
text: Bitsey drives.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Remember this thing about Dusty being
dialog: a bull-horner, going to far?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Why he was fired from DeathWatch,
dialog: and the A.C.L.U.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Right. Maybe the plan was for Dusty
dialog: to release the tape after Gale's
dialog: conviction, after a year or so. You
dialog: know, force him to dry out, let him
dialog: play the heroic victim, give him
dialog: back his dignity. So, Dusty Wright's
text: sitting on this tape, waiting, the
dialog: only one who knows about it. And
dialog: maybe good ole Dusty starts to think
dialog: that an erroneous execution is a
dialog: hell of a lot more politically useful
text: than a last-minute save.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Which would only prove the system
dialog: works.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Yeah. Almost martyrs don't count.
dialog: What's one murder to stop thousands?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: So he'll wait, release the whole
text: tape after the execution.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Right. Somewhere he must have the
dialog: original. What time is it?
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
text: The wall clock: 4:50. Dusty hears the PHONE RING over a
text: BARITONE'S ARIA. He turns the MUSIC DOWN, and picks up.
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: The gas station is old, isolated on a country road.
text: Closed, dark. By the road, a single light pole illuminates
text: the area -- its light catching the drizzle.
text: Directly beneath the pole is a phone booth, where Bitsey
text: waits by the rental car.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
text: Zack is on the phone with the booth door open. Bitsey stands
text: just outside.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Let's talk about your tape... No,
dialog: meet me at the station down the hill,
dialog: in fifteen minutes.
text: Zack hangs up before Dusty can respond. He stops out of the
text: booth and gives Bitsey a tentative look.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT
text: Dusty hangs up, thinks.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: Bitsey sits in the car's driver seat. Zack stands by the
dialog: booth.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Don't move from the booth. Call the
dialog: second you see the truck. Remember,
dialog: let it ring just once. Then get into
dialog: the woods --
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: I know. Go.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (pulling away)
text: Into the woods, Zack.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Go!
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
text: Bitsey is in the woods, watches Dusty pull away in the pickup.
text: She hurries to the front door, enters.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
text: Bitsey turns on the lights and begins searching. She sees 11
text: videos on a bookshelf. Some are labeled, three aren't.
text: She takes the cassettes to the TV/VCR. Puts one in (her hands
text: are wet). Nothing. She searches for the right AV channel.
scene_heading: INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
text: Zack anxiously waits. His eyes check the road.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
text: Bitsey has a picture, but the tape is an old TV western.
text: She starts to fast forward, realizes she won't be able to do
text: so with each tape, hits eject. She checks the clock: 5:04.
text: She takes another unlabeled tape. It's a home video of a
dialog: city council meeting.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (hitting eject)
dialog: Shit!
text: She grabs the next unlabeled tape.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: Zack paces in front of the booth, checks his watch.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
text: Bitsey has an old "I Love Lucy" episode. Ejects, looks at
text: the label: "Lucy." She grabs another, labeled "Unforgiven."
text: The credits from Unforgiven roll on screen.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Shit!
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: Zack sees lights coming toward him. Gets into the phone booth,
text: drops two coins, dials six numbers. He hesitates to punch
text: the seventh, checks the road. The approaching lights belong
text: to a car. He quickly hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
text: Bitsey is frantic. Another tape is an old Johnny Carson
dialog: interview with Pavarotti.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Shit!
text: She reaches for another.
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
text: Zack hugs himself in the waning drizzle.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Come on. Fucking come on.
scene_heading: INT. WRIGHT CABIN
text: Bitsey has what looks like an office Christmas party. She
text: goes for another tape -- the last. Cheyenne Autumn comes up
text: on the screen. She hits eject.
text: She gets up, unsure what to do next. She goes back to the
text: bookshelf, pulls books out to look behind them for more tapes,
text: indifferent to the mess. She goes to a filing cabinet, quickly
text: rifles it. She looks around the room, sees something.
text: She goes to a large oak desk with an old typewriter on it.
text: After the other drawers, she looks in the lap drawer.
text: It's empty except for large padded envelope addressed to
dialog: "Bitsey Bloom/News Magazine/40 W. 43rd St./New York, New
text: York 10036." A beat as she stares in disbelief. She rips it
text: open, pulls out a VHS cassette and checks the label:
text: "Constance." The PHONE RINGS, startling her. She looks at
text: the phone, then at the clock: 5:14. The phone doesn't ring
text: again. A beat of absolute silence.
text: Bitsey goes quickly to the VCR and puts in the tape -- hands
text: shaking. After a few seconds, Constance appears standing in
text: her kitchen by the sink, dressed in a bathrobe. She's wearing
text: the kitchen gloves and fills a glass with water.
speaker_heading: ON VIDEO
text: Constance turns from the sink:
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE (V.O.)
dialog: (her voice weak)
dialog: Ready?
text: The response is silent, but she nods. A beat -- she bites
text: her lower lip. In one quick movement she takes the key from
text: the handcuffs and swallows it with the water. It goes down
text: with difficulty; she coughs, then signals she's okay. She
text: puts the glass in the sink.
text: She takes the duct tape roll, rips off a long section, sticks
text: one end to the back of her gloved hand. She tears off another
text: small section, drops the roll on the floor.
text: She tapes the small section over her mouth.
text: She then takes the plastic bag from the counter, looks at it
text: a beat. Constance turns toward camera, mouth taped, eyes
text: watering. She nods once, and turns back. She quickly puts
text: the bag over her head. After she has smoothed the excess air
text: out with one hand, she takes the packing tape from the other.
text: She seals the bag around her neck.
text: She smoothly takes off the gloves. They're inside out and
text: she snaps them so that the fingers extend. She drops them
text: upside down on the dish rack. She removes her robe -- she's
text: nude beneath -- and tosses it aside. It lands in the bottom
text: right hand corner of the screen.
text: She feels for the handcuffs on the counter, takes them.
text: She sits on the floor, cuffs herself. She rolls onto her
text: side, perfectly still, waiting.
speaker_heading: ON BITSEY
text: Engrossed, trembling. The spell breaks as she comes to the
text: part of the tape she's seen before. Averting her eyes, she
text: fast-forwards past where Constance struggles to where she
text: dies. Constance lies perfectly still. A beat.
speaker_heading: VIDEO
text: A man wearing gloves walks into the frame: Dusty.
speaker_heading: ON BITSEY
dialog: This is what she's needed.
speaker_heading: VIDEO
text: Dusty goes to Constance, kneels and, removing a glove, checks
text: her pulse. He looks briefly up into the camera, then stands.
text: He picks up her robe and comes back past the tripod. A beat.
text: We see only Constance's dead body -- then black.
speaker_heading: ON BITSEY
text: A hand grabs her shoulder. She screams and spins around.
text: It's Zack, breathing hard.
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: He didn't show! Fuckin' move!
text: Bitsey hits the eject button.
scene_heading: EXT. WRIGHT CABIN - NIGHT
text: Bitsey and Zack hurry out of the cabin and into the woods.
text: The pickup is nowhere to be seen.
text: As they disappear into the trees, Dusty can be seen standing
text: beneath the eave at the side of the house, watching.
scene_heading: EXT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE
text: The car moves full speed through the misty dawn. The drizzle
text: has stopped.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
text: Bitsey drives. The overheat light is on. Zack has her purse
text: in his lap, rips a page out of her phone book.
text: She's almost in tears, yelling.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: Everyone! Wake up New York, the
dialog: warden, the Governor, the goddamn
dialog: Supreme Court death clerk! How far
dialog: is it?
speaker_heading: ZACK
dialog: Took me 30 this afternoon. You've
dialog: got 26, maybe more.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: I'll make it.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - IN FRONT OF MOTEL SIX - SUNRISE
text: The rental car slides to a near stop on the interstate
text: shoulder. Zack jumps out, as Bitsey spins away again. He
text: runs across the frontage road toward the motel in the mist.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNTSVILLE TOWN SQUARE - SUNRISE
text: The rental car barrels through the empty square, ignoring
text: stop signs.
scene_heading: EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE
text: The rental car flies past a "Huntsville City Limit" sign and
text: disappears into the fog.
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE
text: The overheat light is still on. Bitsey looks down, then turns
text: on the RADIO. A COUNTRY AND WESTERN SONG is on.
text: She punches scan.
speaker_heading: BITSEY
dialog: (to the radio)
dialog: Give me the time. Give me the goddamn
dialog: time.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY JUNCTION - SUNRISE
text: The highway forks off to another. An arrow sign at the fork
dialog: reads: "TDC Ellis Unit/8 Miles."
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - SUNRISE
text: Bitsey smells something.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY TO ELLIS UNIT - SUNRISE
text: The rental car, smoke pouring from the engine, clunks to a
text: dead roll, stops. Bitsey jumps out, VHS cassette in hand.
text: She doesn't close the door. Starts running.
text: Bitsey runs down the middle of the two-lane highway. The
text: rental car in the b.g. recedes into the mist -- visibility
text: is no more than fifty yards. The sounds of her breathing and
text: SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist.
text: She runs, and runs.
text: A car comes up quickly behind her. Its HORN BLARES. She turns,
text: starts to wave it down. The driver SITS ON his HORN, swerves
text: around her onto highway's shoulder and drives on.
text: She runs. Runs past an abandoned vegetable stand. Runs past
text: a sleepy farmhouse.
text: She runs, and runs.
text: She slows, out of strength, looks up and down the highway.
text: Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a
text: tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort.
text: She runs. Sees something. Stops cold.
text: Coming toward her in the distance are small flashing lights.
text: They rise on hill and then fall behind another.
text: They appear again. Soon, she can make out the form of an
text: ambulance, and its highway patrol escort. The vehicles move
text: slowly toward her, without sirens, as deathly quiet as their
text: cargo. She stands to the side of the road as they approach.
text: The highway patrol vehicle and the ambulance -- marked "Texas
text: Department of Corrections" -- pass silently in SLOW MOTION.
text: She watches as they disappear back into the mist. In SLOW
text: MOTION, she screams, falls to her knees wailing, but we cannot
dialog: hear her. We HEAR NOTHING.
