scene_heading: EXT. APARTMSNT COMPLEX - MORNING
text: We reveal a nondescript apartment complex in North Hollywood
text: California. It is not nice or ugly. It looks like every
text: other pleasant-looking apartment complex in the valley.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - MORNING
text: ANDY STITZER, a boyish looking forty year old man, is asleep.
text: His clock radio goes off. It is playing oldies, which now
text: consists of rock ‘n’ roll from the mid eighties.
text: MUSIC UP: “Heat Of the Moment” by Asia.
text: Andy sits up in bed. Not happy, net unhappy, just another
dialog: day.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING
text: Andy is doing his morning workout. He is doing bench
text: presses. He lifts an enormous amount of weight. His face is
text: very kind, and vulnerable, almost emotionless, but his body
text: is ripped.
text: On a book shelf Andy has an impressive array of action
text: figures and comic books, all in their original packaging.
text: None of his vintage toys have been opened.
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ~ MORNING
text: Andy steps out of his apartment and unlocks his bicycle. His

scene_heading: ESTABLISHING SHOT
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCUIT CITY - MORNING
text: andy rides his bike into the parking lot of a mini-mall. The
text: tini-mall consists of a dozen stores on two stories.
dialog: 2.
text: There is a Barnes and Noble book store, a Daily Grill
text: restaurant, a nail salon, a children's gym and a video store,
text: but the centerpiece is an enormous Circuit City.
scene_heading: INT, CIRCUIT CITY
text: Andy walks inside. He says hello to people as he heads
text: toward the stock room. Everyone politely says hello back but
text: it is clear he has no close relationships here.
text: He takes his place at a desk which is in an opening between
text: the showrcom and the stock room. People come to him with
text: their receipts to get their items pulled from the stock room
dialog: and delivered to their cars.
scene_heading: INT. CURCUIT CITY - LATER
text: Andy is stamping a female CUSTOMER’S receipt. PUNJAB, an
text: Indian salesman, is standing nearby.

text: Through It, it looks amazing on
dialog: this thing.
speaker_heading: ANDY

text: salesman, who is working a 40 year-old black female customer.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Andy knows all about this stuff.
dialog: What is the main reason a flat-
dialog: screen is better than a rear-
dialog: projection?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: The viewing angle is far better on
text: a flat-screen. Due to the liquid
dialog: crystal display, you can watch it
dialog: from any part of the room, and it's
dialog: a much better resolution.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: So sure, you'll save a couple bucks
dialog: with rear-projection, but you have
dialog: more than two people over, they're
dialog: gonna have to sit on your lap to
dialog: watch TV. But maybe you like that!
text: The woman laughs.
text: Andy keeps walking. A very attractive young woman steps in
text: his path. He looks terrified.
speaker_heading: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dialog: Could you help me?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dialog: But you work here.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yes. I’m not a salesman. I stamp
dialog: invoices.
speaker_heading: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
dialog: I just have a quick question about
dialog: CD players.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Punjab or Abujay will be happy to

speaker_heading: CAL

dialog: She was a miserable person, but I
text: so regret breaking up with her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why did you break up with her?
speaker_heading: cAL
dialog: I felt like we were in different
dialog: places in our lives.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: Yeah, you were in this place where
dialog: you were having trouble getting a
dialog: job and she was in this place where
dialog: she hated your fat ass!
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Basically. I miss those titties.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Titties are the best.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I had this girlfriend, she loved
dialog: the fellatio. Anywhere we went,
dialog: she would want to do it.
speaker_heading: CAL

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We went to see Ace Ventura: Pet

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Iocan’t. I'm a gentleman.
speaker_heading: CAL
dialog: Give me a break. You're a freak.
dialog: I can tell.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Lay one on us.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: {after a breath)
dialog: Ok...well....I went with this girl,
dialog: she loved having sex. She was so
dialog: into it. We would have sex and
dialog: she’d be screaming, “I love it.”
dialog: It was so dirty. We had sex in
dialog: every room in the house. The

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: which you would never use.
text: Andy points out a standard looking VCR.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: This one has the features you need
dialog: and it is a third less than the

dialog: Then you should get this one.
dialog: ‘Cause it does look cool. It's
text: black. Has a lot of lights.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Looks are not a factor.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Great. Then we have found what you

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Where do you Live?
speaker_heading: CLD MAN
text: Right down the street on Moorepark.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I can swing by on my way home from

speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: How much would that cost me?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Nothing. It would be my pleasure.
dialog: I would enjoy it.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: That’s very kind of you.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You're doing me the favor. I like

text: like solving a big puzzle.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Thank you. Maybe I could bring in

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: And maybe I will gladly eat it.

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I beat you to it.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (nervous laughter)
dialog: Yes you did.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Great. This'll be fun. And don’t

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Really? Every Monday?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah. I would eat there more, I

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Have I ever waited on you?
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Sure you will. You could do

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: I want to work at that restaurant
dialog: for the rest of my life. I have no

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That’s not true.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: TRISH

speaker_heading: ANDY

text: small whicker basket filled with condoms: She clearly has
text: sex often enough to need this basket. Andy does not pick up
dialog: on this.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Put one of these on.
text: Andy stares at the basket, not sure what to do. He has never
text: worn a condom. He slowly takes one out. He reaches under
text: the sheets, and we can't see what he is doing but it is
text: obvious that he is tearing the wrapper open and attempting to
text: put the condom on.
text: Something goes wrong. He struggles.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It tore. TI need another one.
text: He grabs another one. The same thing happens. For reasons
dialog: which are not clear, he can not figure out how to get this
dialog: condom on properly.
text: Andy attempts this many more times. in quick cuts we see him
text: struggle with at least a dozen condoms as he gets more and
text: more Frustrated with this process. Each time he fails, he
text: tosses the condom and the wrapper on the floor next te him.
text: Finally he gets one on.
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: It's very confusing.
speaker_heading: TRISH
dialog: Does that bother you?

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I was trying to tell her that there

speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: That’s true. Your virginity is a
dialog: gift. A gift you shouldn’t be so
dialog: quick to give away.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I completely agree.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: There are plenty of activities you
dialog: can engage in without having sex
dialog: that can be fun and safe.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: {interested}
dialog: What kind of activities? I'm sure
text: she's interested in knowing.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Well, instead of having
dialog: intercourse, you might want to try
dialog: outercourse.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: Qutercurse. Uch. What's that?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Yeah, what's that?
text: Andy is leaning forward in his chair, way more interested
dialog: than Marla.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Outercourse is anything that isn't
dialog: vaginal intercourse. It can be
text: just having fun in a non-sexual way
dialog: with your friend. Or it can be
dialog: kissing.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Kissing is nice.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: And there are many ways to be
dialog: sexual without intercourse ~— such
dialog: as body rubbing, which you might
dialog: call “dry humping.”
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: See, you can do that.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Masturbation, mutual masturbation.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: That's when you both masturbate at
dialog: the same time.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: {to Marla)
dialog: You could do that instead.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
text: There's deep kissing, erotic
dialog: massage, oral sex play, role-
text: playing, and sharing fantasies with
dialog: a partner.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: So there are a lot of things you
dialog: can do instead of sex.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: It’s only limited by your
dialog: imagination.
speaker_heading: MARLA
dialog: I think I‘m gonna vomit.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: That's very funny, but this is
dialog: serious business. Outercourse
dialog: offers nearly 100 percent
dialog: protection against pregnancy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That's a plus. I didn’t know that.
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Outercourse can also greatly reduce
dialog: the risk of HIV/AIDS and many other
dialog: sexually transmitted infections —
dialog: unless body fluids are exchanged
dialog: through oral or anal intercourse.
dialog: But some infections, like herpes
dialog: and HPV, can be passed by skin-to-
dialog: skin contact.

dialog: This is fantastic. What would

text: fly into a rage and break it off

speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: Sex takes practice, but there are
dialog: many techniques to extend the
dialog: amount of time that a man can
