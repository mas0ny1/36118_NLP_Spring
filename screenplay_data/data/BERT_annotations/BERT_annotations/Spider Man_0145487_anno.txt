scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - DAY
text: A SINGLE GLISTENING STRAND OF A SPIDER’S WEB BISECTS THE BLACK FRAME. AS
scene_heading: CLASSICAL MUSIC CARESSES OUR EARS, WE SEE THE STRAND CRISS-CROSSING OTHERS
scene_heading: IN A PERFECT ORB WEB. A SPIDER-- BLACK WITH AN INTRICATE PATTERN-- DROPS
text: INTO FRAME. IT GRACEFULLY GATHERS AND WEAVES THE STRANDS TOGETHER.
text: The web and spider become small, a gray mass against a basement ceiling
text: corner. The further BACK we go, the grimier the scene becomes: peeling
text: industrial green paint, tangles of pipes and electrical cable, harsh
dialog: lighting.
text: We hear a low WHIR, the pitch growing higher-- a cyclotron. The colossal
text: donut-shaped accelerator dominates the basement lab. It’s a cylindrical,
text: metallic tube, suspended from the ceiling, with wires and fixtures over its
text: length. Utilitarian, a patchwork of technology from the 40s to the 80s,
dialog: with radioactivity warnings.
scene_heading: INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY
text: A STEEL AND GLASS CHAMBER IS BUILT AROUND AND BELOW A SECTION OF THE
scene_heading: CYCLOTRON. METAL SHELVES OF EQUIPMENT, A LARGE ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMER WITH
text: HEAVY CABLES LEADING TO IT FROM THE FLOOR.
text: A three-fingered mechanical claw-- a “waldo”-- thrusts INTO FRAME. Its
text: telescoping arm extends, lifts a tiny one-gram cylinder from a rack of
text: standard weights on a shelf. Another waldo holds a lead canister, a third
text: removes a sealed vial containing a thick, muddy liquid. A fourth arm
text: reaches up to adjust a crystal focusing cone, which juts out from the
text: cyclotron tube. The arm aims the cone at a digital scale on a table in the
text: center of the room.
text: The four waldos are mounted on a panel with a thick, clear pane above it.
text: Through the glass, a shadowy figure manipulates the controls. A fibrous
text: BLUE-WHITE BEAM erupts from the cone, focusing on the weight & the TITLES
speaker_heading: END.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
text: THE WHIR IS MUFFLED NOW, THE MUSIC LOUD FROM A STEREO IN THE CONTROL ROOM.
text: A VIDEO MONITOR SHOWS A WALDO PLACING THE GRAM WEIGHT ON A SCALE; A DIGITAL
scene_heading: READ-OUT BESIDE THE SCREEN JUMPS FROM 0.000000 TO 1.000000. A COMPUTER
scene_heading: SCREEN DISPLAYS IRREGULAR, COLORED PATTERNS DESCRIBING THE DOWNWARD ARCS OF
scene_heading: SUB-ATOMIC PARTICLES. A DIGITAL CLOCK: 8:57 AM. A HALF-EATEN CHILI DOG
text: LIES ON THE CONTROL PANEL.
text: DR. OTTO OCTAVIUS (“DOC OCK”) manipulates the waldo controls. In his 50s,
text: Ock is broad, thickly-featured, brooding, with unfashionably long hair. He
text: wears a stained sweatshirt, protective goggles. Without interrupting his
text: concentration, he lights a fresh cigarette from the butt of the last, and
text: takes a bite of the chili dog.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

text: THE MEN HEAD TO THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL: “CYCLOTRON, AUTHORIZED
scene_heading: PERSONNEL ONLY.”
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: I’m sorry to bother you, Professor. But the man is
dialog: impossible.
speaker_heading: ROZ
text: He has his reasons, Thorkel. At the moment, he has
dialog: something to prove.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: He refused to open the door.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Maybe he didn’t hear you knock.
text: Thorkel snorts. Roz fishes a card-key from his tweeds, inserts it into the
dialog: lock.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
scene_heading: THE DOOR BUZZES OPEN.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: You’ll be late for class, Dr. Octavius.
text: Roz sighs. Ock doesn’t turn around. Thorkel snaps the MUSIC OFF.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: The University pays you to teach.
text: Ock twists a dial, the WHIR increases in pitch, the light grows more
text: intense. Thorkel frowns. Ock notices Roz-- a look of understanding between
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Otto, I don’t like Thorkel any more than you do. But he
dialog: has got a point.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach
dialog: Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.
dialog: You did.
text: Thorkel looks at his watch. Ock sighs and snaps a switch.
scene_heading: INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY
text: THE FOUR WALDOS PULL BACKWARD AND HANG LIMPLY. THE WHIR WINDS DOWN.
scene_heading: EXT. 7TH AVENUE - DAY
text: THE DIESEL ENGINE OF A BUS WINDS DOWN AS IT PULLS UP. THE DOORS HISS OPEN.
text: SNEAKERED FEET BOUND DOWN THE BUS STEPS INTO FRAME, ONTO THE SIDEWALK.
text: THE YOUNG MAN IN THE SNEAKERS, PETER PARKER, PASSES A BANK CLOCK THAT READS
scene_heading: 9:02. INTELLIGENT, 20, WITH DARK HAIR AND RIMLESS GLASSES, PETER IS NEITHER
text: A NERD NOR A MALE MODEL. DRABLY DRESSED IN JEANS AND A BUTTON-DOWN SHIRT,
text: HE CARRIES A BOOK-FILLED BACKPACK OVER ONE SHOULDER, A STYROFOAM CUP OF
text: COFFEE IN THE OPPOSITE HAND. YAWNING, HE HURRIES DOWN THE AVENUE.
scene_heading: EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - DAY
text: PETER HEADS DOWN A SIDE STREET TOWARD AN INSTITUTIONAL BUILDING. A SIGN
scene_heading: READS: “CURTIS CONNORS SCIENCE CENTER,” AND BELOW, “EMPIRE STATE

text: LOOKING DOWN OVER TIERS OF BUILT-IN CHAIRS TO A PODIUM AND BLACKBOARD
scene_heading: FLANKED BY DOORS. SOMBER, TRADITIONAL ACADEMIA. THE HALF-FILLED CLASS
text: SETTLES AS PETER ENTERS AND LOOKS UP TOWARD THE HIGHER ROWS.
text: A weird kid in the first row-- HARRY OSBORN -- waves at Peter. Slight and
text: awkward, Harry has nervous mannerisms and a garish heavy metal T-shirt.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hiya Peter!
text: Peter gives him a perfunctory wave. He climbs up toward the back row,
text: where LIZ ALLEN sits with feet on the empty chair in front of her,
text: seemingly absorbed in a dog-eared Jane Austin novel. Her style reflects a
text: quirky sense of humor: floppy hot-pink sweater over a brilliant purple
text: dress; brightly-striped knee socks with clashing ballet slippers; colorful
dialog: jewelry.
text: Liz is the single bright spot in this otherwise drab environment. Without
text: looking up from her book, she folds her legs up for Peter to pass. He sits
text: discretely one seat away from her, lays his backpack beside her. Peter
text: eyes Liz over his coffee, clearly pleased to see her.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Good morning, Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: How very dull, Peter Parker.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s too early to be clever.
text: She unzips his backpack and toys with his Nikon.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It’s never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence
dialog: how you feel about me.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Fill in the blank: “I blank Elizabeth Allan.”
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I-- uh--
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Uh is a good start.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh. Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
text: Down below, Doc Ock rumbles in, cigarette dangling from his lips, and slams
text: his notes down on the podium. There’s a “NO SMOKING” sign behind him. He
text: starts his lecture as Liz and Peter continue their rapid parry and thrust.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I hate the Platonic idea of you.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I hate people with alliterative names.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I hate--
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your
dialog: shoes.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: (barely audible; BG)
dialog: As you’ll doubtless recall, there are four known forces in
dialog: the universe--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not my coffee.
text: She puts his camera down and grabs his cup, takes a sip.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: No. I was lying about the coffee.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thank God.
text: Liz looks deep into his eyes. It’s the first time she’s looked at him.
speaker_heading: OCK (cont., OS)
dialog: The strong force, which binds matter together; the weak
dialog: force, which causes decay; electromagnetism; and gravity--
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (melodramatic)
dialog: I was lying about it all, Peter. I love you. Ever since
dialog: the third grade, I’ve loved you, I’ve wanted you. I dream
dialog: of you, night and day, my very being o’erbrims with a
dialog: burning passion for you.
text: Peter wishes this were true. Suddenly FLASH THOMPSON dips INTO FRAME and
text: covers Liz’s mouth in a wet kiss. Peter looks away, grossed out.
speaker_heading: OCK (cont.)
dialog: -- gravity, Newtonian theory uses a simple equation with a
dialog: constant--
text: Flash dumps the pack on Peter’s lap, then climbs into the chair beside Liz
text: and throws his arm around her. She tries to catch Peter’s eye, as if to
text: apologize-- but he avoids her look.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: -- which we all know by heart-- Don’t we, Mr. Thompson!
text: Flash grabs Peter’s notes without missing a beat, holds them out of view
dialog: and reads.
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Natch, Doc. That’s… 6.670 time 10 to the negative
dialog: eleventh.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: (eyeing him)
dialog: In what quantity?
text: Flash tries to decipher the hidden notes.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Meters cubed over kilogram-seconds squared!
text: Flash curls his lip. Peter retrieves his notes, clucks his tongue at
dialog: Flash.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Crime doesn’t pay, Flash.
scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM - DAY
text: EARLY AFTERNOON. THE LONG TABLES OF THE OAK-PANELED LIBRARY ARE CROWDED
text: WITH STUDYING STUDENTS. A PRINT OF A FOX HUNTING SCENE HANGS ABOVE A
text: MANTELPIECE. A FAT MALE LIBRARIAN SITS AT A DESK. WE DOLLY IN TO PICK OUT
text: PETER PARKER, SLOUCHING IN A CHAIR WITH A NOTEBOOK IN HIS LAP. HE SNIFFS
text: SOMETHING, LOOKS AROUND, AND SEES:
text: HARRY in the stacks, dragging a small cloth bag over the floor and
text: bookshelves.
text: Peter rolls his eyes. Harry crosses to the table at the far end from
text: Peter, He slides the squirming bag down the table like a whiskey glass in
text: a saloon. Peter grabs the bag in mid-slide, shakes his head “No,” silently
text: but firmly. Harry grins crazily and nods, Oh, yes!” Sensing mischief,
text: the librarian glances up. Peter heads into the stacks with the bag,
text: pursued by Harry. They whisper:
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You maniac. You’ll blow your scholarship.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: They’ll never take me alive.
text: Peter ducks as the librarian passes. Harry snatches the bag back,
text: artistically swipes the man’s rump with it. The librarian doesn’t notice.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What’s in there?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: A little bunny I saved from dissection.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Harry!
text: Roz walks past, looks at Peter, who waves nervously.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Mr. Parker.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi, Professor. What’s up?
text: Harry scrambles atop stack “H-K” by a window. A tape deck sits at the
dialog: ready.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: You tell me.
text: Roz sees Harry signal out the window--
scene_heading: EXT. LIBRARY - DAY
text: A VAN MARKED “RUTLAND’S COMPLEAT HUNTER” PARKED BY THE STEPS. TWO MEN IN
text: RED HUNTING JACKETS RETURN HARRY’S SIGNAL AND OPEN THE VAN DOORS.
scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM - DAY
text: HARRY CLICKS ON THE TAPE PLAYER-- A HUNTING TRUMPET, ROUSING EVERYONE IN
speaker_heading: THE LIBRARY.
text: A dozen baying basset hounds rush in, following the scent over tables,
text: under chairs, upsetting everything in their wake. Pandemonium: students
text: laugh, applaud, some join in the chase. Dogs pursue the librarian, who
text: falls, overturning a bookcase. Peter smiles in spite of himself. Roz
text: claps.
text: From atop his bookcase, Harry watches it all proudly. The scent bag’s
text: still in his hand. The dogs pick up on it, leaping and yelping at him.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON PARK - DAY
text: LATE AFTERNOON. PETER AND LIZ CROSS THE PARK TOWARD A PRETZEL VENDOR.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: -- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Poor Harry. Always desperate for attention. What about
dialog: the bunny?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Back to the lab. Harry’ll probably lose his scholarship.
text: Peter pays for two pretzels-- two dollars and no change. He winces a
text: little. She takes a bite of pretzel.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He’ll weasel out of trouble. Again.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Maybe. I could have stopped it, though.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Since you’re feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to
dialog: somebody who needs it?
text: She gestures over her shoulder toward a derelict. A tacky, blatantly
text: sexual woman in her early 20s-- KIM-- wiggles past the bum in question.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: My my.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Yeah. Really gets to you if you let it.
text: Liz looks past Peter into the distance.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You want to give them something, but they’ll just buy more
dialog: Ripple. And they smell so…bad.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What?
text: Peter looks at Liz, puzzled and amused. She waves toward the Washington
text: Square arch, where Flash gets out of his double-parked MG. His eyes follow
text: Kim’s rear, he pants lasciviously.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: God, Flash can be such a jerk.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But you like that in a man?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You should write that one down.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: “Flash,” Liz. You’re going out with something that calls
dialog: itself “Flash.”
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Some prep school thing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Does it have a human name?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Eugene. Admit it, Peter-- you’d do anything for a nickname
dialog: like “Flash.”
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’d never admit that.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hurry up, Flash!
text: She stops. She looks at Flash, then back at Peter.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What are you doing this weekend?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’ve gotta study.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh. Maybe I should, too--
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Lizzy!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I was sort of hoping to get out of--
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: I’m parked illegally!
text: Liz purses her lips, then hurries to Flash, gets into his car. As the MG
text: speeds away, she turns in the passenger seat, watching Peter recede into
dialog: the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. BUGLE OFFICES -DAY
text: A 1940S OFFICE BUILDING, THE KIND WITH PITTED LINOLEUM AND SMELLY
text: ELEVATORS. A FADED PLASTIC SIGN IN A FOURTH FLOOR WINDOW READS “THE
scene_heading: BUGLE, NEW YORK’S FAVORITE TABLOID.”
speaker_heading: JAMESON (VO)
dialog: No. No. Forget it.
scene_heading: INT. JAMESON’S OFFICE - DAY
scene_heading: A HAND SORTS THROUGH 8X10 B&W PHOTOS: A BAG LADY WITH A SHOPPING CART--
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: Too artsy.
text: Peter looks over Jameson’s shoulder, collecting the rejects in mounting
text: frustration. Next is a wacky sign, such as “HAPPIE FUNERAL HOME--“
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: Too dumb.
text: Peter makes a gesture as if to throttle Jameson. The next photo shows a
text: mohawked punk in a business suit with a briefcase--
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: Too hip. Your photos suck, kid.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I think you’re trying to tell me something.
text: J.JONAH JAMESON is 50, greying, sour-faced, cigar-chewing. Unlike the
text: gruff-but-benign stereotype, publisher Jameson is a bastard to the last.
text: Framed photos of celebrities, biological freaks and aliens line the walls.
text: Papers and rotting coffee cups clutter his ratty desk; sluggish activity
text: out in the main office. The feel is cynical exhaustion: the Bugle is the
dialog: dregs of the newspaper world
text: BETTY, Jameson’s 30-ish assistant, enters with a layout on boards. She
text: looks Peter over. Peter doesn’t notice, holding up the bag lady photo.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Think of the cutline: “Bag lady makes millions recycling
dialog: cans!”
text: Betty grins; Jameson considers it, then shakes his head. He signs the
dialog: boards “JJJ.”
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: Bring me some stuff that’ll grab the morons, something
dialog: like, like--
text: Jameson holds up the front-page board, featuring a bus teetering on
text: abridge, with a huge headline, ‘BUS PLUNGE KILLS 20.” He grins proudly.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Come on, that’s pure luck! The guy was in the right place
dialog: at the right time--
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of
dialog: things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the
dialog: city’s mean streets--
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: But you’re a full-time student, right?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: My scholarship only covers books and tuition, so I’ve got
dialog: to freelance to--
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: Save the chit-chat for the singles’ bar. Now out, both of
dialog: you.
text: Betty sticks her tongue out at Jameson and opens the door for Peter.

speaker_heading: DOOR.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S HALLWAY - EVENING
text: PANTING, PETER CLIMBS THE LAST FLIGHT TO HIS STUDIO LOFT, MUTTERING AT HIS

text: DEEP BREATH, CLUTCHING THE KEYS BETWEEN HIS FINGERS AS A WEAPON.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: There’s nothing in there worth stealing!
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: (from within)
dialog: That’s the understatement of the year.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S APARTMENT - EVENING

text: FURNITURE. A GRIMY SKYLIGHT LEADS TO THE ROOF. IT’S NOT A PRETTY PLACE,
text: BUT IT HAS PERSONALITY.
text: A slim, sharp-featured woman in her 50s kneels by the stereo-- AUNT MAY.
text: In stylish slacks and jacket, she radiates vigor and poise. Peter enters,
text: tosses his backpack and bills on the formica table.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Aunt May, you’re trespassing.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Your records are older than you are. Have you never heard
dialog: of new wave?
text: Peter sprawls in a plastic chair. May shrugs and settles for a Beatles
text: album. Moving fast, she crosses toward him, leans to kiss his forehead and
text: stops, stares, points at a pimple near his hairline.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn’t meddle-
dialog: -
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Oh, Peter. A zit.
text: Annoyed, he brushes his hair over the offending spot. May crosses lithely
text: to the kitchenette, where a grocery bag sits on the counter.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: I wasn’t meddling. I was just so desperately bored I
dialog: thought I’d come over and make you dinner--
text: She tosses him a fresh apple from the bag, he bites a chunk out of it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I am old enough to--
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: --but I didn’t feel like getting to know your roaches.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’ll introduce you.
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Ick. And those foul chemicals in the pots--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m a photographer, remember?
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Anyway, I’ve decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest
dialog: Hills--
text: She grabs her coat, crosses to Peter and tugs on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s Friday night…
speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Yes. Do you have a date?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No.
text: She pulls his chair toward the door, he gets up,laughing.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: The record--
speaker_heading: MAY

speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: Ha. Anti-gravitational particles.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: Power down. I need to talk to you.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: Proof. Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and

speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: Let’s talk in the hall.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: THE WORKER CROUCHES, UNSCREWING A PANEL NEAR THE DOOR. IGNORING THIS,

speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: In this obsolete little cyclotron, I’m solving the greatest
dialog: physics problem of the 20th Century. With more power, I
dialog: could--
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: I’ve had an extremely bad day, Octavius. A sophomoric
text: prank in the library and punitive measures.
text: Behind them, the worker continues. Thorkel glances at him, keeps stalling.
speaker_heading: THORKEL (cont.)
dialog: Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: I couldn’t care less. What I’ve done is--
text: The worker looks at Thorkel and nods, walks off. Thorkel follows.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: What you’ve done is make the entire physics department look
dialog: foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues
dialog: compare you to Bozo the Clown.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: This is the unified field! All the forces of the universe
dialog: tied together-- perfectly!
text: Thorkel pauses at the foot of the staircase, his voice echoes down the
dialog: hall.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: You’ve used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed
dialog: your annual salary. Not to mention the potential hazards
dialog: of your radioactive fuel.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: I don’t care.
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Cretin.
text: Ock crosses back to the cyclotron door, pulls out his card key.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: You’re denied access to the cyclotron.
text: The lock spits out Ock’s card, a red light flashes once. He stares at it
dialog: in disbelief.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: You changed the lock.
text: Thorkel heads up the stairs. Anger wells up in Ock.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: No!
text: He bangs his fist on the door, causing the unseen lab animals to SCREAM.
scene_heading: INT. MAY’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: THE SOUND OF FANS SCREAMING ON A TV BASEBALL GAME. A REFRIGERATOR SLAMS
dialog: O.S.
text: Peter sits on the couch, feet propped on a coffee table. The lower-middle-
text: class home reflects May’s personality: her own odd landscapes on the
text: walls, crude sculptures, macramé hangings. There is too much furniture:
text: an agglomeration of once-trendy pieces dating from the 40s to the present.
text: BEN enters from the kitchen, a can of beer in each hand. Ben is 60,
text: happily overweight, a gentle, good-natured working stiff with a mild

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Here you go, Pete.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: (solicitous)
dialog: What, want a glass?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. No, that’s okay.
text: Ben sits back in his comfy chair in the corner, with a magazine rack, a row
text: of pipes, and a print of dogs playing poker. He pops open his beer.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: So, uh… how’s college goin’?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Same old stuff.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: How’s the pharmacy?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Ah, ya know. Neighborhood’s not what it used to be. Kid
dialog: no more’n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You stop him?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Wasn’t worth gettin’ upset over a Milky Way. Anyways, I
dialog: was never much for, ya know, discipline.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know. Still thinking about retiring?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Eh. If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to
dialog: France or somethin’.
text: An awkward pause; they both know it’ll never happen. They look at the TV.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Ya still follow the Mets, Pete?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No…not really.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: S’funny. When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had
dialog: this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in
dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Remember Little League?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Yeah, Babe Ruth you wasn’t.

speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Please.
text: Their voices recede. A SQUEAK at Peter’s feet startles him-- he looks down
dialog: to see--
text: A white lab rat, melded to its exercise wheel, struggling pathetically
text: across the tile floor. Peter reacts, focuses his camera on it.
text: Above Peter’s head, the still-glowing spider drops from its twisted web on
text: a strand. It lands unnoticed on his hand-- and bites.
text: Peter slaps his hand, but the spider drops onto the floor, ceases to glow.
text: Its limbs contract in death.
text: Peter drops his camera as a wave of nausea hits him. He braces against a
text: sink, sees his image in a twisted mirror-- drenched in sweat, his face

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Hey! What the hell you doin’ in here?
speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Good for you. Stay outta here.

dialog: ambulance.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can’t focus…
speaker_heading: JAMESON
dialog: Gimme that. Pick it up later.
text: He snatches the camera, stuffs it in Peter’s backpack, heads off. Peter

text: PETER’S POV: The world comes into sharp, precise focus.
text: Peter shakes himself, looks through the glasses again, then puts them in

scene_heading: EXT. BRICK BUILDING - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE, ON PETER’S FACE, PRESSED AGAINST THE BRICKS, EYES CLOSED, BREATHING
text: HARD. HE OPENS HIS EYES, REGAINING HIS SENSES. PUZZLEMENT… THEN FEAR.
text: HE LOOKS DOWN.
text: The sidewalk is fifteen feet below him.
text: He’s clinging flat against the wall, palms at his sides against the bricks.
text: Peter whimpers. A tremor in his hand, he reaches to pull himself upward.
text: He tries for a toehold. Brick crumbles beneath his feet, he swings wildly,
text: but his fingertips hold him against the building’s face.
text: He looks at his fingers, his hand-- the spider bite glows faintly under his
dialog: skin.
text: Tentatively at first, he inches upward. With growing confidence, he crawls
text: up the wall to the roof of the ten-story structure.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
text: UNLIKE THE CLAUSTROPHOBIC STREETS BELOW, SKY AND SPACE ABOUND. AT THE

text: HEIGHT. HE LOOKS AROUND HIM, WONDERING IF HE’S LOST HIS MIND. HE SITS
text: DOWN NEAR THE LEDGE.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: This is very strange.
text: He rubs the back of his hand-- the glow of the spider-bite vanishes.
text: Getting slowly to his feet, he stretches, flexes his muscles. His body
text: feels somehow different. He shrugs, then jumps straight up-- about fifteen
text: feet, as if from a trampoline. He lands agilely.
text: Confusion turns to elation.
text: He leaps to the roof access door, clings to it and crawls to the top of the
text: small shack. New York stretches in every direction. The sun peeks out
text: from behind the clouds.
text: Peter LAUGHS in pure exhilaration. He leaps from the access door, and runs

dialog: into space--
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK ROOFTOPS - DAY
text: --AND LANDS ATOP THE SLOPED ROOF OF THE NEXT BUILDING. PETER KEEPS JUMPING

text: Another leap, this time pirouetting in mid-air over a 50-story drop.
text: The next jump, he lands upside-down on the side of a building, clinging and
text: kicking his feet in the air. More LAUGHTER.
text: A pre-teen PIGEON KEEPER turns from his cooing birds. Peter dashes by him
text: and leaps from the building. Stunned, the kid walks out of the coop,
text: leaving the door open. The birds fly out in a flurry.
text: Peter slides down a high telephone cable across an alley between buildings.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

speaker_heading: LEIBER

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: BRAIN MAN (cont.)

speaker_heading: DR. CRAWFORD

speaker_heading: BRAIN MAN

speaker_heading: ORDERLY

speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: Truth. I lifted the veil. Total inter-penetration of

dialog: cosmos!
text: Roz lights Ock’s cigarette, eyes him dubiously. Ock doesn’t bother to
dialog: smoke it.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would
dialog: tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-
dialog: Klein--
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: Ach, theories! This was first-hand, experiential
dialog: knowledge, the essence of the universe.
text: Roz begins to sense the man’s madness.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Mm. But at what cost, Otto. You barely survived a coma.
dialog: And look at yourself--
text: Roz glances at Ock’s sheeted torso.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: My… self. I don’t matter. This human life, all life--
text: insignificant. Bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures--
dialog: but we’re all we’ve got.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: You’re wrong. Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I
dialog: became Creation.
text: Ock takes the cig from his mouth, stares at the smoldering end.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Creation? Or its opposite?
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: Truth. Pure, eternal. Beyond the boundaries of mere
dialog: mortality.
text: Roz regards Ock sadly, takes the cigarette and extinguishes it.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own
dialog: limits--
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: I’ll repeat the experiment. I will hold the truth. That’s
dialog: the only thing that matters.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: No. It isn’t.
text: He moves in closer, trying to see past Ock’s madness. He speaks quietly
dialog: but firmly.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone’s. By comparison,
dialog: our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game-
dialog: -
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: Oh, Roz. My mind is so far beyond yours now.
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: I could beat you at chess now.
text: Roz realizes Ock is beyond communication, off the deep end. A KNOCK and

speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: Gentlemen. Professor, if you could…
text: Rosomoff sighs and rises.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: I was just leaving. Please, Otto. Be careful.
text: Roz exits. Thorkel stands at the foot of the bed, leans on the bedpost.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: It’s good to see you awake. Feeling all right?
text: Ock ignores him. Thorkel gives him a lemony smile.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: Then you’ll be glad to know the University has decided not
dialog: to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and
text: entering… the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23

speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: I will finish what I’ve begun…
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: Doubtless. And you’ll have all the time in the world to
dialog: pursue your work. Somewhere else.
text: Ock’s eyes narrow. Thorkel smiles.
speaker_heading: THORKEL
dialog: To put it bluntly, Octavius, you’re history. Fired,
dialog: canned, out on your ass. The University will take care of
dialog: your medical bills, but I consider that a small price to
dialog: pay for the pleasure of getting rid--
text: Without warning, a steel waldo shoots out from beneath the sheet and
text: clutches Thorkel by the throat. His smirk turns into a grimace as the arm
text: lifts him off the floor, pushing the man up near the ceiling.
text: Amazed, Ock looks along the waldo from his chest to the choking Thorkel.
text: Ock touches the metal arm curiously as the man gasps for breath.
text: Thorkel’s feet kick wildly, then go limp. Ock drops the body.
text: Ock gets out of bed, stands over Thorkel’s body. An arm telescopes
text: outward, the claw opens and shuts experimentally. Ock nods in growing
text: pleasure. Another arm draws the curtains. A third arm shoots out and
text: clicks the door locked. The fourth arm delicately clicks off the
text: electronic monitors. Ock clenches and relaxes his human hands, the
text: mechanical arms writhe like cobras. He smiles.

text: several reels of high-strength fishing line and boxes of miniature gas
dialog: cartridges.
text: Afternoon. Fast-food wrappers, chemical supplies and lengths of thin rubber
text: tubing. Peter uses adhesive tape to secure his “web-shooter”: a pouch of
text: glue under his arm; a tube down his forearm ending with a short metal
text: nozzle at the heel of his hand; a watchband-thin reel of line around his
text: wrist with a tiny gas cartridge; a pressure-sensitive button in his palm.
text: Peter extends his arm toward the far wall, bends his wrist, presses the
text: trigger with his middle finger. A hideous wad of goo oozes all over his
text: hand and explodes through the tubing. He’s grossed out.
text: Over the Bunsen burner again, Peter mixes more glue, thinner this time.
text: Wads of failed line and glue stick to the walls like linguini. Peter tries
text: again. He aims at the ceiling. A long stream of glue-impregnated line
text: spits out and attaches to the ceiling with a SPLAT. Peter tugs at it-- it
text: holds. He climbs up it, hand overhand, and hangs from the ceiling. He
dialog: beams with success.

scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Beers after the last pick-up?
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Sounds good. We’ll be done in a half-hour.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Not at this rate.
text: The Driver revs the motor-- it’s not moving. The Guard unsnaps his
text: holster. Without warning, two waldos SMASH THROUGH the thick glass on both
dialog: sides.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK- DAY
text: OCK HOLDS THE TRUCK ALOFT BY THE REAR BUMPER; THE REAR WHEELS SPIN. TWO
text: OTHER WALDOS SURROUND THE TRUCK, SQUIRMING INTO THE CAB. GUNSHOTS AND
text: PANICKED SCREAMS FROM WITHIN. WITH HIS FOURTH WALDOS OCK TEARS OPEN THE
text: REAR DOOR AND GRABS SEVERAL MONEY BAGS WITH HIS HANDS.
text: In the bank, witnesses stare goggle-eyed. A teller pulls the drapes for

speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Just a theory. Let’s see it.

speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: I’ll do what I can.
text: ON SCREEN-- a graphic of stars in space.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Standard chart of our cosmic neighborhood-- and--
text: The graphic zooms quickly in on the solar system, Earth, then an aerial
dialog: view of the Northeastern US.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Home sweet home. First your original set of values--
text: Bluish pulses appear sporadically in a spiral in the New York area, then
text: stop. Computer-generated TONES like the THROB of Ock’s experiment.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Sporadic pulses, petering out in 96 hours or so. But when
dialog: we crank up the energy variable, we get three distinct
dialog: phases--
text: He pushes a button; the screen clears and resets.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Phase One: the same pulses. If the energy input keeps
dialog: rising and we reach a critical point-- here-- into--
text: Spiral flashes as before. The spiral pulses multiply and coalesce, forming
text: a blue funnel over New York, growing and intensifying.
speaker_heading: HARRY
text: Phase Two: An energy vacuum, sucking power into itself.
dialog: If it gets enough juice, we go into Phase Three: a chain
dialog: reaction. Here’s where it gets really good.
text: The image pulls back for a wider view as North America-- the Earth-- the
text: solar system-- then the surrounding stars implode and dissolve into the

speaker_heading: TUNNEL.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: PETER LOOKS UP, THEN SPRINGS BACKWARD, HEAD OVER HEELS--
text: --and lands upside-down, feet clinging to the grimy tunnel ceiling. He
text: starts to unbutton his shirt-- we see the Spider-Man costume. Coins fall
text: from his pants and clang on the rails below. Peter mutters to himself,
text: pulls the mask over his face.
speaker_heading: ON PETER’S CLOTHES
text: Spider-Man squirts a stream of webbing to tie up the bundled clothes. A

scene_heading: SPIDER-MAN EMERGES FROM THE SUBWAY, STROLLS TOWARD ROCKEFELLER PLAZA. A

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Like it?
speaker_heading: REISS
dialog: Nah. The big mask was better.
dialog: A.D.
dialog: Ten seconds.
text: The A.D. leads the nervous Spider-Man toward the curtain. Reiss watches the
text: MONITOR, where we see Letterman reading from a card--
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: But wait, there’s more. For arachnid lovers everywhere,
dialog: here’s “The Amazing Spider-Man.” How about a tacit round
dialog: of applause.
text: ON STAGE as Spider-Man shuffles out from behind a curtain. The tight
text: costume earns him surprised WHOOPS from the audience. Letterman shakes
text: Spidey’s hand, then winces at his sticky palm.
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Sorry. I’m still getting the hang of this.
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: I see. So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I’ll assume that’s not

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Just call me Spidey.
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Thanks, I already ate.
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: I’ll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what

dialog: the street?
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Well…
text: He leaps straight up, somersaulting in mid-air and sticks on a Klieg light
text: lattice. The audience REACTS, suitably impressed. Letterman cocks his
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: Oh, boy. Must come in handy for changing light bulbs.
text: Spider-Man shoots a long strand of webbing to the ceiling above the
dialog: audience.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: And for my next impression-- Errol Flynn!
text: He swings out over the boggled crowd and clings to a wall. Even Letterman
text: is dumbstruck, leans cross-armed against his desk. Spidey does a
dialog: horizontal dance.
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: Hold it. Are you a shill for Velcro?
text: The cameras swirl to track Spider-Man as he sings back to the stage.
text: Letterman sits on the edge of his desk, shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Ta-daaa!
text: The BAND reprises Spidey’s “Ta-daaa!” The audience CHEERS, Spidey bows.
speaker_heading: LETTERMAN
dialog: All right, amazing. Are you quite finished?
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Just about. You see, I also have this amazing strength…

speaker_heading: REISS
dialog: I asked if you felt like a drink--
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: No. No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something’s wrong -- I
dialog: need to make a phone call.
speaker_heading: REISS
dialog: Okay, kid. Call me tomorrow.
text: Reiss heads off. Spider-Man stops at a phone kiosk, picks up the receiver--
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
speaker_heading: REISS
dialog: I just gave-- yeah, sure.
text: He gives him the coin and walks off. Pedestrians gawk at the costumed
text: figure as he quickly dials. BEHIND HIM, across the street, there’s a cut-
dialog: rate electronics store.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Ben, is everything all right?…Are you sure?
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: No, I guess it was nothing-- I just had this feeling-- no,
dialog: don’t wake her up… just watch Channel 4 at 12:30--
text: ALARM from store in BG. A huge and menacing THIEF races into the street, a
text: paper bag full of cash on one hand, a small TV under his arm. Spider-Man
text: leans into the kiosk to be heard, speaks loudly.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN (cont.)
dialog: Right, tonight. I know it’s late, but it’s worth it--I’ll
dialog: be on television! It’s a long story--
text: An Armenian STOREOWNER chases the thief, who dodges cars and buses and
text: heads straight toward Spider-Man. Brakes SCREECH, horns BLARE.
speaker_heading: STOREOWNER
dialog: Stop him! Somebody stop him!
text: Spider-Man dodges as the thief runs right past him and hurries down the
text: subway. The winded Storeowner stops by Spider-Man, cursing him in Armenian.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN (on phone)
dialog: Isn’t that great? You won’t believe it…
speaker_heading: STOREOWNER
dialog: Whatsa matter with you!
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN (on phone)
dialog: Okay. Okay. See you, Ben.

speaker_heading: STOREOWNER
dialog: You coulda stopped him! Done something-- Stuck your leg

text: In mid-move, Spider-Man freezes-- the tingle of his “spider-sense” again.
text: SILENCE and TRACK IN. We hear GUNSHOTS, a man’s GROAN, distorted.
text: Ambient SOUNDS of the disco return. The crowd urges Spider-Man to
text: continue, but he pushes through them toward the bar. He lifts the lower
text: portion of his mask over his nose to finish his Coke. KIM-- the sexpot
text: Peter saw in Washington Square Park-- watches him hungrily.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I love the way you move. What made you stop?
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Second time tonight… this weird, weird feeling, like a kick
dialog: in the stomach…
text: She runs her hand over his masked face, then over his chest and stomach.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: I want you.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Uh…
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: You’ll leave your mask on.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN

speaker_heading: SAMPLE CASE.
speaker_heading: VENDOR

text: A cab pulls over. The vendor hangs in there.
speaker_heading: VENDOR

speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Twenty-five bucks over the meter. You pay tolls.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Hey, you buy three watches for that, man!
text: Spider-Man gets in, the cab starts off. The vendor goes after a well-

text: The peculiar THROB fills the plaza. People turn toward the metal

scene_heading: INT. CAB - NIGHT
text: SPIDER-MAN FACES FRONT, THE PLAZA BEHIND HIM. THE CAB MOVES VERY SLOWLY.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN

scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA - NIGHT
text: THE SCULPTURE HAS BECOME A HUGE MAGNET. IN QUICK SUCCESSION, EVERY SMALL
scene_heading: METALLIC OBJECT IN THE AREA SAILS TOWARD IN FROM ALL DIRECTIONS:
text: The vendor’s watches fly from out of the sample case-- the man’s car keys
text: rip through his trousers-- his shirt studs-- the woman’s bra from within
text: her evening dress-- a bag lady’s shopping cart-- a hooker’s metal belt and
text: purse-- her pimp’s “gold” chains and rings-- a fat man’s buckle.
text: All fly to the sculpture and stick magnetically. The THROB and PULSE
text: abruptly cease; the objects clatter to the plaza pavement.
text: Spider-Man’s cab-- suddenly released-- peels rubber with a SCREECH. We see
text: his face looking out the rear window.
scene_heading: INT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN

speaker_heading: MAY

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: How is he?
speaker_heading: MAY

speaker_heading: MAY
dialog: Stop that. He’ll be fine.
text: Peter looks stoically across the lobby. It slowly dawns on him: he is

text: enter the hospital waiting room, move to Peter.
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: You the nephew?
text: Peter nods, dazed.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
dialog: Your uncle’s a brave old dude. Evidently the guy was

speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: Not now.
text: From the other side of the waiting room, a grim-faced DOCTOR crosses slowly
text: toward them. May stands up slowly, looks at his face and shudders.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Mrs. Parker, I’m sorry. We tried--
text: A desperate sob. May clutches her chest, gasps for air. The Doctor runs
dialog: to her side.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Jesus-- Code Blue! Crash cart in the lobby, Stat!
text: A blur of action: orderlies, nurses, a stretcher. Marotta gently pulls

speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP
dialog: We’ll get the bastard who did it, Mr. Parker. He’s trapped
dialog: in a warehouse, see, over on 112th--

speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: Kid, leave it. You can’t do anything.
text: Peter pulls away, then runs out into the night. Marotta looks at the cop.
speaker_heading: UNIFORM COP

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Be nice.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, take pity on the feeble-minded.
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: (the insults pass him by)
dialog: No, no, listen. They’re tryin’ to say he was in cahoots
dialog: with this killer--
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Flash, drop it--
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: -- but they got it all wrong. Any fool can figure it out.

speaker_heading: FLASH

speaker_heading: ADELE

speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Parker, you amaze me! You know this guy? Who is he,

dialog: arts freak?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: He’s a mistake.
text: Peter walks away.
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Mistake? Hey, guy, get back here!
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hm. What a lump.
speaker_heading: ADELE
dialog: What’s with him?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Nothing much.
text: Harry rises with his and Peter’s coffee cups.
speaker_heading: HARRY (cont.)

scene_heading: INT. ROSOMOFF’S OFFICE - DAY
text: ROZ LEANS ON HIS DESK BY THE MAP; MAROTTA TINKERS WITH THE ANTIQUE SEXTANT.
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: You were the last one to see Thorkel. In Octavius’
dialog: hospital room.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: So you’ve found Thorkel?
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: Some of him… char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out
dialog: suicide. Any bad blood between him and Ock?
text: Roz gently takes the sextant away from him.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Octavius wasn’t the murderer type.
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when
dialog: those mechanical arms--
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Waldos.
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored
text: truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
text: Roz reacts to this, then leans over the map. Marotta joins him. Peter
text: enters and stands politely by the door. Neither man notices him.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Lieutenant, I’ve triangulated recent bizarre events-- the
dialog: Bronx, Jersey, Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--
dialog: (points)
text: Here. The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius’ experiment
text: seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically
dialog: changing the interrelation between molecular binding,
dialog: electromagnetism and gravity--
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: Yeah, that’s fascinating, but I’m just a fat, dumb cop
dialog: lookin’ for a psycho killer--
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: There’s an infinitely greater danger. If--
dialog: (sees he won’t get through)
dialog: Listen. The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating
dialog: his experiment. To do that, he needs a radioactive
dialog: catalyst, SL 270.
text: He hands the cop a list. Marotta nods.
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: Toxic dumps, huh.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: And he’ll need a cyclotron. He can’t use ours-- he’s
dialog: already destroyed it.
dialog: (hands him a second list)
dialog: Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.
dialog: New Haven, Long Island, two in Cambridge--
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: You sure about all this?
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I know him.
text: Marotta recognizes Peter; Roz looks at him as well. They stare at him.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hi. Professor, I’m here about another extension. My uncle
dialog: died.
text: Roz looks at him dubiously, then sees he’s telling the truth. Marotta
text: slips the lists into his coat.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: It’s a lot of ground to cover. We’ll try.
dialog: (to Peter)
dialog: Funny coincidence, huh?
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: No such thing as coincidence. “God does not play dice with
dialog: the universe.”
speaker_heading: MAROTTA
dialog: Einstein, right? We’ll see ya.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Peter-- my condolences.

speaker_heading: ROZ

speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Oh, don’t do it on my account--
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No, it wasn’t only you-- it -- it just wasn’t my style.

scene_heading: EXT. ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION - DAY
text: A WALDO THRUSTS INTO FRAME, PENETRATING A MASS OF CIRCUITS, WIRES AND

scene_heading: OCK’S EYES FRENETICALLY SCAN A SERIES OF VOLTMETERS; ONE REGISTERS
text: ESCALATING LEVELS WHILE OTHERS JUMP, THEN DROP.
text: A LINEMAN sees Ock from the rear, the waldos stretching from his torso.
speaker_heading: LINEMAN
dialog: Hey!
text: Ock ignores him. The Lineman pulls a heavy wrench from his toolbelt and
text: brandishes it, approaching warily. Without turning around, Ock extends a
text: waldo backward, grabs the wrench and crushes it in two. The Lineman runs
dialog: off.
text: Near the fence, the panicked Lineman slams into two GUARDS, male and
dialog: female.
speaker_heading: LINEMAN
dialog: My wrench! He-- it-- arms!
text: The guards draw their guns as he clambers over the fence.
text: Another voltmeter needle swings as Ock throws a switch.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUARD
dialog: Freeze! Hands up!
text: Ock turns, the waldos waving like Medusa’s hair. The guard steps forward,
text: her bullet RICOCHETS off a telescoping metal arm. It grabs the gun and the
text: woman’s hand, squeezing. A second waldo whips around the male guard’s
text: neck, shakes him like a terrier with a rat, then hurls him into a wall of
dialog: wires.
text: Electricity jolts his body and knocks him out. Ock’s attention returns to
text: his work. Released, the woman falls to her knees in pain, crawls to her
text: fallen comrade. Her hand extends for his revolver. But her body is
text: dragged away from the gun-- a waldo had her ankle. She SCREAMS. Another
text: waldo slaps her head, knocks her out.
text: A voltmeter reads zero. Ock frowns-- then spies a locked metal cabinet
text: marked “Third Rail Circuit-- NY Transit Authority.” Ock considers this.

speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I think I’d like that.
text: He ignores his dessert, stares out the window.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: They keep saying there’s nothing I could’ve done. That’s a
dialog: lie. I could’ve done something. If only I’d paid
dialog: attention to my feelings.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You’re not trained for that. None of us are… I mean,
dialog: sometimes I…

dialog: Okay, let’s say you had gone back. What then? Are you

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, no.

dialog: I’d feel…
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’d feel what?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (covering)
dialog: Listen. You think you’re responsible for everything that

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Am I? I’m not so sure.
dialog: (looks at her)

dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I know what you mean. I…
text: He looks a little queasy-- the spider-sense again. Liz’s voice and the
text: restaurant SOUND drop out, TRACK IN TO TIGHT CLOSE-UP on Peter. We hear
text: the Ock THROB and PANICKED CRIES of people in a subway car.
text: Abruptly, we’re back to reality. And Liz is being oddly inarticulate,
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Maybe unsure is-- good. Maybe you feel more that way.
dialog: Like I was sure you and I were just friends-- and that’s
dialog: it. But-- last weekend, when I was with Flash-- all I
dialog: could think of was--
text: She sees Peter is paying absolutely no attention. She bangs her spoon
text: against her glass.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hello. Earth to Peter. Are you listening?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Unh-huh. Excuse me. I’ve gotta go.
text: He grabs the Lieber’s bag and hurried out. The waiter sets the check down
text: before the boiling Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I think I really do hate him.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE DISTRICT - DAY

scene_heading: PEDESTRIAN AND VEHICLE TRAFFIC SNARLS, HONKING HORNS, FRAZZLED NERVES.
text: The THROB begins-- low, muffled, under the street cacophony. At an
text: intersection, two cars coming from opposite directions suddenly swerve
text: toward each other. The drivers spin their steering wheels to avoid a crash,
text: but magnetic attraction makes them slide through the intersection, smash

text: A taxi swerves around the wreck--
scene_heading: EXT. WARPED STREET - DAY
text: --AND DOWN THIS LESS-CROWDED STREET. THE THROB SWELLS.
text: THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
text: The PULSE spreads through the asphalt ahead, rippling mirage-like.
text: The taxi’s wheels sink into the liquefying street, now the consistency of
text: quicksand. The driver crawls out his window and leaps to the sidewalk as
text: the gooey street swallows the cab.
text: Spider-Man swings to the edge of an overlooking building, watches the cab
text: sink. An earthquake-like RUMBLE from below.
text: From beneath the street, a subway train BURSTS UP, arcs into the air with a
speaker_heading: ROAR--
text: the three-car train sails through the air past Spider-Man--
text: a huge hole opens like an iris in the facade of a nearby modern office
dialog: building

speaker_heading: BIKER

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: I’m hip. Thanks for the lift.
text: He hands her the helmet and she screeches off. Spider-Man spies an
text: approaching semi, runs-- and leaps, clinging to the side of the trailer.
text: The semi moves over the bridge. Ock’s Caddy is several cars ahead, halfway
text: over the bridge. Spider-Man crawls up to the top of the trailer. A cloudy

speaker_heading: BEDDING.
text: In an open concrete bunker, Ock uses his human hands to pull open a vault-
text: like drawer. Inside are dozens of sealed canisters, all bearing “Danger--
text: Radioactivity” warnings. He checks through them, discarding unwanted
text: canisters haphazardly. One near the back catches his eye: “SL 270” is
text: scrawled on the stained label. He plucks it out, examines it, nodding.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Open that now and you’ll spoil Christmas.
text: Ock whirls around. Spider-Man drops down from atop a chemical vat, clucking
text: his tongue and sauntering toward him.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Surprise!
speaker_heading: OCK
speaker_heading: Surprise…
text: He pulls open his overcoat-- all four waldos telescope toward the
text: astonished Spider-Man. They encircle his body, squeezing like pythons.
text: Spider-Man gulps for air, struggling desperately against the steel arms.
text: He wriggles a hand free, shoots webbing up and pulls himself from Ock’s
text: clutches.
text: Ock grabs the small canister-- but a stream of webbing shoots down and
text: jerks the container up to Spider-Man on the roof of the bunker. He springs
text: down to the ground on the run.
text: Ock’s waldos lift an oil drum and hurl it over his head. The drum BURSTS
text: ahead of Spidey, spraying a greasy cloud of noxious gas and sizzling
text: liquid. Spider-Man gags as Ock rumbles toward him.
speaker_heading: OCK
dialog: You are an insect!
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Doc, you know better than that. Insects are a completely
dialog: different order from spiders--
text: Spider-Man ducks as a waldo shoots out, puncturing a hole in a metal vat,
text: which EXPLODES. He rolls under a flaming stream of napalm-like fluid.
text: A waldo grabs the SL 270 container; a third arm backhands Spider-Man,
text: knocking him through the air into a concrete wall. Shaken, Spider-Man gets
text: to his feet, stumbles after Ock.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Well? Had enough?
text: Ock uses the waldos to pull himself over the retaining wall. Spider-Man
text: leaps onto Ock’s back, throws him in a head-lock. Ock sputters, strikes
text: backward with his real fists, to no avail.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Aren’t we both too intellectual for this?
text: A deep, ugly roar echoes from Ock’s chest. Two waldos whip backward, grab
text: Spider-Man and fling him violently over the top of the wall--
scene_heading: EXT. MUDDY STREET - NIGHT
text: AND ONTO THE ROOF OF THE PATROL CAR. HE BOUNCES OFF AND SPLASHES INTO A
scene_heading: PUDDLE. PAINFULLY, HE ROLLS OVER, STRUGGLING TO HIS HANDS AND KNEES. OUT
scene_heading: OF NOWHERE, A WALDO CLAW CLUTCHES AT HIS THROAT, SQUEEZING. SPIDER-MAN
scene_heading: PRESSES THE WEB-SHOOTER TRIGGERS-- THEY SPURT BLOBS OF GOOP, THEN AIR, OUT
speaker_heading: OF WEBBING.
text: Ock thrusts Spider-Man against the wall, rears back with another arm and
text: aims a deadly blow. Spider-Man jerks his head-- the metal fist misses by
text: inches, punching a crater in the concrete. Ock laughs maniacally, prepares
dialog: for the final blow.
speaker_heading: ROZ (O.S.)
dialog: Octavius!
text: Ock turns and sees Roz, getting out of his vintage Porsche.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Please.
text: The wild violence drains from Ock’s face, replaced for a moment by sanity.
text: He looks at Rosomoff, then at the metal arms, then again at Roz, pitifully.
text: With an anguished cry, he loosens the grip on the choking Spider-Man. Ock
text: rushes to the Cadillac, drives off. SIRENS wail in the distance as Roz
text: helps Spider-Man to his feet.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: I sent for the police. We can explain.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
text: Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad

speaker_heading: ROZ

speaker_heading: ROZ

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: (coughs)
dialog: Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey. Lucky you showed up
dialog: when you did.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Logic. Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--

dialog: I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Imagine how I feel.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Excuse me if I’m impertinent, but-- how did you become…
dialog: whatever it is you are?
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: The usual. Heredity and environment. What’s the deal with
dialog: Doc Ock?
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: He’ll try to finish his experiment.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: And blow up the universe just to prove he’s right? Bit
dialog: egotistical, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: ROZ
text: A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In his
dialog: universe, there’s only one mind-- his own. It must be very
dialog: lonely.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Forgive me if I don’t feel too sympathetic right now.
text: They drive south to Lower Manhattan on West End Avenue in the rain.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the
dialog: Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- “I am become Shiva,
dialog: Death-- the destroyer of worlds.” Octavius was…
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Bonkers.
speaker_heading: ROZ

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN

speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Do you… live around here?
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: No, but I’ve got this secret identity to worry about. I’ll
dialog: swing the rest of the way.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: I see. Well, Octavius won’t get much further. They’ll
dialog: catch him and… put him away. Sad. He might very well have
dialog: the truth.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Phooey on that.
text: Roz drives off. Spider-Man raises his arms to shoot a web-- it makes PHFFT

speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Come on, laughter’s the best medicine!
text: Adele pushes him out the door. Liz looks at Harry, who nods and follows

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, God, I forgot to--
speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (half-asleep)
dialog: Strong…
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they’re the weakest

dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Liz!
text: He seizes the offensive, swings at Ock with the drainpipe.
text: The building reels, vertical walls nearly upright.
text: Spidey heaves the drainpipe like a javelin, hitting Ock in the belly. The
text: pipe hurtles downward. Double-jets of webbing shoot out to cover Ock’s
text: livid face.
text: Spider-Man swings around Ock toward Liz, shoots webbing to secure her to
text: the face of the building.
text: Spider-Man dodges and ducks the flailing waldos, weaving a web to bind them
text: to the wall. More and more web-fluid-- the net draws tighter.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: You could use a nice, long rest.
text: At last near enough to Ock’s body, Spidey clips him with a quick blow--
text: he’s out. Spider-Man scrambles to Liz and pulls her inside.
scene_heading: INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY
text: ROZ RUNS FROM ONE BANK OF CONTROLS TO ANOTHER. SPIDER-MAN AND LIZ ENTER
text: FROM THE CONTROL ROOM.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: What’s she doing here?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: This building is flying. I’m in a flying building…
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Sure, in the war. Pull those cables--
text: Spider-Man runs across to the transformer, now glowing less brightly. He
text: pulls a thick electrical cable-- the cyclotron GROANS, the PULSE diminishes
text: further. Spider-Man grabs another cable.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: One at a time! We’ll drop like a bomb!
text: Spider-Man lets go as if it were red-hot.
scene_heading: EXT. SCIENCE CENTER -- DAY
text: SOME ENERGY STREAMS SPUTTER INTO NOTHINGNESS. THE BUILDING GENTLY DESCENDS
text: TOWARD THE CLOUDS BELOW.
scene_heading: INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - DAY
text: LIZ WATCHES AS SPIDER-MAN AND ROZ WORK TOGETHER.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I’m in a goddamn flying building…
text: The PULSE in the floor “unspreads” toward the focusing cone.
text: Liz’s earrings flutter-- the fly off her ears, sailing to the curved wall
text: of the cyclotron. Other metal objects-- pliers, a welder’s torch, etc.--
dialog: join them there.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Magnetism-- phase one. We’re returning to normal.
text: Ock’s waldos ERUPT through the floor. Seething, he pulls himself into the
text: room, loose strands of webbing hanging from his face and arms.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Oh, come on!
text: All four waldos surge out at Spider-Man. He barely leaps away, a waldo
text: lashes after him and pulls loose another electrical cable--
dialog: the room pitches
text: Liz and Roz fall to the floor, she pulls Roz away from the glow.
text: Spider-Man leaps to the ceiling above the cyclotron. Ock strikes out-- the
text: magnetism sucks an arm against the accelerator tube and holds it fast.
text: The Pulse shrinks further to an area below the focusing cone.
text: Ock’s remaining arms strike madly at Spider-Man, Roz, everything.
text: A waldo crosses the beam of power from the focusing cone-- concentric rings
text: of energy shoot down the length of the arm-- the waldo BURSTS APART,
text: scattering wire and metal.
text: Ock YOWLS in pain, a two-foot remnant of a waldo flops limply at his torso.
text: Spider-Man leaps to the ceiling above the focusing cone.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Up here, Docky Ocky!
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: (desperately)
dialog: No, no! Not there!
text: Ock’s remaining two waldo arms thrust madly at Spider-Man-- he springs
dialog: away.
text: The waldos SMASH the cone.
text: Unearthly SOUNDS.
text: The fibrous BLUE WHITE BEAM envelops Doc Ock’s entire body.
text: A dark, completely alien slit opens in space where the focusing cone had
dialog: been.
text: The widening gap draws Ock into its weird Beyond. He reaches toward it with
dialog: his human hands.
text: Liz & Spider-Man struggle to resist the gap’s pull. Roz watches in horror
dialog: as--
text: Ock’s body warps, twists inside itself. He HOWLS-- agony, pleasure,
dialog: enlightenment, death.
text: The gap implodes Doc Ock’s body and…
text: disappears, closing and sucking the last of the energy and PULSE into it.
text: Eerie silence, except for the growing WHISTLE of air.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: (hushed)
dialog: He found his truth.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: We’re falling…
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Okay, I blew it-- let’s move!
scene_heading: EXT. SCIENCE CENTER- DAY

speaker_heading: CLOUDS.
scene_heading: INT. SCIENCE CENTER HALLWAY - DAY
scene_heading: SPIDER-MAN AND ROZ HELP LIZ TOWARD THE STAIRCASE. THE WIND WHISTLES LOUDER

scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE - DAY
scene_heading: PITCHING AND ROLLING, SPIDER-MAN, ROZ AND LIZ MOVE WEIGHTLESSLY UP TO THE

scene_heading: EXT. SCIENCE CENTER - DAY
text: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN IN THE HURRICANE WIND. FIRE EXTINGUISHERS AND OTHER

speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: Hold tight, kids!
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: CENTRAL PARK ACCELERATES TOWARD THEM AS THEY PLUNGE TO EARTH.

scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY
scene_heading: FALLING, WITH LIZ HANGING ONTO HIS NECK, ROZ UNDER ONE ARM, SPIDER-MAN
scene_heading: SHOOTS WEBBING DOWNWARD--
scene_heading: EXT. CLEOPATRA’S NEEDLE - DAY
dialog: TO THE TOP OF THE OBELISK--
text: and swings gracefully down in a spiral around the monument.
text: He touches ground, sets Roz and Liz on their feet. They look around them:
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: A HAILSTORM OF DEBRIS-- PAPERS, BOOKS, BOTTLES, BRICKS. THE LAKE’S SURFACE
text: CHURNS AND CALMS.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEOPATRA’S NEEDLE - DAY
text: THE TRIO STANDS FOR A MOMENT, STUNNED. LIZ’S KNEES BUCKLE AS SHE FAINTS.
scene_heading: SPIDER-MAN CATCHES HER.
speaker_heading: SPIDER-MAN
dialog: I can handle it.
text: He hefts her into his arms and walks off into the gathering crowd.
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL CORRIDOR - DAY
text: NORB AND CHIP LEANS AGAINST THE WALL, HANGING OUT. THEY READ A COPY OF THE
scene_heading: TIMES. THE BOLD HEADLINE: “SCIENTISTS EXPLAIN TORNADO/
scene_heading: EARTHQUAKE/ELECTRICAL STORM.” FLASH SWAGGERS UP, SWACKS THEIR TIMES WITH A
text: COPY OF THE BUGLE.
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Use that to wrap fish. I got the real story.
text: He shows them the tacky Bugle headline: “SPIDER-MAN SAVES UNIVERSE.” Chip
text: and Norb break up laughing. Students pour out of a classroom behind them.
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Hey! This is the truth! Look, Doc Ock had this, uh,
text: experiment thing, and the Science Center crashed into
dialog: Central Park, and--
text: He spots Peter and Harry, holds up the Bugle.
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: Parker, Osborn--true, am I right?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: Oh, of course.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I was there.
speaker_heading: FLASH
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (wild-eyed)
dialog: Or was it all a dream?

dialog: Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, I’ve missed a lot of classes myself….
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Oh. Well, hang in there, amigo.
text: He crosses away. Roz catches up to Peter from the lecture hall.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: Peter-- I’m so very proud of you. I must apologize for
dialog: doubting that you could do it.
text: Peter eyes him, wondering what he knows. Roz eyes him back.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: The paper, my boy. A solid B-plus.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
speaker_heading: ROZ
dialog: If you really apply yourself, you’ll get an A next time.
text: Roz smiles wisely. Peter watches him walk off.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Next time…
text: The idea of doing it all again makes Peter whistle lowly. He sees someone
text: across the street.
scene_heading: EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY
text: SMILING, PETER RUNS UP TO LIZ.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello, Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hello. So very boring. Peter Parker, how do you feel
dialog: about me this morning?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I… I like you. A lot.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hm. Well, I like you, too. I like your aunt. I like your
dialog: shoelaces. I like--
text: He holds a fingertip to her lips.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hold it. Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why?
text: He kisses her. She looks at him bittersweetly.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nah.
text: She kisses him back. They walk off into the park, holding hands…. and we
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
