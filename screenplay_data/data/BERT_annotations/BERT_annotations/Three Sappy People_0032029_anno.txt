speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: A fancy party is in progress. The butler, a large man named WILLIAMS, spoons
text: some punch from a bowl into a glass as THE COUNTESS, a snooty woman with a
text: long cigarette holder and a monocle, looks on.
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: Isn't it rather odd that your mistress hasn't
text: put in an appearance at her own party?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (hands her the punch)
dialog: Uh, yes, Madame. I'm sorry, Madame.
text: The Countess walks off with disdain. The butler shoots a glance across the
text: room. We follow his gaze with a FAST PAN TO the man of the house MR. RUMSFORD,
text: a rather mousy gentlemen who sits worriedly in a chair. His friend DR. YORK
text: stands over him, smoking a cigar.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Where is she?
text: Rumsford pounds his fist into his hand and rises abruptly.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Where is that wife of mine?
scene_heading: DR. YORK
dialog: Now, take it easy, Rumsford.
text: Williams arrives with a tray of drinks.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: A drink, sir?
text: Rumsford and York each take a drink.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: (to Williams)
dialog: Any word from Mrs. Rumsford?
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Not a word, sir. I'm terribly upset.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: You're upset. What about me? She invites all
dialog: these people to her birthday party and then
dialog: runs out on them!
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: She always does that, sir. She'll probably be
dialog: back in a day or two.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: (chokes on his drink)
dialog: Day or two?!
text: Williams makes a face and walks off.
scene_heading: DR. YORK
dialog: Snap out of it, Rumsford. You must make
dialog: allowances for her youth. Sherry'll turn up.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: If I didn't love that woman so much, I swear
dialog: I'd--
text: A car horn HONKS. Rumsford and York stare in horror as an automobile barrels
text: into the living room and SCREECHES to a halt in front of the fireplace. The
text: guests GASP in amazement. At the wheel of the car is the missing wife, young
text: and vivacious SHERRY RUMSFORD, wearing a hat and a fur coat. She waves to her
text: husband and starts to climb out of the car.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Oh, darling! Hello! Be right over!
text: Williams enters and stares in shock at the car.
speaker_heading: SHERRY (o.s.)
dialog: Oh, Williams!
text: Williams regains his composure and stands at attention.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (with some resignation)
dialog: Ready, Madame.
text: Sherry takes off her fur coat while Rumsford and York exchange uneasy glances.
text: She throws her fur coat across the room at Williams and it miraculously
text: drapes itself goofily around his shoulders. She takes off her hat and throws
text: it onto Williams' head. He looks rather ridiculous in a lady's hat and fur
text: but bears the humiliation with dignity. Meanwhile, Rumsford confers with York.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Listen, York. You're a doctor and you're my
dialog: best friend. Isn't there anything you can do
dialog: for her?
scene_heading: DR. YORK
dialog: I'm afraid she's a bit out of my line. The men
dialog: you want are Doctors Ziller, Zeller, and
dialog: Zoller.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Do you think they can help her?
scene_heading: DR. YORK
dialog: Well, they're the finest psychiatrists in the
dialog: business. They're terribly expensive and their
dialog: methods are very peculiar. But they do get
dialog: results.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: I'll have Williams call them. I'll have
text: Williams call them immediately.
text: Rumsford rings for the butler. York checks his watch.
scene_heading: DR. YORK
dialog: I've got to see a patient, Rummy. I'll try to
dialog: get back later. Good luck.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Thanks.
text: York exits as Williams approaches.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Oh, Williams. I want you to telephone Doctors
text: Ziller, Zeller, and Zoller.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY
text: Painted onto the glass of the office's front door, a sign reads:
scene_heading: Dr. Z. ZILLER, M.D.
scene_heading: Dr. X. ZELLER, M.D.
scene_heading: Dr. Y. ZOLLER, M.D.
speaker_heading: PSYCHIATRISTS
speaker_heading: ENTER
text: We PAN from the door to reveal a PAINTER cleaning up his equipment (paint
text: cans, brushes, etc.) and a SECRETARY who struggles with a recalcitrant
text: telephone switchboard.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Oh, this switchboard!
text: The secretary holds the headphone to her ear as she tries to get a line out.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Oh, it's dead!
text: Frustrated, she throws the headphone down and turns to the painter.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Thank goodness you're through. I've been almost
dialog: crazy.
speaker_heading: PAINTER
dialog: Yes, ma'am. I'll have my stuff out right after
dialog: lunch.
text: The secretary exits into a private office as the painter exits out the front
text: door. Immediately, the Three Stooges enter from the front door: LARRY, MOE and
text: CURLY. Moe carries a tool box. Curly carries a huge ladder over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Looks like there's nobody here.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: This is the place all right.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Maybe I got the--
text: Curly turns to look around and SMASHES the glass of the front door with his
dialog: ladder.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: You puddin'-head! Why don't you look what
dialog: you're doin'?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I couldn't help it. I was lookin' around to see
dialog: if there's anybody in the office and when I
dialog: turned--
text: Curly turns and SMASHES a glass water cooler with the ladder.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Look what you did!
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: What?!
text: Curly turns to look at the smashed water cooler and the ladder swings around
text: and POPS Moe in the face.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Oh!
text: Moe clutches his eye in pain. He advances on Curly.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Why don't you be careful?
text: Moe pokes Curly in the eye.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Drop that ladder before you hurt somebody.
text: Curly DROPS the ladder on Moe's foot. Moe clutches his foot in pain.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Remind me to tear out your Adam's apple.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'll make a note of it.
text: As Curly reaches into his pocket, the secretary returns and sees the mess
text: they've made. Curly, with a tiny pencil and pad, makes a note to himself to
text: remind Moe to tear out his Adam's apple.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Give me that!
text: Moe grabs the pencil away from Curly. Curly squeals and pulls another pencil
text: from his pocket and starts to write with it. Moe grabs the pencil away.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: What's the matter with you?
text: Curly makes a few noises of frustration and then pulls a giant-sized pencil
text: from his jacket and starts to write.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nyuk nyuk nyuk nyuk.
text: Moe grabs the pencil and HITS Curly over the head with it.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Oh! You'll break my pencil!
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: I'll break your head.
text: Moe pulls a hair out of Curly's chest and Curly squeals in pain as the
text: secretary joins them.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Say, what war is this?
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Never mind the wisecracks, Toots. We're
dialog: trouble-shooters from the phone company. What's
dialog: wrong here?
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: Painters ruined my switchboard.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Come on.
text: The Stooges move to the switchboard.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: If you can bring it to life and a call comes in
dialog: for the doctors, say they're out of town. I'm
dialog: goin' to lunch.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Okay.
text: As the secretary exits, Curly calls after her.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Hey! Bring me back a piece of burnt toast and a
dialog: rotten egg!
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Burnt toast and a rotten egg?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Yeah, I got a tapeworm and that's good enough
dialog: for 'im.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (pushes Curly)
dialog: Go on! Get busy!
text: The Stooges get to work. Curly sees a stethoscope in a doctor's bag atop the
text: switchboard. He pulls it out and puts the earpieces in his ear.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Larry)
dialog: How's she comin'?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Not so good.
text: Curly puts the stethoscope against the switchboard.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to the switchboard)
dialog: Say, "Ahh!"
speaker_heading: MOE
text: (to Curly, off the stethoscope)
dialog: What do you got here?
text: Moe pulls on the stethoscope, stretching it out.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Hey, gimme that! Gimme that!
text: Moe releases the stethoscope -- it snaps back and WHACKS Curly in the nose.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Ohhh!
text: Moe violently pulls the earpieces from Curly's ears, causing a POPPING sound.
text: Curly GNASHES his teeth pneumatically at Moe who hands the stethoscope back
text: to him.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Now, go on! Get busy like I told ya!
dialog: (to Larry)
dialog: Go on!
text: Moe shoos Larry away from the board, sits, and puts on the headphones. He
text: puts a phone wire up to a hole in the board.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Pull this line through and hook it on number
dialog: six.
text: Curly pulls the line through the hole in the board -- but the line is
text: attached to the headphones on Moe's head, thus causing Moe's head to be
text: pulled forward violently. Moe's head SMASHES into the board.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Oh!
text: Moe pulls his head back, drawing the wire backwards. This frustrates Curly
text: who squeals and pulls on it again -- too hard. He stumbles backward and out
text: of the scene. There is a huge CRASH. Moe and Larry jump in horror as we PAN
text: QUICKLY TO Curly sitting in a bucket amidst the painter's equipment, each of
text: his hands stuck in a paint can and a wooden plank on his head.
speaker_heading: CURLY
text: Woo-woo. Woo-hoo-hoo. Hey, Larry! Help me!
dialog: I'm surrounded! Woo-hoo-hoo!
text: Moe and Larry rush to Curly's aid. They push the plank away and, each
text: grabbing an arm, lift Curly to his feet.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Get up.
dialog: (to Larry, off the bucket
text: wedged onto Curly's rear)
dialog: Get a hold o' that!
text: Moe grabs Curly by the head and Larry pulls the bucket off of Curly's rear.
text: Larry FALLS to the floor in the process.

text: Williams is on the phone, making a call.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS

speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: It's Gertie. She's gonna have--
text: Curly grows suddenly bashful. But Moe realizes what he means.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: That's wonderful. When do you expect it?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Any minute. That's why I'm so upset.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: No foolin'? Why didn't you tell us?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: But, you see, I--
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I know. You're broke.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (nods)
text: Flat as a floogie.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: That's bad. We gotta figure out a way to get
dialog: some money and get it quick.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Aw, thanks, Moe.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: You're welcome.
text: Moe and Curly shake hands.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Okay, I got--
text: Moe looks down in disgust at his hand, now stained with paint, like Curly's.
text: Moe wipes his hand on Curly's jacket.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Come on.
text: Curly barks like a dog. Moe CONKS Curly in the back of the head.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Come on! Get to work!
text: The Stooges head back to the switchboard.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - DAY

text: Larry struggles with some phone wires. Frustrated, he whips one away.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (disgusted)
dialog: Ahhh...
text: Miraculously, the wire lodges in the proper hole: a light flashes and the
text: board starts to BUZZ. The Stooges rush to the board and Moe answers the call.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Hello, Operator?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - DAY

speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Ooooh! I love to play trains!

text: Choo choo choo choo choo! Whooo-woo! Sssssssh!
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Curly)
dialog: Why don't you get a toupee with some brains in
dialog: it?
text: Moe THWACKS Curly's nose. Curly pulls up Moe's bangs and CONKS him on the
dialog: forehead.
speaker_heading: MOE

dialog: Why, you--!
text: Moe turns his attention to the phone.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DOCTORS' OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: MOE

text: Moe hangs up and addresses Larry and Curly.
speaker_heading: MOE

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What are we supposed to do?
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (points to Curly)
dialog: You're Ziller.
dialog: (points to Larry)
dialog: You're Zeller.

speaker_heading: CURLY

dialog: Oh, glad to meetcha, Doctor.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: How are ya, son?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Now, listen, Doc. I'm troubled with T.S.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: What do you mean, T.S.?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Two Stomachs!
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Stick out yer tongue!
text: Curly sticks out his tongue. Moe PUNCHES him in one of his stomachs.
speaker_heading: MOE
text: There's an impatient patient waiting. Come on.
text: Although they protest, Moe grabs Curly by the ear and Larry by the hair and
text: drags them away.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RUMSFORD MANSION - DAY
text: Sherry comes running out of the building, followed by Rumsford and Williams.
text: A chauffeur waits beside a fancy car (license number 5R 161).
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Wait! Sherry, you can't run out on your guests
dialog: like this again.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: But, darling, I'm bored! I'm only going for a
dialog: short ride in a submarine! I'll be back in a
dialog: day or two. Tell them all to wait.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: But, Sh--
text: They are interrupted by the gentle RINGING of bicycle bells. The Stooges --
text: dressed in top hats and tails -- come riding up on a three-seater bicycle.
text: They fall off the bike at the edge of the driveway -- to the shock and
text: confusion of the Rumsfords. The Stooges rise and rush over to Rumsford.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Gentlemen, I'm Mr. Rumsford. Are you looking
dialog: for someone?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'm Ziller.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm Zeller.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: I'm Zoller.
text: As Sherry looks on with interest, Moe puts a shoe horn near Rumsford's mouth.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Stick out yer tongue.
text: Rumsford opens his mouth and Moe uses the shoe horn as a tongue depressor.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Say, "Ahh" with your mouth closed.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Ahhh.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (singing in harmony)
dialog: Ahhh.
speaker_heading: MOE & CURLY
dialog: (joining in)
dialog: Ahhh.
scene_heading: ALL THREE STOOGES
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Ahhh...
dialog: (spoken, with disgust)
dialog: Rats!
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: This is serious.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: You're wrong, gentlemen. It's strictly a case
dialog: of latkes and [pippiks?]
text: Sherry roars with laughter at the Stooges.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: (practically squealing)
dialog: This is priceless.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: (to the Stooges)
dialog: I'm not the patient. It's Mrs. Rumsford.
text: The chauffeur looks on with amazement as the Stooges turn to Sherry.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Oh. How do you do, Madame?
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Now, see here, Sherry...
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Oh, darling, you take the submarine ride. I
dialog: wouldn't leave these men on a bet. Come,
dialog: gentlemen! The last one in is a Republican!
text: Sherry suddenly bolts for the front door. The Stooges take off in happy
text: pursuit, with Curly circling Rumsford like an airplane before taking off
text: after her. A stunned Rumsford quickly follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - LIVING ROOM
text: Sherry runs in, followed closely by the Stooges. Moe plows into Williams,
text: upsetting the tray of pretzels he carries and knocking him out of the shot.
text: Sherry laughs gaily throughout. After a moment, there is a CRASH and a
text: woman's SHRIEK. Sherry and the Stooges turn to look at the sofa where
text: Williams now lies in the Countess' lap beside a mustached guest named John.
text: Everyone is covered with pretzels. John has the pretzel bowl lid on his head.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (totally mortified)
dialog: Oh, Countess. I'm so sorry.
text: The Countess has a pretzel wedged around her eye like a monocle. She puts
text: her own monocle up to the other eye, trying to keep her dignity.
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: Really!
text: Sherry hurries over to help straighten things up.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: (to guest with lid on his head)
dialog: Oh, John!
text: Rumsford rushes in and joins the Stooges. He sees the mess and winces.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Ooooh!
text: Sherry starts to take the lid off John's head.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: I'll get you a drink.
text: She removes the lid but his toupee comes off with it, leaving him bald as a
text: ping pong ball. He clutches his head in horror. A distraught Rumsford
text: confers with the Stooges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Gentlemen, what will I do with her? Now, let me
dialog: tell you a little bit about Sherry.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Oh, don't bother. I'll take Scotch.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Make mine rye.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'll take gin smothered in bourbon. Nyuk, nyuk.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Larry and Curly)
dialog: Boys.
text: Moe motions with eyes and head to something o.s. They follow his gaze. They
text: stare at each other for a split second before racing away from Rumsford and
text: over to a table loaded with drinks. Sherry stands at the punch bowl fixing a
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Gentlemen, do have some rum punch.
text: Sherry leaves with the drink and a tray of hors d'oeuvres.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Rum punch? Why, soitanly. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk,
dialog: nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
text: Curly removes his gloves. Larry pulls the stethoscope from his pocket.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (off the stethoscope)
dialog: I knew this thing would come in handy.
text: Larry removes the earpieces from the stethoscope, leaving only the rubber
text: tubing. Moe watches as Larry offers one of the earpiece tubes to Curly.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Will you join me?
text: The business end of the stethoscope is dropped into the bunch bowl.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Soitanly. Skoal.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Skoal.
text: Using the tubing as a tandem drinking straw, Larry and Curly SLURP up some of
text: the rum punch. After a moment, they stop and make faces.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: This is weak.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Yeah. The rum went through this punch on
text: stilts.
text: Moe takes a bottle from the table, opens it and takes a whiff.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: This Scotch ought to help.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: (picking up another bottle)
dialog: This gin should make it fizzy.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (with two bottles)
dialog: Bourbon and rum ought to help some.
text: Curly sniffs one of the bottles. He sneezes twice and is about to sneeze
text: again when Sherry returns to the table and offers him a tray.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: (to Curly)
dialog: Hors d'oeuvre?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: No. Hay fever.
text: Sherry busts out laughing at this and walks off. The Stooges pour the
text: various bottles into the punch bowl. When these are emptied, they turn to
text: some other bottles on the table.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Hey, here's some new kind of liquor.
dialog: Wor-cester-shire!
dialog: (pours Worcestershire sauce
dialog: into the punch bowl)
dialog: Oh, ho ho ho.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: This says "Tabasco" -- I ain't never drunk any.
dialog: But we'll put it in.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: What have you got to lose?
text: Larry pours hot Tabasco sauce into the bowl. Curly squeals and claps his
text: hands with delight as he finds a bottle of his own.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk. Sham paynee!
text: Curly POPS the cork on his champagne bottle. The cork flies off and
text: champagne SPRITZES out of the top. Curly covers the bottle with his hand to
text: stop the flow. After a pause he looks over at Moe and does a double take.
text: We SWISH PAN TO discover Moe with the champagne cork wedged in his right eye.
text: Moe grimaces, pulls the cork from his eye, stares at it for a second, puts it
text: down, and confronts Curly.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: You shouldn't handle dangerous weapons.
dialog: (off the champagne bottle)
dialog: Give me that.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I will not!
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Let me have it!
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (reluctantly)
dialog: Ohhh...
text: Curly removes his hand and the foam SPRAYS Moe. Curly directs the stream of
text: champagne into the punch bowl while Moe BOPS Curly's head several times in
text: succession. Larry calls Moe's attention to the punch bowl.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Look! It's boiling.
text: The punch is practically steaming.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: It must be done.
text: The Stooges grab little glass cups and dip them into the bowl. They clink
text: their glasses together and all three drink simultaneously. After a moment,
text: they wince horribly and belch PUFFS of smoke from their mouths. They put
text: down their glasses and wipe their mouths, looking rather pleased.
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: A marvelous accomplishment.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: A prodigious achievement.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: You said it! It's putrid!
text: Suddenly, Rumsford joins the Stooges at the table.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Gentlemen, would you be good enough to look my
dialog: wife over now?
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: A pleasure.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: This way.
text: The Stooges follow Rumsford to the sofa where Sherry and the Countess sit
text: talking.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: (to Sherry)
dialog: The doctor's going to look you over, dear.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Oh, goody.
text: Curly joins Sherry and the Countess on the sofa, sitting between them. Moe
text: and Larry stand nearby.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Sherry)
dialog: Now, uh, we shall test your reflex first.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Okay, Doctor.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
text: Sherry's legs are crossed and Curly taps her just below the knee to test her
text: reflexes. But nothing happens. Sherry just laughs. Curly squeals in
text: frustration and taps her again. Still nothing. Curly squeals and palms his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: This is the way a normal reflex should act.
text: To demonstrate, Curly crosses his own legs and taps himself below the knee.
text: Nothing. He does a double take and scowls at Sherry. Now, Curly turns to
text: the Countess sitting beside him and taps her knee, still with no result.
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: (offended, to Curly)
dialog: I beg your pardon.
text: Delighted with Curly's boldness, Sherry gasps and puts a hand to her mouth.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to the Countess)
dialog: Oh, you don't have to apologize. You can't help
dialog: it you're crazy.
text: The Countess is so shocked by this remark that the monocle pops out of her
dialog: eye.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Curly)
dialog: C'mere, guinea pig.
text: Curly rises, sits on the arm of the sofa, and crosses his legs. Moe kneels
text: beside him and prepares to show him how it's done. (Meanwhile, some of the
text: other guests, including the Countess, start tapping themselves below the
dialog: knee.)
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (professorially)
text: Now, then. Holding the palm at a forty-five
dialog: degree angle...
text: Moe taps Curly below the knee. Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Must be off a couple of degrees.
text: Moe tries again. Still nothing.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (upset, to Curly)
dialog: Trouble is, you've got no life.
text: Moe KETTLE DRUMS Curly in the stomach. Curly's leg lashes out and KICKS Moe,
text: sending him backward.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Oh!
text: Curly backs away, squealing, afraid of retaliation. Reaching the other side
text: of the room, Curly trips over the leg of a bookish guest who sits in a chair,
text: reading a newspaper. Curly falls to the floor.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to the guest)
dialog: Pardon me.
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: The guest goes back to reading his paper and crosses his legs. Still on the
text: floor, Curly sees the guest's crossed legs and decides to tap him below the
text: knee. He hits it hard and makes a loud wooden THUMP. The guest puts his
text: paper down and stares at Curly who squeals in frustration before THUMPING the
text: leg again. Finally, Curly smacks himself in the face a few times and karate
text: CHOPS the leg. Curly clutches his hand in pain and HOWLS. The guest gives
text: Curly an "it serves you right" nod. The guest uncrosses the leg and when it
text: BANGS loudly to the floor we realize it is a wooden leg. Curly stares at
text: this, reaches down, and KNOCKS on the wood. It sounds like someone knocking
text: at a door, so Curly says:
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Come in.
text: Curly pulls the guest's trouser leg up to reveal the actual wood -- and a
text: tiny sign that reads: POST NO BILLS. Curly rises and backs away in horror
text: until he encounters a large white marble statue of a muscular man sitting on
text: a pedestal. Sort of a cut-rate version of Rodin's The Thinker. Curly eyes
text: the statue's bent leg and contemplates tapping its knee with glee.
speaker_heading: CURLY
text: Ooo-oohh. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
text: Curly taps the statue's knee and -- improbably -- obtains the desired result:
text: the statue's leg flexes. In response, an amazed Curly barks like a dog at
text: the statue. Then pauses to wonder how the statue could have come to life. (It
text: is, of course, a male model made up to look like a statue.)
text: Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, Moe, Larry and the other guests are
text: all bent over, tapping their legs below the knee. Williams enters and makes
text: an announcement.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
text: Dinner is served.
text: Moe straightens up and turns to Larry.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Eats!
text: Curly starts GIBBERING like a madman and running in place. Moe jumps over
text: the sofa. Larry runs around it and hops on Moe's back for a piggy-back ride
text: into the dining room. The guests and Williams watch all this with stunned
text: looks while Sherry laughs happily. Finally, Curly runs over and jumps on
text: Williams' back for his own piggy-back ride into the dining room.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
text: (laughing, to the stunned guests)
dialog: Aren't they marvelous?
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RUMSFORD MANSION - DINING ROOM - DAY
text: Everyone save Williams is seated at the dining room table. Sherry sits at
text: the head of the table. On her right sits Moe and Larry (when Larry tries to
text: flirt with the lady on his right, Moe grabs him violently by the hair). On
text: Sherry's left sits Curly. To Curly's left is the Countess. Rumsford sits at
text: the other end of the table, opposite Sherry. The seating arrangement looks
dialog: like this:
dialog: Sherry
dialog: Moe		Curly
dialog: Larry		The Countess
dialog: Lady		Male Guest
dialog: ?		Matronly Woman
dialog: ?		John
dialog: Rumsford
text: Everyone has a cream puff in front of them. We know what that means...
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to Sherry)
dialog: I just love cream puffs.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Oh, I hope you gentlemen will like my Spanish
dialog: dinner.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I'm just crazy about Spanish food -- especially
text: corned beef and cabbage.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: (laughing, to guests)
dialog: Isn't he funny? Ha ha ha!
text: Curly notices the Countess looking around for something.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: What's all the fuss?
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: I believe I dropped my serviette.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Well, just keep seated. Nobody'll notice it.
text: The Countess gives him a look. Curly shoots her a look right back.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Okay, have half of mine.
text: Curly tears his napkin in half and hands it to the Countess.
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: (snootily)
dialog: Thenk you.
text: Curly grins, waves and offers a quiet "Nyuk, nyuk." Then, Curly sees the
text: Countess powdering her face with a powder puff. He squeals quietly, digs into
text: his pocket, and pulls out an electric razor. He plugs in the razor
text: (apparently, the socket is built right into the dining room table) and it
text: starts to BUZZ loudly. Curly starts shaving himself, much to the Countess'
text: annoyance. He yelps when he snags a piece of skin just above his lip. Then
text: he reaches over and starts shaving the Countess' face. She shrieks and jumps
text: in horror at this.
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: Really!
text: She goes back to powdering her face. Curly gives her one of his eloquent
text: dismissive waves and goes back to shaving. Williams approaches the Countess
text: with a tray.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Biscuit, Madame?
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: No, thank you.
text: Williams is about to offer Curly a biscuit but is shocked and offended to see
text: him shaving at the dinner table.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (disapproving)
dialog: Sir?!
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Quiet!
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: (regains his composure)
dialog: Biscuit, sir?
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (rubbing his hands with glee)
dialog: Oh, soitanly!
text: Curly takes a biscuit and sets to work on it with a knife while Williams
text: grimaces in disbelief and moves on. William offers the tray to Moe and Larry.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Biscuit, sir?
text: Moe and Larry manage to take their biscuits without incident (Larry takes
text: two). While Moe shakes enough salt onto his biscuit to preserve the entire
text: Columbia film library, Larry makes a sandwich out of his two biscuits and a
text: giant stalk of celery. With both hands, Larry raises the unwieldy sandwich
text: to his mouth and is about to bite into it.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Larry)
dialog: Hey. Where's your Emily Post?
text: Moe's reference to the famous etiquette maven causes Larry to stick both his
text: pinkies in the air before biting down joyfully on the sandwich with an
text: impolite CRUNCH. Moe nods in approval and continues to salt his biscuit.
text: Meanwhile, the Countess continues powdering her face. Curly has cut his
text: biscuit in two and places one half on the table and starts to butter the
dialog: other half.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: This is my favorite dish. Biscuits! Biscuits
dialog: all the time.
text: The Countess sets the powder puff down on top of Curly's half-biscuit. He
text: finishes buttering, picks up the powder puff by mistake, and puts his
text: "biscuit" in his mouth.
text: He tries to bite off a piece but can't. He makes a face, then squeals; the
text: Countess who now puts on lipstick, gives him a disdainful look; Curly finally
text: bites a piece of powder puff, glancing happily at the Countess; struggles to
text: chew it, going cross-eyed at the effort; swallows some down; takes another
text: bite; squeals, earning another look from the Countess; Curly pauses for a
text: moment ... then abruptly stuffs the biscuit in his mouth and tears off
dialog: another piece.
text: The Countess sighs and rolls her eyes. Suddenly, Curly starts to choke. He
text: grabs his throat, eyes bulging. Desperately, he WHACKS the back of his head
text: causing face powder to SPEW out of his mouth. He grabs a water glass from
text: off the table and drinks some down. He turns to look at the Countess and
text: grimaces. The Countess is white with powder and totally mortified. Sherry
text: cracks up at the sight of her.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: (to Curly)
dialog: You funny, funny man!
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (grimly ironic)
dialog: Yes. Isn't he a scream?
text: Williams serves the tamales, a native Mexican food made of minced meat and
text: red peppers rolled in cornmeal and wrapped in corn husks.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Ooh, I just love tamales in the Spring!
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (off his tamale)
dialog: What a funny thing. It don't know whether it's
dialog: comin' or goin'.
text: Suspicious, Moe and Larry peer at their tamales, at first tapping them
text: cautiously, then POUNDING them. Curly picks his up, shakes it, hears a
text: GLOOPY sound from its interior, sets it on his plate, and strikes up a
dialog: conversation with it.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to the tamale)
dialog: Speak to me so I'll know which is the head or
dialog: the tail.
text: Curly barks at it twice, then pats it gently as if it were a dog.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to the tamale)
text: Quiet now, quiet. Nyuk, nyuk.
text: Moe tries to penetrate the corn husk with a spoon, to no avail.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: This thing can't lick me.
text: Moe tucks his napkin into his collar and starts to manhandle the tamale.
text: Meanwhile, Larry uses a fork and a knife on his tamale with no result.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Mmm. Stubborn, huh?
text: Finally, Curly figures out that you have to unwrap the darn things and
text: happily begins to do so.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
text: Larry butters and salts his and BITES down on it as if it were corn-on-the-
text: cob. Moe tries to finger-poke his tamale as if it were Curly. Finally, he
text: tries to squeeze the life out of it.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Get tough with me-- ?!
text: Moe SLAMS it to his plate. Sauce SQUIRTS out of it and blackens Moe's face.
text: He tries to wipe it off, only making it worse.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (off the tamale)
dialog: A bomb! An infernal machine!
text: Curly keeps tearing off flakes of husk, finally finding one he likes. Moe
text: starts to do the same. Curly salts his husk and pops it in his mouth. Moe
text: butters one of his own, puts it with another one, and eats it like a sandwich.
text: He claps his hands together and looks satisfied -- until he tastes the husk.
text: Then, he pauses to make a face. Curly scrapes sauce off a husk with his knife
text: and grows wild-eyed with anticipation as he salts the husk and stuffs his
text: mouth with it.
text: Larry, having made no progress, bites into one end of his tamale causing
text: sauce to STREAM out the other end and blacken Curly's face. Upset, Curly
text: wipes his eye. Larry looks in horror at what he's done.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (angry, to Larry)
dialog: Why, you--!
text: Curly picks up a tamale and threatens to throw it at Larry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm sorry. Don't throw it! Don't throw it!
text: Larry ducks his head into Moe's lap as Curly throws. The tamale hits and
text: spatters Moe. Moe grabs Larry by the hair and pulls him off his lap.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Larry)
dialog: Get up, you.
text: Moe SMACKS Larry on the forehead and turns to Curly.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Curly)
dialog: Why, you--!
text: Moe picks up a cream puff to throw at Curly.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Moe! Don't!
text: Curly ducks his head into the Countess' lap as Moe throws. The cream puff
text: hits the Countess in the forehead. Curly pops up.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I ducked --
text: Curly sees the creamed Countess and reacts with horror. The Countess
text: desperately tries to maintain an air of dignity. The young MALE GUEST sitting
text: beside her begins to roar with laughter at the sight of her. So she SMACKS
text: him in his open mouth with a cream puff. Now, it's Sherry's turn to laugh
text: hysterically. The Male Guest grabs a cream puff and eyes the Countess. He
text: rises, much to her dismay, preparing to hit her with it.
speaker_heading: THE COUNTESS
dialog: (also rising)
dialog: Oh, no no no no no no...
text: But, at the last second, he throws the cream puff at Sherry instead, hitting
text: her square in the face. Rumsford, sitting at the far end of the table next
text: to the guest named John, puts a hand to his head in dismay. But Sherry,
text: smiling like a kid, winds up and pitches her cream puff across the length of
text: the table, hitting John. Then she grabs Curly's cream puff and hits Rumsford
text: as he is shouting:
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: This is outrageous! I demand that something
dialog: be done-- !
text: Sherry laughs even harder than before, shaking in her chair, her mouth wide
text: open. Rumsford grabs a cream puff and somehow throws it right into her open
text: mouth. John, wiping some cream from his face, accidentally FLICKS some onto
text: the Matronly Woman beside him. She, in turn, picks up her cream puff and
text: SMACKS him with it. They start throwing the rest of their food at each other.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (to Curly)
dialog: This is all your fault, you--
text: Moe picks up a cream puff. Curly hides behind the Countess.
speaker_heading: CURLY
text: Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo... Cut it out, Moe!
text: A cream puff hits the Countess. She sputters. Curly pokes his head out from
text: behind her.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
text: He ducks back. Another cream puff hits the Countess.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: (to Moe)
dialog: You missed me.
text: The Countess says something defiant but incomprehensible.
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: Ehh, that'll teach you!
text: Moe gets hit by a cream puff. An untouched FEMALE GUEST tries to keep the
dialog: peace.
speaker_heading: FEMALE GUEST
dialog: Folks! This must stop!
text: The woman is instantly CLOBBERED by a cream puff. By now, the room has
text: degenerated into anarchy: Sherry, Larry, Moe, Curly and the others all either
text: throw cream puffs or get hit with them or both. Curly ducks beneath the
text: table and pops up with his napkin covering his head. Of course, the moment
text: he peeks out from behind it, he is WHACKED with a cream puff --
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: I surrender! I--
text: Curly rises, grunts, and gets WHACKED again.
speaker_heading: CURLY
dialog: Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.
text: An unsuspecting Williams calmly enters the room and stares wide-eyed in
text: amazement. Everyone is throwing food.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Doctor York just--
text: Williams gets hit by a cream puff. Huffily, he turns to exit and gets a cold
text: one right in the back of the neck. He raises his shoulders high, exhales
text: deeply, and marches out of the room.
text: Rumsford and the Stooges crawl on hands and knees away from the rioting
text: partygoers and confer in a quieter part of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: (to the Stooges)
dialog: Gentlemen, I think you'd better leave now while
dialog: my wife's still enjoying herself and before she
dialog: changes her mind. Believe me, I'm grateful.
dialog: (pulls out a wad of cash)
dialog: Will-will about fifteen hundred do?
speaker_heading: MOE
dialog: (taking the whole wad)
dialog: Oh, that's just right. Thanks.
text: Rumsford crawls away to join Sherry while the Stooges count their money.
text: Sherry is having a ball, throwing and being thrown at.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: Whoooo! Ha ha ha!
text: A smiling Rumsford approaches, carrying a huge chocolate cake that says HAPPY
text: BIRTHDAY on it.
speaker_heading: SHERRY
dialog: (happily, off the cake)
dialog: Oh, my birthday cake! Oh, darling, in all my
dialog: life I've never had so much fun!
text: Rumsford immediately DUMPS the entire cake on her head.
speaker_heading: RUMSFORD
dialog: Me, too.
text: They stare at each other, she in disbelief and he, inscrutably, with his
text: hands on his hips.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
