text: An OVERHEAD VIEW of BOB HUGHES lying down in the back seat
text: of a 1968 Cadillac. He is looking up at the ceiling of
text: the car, at the camera, and his features are changing this
text: way and that, sometimes eeking out a giggle or an inspired
text: laugh, looking like some sort of wired druq addict with
text: thoughts racing by too fast to interpret by his features.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: I figured I was qualified to write a book, if I
dialog: could ever sit down long enough in one place to
dialog: do it. It would be titled, A Dope Fiend's
dialog: Guide to Drug Stores, or something like that.
text: CLOSE VIEW of Bob's face and shifting eyes.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: And in it the curious reader would find flights
dialog: of fancy, gems of creativity, artistry, and yes
dialog: even honest-to-goodness poetry. Of course it
dialog: would have a lot of the standard stuff, like
dialog: picking locks...

dialog: used to Bob being in his own little world there.

text: THE FOURTH MEMBER of the group enters, RICK, the muscle.
text: Nadine proceeds down the store's main aisle and stops at
text: the perfume counter.
text: Rick takes a post near the entrance pretending to look
text: through the get well cards.
text: Dianne is engaged in an over the counter conversation with

dialog: Ma'am?
text: Bob gives the signal to Dianne who is peering over her
text: sunglasses, then scratches her rear, signaling Nadine who
text: goes into her act.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Help! This lady is having a seizure. She
dialog: might swallow her tongue!
text: Nadine SCREAMS and falls backward against a low display
text: case, leaving her body arched to make the most of the fact
text: that she's wearing a very short skirt.
text: She begins to convulse and jerk, trying to mimic the
text: symptoms of an epileptic seizure.
text: VIEW of the Druggist's eyes, and they are taking special
text: notice of Nadine's torso; he bounds over the counter to
text: Nadine's rescue.
text: Bob makes his move, quickly ducking behind the vacated
text: counter and dropping to his knees.
text: MOVING VIEW of Bob scooting along, looking for any drawer
text: or cabinet with a lock. Midway along the counter he finds
text: what he is looking for. He spies a drawer and opens it.
text: Dianne, spying a checkout girl on her way to the action,
text: COUGHS a signal to Bob to hurry up.
text: Bob responds to Dianne's cough and scurries back down to
text: the end of the counter and peeks around to see if things
dialog: are safe.

dialog: 9-10-88
text: BOB'S VIEW. The checkout girl is helping the druggist
text: with Nadine.
text: Bob is satisfied that it is safe, and scurries back to the
text: drawer. He straightens up to his knees and begins rifling
text: the contents. The sweat is standing up on his forehead.
text: His hands start to shake and his knees quiver and jerk as
text: he scoots back down the aisle around the pill shelves and
text: into the back room.
text: Dianne begins to start another COUGHING FIT as the
text: druggist is on his way back behind the counter going to
dialog: the phone.
text: Bob tries the back door but it is locked. Now the
text: druggist is in Bob's sight and he has to operate on the
text: back door to the druggist's back.
text: Bob quietly pulls out a screwdriver and smoothly takes the
text: locked door off the hinges, very quietly, and leaves the
text: back room.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: (to the counter girl)
dialog: Excuse me...are you too busy to take this money
dialog: for some cough syrup?
text: The counter girl, holding Nadine, looks at Dianne like she

text: SURROUNDING CUSTOMERS, and quietly leaves.
text: VIEW of Nadine arched over the low display, and hearing a
text: distant AMBULANCE SIREN, she sits up, rearranges her
text: clothing and hair, tries to look embarrassed, deftly
text: disengages the hands of the counter girl holding her, and
text: walks out the door. She is followed by Rick.
text: The druggist and the checkout girl stand in amazement as
text: they leave. We see the druggist's has a nagging suspicion
dialog: that they have been HAD.

text: Rick grins. Dianne pulls out of the parking place.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Anybody got an outfit up there?
text: Dianne turns completely around, disregarding traffic.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Goddamnit, Bob, why do you have to fix in the
dialog: car? Can't you wait until we get home like

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Shut up and watch your driving.
text: Bob sits up a bit and looks out the window of the car,
text: like a little kid with his nose pressed against the glass.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE OVER
dialog: After any kind of drug haul, everyone in the
text: crew indulged to the utmost. I laughed to
dialog: myself as I pictured blues or dilaudid in such
dialog: great amounts that the spoon would literally be
text: overflowing. Upon entering my vein the drug
text: would start a warm itch that would surge along
text: until the brain consumed it in a gentle
text: explosion that began in the back of the neck
dialog: and rose rapidly, until I felt such pleasure
dialog: that the whole world sympathized and took ona
text: soft, lofty appeal. Everything was grand then.
dialog: Your worst enemy, he wasn't so bad. The ants
text: in the grass, they were just doing their thing.
text: Everything took on the rosy hue of unlimited
dialog: success, you could do no wrong. As long as it
dialog: lasted, life was beautiful.
text: Dianne has been riding in the front seat swearing at the
text: traffic quite liberally, and a few choice four letter
text: words drift into Bob's quiet musings in the back seat.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (to Dianne)
dialog: Boy what a bitchy group! Fuck this, and screw
dialog: that, Dianne, what kind of an example are you
dialog: setting for the youngsters anyway?
text: Dianne takes her eyes off the road, turning to Bob.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: You're goddamn lucky that I have to keep my

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Keep your eyes on the road then.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: .Â» . .and the steering wheel in my hand because

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Now, everybody. Just act cool. It's like we've

scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT DAY
dialog: 
text: The car jumps excitedly over a bumpy drive and squeals
text: it's tires a little as it makes its way to the back of the
dialog: apartment building.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: For some reason, every dope fiend in the area
dialog: could tell if you were holding.
text: Across the street, DAVID, a long haired hippy about
text: twenty-one years old, sits up in an easy chair on the
text: porch of his house, as if he just woke up.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
text: The hangers on, the rip-off artists, that is.
text: Not the cops. They couldn't smell a dead rat
text: two feet away. But the damn dope fiend
dialog: snitches could.
text: At this point David does look a little like he is sniffing
text: the air as he puts on a shirt.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: It didn't make any difference how careful you
text: were. They could sense it. They could almost
dialog: smell it.
text: David makes his way down the steps of his porch and sees:
text: Bob, Nadine, Rick and Dianne skipping from the car quickly
text: into their apartment.
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: They could tell by the way you drove in the
dialog: yard, by the way you hurried into the
dialog: 15
dialog: 9-10-88
speaker_heading: BOB'S VOICE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: apartment, and if you made a studied, careful
text: approach, they could sense it even more. There
dialog: was just no way to improvise that disgusted

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT DAY
dialog: 
text: The four sitting around a coffee table that has fast food,

dialog: Nadine?
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Give me the same, I guess.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: No, I don't think so, Nadine.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Why not?
text: Dianne brings her head up and looks right through Nadine.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Nadine, you can't shoot no goddamn blue. Give
dialog: her half of one, Bob, that'll keep her in the
dialog: crapper all afternoon.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: (fighting back)
dialog: Goddamnit, I was in there just like you, I
dialog: ought to get the same as everyone else, even if
dialog: I can't shoot it all right now. I could save
dialog: it, or maybe sell it and get me a few things.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, Nadine, I'l] tell you, that just ain't
dialog: the way things work around here. You don't do
dialog: shit. All you've done is shag your twat, and
dialog: that ain't nothin'. It's me that's taking the
dialog: big risk. What are they going to bust you for,
dialog: having a fit in a drug store?

scene_heading: 15A EXT./INT. APARTMENT DAY

speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: Well, how about Dianne, she ain't done nothing
dialog: either?
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Don't give her a damn thing. Kick her ass out
text: in the street where we found her.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, no fair is fair, you want your fourth, you
dialog: got it, Nadine. But I ain't taking on no
dialog: apprentices and giving them a full end of my
dialog: thing. You take it and get out.
text: At this , Nadine looks confused, like she doesn't know
dialog: what she wants.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Goddamn you, Nadine! Take your half a blue and
dialog: shut up, shoot it and go puke awhile.
text: A KNOCK sounds on the door.
text: Quickly Dianne scoops up all the bottles and runs for the
text: ~~ bedroom. Bob draws a forty-five automatic pistol from
text: under the couch cushion. Holding it at arms length
text: pointed at the floor, he approaches the door's peephole.
text: VIEW through the peephole. Bob recognizes the intruder.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What do you want, David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just want to see you for a minute, Bob, let
dialog: me in.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You alone?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hell yes, I'm alone, what'd you think, I
dialog: brought my rat-faced granny along to hold my
dialog: hand?
text: Nadine and Rick are standing as if glued to the floor.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You, Nadine, pick up those spoons, outfits and
dialog: Cr that glass of water. Rick you get your goddamn

text: Both Rick and Nadine jump at his order.
text: Bob opens the door and points his cocked gun at the
text: long-haired disheveled young man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What the hell, pard, you finally gone
dialog: completely crazy or something?
text: David smiles at the ritual. He slowly steps into the
text: apartment and looks over Bob's shoulder to see Rick's arm
text: and gun protruding around the door jam of the bedroom.
text: Then he carefully takes off his jacket, swirls around like
text: a ballet dancer doing a swan number and relaxes on the
text: couch in a half sitting and half lying position.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you holding, pard?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I ain't holding shit, David.
text: Bob lowers his gun and tries his best to look innocent.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I was just thinking of dropping by your place
dialog: to see if you've got any speed.
text: David smiles.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, I got some speed.
text: David laughs, embarrassed somewhat.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: What kind of speed you got?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Methadrine crystal.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (grins)
dialog: You know what, David? You could have little
dialog: balls of shit wrapped up in those little
dialog: cellophane bags of yours and your answer would
dialog: always be the same, methadrine crystal.

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Okay, just a moment, I got to talk to Dianne
dialog: first.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM DAY xe
text: Bob enters and finds Dianne straddling the window sill,
text: still clutching her armload of small bottles. She has
text: heard everything in the next room and shows
text: dissatisfaction with the way things are turning out.
text: Bob grins at her sheepishly.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: How about some speed, baby? The man says that
dialog: he's got methedrine crystal.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: What do you want that goddamn speed for? You
dialog: know how ringy it makes you. It turns you into
dialog: a different person, Bob, and I don't much like
dialog: that person.
text: Bob holds out his hands, palms up in the age old gesture,
dialog: as if to say, "Oh, what the hell, one more time isn't
text: going to hurt anything." And Bob's voice takes on the
text: excitement of a small boy in a candy shop.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Baby, listen to me, what night is this anyway?
dialog: It's Sunday, right? How about us getting some
dialog: speed, see, and then we'll all jump in the car
dialog: and get that big fat pharmacy. You know how
dialog: these things go. When you're hot, you shoot
dialog: the works, when you're cold, you lay off a
dialog: bit. Well right now I'm hot, baby, I'm so hot
text: I'm burning all over.
speaker_heading: DIANNE

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (eyebrows go up again)
dialog: Hell no, if I had sixteenths, you think I'd be
dialog: sitting here rapping to you about some shitty
dialog: speed? Now how about some morphine. I got
dialog: some good old morphine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What'd you get, man, morphine sulfate, quarters
dialog: or halves?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah, man, (lapsing into black jargon) I got
dialog: quarters and halves. It's got a little
dialog: atrophine in it, but. Just take you a little
text: old ink blotter, lay the tablets out on them in
dialog: rows, place one drop of water on each one and
text: the atrophine eases right off into the blotter
dialog: and you're home free. Throw the little fellers

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're crazy, man, I can't even read a stop

speaker_heading: BOB

dialog: That's all I got and all I can give.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, if you didn't

dialog: as dumb as you think.
speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I'll hit you with nine quarters per package,
dialog: and that's just because I'm feeling good and
dialog: because you're a real standup dude. I'll even
dialog: throw in an ink blotter. How's that? I'll]

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much you want for her, Bob?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How much you want for her, man, the female, the

text: Bob turns his pistol on Nadine while he addresses David.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You know what, sport? I'd kill that girl right

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Out of curiosity, how many bags of speed would
dialog: you give for her?
text: David slumped with relief and headed toward Nadine with
text: his hand extended, ready to feel for himself if all the
dialog: curves were real.
speaker_heading: NADINE
dialog: You little twirp. You come one step closer to
dialog: me and I'll knock your block off.

speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Pick up your stuff and go. We got some things

speaker_heading: BOB

speaker_heading: PHARMACIST
dialog: No, we don't have any dilaudid in any form. We

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hell, I don't know, Nadine. What difference

speaker_heading: RICK

text: TWO POLICEMEN come running from the front doors of the
dialog: hospital.
text: They run across the front lawn less than a hundred yards

dialog: corridor, and:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT
text: NOT SEEING ANYBODY, steps across the corridor to the
text: locked entrance of the PHARMACY. After studying the door
text: momentarily, he takes a small pry bar, slams the tapered
text: end into the crack between the door and the jam at lock
text: level, and SNAPS the other end of the bar back. The door
text: shoots open with a noise resembling a muffled shot.
scene_heading: INT. PHARMACY NIGHT

dialog: 136
dialog: 137
dialog: 9-10-88
dialog: 61
text: he goes directly to the narcotics cabinets housed behind a
text: counter. The lockers are made of one-eighth inch sheet
text: steel and have large brass padlocks on them.
text: Bob tries to wedge his pry bar between the bolt of a lock
text: but the bar is too big. Next he tries to wedge it between
text: the lock and the hasp, but the bar slips out.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Fuck it!
text: The sweat is pouring down Bob's face in rivulets, his

text: He tries forcing the bar into the crack beside the cabinet
text: door, but the bar jumps toward him every time he applies
dialog: pressure.
text: He tries lifting the cabinet free from the wall, but it is
text: solid. He jams the pry bar between the wall and the
text: cabinet and gives a mighty heave. The cabinet bends
text: toward him, but it's obvious that this will take too long.
text: Bob stands back from the cabinets and brings the wedge
text: shaped point of the bar down in a cutting motion in an
text: attempt to tear a hole in the sheet metal and more or less
text: can-open the thing enough to reach inside.

scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, since I've been twelve or thirteen I've

speaker_heading: BOB

scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: Why do you want to quit now, after all that

dialog: I don't know, curiosity I guess. I just

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yes. A few times.
scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: What were they? What kind of felonies were
dialog: you convicted of?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Oh, burglary, robbery, possession, grand

scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: And how much time have you spent in prison?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: I don't know. Twelve years more or less I
dialog: suppose.
scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: Well, then, you haven't been an addict all
dialog: your life then, have you, Mr. Hughes?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: what do you mean?
scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: I mean you could hardly have been an addict in

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Why not?
scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: Do you mean to sit there and tell me that you
dialog: were addicted to drugs while in prison?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, not all the time. But I used all the
dialog: time I was inside, I mean, what do you want,
dialog: lady, my life story? Well, I'll tell it to
dialog: you. I was a junkie. I liked dope. I liked
dialog: the lifestyle. I was on top of it all but it
dialog: wasn't real. You don't see my kind of people,
dialog: because my kind of people don't come down here
dialog: and beg dope. They go out and get it and if
text: they miss, they go to jail and then they kick
text: alone without nothing in some holding tank.

scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: I'm sorry, Bob. I don't mean to hassle you.
dialog: All this is required. I'm sorry if it seems
dialog: unnecessary. Have you ever thought about
text: becoming a counselor and helping other addicts
dialog: with their problems?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: (without hesitation)
dialog: No, I don't think so, ma'am.
scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Well, to begin with, no one, and I mean no one
dialog: can talk a junkie out of using, so all your
dialog: counseling is just wasted words and you might
text: as well have flushed them down the toilet. A
dialog: junkie needs his thing nine times out of ten
dialog: just to be able to live with himself. He
dialog: needs it just like a diabetic needs insulin.
dialog: How are you going to sit and talk a diabetic
dialog: out of using insulin?
scene_heading: MRS. WATERMAKER
dialog: Hmmm, I see, well, tell me, Bob, if you can,
dialog: why did you use narcotics?
text: Bob sits and squirms in his chair. He looks out the
text: office window.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: That really is a tough question, lady. I may
dialog: think I know the answer, and then maybe I
dialog: don't. When you ask a dope fiend why he uses,
dialog: it's just about like asking a normal person
dialog: why they like sex. And I suppose different
dialog: people will come up with different answers,
dialog: ranging from it just feels good, to I can't
dialog: resist the urge, to it's all part of love, to
dialog: I only do it to have children. Lady, a dope
dialog: fiend will give you just about the same
text: answers, with the exception of the last one.
dialog: I've yet to hear a dope fiend claim he shot

dialog: Yeah, it's been a long time. You living here

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I have nowhere else to go. There is no demand
dialog: in the priesthood for elderly drug addicts.
dialog: An indiscretion back in '70 -- you were
dialog: "inside" at the time, I believe -- resulted in
dialog: my descent to this sorry state. As a matter
dialog: of fact I am feeling a bit sick right now.
dialog: Are you holding?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Naw, I am kicking like a goddamn mule. Those

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: And they didn't kick his ass.?!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What's the point? These junkies, they figure

text: that, they watched him closer.
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You know, Tom, you taught me a lot, like stay

speaker_heading: TOM
text: Narcotics have been demonized and scapegoated

speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No, baby, it wasn't you. It was Nadine's
dialog: death and the hex that she threw on us with
dialog: the hat. And then I panicked when I looked
dialog: out into that parking lot and seen all those
dialog: cop cars. I just knew I was dead. Everything
dialog: up to then had gone wrong and so I started
dialog: coping deuces. I prayed like never before. I

dialog: out, and I promised, so here I am.
speaker_heading: DIANNE
dialog: Are you going to stick to it forever?
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: Yeah. And, you know, for all the boredom the
