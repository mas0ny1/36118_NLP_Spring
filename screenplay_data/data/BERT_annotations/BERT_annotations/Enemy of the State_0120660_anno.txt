speaker_heading: HAMERSLEY
dialog: You didn't ask me to meet you 30

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone

speaker_heading: HAMERSLEY
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS

speaker_heading: HAMERSLEY
dialog: We're not gonna hand you and your

text: Whoever the guy is, he's flying. Then a man with a

text: HAMERSLEY flies into a blind curve. Tires SCREECH as he
text: rounds the bend to see
text: A PROPANE TRUCK. Blocking both lanes of the road.
text: HAMERSLEY's eyes widen. He stomps the brakes, SKIDS and
text: SLAMS into the truck. The EXPLOSION engulfs everything.
text: HAMERSLEY and the car are consumed. The pursuing sedan

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: That's because your Union bosses
dialog: are those Guido mother-fuckers.
dialog: L.T.
dialog: I don't under--
speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ten thousand cash. I don't know if

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I take a straight 15 percent.
dialog: Brill's fee varies with risk.
dialog: Perhaps you'd be more comfortable

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Other than Brill.
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BLAKE
dialog: They want to hold you in Contempt

speaker_heading: SILVERBERG
dialog: They claim you helped create a

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: BLAKE

speaker_heading: SILVERBERG

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I

speaker_heading: SILVERBERG
dialog: Well until we find, you're gonna

text: another hall, SOUNDS OF NEARING FOOTSTEPS. DEAN detours
dialog: into--
scene_heading: INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Empty. DEAN stands at a sink, water running. He glances
text: at the door. He splashes water on his face. Suddenly--
text: --DEAN's slammed forward, a silenced pistol is shoved
text: into his ear, pinning his face to the mirror.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Jesus! What?! You want money?!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Shut the fuck up.
text: Hands frisk DEAN. Up and down the legs, behind the back
text: and chest. A wallet is removed, ID's looked at - then
text: returned. DEAN turns to see--
text: A MAN, early 50's. He sweeps a signal frequency locator
text: over DEAN's body. The needle reacts at DEAN's foot.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: Your shoe.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: My shoe?
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Gimme the shoe.
text: DEAN complies with the strange request as the MAN flips
text: out a knife.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Brill?
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
text: Brill's dead. He died of small pox
dialog: when he was two and he was buried
text: in a Kansas field.
dialog: (prying away DEAN's heel)
dialog: My name doesn't matter.
text: CLOSE ON DEAN's HEEL - a hollow compartment reveals a
text: miniature tracking device. The MAN removes it, then
text: returns the shoe.
speaker_heading: "BRILL" (CONT'D)
text: A tracker. Thousand yard range.
dialog: They're close.
text: The MAN reaches in a trash can, removes a potato-chip
text: bag, wraps it around the tracker and flushes it down
dialog: the toilet.
speaker_heading: "BRILL" (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon.
text: "BRILL" goes through the window. DEAN eyes the window,
text: not sure. He eyes the door. Same feeling.
scene_heading: EXT. LOADING DECK - MOMENT LATER
text: DEAN crawls through the window to a loading dock.
text: "BRILL" motions him to follow as he moves off into the
dialog: shadows.
text: The sounds of the window OPENING behind them, followed
text: by FOOTSTEPS. "BRILL" shoves Dean behind a dumpster and
text: removes his gun as two men run by. The STEPS FADE.
text: "BRILL" looks. They're gone.
scene_heading: EXT. FERRY TERMINAL - NIGHT
text: Establishing. A closed farmer's market by the terminal.
text: Several cars are parked. One's a cab. "BRILL" opens the
text: driver's door. DEAN grabs the front passenger door.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: No. In back like you're a customer.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - NIGHT
text: "BRILL" sits in the driver's seat, eyes flickering to
text: all views, as DEAN climbs in the back. "BRILL" flips on
text: the meter and guns into traffic.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It started with the information you
dialog: gave me on DePinto. After we talked,
text: he agreed to resign. Next, a phony
dialog: detective asked me about Daniel
dialog: Zavitz. Then an investigator
dialog: questioned me about an extortion
dialog: scheme they claimed Zavitz was
text: behind. The FBI started looking
text: into mob connections. A doctored
text: picture in the paper. Overnight,
dialog: I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank
dialog: accounts, everything gone.
text: "BRILL" eyes the mirror. A BLACK CHEVY appears several
text: car lengths behind.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
text: DePinto's dead.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Oh Jesus.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: They found him yesterday folded
text: neatly in a car trunk. What about
dialog: Zavitz?
text: "BRILL" starts to weave in and out of traffic. He looks
text: in the mirror - the Chevy's also weaving several cars
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't know anything about Zavitz.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: You said he was behind an extortion
dialog: scheme.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: They said he was behind an
dialog: extortion scheme.
text: "BRILL" whips the cab around a corner, accelerating.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: And you were the last one to talk
text: to him.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: What'd he say to you?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: What'd he give to you?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: Don't bullshit me, I can save your
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I'm telling you, I--
text: The ride from hell gets worse as "BRILL" screeches
text: another turn. The car ahead stops and "BRILL" screeches
text: past on two wheels.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I just gave him my card.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: He didn't give you an address? He
dialog: didn't give you a phone number?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Nothing. Two nights later I was
dialog: robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
text: "BRILL" takes an impossible left into another alley.
text: The Chevy follows. "BRILL"'s good. The guy in the
dialog: Chevy's better.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Um...who's that?
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: Don't know. Did you check everywhere?
text: Maybe it was hidden in something.
dialog: Maybe there was someone else--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Someone else?
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: Maybe you bumped into someone who
dialog: took it and you didn't even know.
text: The cab is rear-ended hard by the Chevy. Their necks
text: snap back from the force.
speaker_heading: "BRILL" (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
text: WHAM! They're hit again. "BRILL" pulls out a communicator.
speaker_heading: "BRILL" (CONT'D)
dialog: 209 to anyone! I need some help here!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Who are you calling?!
text: WHACK! "BRILL" back-hands DEAN with his fist, knocking
text: him silly as WHAM!--the cab's rear-ended again.
speaker_heading: "BRILL"
dialog: (trying again)
dialog: This is 209! Does anyone copy?!
text: Then "BRILL" sees that the alley empties into a busy
text: street, then a bakery shop.
text: He slams the brakes. Tires screech smoke but it's no
text: use. The powerful Chevy pushes the cab, bumper to
text: bumper, toward the street. "BRILL" grips the wheel.
text: It's all he can do as the cab rockets into cross
dialog: traffic and--
text: BLAM! They're broad-sided by a delivery truck. The cab
text: is shoved sideways along the street and into a fire-
text: hydrant, finally stopping under jetting water from the
text: broken main.
text: DEAN slowly opens his eyes. Water pours in everywhere.
text: "BRILL" is sticking halfway through a window, not
text: moving. Seeing "BRILL"'s pistol, DEAN grabs it and
text: crawls from the wreckage.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: DEAN climbs from the wreck as BYSTANDERS approach.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Look out! He's got a gun!
text: They back away as DEAN gets to his feet and looks
text: around. Off to the side he sees the Chevy, waiting like
text: a coiled snake.
text: DEAN limps into the crowd. He rounds the corner to
text: ANOTHER STREET and now he's running with all he's got left.
scene_heading: INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/STUDY - NIGHT
text: STACY is at the desk looking at the latest edition of
text: the paper, which now has a photograph of DEAN and
text: RACHEL walking in the park from the day before.
text: The phone rings and STACY reaches for it...
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
text: DEAN stands at a pay phone--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Stacy, don't hang up.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Stacy--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I'm looking at a picture of you and
dialog: Rachel taken yesterday.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I know, but listen--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Was that doctored-up, too?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No, I was with her yesterday. I
dialog: want you to take Eric and go to our
dialog: parents house. I want you to do it
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I went to the grocery store. My ATM
dialog: and credit cards didn't work. I
dialog: couldn't buy food.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I went to the bank to see why. They
dialog: said you emptied our accounts--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It wasn't me.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: This is science-fiction Robert! The
dialog: manager showed me the transfer
dialog: notice with your signature on it.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me.
dialog: Now goddamit--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: My father's put me in touch with an
dialog: attorney. He'll be--
text: A hand suddenly clicks down the phone hook. DEAN turns
text: to see a MAN, late 50's, gruff and alert. It's the guy
text: driving the Chevy.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Put the phone down. Do as I say.
text: DEAN does nothing, temporarily frozen. A pistol jabs
dialog: him hard.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Alright, alright--
text: DEAN replaces the phone. The man removes DEAN's gun.
text: Nearby, two PEOPLE chat at a restaurant hostess desk,
text: unaware.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Move to the elevators.
text: DEAN does but is suddenly redirected through a roof-
text: access door.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - NIGHT
text: A TECHNICIAN sits in a van jammed with high-tech
text: surveillance gear. HICKS is next to him, a phone
text: pressed to his ear.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: We just picked up his call.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: REYNOLDS, dressed in a tux, presses his cellular to his
text: ear, while behind him MARSHAL and SHAFFER, also in
text: tuxedos, have a heated discussion.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: 30 minutes ago you said we had him.
dialog: What in hell's goin' on out there?
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: He had help.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Help from whom?
dialog: (he hears the answer)
dialog: Christ.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH-RISE ROOFTOP - NIGHT
text: Eight stories up and deserted. The lit dome of the
text: Capitol building shines like a beacon in the D.C. skyline.
text: DEAN suddenly slams against a wall--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Forget me, forget what I did for
dialog: you. Don't ever mention my name or
dialog: try to contact me again. Get it?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't know you, I don't know your
dialog: name, I don't know what the hell
dialog: you did for me except hang up on my
dialog: wife and slam me into a wall, but
dialog: I'm getting pretty fuckin' sick of
dialog: this! Get it?!
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Seat 74.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You're Brill.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: You knew the deal. No contact.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Who was that other guy?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: One of many people who would live a
dialog: word with you.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Who are they?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: You've heard of the National Security
dialog: Agency?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What do they have to do with this?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: That's who they are.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: The NSA?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You're crazy.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: (starting to leave)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Wait.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: You drive a black BMW, license
dialog: plate SRK1339?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: (reaching in his pocket)
dialog: I clipped this from your wheel well
dialog: just before they towed your car away.
text: BRILL pulls out a disk-shaped object the size of a
dialog: walk-man.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: It's a SAT-tracker.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Like a LowJack, but two generations
dialog: ahead of what the police use. It
text: pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band
text: for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: It means the NSA can read the time
dialog: off your wristwatch.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Why are they after me?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: If I knew, they'd be after me.
dialog: Which they probably are right now.
dialog: 'Bye.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Wait. What do I do?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What
dialog: you did, who you were...that's done.
dialog: I'd find a quiet job somewhere
text: shoveling snow.
text: A helicopter hovers near the Washington Monument. BRILL
text: eyes it cautiously.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Why don't they just identify
dialog: themselves and tell me what they want?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: They're spooks.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't know what that--
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Exposure. They can't have it. They
dialog: wanna learn what you know and then
dialog: deal with it.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't know anything.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What am I gonna do?! I mean, like,
dialog: for the rest of my life?!
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Hey, if you live another week I'll
dialog: be impressed.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What if--
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Look, you gave me some work over
dialog: the last year. We'll call it even.
text: BRILL turns to leave--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (blocking the exit door)
dialog: What if I find out what they're
dialog: after. You know these people, I don't.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: And you won't. Now move--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I'll pay you.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: (taking out his pistol)
dialog: They froze your accounts. Get outa
dialog: my way.
text: DEAN continues blocking the door, maintaining calm even
text: as BRILL's pistol is pressed firmly to his forehead.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I've got a hundred-thousand dollars
text: in jewelry in a safe-deposit box
text: under a third party name.
text: BRILL looks at the ground. Torn.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: How many years have you been hiding
dialog: from them? How many years have you
dialog: been running?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What'd they do to you?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: (pause)
dialog: If you find something, chalk the
dialog: Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go
dialog: to Temperanceville. It's South of
dialog: Salisbury.
dialog: (giving DEAN his pistol)
dialog: And take this.
text: And with that, he's gone.
text: DEAN eyes the gun. He walks to the ledge, looking at
dialog: the city.
text: DEAN'S POV: Several vehicles quietly pull up to the
text: building. MEN storm out an move inside.
text: DEAN quickly backs away.
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: DEAN races for the stairwell two steps at a time. He
text: hears the SOUND of a DOOR OPENING somewhere below.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
text: 303 to 301. Floor one secured.
text: Moving to two.
text: DEAN retreats upward, then he hears SOMEONE COMING DOWN.
text: Trapped. He opens the door on '3' and is about to run
text: when he sees a security camera directly above.
text: Grabbing a fire extinguisher, he pulls the pin. Spray
text: coats the lens. Then he yanks a FIRE ALARM. A HORN BLARES.
text: DEAN runs for the second stairwell when he sees JONES
text: stepping out. DEAN looks back at the stairwell he left.
text: That door's opening as well.
dialog: Trapped.
text: Using the extinguisher, DEAN smashes the glass door to
text: an office and goes inside. JONES starts to enter when a
text: shot rips into the wall, convincing him otherwise. He
text: retreats as the BLARING FIRE ALARM STOPS.
text: DEAN races through the suite of offices trying locked
text: door after locked door. Finally, one opens and he
text: rushes in and tries to lock it behind himself.
dialog: No lock.
text: He sees the MEN and they see him. He slides a desk
text: against the door, then backs away, pistol ready.
speaker_heading: JONES (O.S.)
dialog: (disturbingly calm)
dialog: Open the door, Mr. Dean. There's
dialog: nowhere to go. We'd just like to talk.
text: Seeing a phone, DEAN grabs it.
text: No tone. Just a RECORDING of Nancy Sinatra's song
dialog: "These Boots are Made for Walking".
speaker_heading: JONES (O.S.)
dialog: It'd be easier for all of us if you
dialog: just come out. Nothing'll happen.
text: DEAN heaves a coffee table up on the desk.
speaker_heading: JONES (O.S.)
dialog: It's quite hopeless what you're
dialog: doing, Mr. Dean.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I swear to God I'll shoot.
speaker_heading: JONES (O.S.)
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: I think you might be over-reacting
dialog: there, Mr. Dean. We just want to talk.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Go ahead. I hear you fine.
text: The door pushes in--
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I said I'll shoot!
text: The door keeps pushing.
text: DEAN FIRES high.
text: The pushing stops.
text: Then DEAN hears the distant sound of SIRENS approaching.
text: DEAN rips off his sweater, takes out a lighter, and
text: sets the sweater on fire.
text: He throws it into a garbage can and tosses styrofoam
text: cups in on top of it.
text: The pushing starts again, but before DEAN can fire, a
text: small cylindrical device drops into the room.
text: A STUN GRENADE.
text: DEAN ducks as a BLINDING FLASH rocks the room.
text: The window is blown open. Smoke billows out. DEAN,
text: temporarily blinded and deaf, struggles to a ledge as
text: fire engines arrive.
scene_heading: INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS
text: Fire trucks, police cars and an ambulance arrive
text: beneath DEAN as HICKS watches from his van.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: I don't fuckin' believe this!
dialog: (into radio-mic)
dialog: 301 to all units. Everyone out! Now!
dialog: We'll take him at the hospital.
scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT
text: DEAN sits in back with a PARA-MEDIC, covered in soot,
text: breathing hard through an oxygen mask as the ambulance
text: WAILS and weaves through traffic. He looks through the
dialog: rear window to see--
text: TWO CARS FOLLOWING, keeping pace. Off to the side, RFK
text: Stadium is emptying, a Redskins game is over.
text: DEAN rips off the oxygen mask--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Tell him to stop the ambulance.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Whoa there, fella. Just take it easy.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Tell him to stop the ambulance.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC
dialog: Now you're a little shaken up, but
dialog: we're gonna get you on your feet in--
text: DEAN whips out his pistol and shoves it in the
text: PARAMEDIC's face--
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the driver)
dialog: --stop the ambulance.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: The ambulance pulls over and the back doors fly open.
text: DEAN leaps out into the crowd.
text: The OTHER CARS pull over and PRATT and JONES exit. They
text: scan the area and see DEAN descending a stairwell
text: marked: METRO.
scene_heading: INT. METRO STATION PLATFORM - NIGHT
text: DEAN stands at the end of the crowded platform. PRATT
text: and JONES work through the CROWD as the train pulls in.
text: DEAN slides on board. The departure HORN sounds. JONES
text: and PRATT step on.
scene_heading: INT. METRO - NIGHT
text: DEAN huddles in the back car, panic-breathing, as PRATT
text: and JONES move through the cars searching for faces.
text: DEAN looks for an out. He sees an emergency stop handle.
text: He YANKS it forward. PASSENGERS yell. The brakes lock
text: and SCREECH. The train slows. Then stops.
text: DEAN opens the door.
text: And jumps. He looks around. Just black curved track in
text: either direction. He starts running.
text: Then he hears it.
text: The horrible SCREECHING of an approaching train.
dialog: Trapped.
text: On one side, the train he left. On the other, a wall.
text: He runs down the track with all that's left.
text: PRATT and JONES reach the open door and see the
text: oncoming train bearing down on DEAN. They duck in as
text: the train SWISHES by.
text: DEAN lays flat between the tracks, his face kissing
text: greasy ground as the train screeches over him.
text: Tons of angry steel are teasing his shirt fabric.
text: Then it's over. The train's gone. DEAN's alive.
text: He gets up to see PRATT and JONES leap to the tracks.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: I hate these guys.
text: Then he sees an "EMERGENCY ACCESS" sign beaming in the
text: darkness. A God-send. DEAN runs for it.
scene_heading: EXT. METRO EMERGENCY ACCESS EXIT - NIGHT
text: PRATT and JONES fly out the door and into a park.
text: It's empty. Quiet.
dialog: No Dean anywhere.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS (V.O.)
dialog: I'm confused about something. Maybe
dialog: you can help me out.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE - CONTINUOUS
text: The Lincoln Memorial is seen in the distance. REYNOLDS

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
dialog: I sit on top of the greatest
dialog: intelligence gathering organization
dialog: in human history. Why can't I bring
text: in a man whose name is in the
dialog: fucking phonebook?!
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: He's clever. He had help.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: He's clever? He had help?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Sir--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
dialog: you were hoping to be transferred
text: to a weathership outside Greenland.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: I just meant--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: I don't care if he's Solomon with
dialog: Saint Joseph sitting in his lap. I
dialog: want the tape and I want him. Now is--
text: A WAITER with a tray steps out onto the terrace...
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the WAITER)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Puffed cheese?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: I also have tiny pizzas and
dialog: mushrooms stuffed with--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Then let's assume I don't.
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes sir.
text: The WAITER goes back inside.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Now is that clear?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes sir.
text: REYNOLDS disconnects, breathes deeply, and goes back to
dialog: the party.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO BUILDING - NIGHT
text: DEAN watches from the shadows. It seems quiet. He's
text: about to move for the entrance when he sees--
text: A cigarette lighter flame-up inside a parked car. TWO
text: MEN sit inside, watching. DEAN retreats into the shadows.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL'S CONDO - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT
text: Quiet. DEAN listens through the door and hears nothing.
text: He KNOCKS softly.
dialog: No reply.
text: He tries the doorknob. It opens.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: DEAN enters. The place is still.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Rachel?
text: No answer. DEAN drifts through the living room. A lamp
text: is knocked over on the floor. DEAN keeps moving into
text: the bedroom. He stops in the doorway - eyes fixed inside.
text: DEAN'S POV: RACHEL lies on her stomach, naked in bed.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (approaching)
dialog: Rachel?
text: She doesn't respond. He touches her.
dialog: Nothing.
text: He turns her over. Her face is frozen, eyes open, neck
text: purpled and bruised with signs of strangulation.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Oh God--
text: DEAN wants to throw up but holds it down.
text: Then, under a night table, he sees a shirt. He grabs it.
text: DEAN'S POV: An oxford button-down. The inside collar is
text: stamped with a dry-cleaner's marker reading: R. DEAN.
text: Panic overtakes horror as DEAN quickly searches for
dialog: anything else of his that may have been planted inside
dialog: the apartment.
text: Under the bed - a cufflink.
text: In the bathroom - a hairbrush.
text: On the desk - documents with his name on them.
text: DEAN shoves everything into a garbage bag. Grabbing a
text: towel, he retraces his steps, wiping his prints from
dialog: everything he touched.
text: Exiting, he wipes off the doorknob as--
text: A NEIGHBORS DOOR OPENS. A COUPLE stumbles out, laughing,
text: kissing...and noticing DEAN leaving Rachel's condo.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
text: JERRY walks alone through the large underground garage
text: on the way to his car. He pauses, thinking he's heard
dialog: something.
dialog: Nothing.
text: He continues walking. He reaches his car. Suddenly
text: someone comes up behind him fast. JERRY spins--
dialog: --it's DEAN.
speaker_heading: DEAN

dialog: Jerry--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Christ!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Ssh!
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Bobby--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: It's the NSA. They're the ones
dialog: doing this.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Bobby--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: The NSA's doing this 'cause they
dialog: think I have something. And they
dialog: killed--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: They killed Rachel.
speaker_heading: JERRY

dialog: Rachel's dead?
speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: No, listen to me. You gotta let me

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No, I--
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: You gotta let me bring you in to
dialog: the police.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I won't make it to the police. They
dialog: won't let me get there. You go.
speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: To the cops?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em
dialog: to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what

speaker_heading: JERRY
dialog: Bobby, you're in way over your head.
speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: JERRY

speaker_heading: DEAN

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING
text: Establishing. A quiet street in Dean's neighborhood.
text: Several REPORTERS are camped in Dean's driveway
text: entrance, sipping coffees. Farther down the street, a
text: JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked. The driver waits and
dialog: watches.
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - SAME TIME
text: DEAN sneaks between two large houses, ducking by
text: windows and scaling a fence. Somewhere a DOG BARKS a
text: warning as DEAN plows through a large hedge, entering
text: the backyard to his home.
scene_heading: INT. DEAN'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - SAME TIME
text: DEAN quietly unlocks the door and enters. He listens.
text: The house is quiet. Empty.
scene_heading: INT. DEAN'S FOYER - DAY

text: The TV suddenly REMOTES ON - VOLUME LOUD.
text: She turns as DEAN approaches fast--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Robert--
text: DEAN's hand cups her mouth as he pulls her into a

scene_heading: INT. PANTRY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (barely a whisper)
dialog: Listen to me. The house is bugged.
dialog: So we gotta be quiet, okay?
text: STACY nods understanding. DEAN slowly removes his hand.
speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Is Eric in school?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Just reporters.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I wish you'd gone to your parents
dialog: like I asked you.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: This is my house. Nobody's kicking
dialog: me out of my house. I picked those
text: drapes.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I don't think anybody wants the
dialog: drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes
dialog: are okay.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: What happened to your head?
speaker_heading: DEAN
text: I was in a car chase and a small
dialog: explosion. Now listen to me: The
dialog: NSA is behind this. They think that
dialog: guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz,
dialog: they think Zavitz gave me a tape or
dialog: computer chip of some kind that
dialog: could be damaging to them. So
dialog: they're doing all these things
dialog: electronically. The bank records,
dialog: the surveillance. They're the ones
dialog: who broke into the house. Now I
dialog: know there's no reason to believe
dialog: me. But I love you. And I love our
dialog: son. So just believe me anyway.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Please.
text: STACY gently touches his forehead where he's been cut...
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Does that hurt?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Well...yeah.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Stacy--
text: She grabs him and kisses him. The kiss lasts a good
text: long time before STACY smacks him on the arm--
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I told you they could do this. I
dialog: told you they had this kind of
dialog: capability and that with this anti-

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the
dialog: best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
text: She kisses him again.
speaker_heading: STACY

speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: That's okay.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I opened the present you got me
dialog: from Harrison's.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You opened the thing?
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: The lingerie.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: That was for Christmas.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I was missing you.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You're as bad as Eric. I've got an

speaker_heading: DEAN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. JEEP GRAND-CHEROKEE - DAY

text: The REPORTERS stare at each other a beat--

speaker_heading: DRIVER

speaker_heading: JONES (O.S.)

speaker_heading: DRIVER
text: She's off location with a friend.
speaker_heading: JONES (O.S.)

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: ANOTHER AGENT (O.S.)
dialog: (radio effect)
dialog: 502 to 501, I've got the eyeball.
dialog: He's approaching Ridgeview, we'll
text: take him at the intersection.
text: The RANGE ROVER speeds through the neighborhood.
text: Suddenly, two cars are out in front, blocking the way.
text: The Range Rover swerves and breaks as two more cars rip
text: up behind, boxing it in. An un-marked Trans-Am lags
text: behind, keeping reporters at bay.
text: Doors fling open. JONES and THREE MEN, all in plain
text: clothes, pistols and MAC-10 aimed at the Range Rover.
dialog: Nothing happens.
dialog: The MEN move closer--
text: JONES grabs the door and rips it open, revealing Dean's
text: PISS-FRIGHTENED NANNY behind the wheel in Dean's trench
text: coat and hat.
text: JONES YANKS her out, puts her hard to the ground, gun
text: jammed to her head, as other search the Range Rover for
dialog: Dean.
scene_heading: EXT. DEAN'S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: DEAN drives the Nanny's rusted, low-rider Dodge out of

scene_heading: EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Eric?
text: ERIC looks up...
speaker_heading: TRACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your father's here.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Where've you been?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Having an adventure. I can't tell
dialog: you about it right now, but I'll
dialog: tell you about it soon.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Are you and mom getting a divorce?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: No. We're never getting a divorce.
dialog: We were having a fight. It happens
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Who won the fight?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Men don't win fights with women,
dialog: son, I'll tell you about that
text: sometime, too. In the meantime,
dialog: I've got a question for you, and
dialog: it's incredibly important that you
dialog: tell me the truth. Under no
dialog: circumstances will I be angry with
dialog: you. This is a total Get-Out-Of-
dialog: Jail-Free card. Ready?
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Did you take anything--anything at
dialog: all--out of those Christmas bags I
dialog: brought home last week.
text: ERIC hangs his head...busted...then shouts to a GROUP
text: OF KIDS on the playground...
speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: DYLAAAAN!!
text: DYLAN comes trotting over, carrying his backpack...
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Oh, God, I knew it was stupid, I
dialog: knew we'd get caught. But the
text: Gameboy was just sitting there.
text: Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes.
dialog: We took the GameBoy out of the bag,
dialog: but with every intention of putting
dialog: it back.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
text: DYLAN hunts through the backpack as DEAN and ERIC looks
text: on. All kinds of junk flies out--candy, comics, game-
dialog: cartridges--
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: It was broken when we found it, I
dialog: swear. I tried fixing it for you. I
dialog: even put in new batteries.
dialog: (pulling out the GameBoy)
dialog: The screen scrambles whenever you
dialog: boot up. I'd try to get your money
dialog: back.
text: DEAN eyes the pieces of the GameBoy, knowing that
text: somewhere in the puzzle of plastic and chips is the key
dialog: to his problems.
scene_heading: EXT. BALTIMORE SHERATON - EVENING
text: PEDESTRIANS walk on the sidewalk. A MAN comes along and
text: drops a few letters in the corner mailbox.
text: From the other direction comes DEAN. Without stopping,
text: he casually slashes the mailbox with chalk.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: DEAN's asleep. There's a SOFT SHUFFLING SOUND. The
text: CAMERA EXPLORES for the source, moving by the windows,
text: flashing neon, a TV and finally, the door.
text: We PUSH CLOSER as a MULE TOOL snakes under the door.
text: The tool pops upright against the door's inside. The
text: strap drapes over the doorknob and tightens. The
text: doorknob turns and opens.
text: SOMEONE slips in--
text: CLOSE ON DEAN asleep. A HAND covers his mouth. DEAN's
text: eyes go wide.
text: Then he sees it's BRILL...
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Get dressed. We're leaving.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: You could knock on the door, you
dialog: know, and I'd open it.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Move it.
scene_heading: EXT. CAPE CHARLES - 4 A.M.

speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
dialog: Dean, the attorney recently under
dialog: investigation for a money laundering
dialog: scheme, was seen leaving Ms. Banks
dialog: apartment late last night.

scene_heading: INT. PICK-UP - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
dialog: Police are seeking--
text: BRILL ejects as cassette from the dashboard and hands
dialog: it to DEAN.
speaker_heading: BRILL
text: I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: And you were worried about me.
dialog: That's nice, I appreciate--
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: I was worried about my hundred and
dialog: twenty 'K'.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: We said a hundred.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: The price rises with the temperature
dialog: and right now you're smokin'. But
dialog: you're right, you should shop
dialog: around and get the best price. I'll
dialog: just let you out here.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: One-twenty.
text: BRILL checks the rear-view mirror.
text: BRILL's POV: Car headlights following in the distance.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Did you call anyone?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: I mean did you call anyone.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Look, my wife is understandably--
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Jesus!
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I called my wife!
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: What'd I tell you?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I didn't use my name.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: What'd I tell you?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I called from a payphone!
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: What'd I tell you?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You told me no calls.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: I told you no calls.
text: BRILL does a bootleggers U-turn. Several cars pass by
text: in the opposite direction.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: You don't get it. They go through
dialog: your phone records. They fuckin'
dialog: monitor everyone you called in the
dialog: last--
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: I didn't use my name.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Oh, I'll bet that threw 'em off the
dialog: scent. I sure hope you covered the
text: mouthpiece with a handkerchief and
dialog: used a funny voice!
text: BRILL turns off the headlights, does another U-turn,
text: pulls off on an emergency road and stops.
text: He turns off the engine, rolls down the window, looks
text: up into the night sky and listens.
text: BRILL's POV: A cloudy night. Silent except for the
text: water and a distant fog-horn. No sounds of aircraft.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (looking up as well)
dialog: I don't hear anything.
dialog: (on BRILL's silence)
dialog: Maybe you're wrong.
text: BRILL is staring upward...
speaker_heading: BRILL

scene_heading: INT. NRO KEYHOLE-12 LAB - CONTINUOUS
text: Re-establishing. A massive, dark place filled with

text: CLOSE ON A MONITOR - displaying a live SAT feed showing

text: image of BRILL looking upward is fairly clear. He pops
text: his head back into the truck and pulls onto the road.
text: The satellite continues tracking the truck.
speaker_heading: BRILL (O.S.)
text: It's a consumated marriage.
scene_heading: INT. TOYOTA - NIGHT
text: BRILL drives along a high fence surrounding acres of
text: empty warehouses, docks and rust-bitten fences. He's
text: still on constant alert - looking for sign of their
dialog: presence.
speaker_heading: BRILL (CONT'D)
dialog: The NSA's been in bed with the
dialog: entire tele-communications industry
dialog: since the 40's. They've infected
dialog: everything: Banks, computers,
dialog: phones, mail, name it.
dialog: (stopping the car near
dialog: the gate)
dialog: The more technology we buy into,
dialog: the easier it is keeping tabs on us.
dialog: It's a brave new world.
dialog: (handing DEAN the keys)
dialog: At least it better be.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: How do you know so much?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: None of your business.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: I was a traffic analyst.
text: DEAN gives him a look that says, "I don't know what
dialog: that means".
speaker_heading: BRILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I intercepted phone calls.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: How'd you get around the tap orders?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: They can tap anything as along as
text: it's an airwave intercept.
dialog: Cellulars and pagers your kid can
dialog: do.
dialog: (driving through)
dialog: Hard-line calls we'd pick off the
text: relays as they were being fed into
text: ground cables or fired up to the
dialog: SATs. We'd suck in everything. All
dialog: foreign, most domestic.
dialog: (DEAN re-closes the gate)
dialog: Domestic was my group. Druggies,
dialog: radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we
dialog: wanted.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (climbing back in)
dialog: How'd you have the manpower to--
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: (driving again)
dialog: Meade has 18 underground acres of
dialog: computers. They scan every
dialog: phonecall for target words like
dialog: "bomb" or "President". We red-flag
dialog: phone numbers or voice
dialog: prints...whatever we wanted. When
dialog: the computers found something, it
dialog: was bounced to comparative analysis.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: That was twenty years ago. With
dialog: digital? They can suck a salt grain
text: off a beach.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Why'd you leave?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: It was '72. I figured we had enough
dialog: problems without monitoring a
dialog: Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I
dialog: sold my story to Ramparts and split.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: They come after you?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: (shrugging it off)
dialog: Well...there'd be too much
dialog: disclosure to prosecute me. So they
dialog: ruined my records and made sure I'd
dialog: never hold a real job again.
text: The pick-up stops by a long two-story warehouse.
speaker_heading: BRILL (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Looks like Detroit.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
scene_heading: INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: BRILL and DEAN enter the 2nd story of a large, empty
text: structure. DEAN is carrying a crumpled, brown paper bag.
text: In the center of the cavernous space, a windowless,
text: cinderblock room built on 5-foot supports.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: I call it the jar. No phone or
text: utility lines going in.
text: BRILL opens a side door revealing a mini-generator. He
text: pushes the start button. The generator HUMS to life.
speaker_heading: BRILL
text: Self-contained. Unplugged from the
dialog: world.
dialog: (opening Jar door)
dialog: Nothing for a wire bug to piggy-
text: back in on. That leaves only
dialog: transmitters and signal sweep for
dialog: those.
dialog: (turning on the light)
dialog: Now let's see what we got.
text: DEAN tosses the paper bag to BRILL, who empties its
text: contents (the pieces of the GameBoy) on to the table.
scene_heading: EXT. DOCKS - DAWN
text: DEAN sits alone, smoking a cigarette, and watching
text: Norfolk rise from dawn's fog.
text: In the distance we see BRILL coming down from the

text: He stands behind DEAN for a moment before...
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: That is one ugly sunrise.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It really is.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you find anything?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Take a walk with me.
text: DEAN gets up and joins BRILL. The two of them start in
text: the direction of the second warehouse.
speaker_heading: BRILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember when Senator Hamersley
dialog: died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: The NSA killed him.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Jesus. Do you have proof?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Well, actually, you have proof.
dialog: Could you walk a little faster please.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: They're here.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Them.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Here?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Here?!
speaker_heading: BRILL
text: In the warehouse. They're hiding in
dialog: a duct on the third floor. When we
dialog: go back inside, they're gonna kill
dialog: us. When they notice that we're
dialog: moving toward the car, they'll come
text: running out of the building.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: 'Kay, well, could you walk faster,

speaker_heading: JONES

scene_heading: EXT. THE SECOND WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: DEAN and BRILL are kneeling beside the Chevy, letting
text: the air out of the tires.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat.
dialog: And turn your head. There might be
dialog: some debris flying your way.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Why?
text: And with that, THE FIRST WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, sending a
text: fireball of debris in all directions.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: What the fuck?!
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: They shouldn't have come without
dialog: calling first.
text: BRILL jumps into the Chevy, turns the key and the
text: engine ignites. DEAN leaps in. BRILL stomps on the gas
text: and tires screech. The Chevy hurtles through the
text: warehouse toward a shut garage door. BRILL clicks a
text: remote. The door rises.
text: OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - The Chevy roars outward,
text: screams around a corner, then speeds down a road lined
dialog: with warehouses.
text: DEAN looks down an intersecting road to glimpse a
text: Saturn sedan gaining on a parallel road.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Where's your gun?
text: They pass an area with no warehouses. The Saturn turns,
text: heading straight at them.
speaker_heading: DEAN
text: Back at the warehouse.
text: The Saturn pulls on the road behind them. The MAN in
text: the Saturn leans out and fires an assault rifle. The
text: side window by Dean's head shatters.
text: BRILL one-hands the pistol and checks the load.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (re: the pistol)
dialog: Gimme that.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: You're driving.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Those are Feds.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (taking the pistol)
dialog: I didn't see a warrant. Did you see
dialog: a warrant?
text: The Chevy enters a narrow lane, the Saturn right behind.
text: With the Chevy's tires flat and flapping, the Saturn
text: hugs their rear. DEAN looks back again as the RIFLEMAN
speaker_heading: FIRES--
text: The rear window EXPLODES. DEAN pops up and fires three
text: quick, well-placed rounds.
text: The Saturn swerves and drops back. BRILL's impressed.
text: DEAN looks forward to see an exit road blocked by an
text: iron cross-bar. BRILL, unfazed, pushes the Chevy faster.
text: Beam or no beam, he's going through.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Think we let out enough air?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh my God...
text: BRILL and DEAN hit the deck as the Chevy's hood scrapes
text: just under the beam. The windshield frame takes the
text: full impact. The beam slices through steel and glass,
text: decapitating the car. They emerge on the other side
dialog: minus roof and windows as--
text: --the Saturn SCREECH-STOPS inches from the beam and
text: debris. A MAN leaps out, shoulders his rifle and aims--
text: --but the Chevy disappears around a building.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING
text: A foggy morning. The rural highway's deserted at this
text: early hour. The Chevy rumbles by...
scene_heading: INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS
text: DEAN and BRILL, windblown but alive, remove shards of
text: glass. BRILL eyes the road behind him.
text: Empty.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: We lost 'em.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: That wasn't so hard.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Fuckin-A.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Let's not do the tire thing anymore,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Yeah, I can see where that'd--
text: He stops talking.
text: He hears ROTOR THUMPS as a black HELICOPTER appears
text: over a fog-laced hillside, swooping down.
text: BRILL floors it. The helicopter drops in closer as
text: BRILL swerves back and forth while taking a curve at 70-
text: plus on flapping tires. A helicopter SHARP-SHOOTER aims
text: with an M-16.
text: A spray of high-powered slugs suddenly rip into the
text: Chevy's hood. The engine starts knocking.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: These guys are incredibly persistent.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Tell me about it.
text: The road straightens. Up ahead, a tunnel.
text: More bullets slice the hood. Radiator fluid starts
text: hissing. The Chevy starts dying.
text: BRILL stomps the pedal, squeezing out every last kick
dialog: of horsepower.
text: Rubber flaps. Tires shred. Steam hisses. Bullets fly.
text: The helicopter swoops in lower and lower for the kill shot.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
text: The SHARP-SHOOTER lines DEAN in his sights.
text: The PILOT keeps pace, dropping closer. The SHARP-
text: SHOOTER has the shot.
text: The Chevy reaches the tunnel's opening on sparking,
text: screeching wheel rims.
text: The helicopter pulls up, missing the hill by inches.
text: But not the power lines. The PILOT sees them too late.
text: The helicopter flies into a web of cables. The upper
text: rotor slices neatly off. The helicopter's body rockets
text: downward to the road where it bounces and skids like a
text: rock on water until it meets an oncoming semi-truck
text: head-on.
speaker_heading: BLAM!
scene_heading: EXT. INSIDE THE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: BRILL tries steering but metal wheels on concrete don't

text: they bash into the tunnel wall, grinding to a stop.
scene_heading: INT. DODGE - CONTINUOUS
text: A GRUNGE-DUDE blasts his car-stereo as he enters the
text: tunnel, unaware of the mayhem behind him.
text: He slows, seeing a smoking wreck ahead.
text: Closer, he sees DEAN waving him down. He slows more.
dialog: Bad move.

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS

speaker_heading: HICKS

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Oh, let's assume that they have.
speaker_heading: HICKS

speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Resources, that's a good point.

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: BRILL

speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: BRILL

speaker_heading: BRILL

text: The WELL-DRESSED MAN scans the coffee shop and sees the

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: DEAN and BRILL run down the street, through an alley
text: and over a fence to another street. They slow as they

scene_heading: EXT. BOSTON STREETS - CONTINUOUS
text: Through alleys, down streets, under an overpass, down a
text: one-way street, barely missing a head-on as they roar
text: into a rail-yard traversing the waterfront. BRILL's at
text: his best, putting distance between himself and the cops
dialog: at every turn.
text: Finally, it looks as if they've made it as they race
text: down an alleyway, only to realize it's a dead-end.
text: BRILL slams into reverse. They screech backward, tires
dialog: smoking.
text: Too late. The squad car rips into the alleyway, boxing
dialog: them in.
text: BRILL hits the brakes. He looks back at the dead-end
text: and sees an empty flat-bed trailer with a ramp. BRILL
dialog: gives it everything. If they can get enough speed and
text: hit the ramp right, maybe they can clear the obstructing
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: BRILL
dialog: Feeling lucky?
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Not particularly, no.
text: They hit the ramp full speed. The front end bottoms at
text: the Taurus bounces skyward. Tires clip the wall as the
text: car flips and smashes into a parked rail-car filled
dialog: with coal.
dialog: They aren't going anywhere.
text: Back in the alley, the squad car skids to a stop.
text: A ROOKIE climbs from his car, leaps the wall, draws his
text: gun and nears...
text: Inside the Taurus, the windows are shattered. Steam
text: hisses, gasoline drips and coal is everywhere.
text: DEAN shimmies out through a broken side window. He
text: barely gets to his feet as he stumbles 20 yards or so.
text: His foot accidentally dislodges a large pile of coal,
text: which buries him up to his waist and immobilizes him.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: (to BRILL)
dialog: I'm stuck. Help me out.
text: He looks back to see that BRILL is hanging out the

speaker_heading: COP
dialog: (on waist radio)
dialog: One-Lincoln-Nine, suspects TA'd
text: into a coal car at the Fullbright
text: rail-yards. Requesting back-up,
text: fire and ambulance.
text: An unmarked car with red-flashers races up the rail-
text: yard and stops. The ROOKIE turns as JONES and KRUG hop out.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: (flashing ID)
dialog: FBI. What do you got?
speaker_heading: COP
text: Two murder suspects. One's wounded,
dialog: the other's maybe dead.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Thank you.
text: KRUG draws his silenced pistol and matter of factly
text: shoots the COP dead.
speaker_heading: JONES
speaker_heading: (to KRUG)
dialog: Check inside.
text: DEAN is watching this all unseen, helplessly trying to
text: dig himself out of the coal.
text: KRUG inspects the Taurus interior for anything of

speaker_heading: KRUG
text: (to BRILL as he searches.)
dialog: I hate doin' cops, I really do. You
dialog: I won't mind. Didn't mind that
dialog: Rachel Banks. Didn't mind doin' her
dialog: one bit.
dialog: (seeing DEAN's shoe)
dialog: Your lawyer friend buried over there?
text: BRILL can only gurgle blood. JONES pops the Taurus's
text: trunk had looks inside.
text: KRUG digs quickly through the coal pile, searching for
text: Dean. Then BRILL sees him--
text: BRILL's POV: DEAN down off the side of the coal-car,
text: lodged in the coal pile. He's safe, but not once KRUG
text: discovers he's not in the car.
text: BRILL pushes in the cigarette lighter.
text: JONES dumps everything from the Taurus into the
text: unmarked car. SIRENS suddenly fade in.
text: KRUG digs faster, looking for DEAN, as JONES approaches
text: with his pistol, clambering around for BRILL.
speaker_heading: KRUG
dialog: Fuck him, he's dead in two minutes.
dialog: Find Dean.
text: JONES starts to back out, just as the Taurus's
text: cigarette lighter pops out. BRILL grabs it.
text: KRUG eyes the glowing lighter. Then he eyes BRILL.
dialog: Shit.
text: BRILL ignites the gas. WA-WOOMFF!! A fireball explodes,
text: consuming all - the car, BRILL, KRUG. JONES is blown
text: off his feet from the concussion.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: (scrambling away)
dialog: Fuck--
text: JONES wipes prints off his pistol and silencer and

speaker_heading: CHRISTA (O.S.)

speaker_heading: ALBERT

dialog: modulator.
speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: I don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: DEAN
dialog: Me neither, but the upshot is I've

dialog: So...how much money do you want in

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: You're not.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Then what do you want from the Senator?
speaker_heading: DEAN

speaker_heading: SENATOR ALBERT

speaker_heading: ERIC
dialog: If they're voting today, hasn't

speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: Actually, this man appears to have
dialog: changed his mind dramatically.

speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: C'mon upstairs. I've got a
dialog: Christmas present from Harrison's I

speaker_heading: ALBERT
dialog: (on TV)
dialog: Our intelligence communities
dialog: presently monitor our phones,
dialog: computers, financial transactions,
dialog: medical histories...all this and
dialog: more. Some of you may say, "Fine.
dialog: I'm not a criminal and I have
dialog: nothing to hide." Well God forbid
dialog: we ever edge to tyranny. God forbid
dialog: George Orwell's version of America
dialog: becomes a reality. We are that close.
