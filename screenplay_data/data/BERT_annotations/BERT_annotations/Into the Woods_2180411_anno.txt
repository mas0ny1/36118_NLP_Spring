speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: In the past, when you were no more

dialog: They were a lovely couple. But not

dialog: was with child and she developed an

scene_heading: BAKER'S FATHER'S POV

speaker_heading: (SHE EXPLODES)

text: The WITCH flings her arms and a hundred-mile wind throws the

scene_heading: EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - DAY
text: An open-air carriage and horses wait in the courtyard. The

speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
dialog: Ladies. Our carriage awaits!
text: CINDERELLA darts out of the house holding out the bowl of

speaker_heading: WIFE

speaker_heading: BAKER

speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WIFE

scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD BY JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAY
text: The carriage carrying the STEPFAMILY crosses a small country

scene_heading: EXT. CINDERELLA'S MOTHER'S GRAVE - DAY
text: A large willow tree stands tall.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: Deep within the woods, Cinderella had
text: planted a branch at the grave of her
dialog: mother. And she visited there so
dialog: often, and wept so much, that her
text: tears watered it until it had become a
text: magnificent tree.
text: CINDERELLA kneels in prayer.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I WISH...
text: She begins to cry.
speaker_heading: MUSIC.
text: In the reflection, CINDERELLA sees the tree slowly twist and
text: turn taking on the shape of her MOTHER, who looks down upon
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: C'S MOTHER
dialog: What is it that you wish, child?
text: CINDERELLA looks up to see her MOTHER in the tree.
speaker_heading: C'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WISH?/ ARE YOU
dialog: CERTAIN WHAT YOU WISH/ IS WHAT YOU
dialog: WANT?/ IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,/
scene_heading: THEN MAKE A WISH--/ ASK THE TREE,/ AND
dialog: YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR WISH.
text: CINDERELLA closes her eyes and makes her wish.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE
text: The wind now blowing the willow tree, its LEAVES begin to
text: rain down on CINDERELLA, turning gold and silver as they
text: swirl around her, transforming her clothes into a beautiful
dialog: gown.
text: CINDERELLA looks down to see that she is now wearing a pair
text: of shoes literally made of gold leaf. When she looks back up,
text: the tree has now returned to its former shape.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Thank you, Mother.
text: She dashes into the woods.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY
text: LRRH walks along the path.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: On her path to Granny's, the little
text: girl suddenly found herself in a very
text: unusual part of the wood.
speaker_heading: WOLF'S POV
text: Branches and leaves rush by in a blur. Suddenly, the CAMERA
text: stops, and in the distance we see LRRH strolling down a path
text: of exotic flowers as she munches on a treat. We hear HEAVY
text: BREATHING. The CAMERA continues stalking its prey, moving
text: closer towards LRRH through the brush.
text: ANGLE on LRRH, as she continues walking and eating.
speaker_heading: WOLF (O.S.)
dialog: Good day, young lady.
text: She turns around and what she sees - through a CHILD'S EYES -
text: is a super-slick, good-looking guy. What she doesn't notice
text: is his curiously low hairline, something of a snout, and a
text: tail peeking from his waistcoat.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Good day, Mr. Wolf.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Whither away so hurriedly?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: To my Grandmother's.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: And what might be in your basket?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: It's bread for Grandmother so she'll
dialog: have something good to make her
dialog: strong.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: And where might your Grandmother live?
speaker_heading: LRRH
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: A quarter of a league further in the
text: woods; her house stands inside a great
dialog: oak tree.
text: She continues on the path.
text: The WOLF looks after her longingly.
dialog: 23
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOLF
scene_heading: MMMMH.../ UNHH.../ LOOK AT THAT
scene_heading: FLESH,/ PINK AND PLUMP./ HELLO, LITTLE
scene_heading: GIRL.../ TENDER AND FRESH,/ NOT ONE
scene_heading: LUMP./ HELLO, LITTLE GIRL.../ THIS
scene_heading: ONE'S ESPECIALLY LUSH,/ DELICIOUS...
text: With inhuman speed, he manages to suddenly be back in front
text: of the girl on the path.
speaker_heading: WOLF (CONT'D)
scene_heading: HELLO, LITTLE GIRL,/ WHAT'S YOUR
dialog: RUSH?/ YOU'RE MISSING ALL THE
text: FLOWERS./ THE SUN WON'T SET FOR
dialog: HOURS,/ TAKE YOUR TIME.
speaker_heading: LRRH
scene_heading: MOTHER SAID,/ "STRAIGHT AHEAD,"/ NOT
text: TO DELAY/ OR BE MISLED.
text: She continues moving forward, he slithers around her. This
text: WOLF has some smooth moves.
speaker_heading: WOLF
text: BUT SLOW, LITTLE GIRL,/ HARK! AND HUSH-
text: / THE BIRDS ARE SINGING SWEETLY./
dialog: YOU'LL MISS THE BIRDS COMPLETELY,/
dialog: YOU'RE TRAVELLING SO FLEETLY.
text: He drops behind again, thinking to himself.
speaker_heading: WOLF (CONT'D)
scene_heading: GRANDMOTHER FIRST,/ THEN MISS
scene_heading: PLUMP.../ WHAT A DELECTABLE COUPLE./
scene_heading: UTTER PERFECTION:/ ONE BRITTLE, ONE
speaker_heading: SUPPLE--
text: Racing ahead and then darting out from a tree.
speaker_heading: WOLF (CONT'D)
scene_heading: ONE MOMENT, MY DEAR--
speaker_heading: LRRH
scene_heading: MOTHER SAID,/ "COME WHAT MAY,/ FOLLOW
text: THE PATH/ AND NEVER STRAY."
speaker_heading: WOLF
scene_heading: JUST SO, LITTLE GIRL--/ ANY PATH./
scene_heading: SO MANY WORTH EXPLORING./ JUST ONE
text: WOULD BE SO BORING./ AND LOOK WHAT
dialog: YOU'RE IGNORING...
text: He ushers LRRH off the path to a lush meadow blanketed with
text: exquisite purple flowers and wild berries.
dialog: 24
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOLF (CONT'D)
dialog: (working himself up)
scene_heading: THINK OF THOSE CRISP,/ AGING BONES,/
text: THEN SOMETHING FRESH ON THE PALATE./
scene_heading: THINK OF THAT SCRUMPTIOUS CARNALITY/
dialog: TWICE IN ONE DAY.../ THERE'S NO
text: POSSIBLE WAY/ TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU
dialog: FEEL/ WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO YOUR
dialog: MEAL!
text: The WOLF picks a flower and hands it to LRRH.
speaker_heading: WOLF (CONT'D)
dialog: For Granny.
speaker_heading: LRRH
scene_heading: MOTHER SAID/ NOT TO STRAY./ STILL, I
scene_heading: SUPPOSE,/ A SMALL DELAY--/ GRANNY
scene_heading: MIGHT LIKE/ A FRESH BOUQUET.../
dialog: Goodbye, Mr. Wolf.
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: Goodbye, little girl./ AND HELLO...
text: The WOLF climbs to the top of a precipice where he is
text: silhouetted by the red hot sun. He lets out a mighty howl.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: LRRH goes about her business picking flowers further from her
dialog: path.
text: ANGLE ON THE BAKER who has been observing LRRH from a
text: distance. Like a bat, the WITCH swings upside down from a
text: tree above the BAKER:
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Why are you standing there?! Go get
dialog: the cape!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You frightened me!
text: The WITCH swings to the ground.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Get it! Get it! Get it!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: How am I supposed to get it?
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: You go up to the little thing, and you
dialog: take it.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I can't just take a cloak from a
dialog: little girl. Why don't you take it!
dialog: 25
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: It's the rules. Why do you think I
dialog: asked you in the first place? I'm not
dialog: allowed to touch any of the objects!
text: We suddenly hear the lilting sound of a young voice singing
text: in the distance. The WITCH, almost intoxicated by her sound,
text: swoons with delight. Then:
speaker_heading: WITCH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (YELLING)
dialog: Get me what I need! Get me what I
dialog: need!
text: She wraps the cape about herself and disappears in such a
text: strong blast of wind that it knocks the BAKER to the ground.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: This is ridiculous!
text: ANOTHER ANGLE. LRRH is picking flowers off the path, blithely
text: unaware of anything else. The BAKER gets up and hurries over
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello there little girl.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Hello, Mr. Baker.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Have you saved some of those sweets
dialog: for Granny?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: I ate all the sweets and half the loaf
dialog: of bread.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: So I see! Now tell me...where did you
dialog: get that beautiful cape?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: My Granny made it for me.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Is that right? I would love a red cape
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: LRRH
speaker_heading: (GIGGLING)
dialog: You'd look pretty foolish.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: May I take a look at it?
text: He quickly unties it.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: No!
dialog: 26
dialog: 
text: He pulls it off her back, she grabs the other side.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I need it badly.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Please -- give it back!
text: They have a tug of war.
text: The BAKER pulls free and runs off with the cape. LRRH stands
text: there momentarily stunned, then lets out a loud scream.
text: ANGLE ON THE BAKER. He stops cold, realizing what he's done,
text: then runs back to LRRH and places the cape around her
dialog: shoulders.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure
dialog: that you really loved this cape. Now
dialog: off you go to Granny's -- and be
dialog: careful that no wolf comes your way.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: I would rather a wolf than you any
dialog: day.
text: LRRH stamps on his foot. The BAKER hops on his good foot.
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (DISTRAUGHT)
dialog: This is hopeless. I'll never get that
dialog: red cape or find a golden cow and a
dialog: yellow slipper -- or was it a golden
dialog: slipper and a yellow cow?
speaker_heading: WIFE (O.S.)
text: THE COW AS WHITE AS MILK,/ THE CAPE AS
scene_heading: RED AS BLOOD,/ THE HAIR AS YELLOW AS
scene_heading: CORN,/ THE SLIPPER AS PURE AS--
text: He stops in his tracks.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: The WIFE steps out from behind a thicket.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: You forgot your scarf.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You shouldn't be here. It's not safe
dialog: in these woods!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I want to help.
text: She goes to tie the WOOL SCARF around his neck but he pulls
dialog: away.
dialog: 27
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: No! THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE--
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: OUR HOUSE--
speaker_heading: BAKER WIFE
text: ONLY I CAN LIFT THE SPELL,/ WE MUST LIFT THE SPELL
text: THE SPELL IS ON MY HOUSE--!/ TOGETHER!/ THE SPELL IS ON--
dialog: THE SPELL IS ON--
dialog: 
text: The two stop cold when they notice JACK and his COW coming
text: down the path towards them.
speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (MURMURED)
dialog: A cow as white as ...
text: They look at each other.
speaker_heading: BOTH
dialog: ... milk.
text: The WIFE pushes the BAKER in JACK'S direction, then follows.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Hello there, young lad.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hello, sir.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What might you be doing with a cow in
dialog: the middle of the forest?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was heading toward market -- but
dialog: I seem to have lost my way.
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: (COACHING BAKER)
dialog: What are you planning to do there?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: And what are you planning to do there?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Sell my cow, sir. No less than five
dialog: pounds.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Five pounds!
speaker_heading: (TO WIFE)
dialog: Where are we to get five pounds?
text: The WIFE moves forward to JACK as the BAKER goes through the
text: pockets of his hunting jacket looking for money.
dialog: 28
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: She must be generous of milk to fetch
dialog: five pounds?
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (HESITANTLY)
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: And if you can't fetch that sum? Then
dialog: what are you to do?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I hadn't thought of that...
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (TO WIFE)
dialog: This is all we have...
text: She inspects his hand, which holds a few coins and the six
dialog: magic beans.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (loudly, for the
dialog: benefit of the boy)
dialog: Beans? We mustn't give up our beans!
dialog: Well, if you feel we must...
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Beans in exchange for my cow?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Oh, these are no ordinary beans, son.
dialog: These beans carry...magic.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Magic? What kind of magic?
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: (TO BAKER)
dialog: Tell him!
text: The BAKER has no idea. He makes something up.
speaker_heading: BAKER
text: Magic that defies description.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How many beans?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Five!
speaker_heading: (TO JACK)
dialog: They're worth a pound each, at least.
dialog: 29
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Could I buy my cow back someday?
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (UNEASY)
dialog: Well ...
text: The WIFE gives him a little poke.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: ...possibly. Here.
text: He hands JACK the five beans, carefully dropping them one at
text: a time into the boy's hand. The WIFE quickly takes the SIXTH
text: BEAN and puts it in her pocket.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Good luck there, young lad.
text: As the BAKER takes the cow's leash, JACK wraps his arms
text: around the bony animal.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: One day, I'll buy you back -- Promise!
text: JACK kisses the cow. The BAKER looks to his WIFE guiltily.
text: Overcome with emotion, JACK runs back into the woods.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Take the cow and go home!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I was just trying to help.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Magic beans! We've no reason to
dialog: believe they're magic! Are we going to
dialog: dispel this curse through deceit?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: No one would have given him more for
dialog: this creature. We did him a favor. At
dialog: least they'll have some food.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Five beans?!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Do we want a child or not?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Of course. But...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: We have one chance. Don't you see
dialog: that? And if we fail...
dialog: 30
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I'm just not sure I'm cut out to be a
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Because of my father.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: You're not him.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: If you can't do this for yourself,
dialog: can't you at least do it for me?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: All right. You take the cow and go
dialog: home. I'll find the rest of the
dialog: things. On my own.
text: The BAKER walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY
text: RAPUNZEL'S PRINCE glides through the woods on a white stead.
dialog: It's difficult to say who is more beautiful, the PRINCE or
text: the HORSE. From the corner of his eye he notices something in
text: the distance. He slows down and circles back, and HEARS the
text: melodious singing of RAPUNZEL. He dismounts and slips through
dialog: the brush to see:
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - RAPUNZEL'S TOWER - DAY
speaker_heading: R-PRINCE POV
text: An exquisite tower, surrounded by a thicket of tall rose
text: bushes, with no entryway, just a lone window at its peak. At
text: the bottom of the tower, the WITCH looks upward:
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Rapunzel. Rapunzel. Let down your hair
dialog: to me.
text: The PRINCE, hiding within the brush.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: (savoring the name)
dialog: Rapunzel...
text: At the window, the gorgeous young blonde girl, RAPUNZEL
dialog: proceeds to lower the longest stretch of hair you've ever
text: seen. The WITCH scales up the tower. (This causes more than a
dialog: little discomfort for RAPUNZEL.)
dialog: 31
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: The old enchantress had given the name
dialog: Rapunzel to the child she had hidden
text: away and locked in a a doorless tower.
dialog: But little did she know that the
text: girl's lilting voice had caught the
dialog: attention of a handsome Prince."
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: Rapunzel...
text: The PRINCE dashes back to his horse and gallops off.
text: The WITCH arrives at the window.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Don't you look lovely today, my dear.
speaker_heading: RAPUNZEL
dialog: Thank you, Mother.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: I brought your favorite. Blackberries,
text: fresh from the garden.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: LRRH walks over a rickety bridge that spans a brook. She
text: stops and stares at the cottage which is built into a large
speaker_heading: OAK TREE.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: As the little girl approached her
dialog: Granny's oak tree, she was surprised
text: to see the door standing open.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Oh dear, how uneasy I feel. Perhaps
dialog: it's all the sweets.
scene_heading: INT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: LRRH makes her way down a curved staircase in the house. She
text: sees the CURTAINS drawn around her GRANNY'S BED and, behind
text: them, the SILHOUETTE of what "looks like" GRANNY.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Granny?
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: (In a granny voice)
dialog: Come in, my deary.
text: LRRH moves towards the bed with trepidation and slowly pulls
text: back the curtain. The WOLF is revealed, lying under the
text: covers, dressed in GRANNY'S nightcap and robe.
dialog: 32
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: My, Grandmother. You're looking very
dialog: strange. What big ears you have!
speaker_heading: WOLF
dialog: The better to hear you with, my dear.
text: The handsome WOLF flashes a smile that reveals a set of
text: gleaming white FANGS.
scene_heading: EXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The BAKER crosses the bridge and heads towards the cottage.
text: He suddenly hears LRRH scream. Nervously he pulls the knife
text: from his belt.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: And with a single bound, the wolf had
dialog: devoured the little girl. Well, it
dialog: was a full day of eating for both.
scene_heading: INT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The BAKER enters and hears a loud SNORE. Brandishing the
text: knife, he moves towards the bed where he sees the WOLF
text: DRESSED AS GRANNY, sound asleep, a piece of the red cloth
text: sticking out of it's mouth.
text: Squeamishly, he pulls back the sheet to see the WOLF'S
text: SWOLLEN STOMACH. He raises his knife and as he brings it
text: slashing down we hear a loud HOWL from the WOLF.
speaker_heading: CUT TO BLACK
scene_heading: EXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER
text: FADE UP ON THE BAKER, clearly shaken, leaving the cottage and
text: walking away.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I can't believe I just did that.
text: LRRH and GRANNY appear at the doorway behind him.
speaker_heading: LRRH
speaker_heading: (CALLING)
dialog: Wait!
speaker_heading: GRANNY
dialog: Aren't you going to help us skin that
dialog: beast?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: No thanks!
speaker_heading: GRANNY
dialog: What kind of hunter are you?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I'm a baker.
dialog: 33
dialog: 
text: GRANNY gives him a disdainful look and goes back into the
text: house. LRRH in her cape runs after the BAKER as he approaches
text: the rickety bridge.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Wait a minute. I never thanked you.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You need to be more careful, young
dialog: lady.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: I'm sorry. I should have known better.
scene_heading: MOTHER SAID,/ "STRAIGHT AHEAD,"/ NOT
text: TO DELAY/ OR BE MISLED./ I SHOULD HAVE
scene_heading: HEEDED/ HER ADVICE.../ BUT HE SEEMED
speaker_heading: SO NICE.
dialog: AND HE SHOWED ME THINGS,/ MANY

dialog: PATH,/ SO I NEVER HAD DARED./ I HAD
scene_heading: BEEN SO CAREFUL/ I NEVER HAD CARED./
scene_heading: AND HE MADE ME FEEL EXCITED--/ WELL,
text: EXCITED AND SCARED.
text: LRRH relives her nightmare.
scene_heading: INT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY - NIGHTMARE
text: LRRH walks down the staircase towards GRANNY'S bed. She sees
text: the WOLF'S silhouette through the bed curtains.
speaker_heading: LRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: WHEN HE SAID "COME IN!"/ WITH THAT
text: SICKENING GRIN,/ HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT
dialog: WAS IN STORE?/ ONCE HIS TEETH WERE
scene_heading: BARED,/ THOUGH, I REALLY GOT SCARED--/
scene_heading: WELL, EXCITED AND SCARED./
text: LRRH grabs hold of the bed curtains and pulls them around
dialog: herself.
scene_heading: INT. THE WOLF'S BELLY - NIGHTMARE
text: LRRH falls down a dark cavernous void.
speaker_heading: LRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: BUT HE DREW ME CLOSE /AND HE SWALLOWED
scene_heading: ME DOWN,/ DOWN A DARK, SLIMY PATH/
text: WHERE LIE SECRETS THAT I NEVER WANT TO
speaker_heading: KNOW,/
text: She lands and sees a blurry form in the distance before
speaker_heading: realizing it is GRANNY.
speaker_heading: LRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
scene_heading: AND WHEN EVERYTHING FAMILIAR/ SEEMED
text: TO DISAPPEAR FOREVER,/ AT THE END OF
text: THE PATH/ WAS GRANNY ONCE AGAIN.
dialog: 34
dialog: 
text: GRANNY reaches out her arms blindly until the two are united
text: in a warm embrace.
speaker_heading: LRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
text: SO WE LAY IN THE DARK/ TILL YOU CAME
dialog: AND SET US FREE,
text: LRRH POV -- A crack of light widens until it's clear that she
text: is seeing a KNIFE opening the WOLF'S STOMACH that creates the
text: blinding light. The BAKER'S EYE peeks through the slit.
speaker_heading: LRRH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: AND YOU BROUGHT US TO THE LIGHT,
text: LRRH reaches for the BAKER...
scene_heading: EXT. GRANNY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: ...the BAKER takes her hand.
speaker_heading: LRRH
text: AND WE'RE BACK AT THE START.
text: She continues her story.
speaker_heading: LRRH (CONT'D)
text: AND I KNOW THINGS NOW,/ MANY VALUABLE
dialog: THINGS,/ THAT I HADN'T KNOWN BEFORE:/
dialog: DO NOT PUT YOUR FAITH/ IN A CAPE AND A
speaker_heading: HOOD,
text: She takes off her cape.
speaker_heading: LRRH (CONT'D)
dialog: THEY WILL NOT PROTECT YOU/ THE WAY
text: THAT THEY SHOULD./ AND TAKE EXTRA CARE
scene_heading: WITH STRANGERS--/ EVEN FLOWERS HAVE
text: THEIR DANGERS./ AND THOUGH SCARY IS
scene_heading: EXCITING,/ NICE IS DIFFERENT THAN
dialog: GOOD.
dialog: Mr. Baker. You saved our lives. Here.
text: LRRH hands him the cape.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Are you certain?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Yes. Maybe Granny will make me another
text: with the skins of the wolf.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Thank you. Thank you!
text: Impulsively he gives her a kiss on the cheek and as he
text: leaves, the girl wipes it off.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Yuck!
dialog: 35
dialog: 
text: She makes her way back to GRANNY'S.
speaker_heading: LRRH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO HERSELF)
scene_heading: NOW, I KNOW:/ DON'T BE SCARED./ GRANNY
dialog: IS RIGHT,/ JUST BE PREPARED./ ISN'T IT
text: NICE TO KNOW A LOT?/ AND A LITTLE BIT
dialog: NOT...
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT
text: Having just greeted JACK on his return, his MOTHER stares at
text: the beans he has just handed her.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
speaker_heading: (DESPAIRING)
dialog: How could you do this? What sort of
dialog: boy would exchange a cow for beans?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But they're magic -- the man said --
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: Get your head out of the clouds!
text: She angrily THROWS the beans to the ground.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Mother -- no!
text: She turns to grab JACK'S ear, failing to see the electric
text: sparks that flare when the beans strike the ground.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Dragging him up to the hayloft and pushing him on to his cot.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: You and your worthless adventures!
dialog: Will you never learn, Jack?! To bed
dialog: without supper for you!
text: She storms away. JACK lies on his bed bereft. He sees his
text: sling on the floor and picks it up cradling it as he closes
text: his eyes.
text: THE CAMERA travels to a hole in the wall and looks below to
text: see five bean stalks already growing and intertwining,
text: quickly reaching skyward.
scene_heading: EXT. KING'S CASTLE - NIGHT
text: WIDE SHOT. Sitting on a hilltop surrounded by the woods on
text: all sides, a magical and ageless castle sits aglow. A huge
text: FULL MOON hangs in the sky, but there's already the slither
text: of a SHADOW beginning to cross its face.
text: We hear MUSIC in the background along with the jovial sounds
dialog: of the ball.
dialog: 36
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: The first night of the festival ball
dialog: brought Cinderella her wish. The
dialog: Prince danced only with her, `til he
text: turned and she had slipped away.
text: Suddenly CINDERELLA in her ball-gown rushes out of a back
text: entrance and onto the terrace disappearing around a corner.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - THE STEPS
text: She descends a long stretch of ancient stone steps that lead
text: to the outside grounds.
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS
text: She appears running down a garden path below and into the
text: woods. A beat later, CINDERELLA'S PRINCE, dashes out on to a
text: drawbridge where he spots CINDERELLA below. He is tall, dark
text: and impossibly handsome. His STEWARD and other attendants
dialog: join him.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: I must find that girl!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - PATHWAY TO THE CASTLE - NIGHT
text: The BAKER'S WIFE is trying to find her way back to the
text: village, pulling an obstinate MILKY-WHITE on a leash behind
text: her. We see a piece of the castle in the distance.
text: We TRACK CINDERELLA racing through the brush -- not an easy
text: feat in a ball gown and gold slippers. We hear VOICES in the
text: distance and the NEIGHING OF HORSES. CINDERELLA stumbles on a
text: knoll, loses her footing and rolls over and over to the
text: bottom landing with a spectacular THUD just yards from the
speaker_heading: WIFE.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Are you alright, miss?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
speaker_heading: (STARTLED)
dialog: Yes. I just need to catch my breath.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What a beautiful gown you're wearing.
dialog: Were you at the King's Festival?
text: CINDERELLA, preoccupied, collects herself so she can continue
text: on her way.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Aren't you the lucky one. Why ever are
dialog: you in the woods at this hour?
text: We hear the PRINCE'S ENTOURAGE approaching.
dialog: 37
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEWARD (O.S.)
dialog: This way!
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Please. Don't let them know I'm here.
text: She quickly hides herself in the brush. The WIFE turns around
text: and looks to the top of the rise to see C-PRINCE on a black
text: stallion, with his STEWARD and ATTENDANTS in tow. He calls
text: down to the WIFE.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Have you seen a beautiful young woman
dialog: in a ball gown pass through?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (Breathless as she
speaker_heading: BOWS)
dialog: I don't think so, sir.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: If I may, my lord, I think I see her
dialog: over there.
text: The ENTOURAGE races off and CINDERELLA reappears and sits,
text: catching her breath.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I've never lied to royalty before.
dialog: I've never anything to royalty before!
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: If a prince were looking for me, I
dialog: certainly wouldn't hide.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Well, what brings you here -- and with
dialog: a cow?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Oh, my husband's somewhere in the
dialog: woods.
speaker_heading: (WITH PRIDE)
text: He's undoing a spell.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Oh, yes. But tell me, the Prince, what
dialog: was he like?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
text: HE'S A VERY NICE PRINCE.
dialog: 38
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: AND?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: AND--/ IT'S A VERY NICE BALL.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: AND?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
text: AND--/ WHEN I ENTERED, THEY TRUMPETED.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: AND--?/ THE PRINCE--?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: OH, THE PRINCE...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: YES, THE PRINCE!
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
scene_heading: WELL, HE'S TALL.
text: The WIFE sits down next to CINDERELLA admiring her dress as
dialog: they chat.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: IS THAT ALL?/ DID YOU DANCE?/ IS HE
dialog: CHARMING?/ THEY SAY THAT HE'S
speaker_heading: CHARMING.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
text: WE DID NOTHING BUT DANCE.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: YES--? AND--?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
text: AND IT MADE A NICE CHANGE.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: NO, THE PRINCE!
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: OH, THE PRINCE...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: YES, THE PRINCE.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: HE HAS CHARM FOR A PRINCE, I GUESS...
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: GUESS?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I DON'T MEET A WIDE RANGE.
text: AND IT'S ALL VERY STRANGE.
dialog: 39
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: But why would you run away?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: It's not quite what I expected.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Princes, castles, gowns...
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I have no experience with those
dialog: things.
text: We hear the far off CHIMES OF MIDNIGHT from the castle.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: But you will return to the Festival
dialog: tomorrow eve?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Yes... No... I don't know...
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: You don't know? What I wouldn't give
dialog: to be in your shoes.
dialog: (looking to her
speaker_heading: SHOES)
dialog: ...I mean your slippers.
speaker_heading: (EXCITED)
dialog: As pure as gold?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I must get home.
text: CINDERELLA runs off.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Wait! I need your shoes!
text: The WIFE goes after CINDERELLA but then hears a distant COW
text: MOAN. She turns around to discover that MILKY-WHITE has taken
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
dialog: Milky-White!
text: The WITCH appears from nowhere.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: One midnight gone!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Already?!
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Get that cow!
text: The WIFE takes off after the cow as the CAMERA RISES above
text: tree level. The BLUE SHADOW has moved a little further across
text: the face of the MOON.
dialog: 40
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY - DAYBREAK
text: A STRAGGLY ROOSTER crowing, the sun cutting across its path.
scene_heading: INT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAYBREAK - CONTINUOUS
text: JACK'S MOTHER is woken by the rooster crow to find something
text: ticking her nose.
text: She opens her eyes, brushing the "something" away -- then
text: sees that it's a huge LEAF pushing in through an open slat in
dialog: the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. JACK'S FARMHOUSE - DAYBREAK - EXTREME WIDE SHOT
text: The cottage, now dwarfed by a giant BEANSTALK. JACK'S MOTHER,
text: a tiny figure from this distance, comes running out of the
text: house, takes one look at the giant plant and screams.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY
text: Various angles of JACK, running feverishly through the woods
text: in search of the BAKER. He carries a huge sack of LARGE-SIZED
text: COINS over his back. He occasionally calls out: "Mr. Baker!"
text: The BAKER, peacefully asleep is curled up in a large root,
text: clutching the red cape like it was his blankie. Suddenly JACK
text: leaps from atop calling his name and waking him.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker!
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (HALF ASLEEP)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Good fortune! Good fortune, sir! Look
dialog: what I have! Five gold pieces.
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (SKEPTICAL)
dialog: How would you come by five gold
dialog: pieces?!
speaker_heading: JACK
text: THERE ARE GIANTS IN THE SKY!/ THERE

scene_heading: EXT. BEANSTALK - DAY - FLASHBACK
text: JACK scurries down the BEANSTALK, with the large SACK OF

speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: So, here's your money, sir! Five gold
dialog: pieces. Where is my Milky-White?
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (HESITANTLY)
dialog: Milky-White is back home with my wife.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's go find them!
text: JACK grabs the BAKER and excitedly tries to pull him along.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Wait a minute! I'm not sure I want to
dialog: sell.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But you said I could buy her back. Do
dialog: you want more money?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: No, no, no! It's not that--
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (IGNORING HIM)
dialog: You keep that. I'll fetch some more.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Wait. I didn't say--

speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, come back!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUS

dialog: money sack.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Well...
text: She doesn't want to tell him she's lost MILKY-WHITE.
speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
dialog: I see you've got the red cape!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Yes. I've got the cape. Only two items
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: (SHEEPISH)

speaker_heading: BAKER

speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: (FAKED ENTHUSIASM)
dialog: You've the cape...
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What have you done with the cow?!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: She ran away. I never reached home.
dialog: I've been looking for her all night.
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (ANGRY)
dialog: How could you?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: She might just as easily have run from
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: But she didn't!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: BUT SHE DIDN'T!!!
speaker_heading: WITCH (O.S.)
speaker_heading: WHO CARES!
speaker_heading: 44

speaker_heading: WITCH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: We were just going to do that. Here.

speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: You can have this--
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH THAT, FOOL!! I
dialog: can't touch it! By midnight tomorrow
dialog: bring me the items or that child you
dialog: wish for will never see the light of

text: With a grand sweep of her cape, the WITCH throws off dirt and
text: muck over the BAKER and the BAKER'S WIFE as she disappears
text: into a cloud of dust.
text: The BAKER wipes dirt from his mouth.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I don't like that woman.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I'm sorry I lost the cow.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I shouldn't have yelled.
dialog: (firmly but kindly)
dialog: Go back to the village. I will make
dialog: things right. And then we can just go
dialog: about our life. No more witches or dim-

text: The BAKER'S WIFE starts to speak.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: GO!, please -- go.
dialog: She goes.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - PINE FOREST - DAY
text: WIDE SHOT. We hear the hoofbeats of horses coming from both

text: CINDERELLA'S PRINCE on his BLACK stallion and RAPUNZEL'S
text: PRINCE on his WHITE steed. They pass out of the frame. After
text: a few beats, they return trotting, meeting in the middle.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: Good brother. I was wondering where
dialog: you'd gone.
dialog: 45
dialog: 
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE

speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: Her?
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: The beautiful one I danced the evening

speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: Where did she go?
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Disappeared, like the fine morning
dialog: mist.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: She was lovely?
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: The loveliest.
text: They dismount and walk their horses through the forest.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: I am not certain of that! I must
dialog: confess, I too have found a lovely
text: maiden. She lives here in the woods.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: The woods?
text: In the background we see the WIFE, who has wandered by on her
text: way back home. She stops to EAVESDROP on the PRINCES.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
text: Yes! In the top of a tall tower that
dialog: has no door or stairs.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: Two leagues from here, due east, just
text: beyond the mossy knoll near the rose
text: thickets.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: And how do you manage a visit?
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: I stand beneath her tower and say,
dialog: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your
text: hair to me." And then she lowers the
dialog: longest, most beautiful head of hair -
dialog: yellow as corn - which I climb.
text: The WIFE is thrilled by this news, and runs off.
dialog: 46
dialog: 
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Rapunzel, Rapunzel! What kind of name
dialog: is that? You jest! I have never heard
dialog: of such a thing.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: I speak the truth! She is as true as
dialog: your maiden. A maiden running from a
dialog: prince? None would run from us.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Yet one has.
text: The PRINCES lead their horses to a stream that cascades into
text: a magnificent waterfall.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE (CONT'D)
dialog: DID I ABUSE HER/ OR SHOW HER DISDAIN?/
dialog: WHY DOES SHE RUN FROM ME?/ IF I SHOULD
scene_heading: LOSE HER,/ HOW SHALL I REGAIN/ THE
dialog: HEART SHE HAS WON FROM ME?
scene_heading: AGONY--!/ BEYOND POWER OF SPEECH./

dialog: Excuse me for this.

text: The PRINCE mounts his horse and rides off towards a low rose

speaker_heading: LRRH

speaker_heading: JACK

scene_heading: EXT. BEANSTALK &amp; JACK'S FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: Jack took the little girl's dare and
dialog: before he knew it, found himself

text: Suddenly, the BEANSTALK shakes mightily, making JACK hold on
text: for dear life. He looks up to discover the Giant climbing

speaker_heading: WIFE

text: CINDERELLA dashes off.
text: ON THE WIFE AND STEWARD.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
speaker_heading: (SUSPICIOUS)
dialog: Stop! What is that you have in your
dialog: hand?
text: The WIFE hides the slipper behind her back. The STEWARD
text: dismounts.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: It's mine.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: (gets off horse)
dialog: Lying will cost you your life!
text: The STEWARD snatches the shoe. The WIFE pushes the Steward
text: and grabs the slipper back.
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: (DESPERATE)
dialog: I don't care if this costs me my
dialog: life...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: You will pay for this!
dialog: 62
dialog: 
text: The C-PRINCE rides in (with the other SLIPPER), followed by
text: his RETINUE. The STEWARD takes the opportunity to pull the
text: slipper from the WIFE'S hand as she curtsies.
speaker_heading: STEWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Sire! I have succeeded in obtaining
text: the other slipper.
text: He holds it up. The WIFE steps forward.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Please give me the slipper, kind
dialog: Prince, and all will come to a happy
dialog: end.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
speaker_heading: (OVERLAPPING)
dialog: Step back, peon!
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Do as she says, Steward. We only need
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Oh...
text: He hands the slipper back to the WIFE. The STEWARD gets onto
dialog: his horse.
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: (to C'S PRINCE)
dialog: Thank you. Thank you!
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
speaker_heading: (TO STEWARD)
dialog: We must search immediately for the
dialog: maiden who fits this slipper.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: Tonight?
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: This very night!
text: The PRINCE, STEWARD and RETINUE ride off, leaving the WIFE
text: alone. She looks up to the moon and hurries off.
text: We follow the WIFE'S feet as she scurries past the beginnings
text: of a BEANSTALK CURLING UPWARDS from the ground.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: And in her haste, the Baker's Wife
text: took no notice of a second beanstalk
text: climbing skyward.
dialog: 63
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: TRUMPETS sound. The C-PRINCE, the STEWARD and the RETINUE
text: ride through the town, as VILLAGERS open their windows and
text: rush out of their houses.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Let it be known that his Royal
dialog: Highness the Crown Prince will be
dialog: visiting every house in this village
dialog: tonight.
scene_heading: INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: CINDERELLA has only just got back. Grubby again, and wearing
text: her old clothes, she bundles her beautiful dress into a
dialog: chest.
speaker_heading: STEWARD (O.S.)
dialog: All young maidens are hereby commanded
dialog: to remain in their home until they are
text: visited by the Royal Guard.
text: CINDERELLA goes to the window and looks out.
scene_heading: EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: CINDERELLA'S POV: The C-PRINCE and the royal RETINUE arrive
text: in the entry courtyard.
text: BACK ON CINDERELLA. She smiles to herself.
scene_heading: INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: The entire STEPFAMILY has assembled, in various stages of
text: undress. LUCINDA stands and watches as the STEPMOTHER tries
text: to force FLORINDA'S large foot into the tiny slipper.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: As the Prince anxiously waited, the
dialog: Stepmother took matters -- and
text: Florinda's foot -- into her own hands.
speaker_heading: FLORINDA
dialog: CAREFUL, MY TOE--!
speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
scene_heading: DARLING, I KNOW--
speaker_heading: FLORINDA
dialog: WHAT'LL WE DO?
speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
dialog: IT'LL HAVE TO GO./ BUT WHEN YOU'RE HIS
dialog: BRIDE,/ YOU CAN SIT OR RIDE./ YOU'LL
dialog: NEVER NEED TO WALK!
text: The STEPMOTHER takes a handkerchief and stuffs it into the
text: girl's mouth and then pulls a large kitchen knife from her
text: pocket and raises it over her foot--
dialog: 64
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - NIGHT
text: Standing lanterns have been set up outside the house, bathing
text: the area in light.
text: The STEPFAMILY watches as the STEWARD helps FLORINDA up on to
text: the back of the Prince's horse. In pain, she grits her teeth
text: in a frozen smile.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: Minus one toe, Florinda mounted the
text: Prince's horse, unaware of the blood
text: dripping from the slipper.
text: As the STEWARD steps back, he notices a tiny speck of blood
text: on his white glove. He looks up to the PRINCE to show him his
text: hand. The PRINCE looks back to FLORINDA who shrugs
text: sheepishly.
scene_heading: INT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: This time the STEPMOTHER tries to force LUCINDA'S foot into
text: the slipper. FLORINDA looks on with a smirk.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: Lucinda was next.
speaker_heading: LUCINDA
dialog: WHY WON'T IT FIT?
speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
scene_heading: DARLING, BE STILL./ CUT OFF A BIT/
text: OF THE HEEL AND IT WILL./
dialog: (she pulls out knife)
dialog: AND WHEN YOU'RE HIS WIFE/ YOU'LL HAVE
dialog: SUCH A LIFE,/ YOU'LL NEVER NEED TO
speaker_heading: WALK!
speaker_heading: QUICK SHOTS:
text: FLORINDA'S hand over LUCINDA'S mouth.
text: The KNIFE raised up by the mother.
text: LUCINDA'S eyes in fear as we hear a muffled scream and the
dialog: "WOOSH" of a knife--
scene_heading: EXT. CINDERELLA'S HOUSE - ENTRY COURTYARD - NIGHT
text: The PRINCE and STEWARD wait impatiently in the torchlight.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
text: Minus a heel, Lucinda did her best to
dialog: swallow the pain.
text: At last, LUCINDA appears, masking her pain with a smile, and
text: limps towards the PRINCE. She is followed by her MOTHER and
speaker_heading: SISTER.
dialog: 65
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
dialog: It's a perfect fit, Your Highness!
text: LUCINDA winks at the PRINCE flirtatiously, then promptly
text: faints to the ground with a thud. The shoe falls from her
text: foot. The PRINCE nods to the STEWARD who walks over and
text: gingerly picks up the bloody slipper.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Have you no other daughters?
speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
text: Only a little stunted kitchen wench,
dialog: which her late father left behind but
text: she cannot present herself. She is too
dialog: dirty.
text: Out of the shadows, CINDERELLA appears.
text: The STEWARD hands the slipper to the Prince, who kneels down
text: in front of CINDERELLA and easily slips it on her foot.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: I would recognize these beautiful eyes
dialog: anywhere. This is the true bride!
text: The PRINCE sweeps CINDERELLA off her feet and leads her to
text: his horse. The two of them ride off.
text: FLORINDA and LUCINDA watch, not at all happy. Then they hear
text: a CAWING (the sound of birds) overhead. They look up,
dialog: alarmed.
text: BIRD'S POV. Far below, FLORINDA and LUCINDA cower together,
text: dreading what is to come as the CAMERA rushes towards them.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: As punishment for their cruelty,
text: Cinderella's birds swooped down upon
text: the Stepsisters... and blinded them.
text: The BIRDS enter the picture frame, more and more, their
text: CAWING rising to a crescendo until their flapping wings are
dialog: all we see.
scene_heading: EXT. MARSHLAND - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: RAPUNZEL is alone in a mossy bower on an isolated island in
text: the middle of swamp waters filled with POISONOUS SNAKES. She
text: hums a sad refrain.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: As for Rapunzel, the Witch had
text: banished her to a swamp in the darkest
text: depths of the forest.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE. The R-PRINCE with a ragged scarf wrapped
text: around his now blinded eyes, sits slumped over on his horse
text: as the animal navigates its way through the marshy expanse.
text: The R-PRINCE lifts his head as he hears RAPUNZEL'S singing.
dialog: 66
dialog: 
text: Could it be? The horse, seemingly knowing the way, follows
text: the sound as the R-PRINCE calls her name.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: Rapunzel? Rapunzel?
scene_heading: ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL
text: She looks up and cries with delight when she sees her PRINCE
text: across the water.
speaker_heading: RAPUNZEL
dialog: My darling!
text: She jumps into the swamp, fearlessly ignoring the SNAKES,
text: until she reaches terra firma and her man.
text: R-PRINCE falls from his horse onto the ground.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: Rapunzel? Is it you?
text: RAPUNZEL reaches him and rips off his scarf. She kneels to
text: cradle his face, weeping.
speaker_heading: RAPUNZEL
dialog: How could she do this to you?
scene_heading: EXTREME CLOSE-UP: RAPUNZEL'S TEAR falls into the R-PRINCE'S
text: blind eye.
text: The PRINCE'S vision is restored.
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
speaker_heading: (ASTONISHED)
dialog: Rapunzel!
speaker_heading: RAPUNZEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: R'S PRINCE
dialog: I can see you!
text: The two of them embrace. At the same time, we hear MOOING.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT
text: The BAKER is pulling a very obstinate WHITE COW through the
text: woods. He looks up at the MOON which is almost completely
text: covered in SHADOW.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: (to the COW)
dialog: Come on! We don't have any time...
text: Then the WIFE rushes in from another direction, carrying the
speaker_heading: SLIPPER.
dialog: 67
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I've found you!
dialog: (sees the cow)
dialog: You've got the cow!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You've got the slipper!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: We've all four!
text: They hug with delight but are quickly startled by the WITCH
text: who appears in the hollow of a tree.
speaker_heading: WITCH
text: I see a cow. I see a slipper.
speaker_heading: BAKER
text: And the cape as red as blood.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: And the hair as yellow as corn.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: We've done it!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: We've got them all.
text: But suddenly the WITCH is suspicious.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Wait a minute!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: That cow doesn't look as white as milk
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Of course she is.
text: A desperate glance at the BAKER. He couldn't have screwed
dialog: this up -- could he?
speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
dialog: She has to be!
text: The WITCH walks over and smacks the animal. Flour puffs off
dialog: its back.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: This cow has been covered with flour!
speaker_heading: WIFE
speaker_heading: (To the BAKER)
dialog: What? You didn't get a real white cow?
text: The BAKER turns to the WITCH.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: We had a cow as white as milk.
dialog: Honestly we did.
dialog: 68
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Then where is she?
speaker_heading: WIFE
text: She's dead.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: And we thought you'd prefer a live
dialog: cow.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Of course I'd prefer a live cow! So
dialog: show me the dead cow and I'll bring
dialog: her back to life!
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - COW'S GRAVE - NIGHT
text: JACK'S MOTHER is madly hurrying through the woods, searching
text: for JACK. She hears HARP MUSIC -- and that carries her to
text: JACK, sitting with his harp next to the mound where
text: MILKY-WHITE has been covered with LEAVES.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: Jack! There you are! I've been worried
dialog: sick about you! There's a dead giant
dialog: in our backyard!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: There is?
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: You know there is. You could have been
dialog: crushed!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: But Mother, look. The most beautiful
dialog: harp.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
speaker_heading: (CONFLICTED)
dialog: You've stolen too much.
text: She cuffs the back of his head... then hugs him.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
dialog: You could have been killed coming down
dialog: that plant.
text: The WITCH, the BAKER and the WIFE hurry towards the leafy
dialog: mound.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: We're running out of time!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: It's here...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's happening?
dialog: 69
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: She's going to bring Milky-White back
dialog: to life.
speaker_heading: JACK
speaker_heading: (AMAZED)
dialog: She can do that?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: She's a witch! She can do anything!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wow!
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Stand back!
text: They quickly move away, and the WITCH invokes some
text: unintelligible incantation, and with the wave of her cape,
text: the DEAD COW comes back to life, shaking off the leaves.
text: JACK races over to her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Milky-White. You're back! I missed you
dialog: so much!
text: The BAKER looks up at the MOON...only a slither left, the
text: rest covered by SHADOW.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: It's almost midnight!
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Quiet! Feed the objects to the cow.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: You heard me! Feed them to the cow!
text: The WIFE and BAKER walk towards the COW and begin feeding it
dialog: a portion of the ingredients. Not an easy chew for the
dialog: animal.
text: The WITCH hands them a silver chalice.
speaker_heading: WITCH (CONT'D)
dialog: Fill this!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'll do it. She'll only milk for me.
text: JACK begins milking the cow, the others watching intently,
dialog: but alas, nothing is coming out.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Squeeze, pal! You can do it.
dialog: 70
dialog: 
text: He tries harder to no avail. The WITCH goes over and looks
text: into the goblet. Nothing.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Wrong ingredients. Forget about a
dialog: child!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Wait! We followed your instructions.
text: One, the cow is as white as milk.
dialog: Correct?
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: And two, the cape was certainly as red
dialog: as blood.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: And three, the slipper--
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: And four, I compared the hair with
dialog: this ear of corn.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I pulled it from a maiden in a tower
dialog: AND--
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: You what?! What were you doing there?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Well, nothing. I happened to be
scene_heading: PASSING BY--
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: I touched that hair! I told you! I
dialog: cannot have touched the ingredients!
speaker_heading: BAKER/WIFE
speaker_heading: (MOANING)
dialog: Nooooo...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The corn! The corn!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What?
text: JACK grabs the ear of corn out of the BAKER'S hand.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You can use the silky hair of the corn--
dialog: 71
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Yes! Pull it from the ear and feed it
dialog: to the cow. Quickly!
text: The BAKER grabs the ear of corn from JACK, pulls the hair
text: from the corn and feeds it to the cow.
text: JACK begins milking the cow again. We hear the distant CHIMES
text: OF MIDNIGHT begin.
text: Light pours from above bathing them in a growing haze of BLUE
text: LIGHT as the SHADOW finally eclipses the MOON. The COW lets
text: out a BLOODCURDLING MOAN.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: It's working!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: She's milking!
text: The WITCH grabs the chalice.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: At last!
text: The WITCH drinks the potion. She begins to shake. Blue smoke
text: begins to pour from her and swirl about as if she is trapped
text: inside a cloud. The WIFE lets out a shriek..
text: The BAKER looks at his WIFE, her belly begins to grow to nine-
dialog: months-full of pregnancy.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: That was quick!
text: The cloud that has surrounded the WITCH now engulfs the area
text: until a brisk wind blows it away, revealing a beautiful woman
text: standing in the BLUE LIGHT of the FULL MOON. The WITCH has
text: been restored to her former self, and she likes what she
dialog: sees.
text: The final CHIME OF MIDNIGHT is joined by every other BELL IN
text: THE KINGDOM -- a joyous cacophony as we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD TO KING'S CASTLE/KING'S CASTLE - A NEW DAY
text: GOLDEN ROSE PETALS fill the air, swirling across the screen.
text: PULLING BACK we see that the petals are being thrown by
text: CHEERING SUBJECTS who toss more into the air as they clamor
text: to catch a glimpse of CINDERELLA and her PRINCE on their
dialog: wedding day.
text: MUSIC. CINDERELLA'S carriage resplendent in gold drawn by
text: black stallions passes. She sits demurely smiling as her
text: PRINCE plays to the PASSERS-BY. This comes easily to him.
dialog: 72
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: And it came to pass, all that seemed
dialog: wrong was now right. The Witch
dialog: succeeded in reversing her mother's
dialog: curse. Cinderella finally stopped
dialog: running from her Prince.
text: CINDERELLA'S POV on the crowd.
text: She sees JACK and his MOTHER waving; JACK'S MOTHER is over-
text: dressed in brand new clothes including a ridiculous
dialog: "fascinator" hat.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: Jack was reunited with his beloved cow
dialog: and his mother could now dress in the
dialog: best a golden egg could buy.
text: Cinderella now sees the BAKER and his WIFE standing amongst
text: the crowd, the WIFE holding their new BABY BOY.
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: And the Baker and his Wife were proud
text: parents of a strapping baby boy.
text: The WIFE shows her the BABY.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (calling to her)
dialog: Thanks for the slipper.
text: The carriage arrives at the entrance to the castle. As the
text: PRINCE and CINDERELLA step from their carriage they are met
text: by cheers.
text: The STEPFAMILY awaits the married couple. The beaming
text: STEPMOTHER with her DAUGHTERS who are now wearing dark
text: glasses, holding canes and looking rather glum.
text: RAPUNZEL stands with her PRINCE.
text: The CROWD ROARS as CINDERELLA and her PRINCE wave.
text: The STEWARD takes up a large speaking trumpet and the CROWD
dialog: quiets.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: Let us cheer the newlyweds as they
dialog: embark on their happy bliss today, and
scene_heading: EVER AFTER--
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: And so with the kingdom filled with
dialog: joy, those who deserved to were
dialog: destined to live happily ever...
dialog: 73
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the earth SHAKES with a mighty force, tossing
text: CINDERELLA and her PRINCE (mid-kiss), along with their
text: ATTENDANTS and the entire CROWD to the ground. A piece of the
text: CASTLE comes CRASHING DOWN. Chaos ensues.
text: JACK'S MOTHER stands up and looks around. No sign of JACK.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: Jack? Jack...?
text: ANGLE ON BAKER and his WIFE.
speaker_heading: BAKER
speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: Are you alright?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: And the baby?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Yes, he's fine.
text: There is another AFTERSHOCK.
text: ANGLE ON RAPUNZEL. She is spooked by the commotion and runs
text: off through the crowd and disappears.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: (speaking into the
speaker_heading: HORN)
dialog: Attention! Attention! Let there be no
dialog: panic. NO PANIC! The Royal Prince
dialog: wishes to address his loyal subjects.
dialog: Attention!
text: The R-PRINCE searches the crowd for RAPUNZEL. Those who
text: haven't fled, quiet and gather around. The C-PRINCE takes the
dialog: horn.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: There's no need for worry. It was an
text: earthquake in a far-off quadrant of
dialog: our kingdom. Nothing to fear at all.
dialog: As many of you know, we had another
dialog: little shaker just days ago. I will
dialog: personally investigate the
dialog: disturbance. Now everyone, back to
dialog: your villages, and on with your lives!
scene_heading: EXT. KINGDOM - DAY
text: A dense mist settles across the kingdom. In the distance a
text: beanstalk stretches up to the sky. C'S PRINCE and his RETINUE
text: gallop away from the destroyed castle into the woods.
dialog: 74
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER (V.O.)
dialog: But as they made their way back into
text: the woods, their familiar paths were
dialog: nowhere to be found and their lives
text: were about to take an unexpected turn.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - FLOWERED PATH - DAY
text: The BAKER and his WIFE are walking down a path -- or the
text: remnants of a path.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What's happened? Everything's so
dialog: different.
text: They discover LRRH sitting on her suitcase in what was once a
text: lush area, now trampled and broken.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Hello, little one. Are you alright?
dialog: What are you doing here? With a
dialog: suitcase?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: I'm moving in with Granny. Our whole
dialog: village collapsed. I couldn't find my
dialog: mother anywhere. And now I can't find
dialog: my Granny's cottage.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: I went down the dell, and I didn't
dialog: recognize anything. There was no path.
dialog: (getting worked up)
dialog: Where's the stream? Where's the
dialog: bridge? Where's Granny?
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Calm down.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: We can help you find Granny's without
dialog: the path.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Yes.
text: The WIFE is exhausted. She hands the BABY to the BAKER.
speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
dialog: Please take him for a few moments.
text: The BAKER is clearly uncomfortable holding the BABY. They
text: continue walking. The BABY begins to cry.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Why does he always cry when I hold
dialog: him?
dialog: 75
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: You needn't hold him as if he was so
dialog: fragile.
text: The BABY wails. The BAKER hands the bundle back.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: He doesn't want me. He wants his
dialog: mother!
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: I can't take care of him all of the
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: I'll take care of him -- when he's
dialog: older...
text: They hear COMMOTION in the distance.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: Who might that be?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: It's the Steward and the royal family.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - DAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Through a thick haze, the BAKER sees the STEWARD, the
text: STEPFAMILY and a few SERVANTS carrying trunks and tending to
text: the blind, hobbling STEPSISTERS.
text: The BAKER makes his way to them with his WIFE and LRRH in
dialog: tow.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What brings you into the woods?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
text: The castle has been destroyed.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
text: The kingdom is under attack.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: What is the Royal family going to do?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: I have no idea! I don't make policy. I
dialog: just carry it out.
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: (to the Baker)
dialog: I think it best we get back to the
dialog: village. We'll take the girl with us.
text: She holds out a hand for LRRH.
dialog: 76
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
dialog: You come with us.
text: LRRH takes her hand.
text: But then the ground begins to shake. A frightening and
text: increasingly loud crunching noise. They fight for their
dialog: footing.
text: The STEPFAMILY drop their belongings and rush to each other.
text: The BAKER puts his arm around his WIFE.
text: Everyone's faces fill with terror as a huge shadow engulfs
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: WIFE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a giant!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: A giant woman!
text: Through the trees we see the furious face of a female GIANT.
dialog: We never see her in her entirety -- but the volume of her
text: voice matches her size.
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: Where is the lad who killed my
dialog: husband?
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: There is no lad here!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: We haven't seen him.
text: The WITCH, who has slipped in behind the group, comes forward
text: startling everyone and moves directly to the GIANT.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: We'll get him for you right away.
dialog: Don't move!
text: LRRH races past the WITCH and brandishes her knife.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: It was you who destroyed our house -
dialog: not an earthquake.
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: And who destroyed my house? I want
dialog: him!
text: A great bellow that makes the trees shake.
text: The WITCH moves towards the STEPSISTERS.
speaker_heading: WITCH
dialog: Would you like a blind girl instead?
dialog: 77
dialog: 
text: FLORINDA and LUCINDA scream. The STEPMOTHER takes them in her
dialog: embrace.
speaker_heading: STEPMOTHER
dialog: How dare you? She wants the boy!
text: And then JACK'S MOTHER arrives. Innocently, she asks the
dialog: worst question possible.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: Jack! Has anyone seen my Jack? He ran
dialog: off again and I've been...
text: Everyone stares at her. JACK'S MOTHER does a slow take
text: looking up and discovering the GIANT.
speaker_heading: STEWARD
speaker_heading: (meaning the GIANT)
text: She's looking for him too.
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: Give him to me!
text: The GIANT suddenly reaches down. They all quickly duck out of
dialog: the way.
text: JACK'S MOTHER runs forward to confront the GIANT.
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: Jack is just a lad! We had no food to
dialog: eat so he sold his beloved cow in
dialog: exchange for magic beans.
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: The boy - I want the boy!
speaker_heading: JACK'S MOTHER
dialog: You leave my boy alone!
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: You're making me very angry!
text: The GIANT stomps her foot in anger.
speaker_heading: GIANT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WIFE

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Away from here.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: But you said we had to find our way

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: It doesn't matter whether we're

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: We need your help.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You don't understand. My wife was the

speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER (O.S.)

speaker_heading: BAKER

dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't want to talk to you. It's
dialog: because of you all of this happened.
dialog: Go away!
speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER
dialog: I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Why would you do that? Why did you
dialog: take the Witch's beans?
speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER
dialog: They were there and I wanted them. I
dialog: didn't think. I was being careless --
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: -- Selfish.
speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER
speaker_heading: YES --
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You stole them and you were caught,
dialog: and then you did what you do. You just
dialog: ran away.
speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER
dialog: When your mother died, I was... I
dialog: hated myself and I ran from my guilt
dialog: and my shame...
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: ... and your son.
speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER
dialog: Yes, and my son. And I'm sorry for
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: If you're looking for forgiveness,

speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER
dialog: I never expected...
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Then what do you want?
dialog: 98

speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER

speaker_heading: BAKER'S FATHER (CONT'D)

dialog: (the Baker looks
speaker_heading: AWAY)
dialog: Be better than me, son. Do better...
text: The BAKER turns to look at his FATHER, but he is gone. Was he
dialog: ever there?
text: The BAKER walks angrily along an overgrown path through the

text: his wife's scarf in his hands.
text: Slowly he calms himself.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT
text: JACK and LRRH are making a plan. CINDERELLA has the BABY.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: If there were just some way we could
dialog: surprise the Giant.
speaker_heading: LRRH
text: She's too tall to surprise.
text: They look up as a newly determined BAKER returns.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I knew you wouldn't give up.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: He wouldn't leave his baby.
speaker_heading: LRRH
text: It looked like he was going to.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Give me my son.
text: The BAKER takes the BABY. The baby begins to cry.
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: (pulling the baby
dialog: close to comfort
speaker_heading: HIM)
dialog: Hey, hey.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: What are we going to do now?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: We need to rid this kingdom of the

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 99
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: She'll be back soon; here's the plan.
dialog: We're going to feed Jack to the Giant.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JACK CINDERELLA
dialog: What? No!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to use you as bait to lure

text: Suddenly a swarm of BIRDS appears overhead.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: The birds can help!
speaker_heading: (TO BIRDS)
dialog: Oh good friends we need your help more
dialog: than ever.
speaker_heading: (BIRDS CHIRP)
dialog: What of the prince?
text: She looks to the BAKER awkwardly. Then resolute...
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: That doesn't matter now! What's
dialog: important is that we find a way to
dialog: defeat the Giant.
speaker_heading: (BIRDS CHIRP)
dialog: Oh yes, thank you birds.
text: The BIRDS fly off. The others look at her with amazement.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: You can talk to birds?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: The birds will do their part.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Okay, we don't have much time.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm excited.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Here's what we're going to do...
text: The BAKER leads them away from the tar pit.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: CINDERELLA settles the baby.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Your father's being very brave. We're
dialog: going to be very brave too.

text: when he sees CINDERELLA.
dialog: 100
dialog: 
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
speaker_heading: (CALLING OVER)
dialog: Are you alright, miss?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: (hiding her face)
dialog: The Giant went in that direction.
text: He rides closer.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: My darling!
speaker_heading: (DISMOUNTS)
dialog: I did not recognize you. What are you
dialog: doing here? And with a child? You must
dialog: go back to the castle at once. There's
text: a giant on the loose.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I'm well aware of that.
text: He comes and puts his arm around her, but she pulls away.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: My love. What is it?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Maybe I'm not your only love.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I love you. Truly I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: If you love me, why did you stray?
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: I thought if you were mine, that I
dialog: would never wish for more.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: If this is how you behave as a prince,
dialog: what kind of king will you be?
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: I was raised to be charming, not
dialog: sincere.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I think you should go.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: I'm not going to leave you.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Consider that I've been lost. A victim
dialog: of the Giant.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: Is that what you really wish?
dialog: 101
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: My father's house was a nightmare.
dialog: Your house was a dream. Now I want
text: something in-between.
text: She takes off her wedding ring and gives it back to him. He
text: stands there for a moment, then mounts his horse.
speaker_heading: C'S PRINCE
dialog: I shall always love the maiden who ran
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: And I the faraway prince.

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: ANGLE ON A TREE BY THE TAR PIT
text: The BAKER is scaling his way up the tall tree. JACK follows
text: him, each carrying slings and stones. A branch gives way
text: under JACK but he is able to keep his balance.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Careful, there. Not so fast.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You needn't worry -- this is easier
text: than a beanstalk.
text: ANGLE ON CINDERELLA. She's sitting on a tree stump, rocking
text: the baby. LRRH returns.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: They're in the tree -- over there. We
dialog: made slings out of my cape.
text: LRRH sits next to CINDERELLA.
speaker_heading: LRRH (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: I'm glad you're here to help me.
text: LRRH turns her head away.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: I think my mother and my Granny would
dialog: be upset with me.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Why?
dialog: 102
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: They said always to make them proud
dialog: and here I am about to kill somebody.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Not somebody. A giant who's done a lot
dialog: of harm.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: But a giant's a person. Aren't we to
dialog: show forgiveness?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
scene_heading: MOTHER CANNOT GUIDE YOU./ NOW YOU'RE

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Wait until my mother hears I've slain

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Jack, there's something you have to
dialog: know. Your mother...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: She didn't make it.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Was she killed by the Giant?
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: No. It wasn't like that. She was
text: fighting with the Giant, trying to
dialog: protect you, and she was pushed by the
dialog: Steward -- and -- she fell.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: The Steward will pay for this.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: No, Jack --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: After we slay the Giant, I will slay
dialog: him.
dialog: 103
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: You'll do nothing of the kind.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What he done was wrong. He should be

speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: It's not as easy as that.

text: They're interrupted by the ominous sounds of the approaching
speaker_heading: GIANT.
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Here she comes!
text: ANGLE ON JACK AND THE BAKER.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Go, Jack! Be careful.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE GIANT'S FEET
text: Destroying everything in its path.
text: ANGLE ON JACK, as he scurries up higher in the tree.
dialog: 105
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDE SHOT
text: The GIANT approaches LRRH and CINDERELLA.
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: Where is the boy?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: We have him.
speaker_heading: GIANT
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: LRRH
speaker_heading: (POINTS)
dialog: He's hiding in that tree!
text: JACK pops up and reveals himself at the top of the tree.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here I am!
text: The GIANT begins to move aggressively towards JACK.
text: JACK and the BAKER load their slings.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: (calling up to JACK)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ready!
text: ANGLE on the GIANT'S feet, trampling everything in her path.
text: Suddenly, she steps into the expanse of the tar pit, which
text: slowly stops her in her tracks. She fights to free herself as
text: she begins to sink.
speaker_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS
text: -- The BIRDS fly from the trees.
text: -- BAKER'S POV through the tree branches as the BIRDS swarm
text: around the head of the GIANT.
text: -- CINDERELLA and LRRH watch and hear the GIANT'S screams.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Good birds!
speaker_heading: LRRH
text: She doesn't look happy.
text: -- the BAKER and JACK use their slings to fire stones at the
speaker_heading: GIANT.
text: -- JACK shimmies to the end of a high limb for better aim.
text: -- The GIANT reaches blindly towards JACK.
dialog: 106
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LRRH (CONT'D)
dialog: Look out Jack!
text: -- The GIANT seizes hold of the branch where JACK is standing
text: which knocks JACK off. JACK catches himself on the way down,
text: grabbing the branch, and hangs on for dear life. Using one
text: hand, JACK whirls his sling and delivers a knock-out blow to
text: the GIANT'S forehead.
text: -- The GIANT reacts and begins to sway.
text: BAKER'S POV of the GIANT'S eye as she fall towards him.
text: The GIANT'S hand grabs some tree branches, as she fights for
text: her balance. We hear the crackling branches as the GIANT
text: FALLS pulling the tree down with her, snapping it in a final
text: deafening THUD.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - TALL TREES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: CINDERELLA and LRRH run around the gigantic, exposed roots.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: LRRH
dialog: Jack? Mr. Baker?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: LRRH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO LRRH)

speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Oh, be careful, are you alright?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: He's not with you?
speaker_heading: LRRH

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Jack, Jack!
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Help me. Help me!
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: Jack, I'm here.
text: CINDERELLA helps JACK lift the tree branch as the BAKER,

text: scratched up, but relieved. CINDERELLA takes the BABY from
speaker_heading: LRRH.
speaker_heading: CINDERELLA
dialog: Let me take him.
speaker_heading: BAKER
dialog: (To Jack then LRRH)
dialog: Are you okay? Are you alright? We did
dialog: it! We did it! Come here.
text: They embrace the BAKER. There's a moment of realization of
text: what just happened as they look up at the roots of the fallen
dialog: tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAKER (CONT'D)
dialog: Now we can all return home.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What home? I have no one to take care

speaker_heading: LRRH
speaker_heading: (to the BAKER)
dialog: And we have nowhere to go, so we'll

speaker_heading: BAKER

speaker_heading: (to the BABY)
