text: TO THIS DAY, ITS RECORDS REMAIN CLASSIFIED...
scene_heading: EXT. MONTAUK SKY - NIGHT
text: We FADE UP on the night sky. Dark clouds swallow the stars.
text: We hear a LOW-END RUMBLE. It sounds almost like thunder, only
text: it is somehow more alive. Like the growl of an unseen beast.
dialog: We TILT DOWN to find...
text: CAMP HERO MILITARY BASE. It is an imposing cement building in
text: a dense forest. A LONG-RANGE SEARCH RADAR DISH rotates atop

dialog: Superimpose titles:
scene_heading: CAMP HERO. MONTAUK, NEW YORK.
speaker_heading: OCTOBER 5. 1980.

dialog: We draw closer to this door...
dialog: And closer...
dialog: And...
text: WHOOM! THE DOOR SUDDENLY EXPLODES OPEN. THE HINGES SHRIEK.
text: A SCIENTIST staggers out into the corridor. He is gasping for

text: skin beneath; it is burned, shredded, bloody. His entire left
text: arm is missing.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: He collapses to the floor. Twitches. Stills. Dead.
text: His eyes remain open. Frozen in a look of sheer terror.
text: We continue past him...
dialog: Moving into...
text: A LABORATORY.
text: A DOZEN MORE SCIENTISTS lie dead on the ground.
text: They too, are burned; many also missing limbs. Some, heads.
text: We survey the lab around them. There are BULKY COMPUTERS,
text: MYSTERIOUS ANALOG EQUIPMENT, and most striking of all:
text: An ISOLATION TANK, an upright metal cylinder filled with
text: water. A tangle of electrical wires connect this tank to...
text: A METAL DOOR FRAME. The door leads nowhere; there is just
text: empty white space behind it. The base of the door is on fire.
text: We watch as this fire begins to spread across the lab.
text: The flames grow hotter...
dialog: And hotter...
dialog: And...
text: HISS! FIRE SPRINKLERS kick on.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
text: HISS! LAWN SPRINKLERS kick on.
text: We are now in a 1980s SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC. Quiet. Calm.
text: A row of uniform houses wind up the tree-lined street;

scene_heading: MONSTER MANUAL.
text: MIKE WHEELER, 12, is the “Dungeon Master.” He is a cute moppy

text: DUSTIN HENDERSON, 12, playing as a dwarf. He wears glasses,

scene_heading: THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Oh, yeah, I’m sure a growth spurt
dialog: will really do it for you, Lucas...
text: The boys bike out of the garage, arguing as they go. Mike
text: takes his hands off his ears. He can’t help but smile. Then:
text: BZZZZ2Z. The light above him begins to flicker. Strange.
text: Mike switches it off and heads back inside.
text: We return our gaze to the light.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: It sputters back on. And...
scene_heading: EXT. MONTAUK NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
text: WHOOSH! The boys bike home.
text: Their handlebar lights wink in the night. And good thing,
dialog: because it’s dark out here, as in, very dark. Montauk is
dialog: coastal, but it’s more akin to living out in the country.
text: Lucas peels off from the group.
speaker_heading: LUCAS
dialog: See ya, ladies.
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Kiss your mom ‘night for me.
text: Lucas flips him the bird and bikes up a driveway towards his
text: TWO-STORY HOUSE. Almost identical to Mike’s, a little larger.
text: Will and Dustin bike on in silence for a beat, then:
speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Race to my place? Loser gets a

speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Any comic?
speaker_heading: DUSTIN
dialog: Yeah --

speaker_heading: DUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: shit!

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST ROAD - LATER
text: Will is now biking along an empty forest road. All alone.
text: He lives much further out than the rest of his friends. It is
text: even darker out here and quiet; unnervingly so. Only the
text: sound of cicadas and a gentle breeze to keep him company.
text: He bikes past a LARGE METAL FENCE. A warning sign reads:
scene_heading: AUTHORIZED VEHICLES ONLY. NO TRESPASSING.
dialog: We’re near Camp Hero.
text: Will suddenly notices something strange: the hair on the back
text: of his arms is standing straight up. It’s like he’s in the
text: middle of a massive electrical storm. And perhaps he is...
text: A LOW-END RUMBLE reverberates above him. He looks up.
text: Sees nothing but darkness. Clouds over the moon.
text: He looks back down. His eyes shoot wide.
text: A TALL FIGURE STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.
dialog: 
text: Will spins the wheel -- loses control --
text: He veers off the road --
dialog: And explodes into --
text: THE FOREST.
text: The bike flies down a steep hill and --
text: CRASHES. Will flies off the bike. He skids, rolls, eats dirt.
text: As he lies there on the ground, gasping for air, he hears:
scene_heading: STRANGE GUTTURAL SOUNDS. COMING FROM BEHIND HIM.
text: He pushes to his feet and turns to the sound.
text: Foliage shudders. The sounds grow. Something is coming.
text: Will abandons his bike --
dialog: And _ runs.
scene_heading: EXT. MONTAUK BEACH -- NIGHT
text: Will bursts out onto the beach.
text: The wind whips his clothes. Waves crash the shore. Roaring.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER.
text: He races up a dune toward a house. His house.
text: It is small, lower class, and falling apart after decades of
text: abuse from the battering ocean winds. But it offers safety.
scene_heading: INT. THE BYERS HOUSE -- NIGHT
text: Will slams the door shut behind him and bolts the lock.
text: A shaggy mutt, CHESTER, races to greet him.
text: Will ignores him, calls for his family.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: MOM?! JONATHAN?! MOM?!
text: There is no answer.
text: He checks his MOM’S BEDROOM. His BROTHER’S BEDROOM.
text: No one is home. He is all alone.
scene_heading: INT. THE BYERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
text: Will scrambles back to the living room window.
text: He cups his hands to the glass and peers out into the yard.
text: It is dark. Murky. Quiet. A gust of wind blows and...
text: Day-old laundry flutters on a clothes line to reveal...
text: THAT FIGURE AGAIN. JUST STANDING THERE AMONGST THE BILLOWING
text: LAUNDRY. WE CAN'T MAKE OUT ANY FEATURES, BUT ITS PROPORTIONS
scene_heading: SEEM... OFF. ITS HEAD IS TOO LARGE. ITS ARMS TOO LONG. ITS
text: BODY SWOLEN AND BENT IN A STRANGE, TWISTED SHAPE.
text: Another gust of wind. The clothes flutters again and...
text: The Figure is gone.
text: Will pales. His heart in his throat.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Will rips a phone off the kitchen wall. Dials 911. But --
text: It does not ring. Just hums with LOW-END STATIC.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hello?! HELLO -- ?!
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 12.
text: Will pauses. He hears something on the other line. But not a
text: voice... it is that GUTTURAL SOUND he heard in the forest.
text: The pitch rises and falls, making a series of strange sounds.
dialog: Words? It is as if the figure... whoever... whatever it is...
text: is somehow speaking to him through the phone receiver.
text: Behind him, Chester begins to GROWL at the front door.
text: Will lowers the phone. And looks back at the door.
text: A SHADOW fills the crack at the base of the door.
text: And then somehow, impossibly, the chain bolt begins to slide
text: open, as if drawn by an invisible hand. The metal SHRIEKS.
text: Will drops the phone and --
scene_heading: EXT. BYERS HOUSE - NIGHT
text: WHOOM! Will explodes out the back screen door.
text: He sprints into an OLD WOODEN SHED and --
scene_heading: INT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER
text: WHAM! He slams the shed doors behind him. Breathing hard.
text: His eyes dart. Searching for something.
text: The shed is cluttered and dark, lit only by a NAKED LIGHT
text: BULB, hanging from the ceiling. The bulb buzzes, flickers.
text: At last he spots it:
scene_heading: AN OLD REMINGTON RIFLE. DUSTY. HANGING ON A WALL MOUNT.
text: Will yanks it down, retrieves a few AMMO SHELLS from a work
text: bench, and loads the rifle as fast as he can, which isn’t
text: very fast at all; he is so scared his hands sweat and shake.
scene_heading: THUD. THUD. THUD. HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ECHO. THEN GUTTURAL NOISES.
text: Will looks back to the shed doors. They shudder and moan.
text: And then, slowly... ever slowly... they begin to yawn open.
text: Will finishes loading the rifle. He snaps the chamber shut
text: and aims it at the door. The rifle trembles in his hands.
text: The shed doors slowly yawn open the rest of way.
text: It... whatever it is... enters the shed.
dialog: We still do not show it in full, but we catch glimpses of it
text: in the flickering light. Misshapen, withered, pale, slick.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 13.
text: Will doesn’t fire. He just stares. Paralyzed by fear.
text: The hairs on his arms stand up again.
text: His ears begin to drip blood.
text: And then his nose.
text: He fights tears.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: ...P-please --
text: A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING SOUND SUDDENLY FILLS THE SHED.
text: WE DON’T SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO WILL; WE JUST WATCH THAT NAKED
text: DANGLING LIGHT BULB. IT GLOWS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND
text: BRIGHTER, FILLING THE SHED WITH OVERWHELMING WHITE LIGHT. WE
text: THINK THE GLASS OF THE BULB IS GOING TO SHATTER BUT THEN --
text: The TERRIBLE SHRIEKING sound abruptly stops.
text: The bulb dims. Returning to normal wattage.
text: We pull away from the light.
text: The shed is empty.
text: Will has vanished.

scene_heading: INT. HOPPER’S HOUSE - MORNING

text: A hand smashes it, shutting it up. The hand belongs to:
text: JIM HOPPER, or “HOP,” early 40s. He is sprawled on a sofa,
text: shirtless, wearing only a pair of worn Levi jeans. His house
text: is a mess, cluttered with beer bottles, cigarette butts, and

text: A LOCAL NEWSMAN drones on a dusty eight-inch TV:
speaker_heading: NEWS ANCHORMAN
dialog: ...reports of surges and outages
dialog: across the county... we reached out

text: Hop sits up. A RAY OF SUN slices through blinds. Strikes him.

scene_heading: EXT. HOPPER’S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Hopper steps out onto a decrepit porch. Drags on a cigarette.
text: His shack-like house is perched on the shore of the beach.
text: The beach is deserted now; tourist season has come and gone.

text: And lastly, he clips on a GOLD BADGE. It reads:
scene_heading: MONTAUK POLICE. CHIEF.
scene_heading: MOMENTS LATER.
text: Hopper heads out the door. We watch through the smudged
