speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: What you are now witnessing is
dialog: footage never before seen by
text: civilized humanity: a lost world in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS
text: Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
text: one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
dialog: This lighter-than-air craft was
text: designed by Muntz himself, and is
dialog: longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
text: wagons placed end to end.
text: Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
text: and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: And here comes the adventurer now!
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Never apart from his faithful dogs,
dialog: Muntz conceived the craft for
dialog: canine comfort! It's a veritable
text: floating palace in the sky...
dialog: 
text: An opulent dining room.
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...complete with doggie bath and
text: mechanical canine walker.
dialog: 
text: One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a

speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
dialog: consider Muntz the bee's knees!
dialog: And how!
dialog: 
text: Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
dialog: "thumbs up" stance.
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: "Adventure is out there!"

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: Ooh!
text: Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: And golly, what a swell monster

text: Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: Scientists cry foul! The National

dialog: fabricating the skeleton!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG CARL
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other

speaker_heading: Carl GASPS.
dialog: 
text: Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield. He grimly
text: addresses the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
dialog: Paradise Falls and promises to
dialog: capture the beast... alive!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: I promise to capture the beast...
dialog: alive!
dialog: 
text: In the theater, young Carl smiles.
speaker_heading: MUNTZ

speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: What's wrong? Can't you talk?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE

speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: You know him.
text: Carl smiles excitedly.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
dialog: big, I'm going where he's going:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: It's like America... but south.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: (reading caption)
dialog: "Paradise Falls, a land lost in
dialog: time." I ripped this right out of
dialog: a library book.
dialog: 
text: Carl GASPS in horror.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,

dialog: falls. Who knows what lives up
dialog: there? And once I get there...
dialog: 
text: She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF

dialog: 
speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: Well, I'm saving these pages for
dialog: all the adventures I'm gonna have.
dialog: Only... I just don't know how I'm

speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE
dialog: That's it! You can take us there
dialog: in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.
dialog: Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross

dialog: Carl does.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ELLIE

speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Me! Me! I'll do it!

speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: This doesn't look like the city or

text: The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (to house)
dialog: Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
text: The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
text: flat-topped mountain on which they stand.
dialog: 
text: Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.
text: Carl stares. He can't believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Now, when you get up there, go
dialog: ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!
dialog: 
text: Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You on the porch yet?!
dialog: 
text: Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb.
text: He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: What? That's it?! I came all this

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: We could walk your house to the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Walk it?
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
dialog: We could walk it right over there.

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Now, we're gonna walk to the falls

text: Russell inspects his surroundings.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
speaker_heading: (DISTRACTED)
dialog: Uh-huh.

speaker_heading: CARL

dialog: 
text: Two dark shapes are chasing the prey. Each has a light.
dialog: Hunters.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS
text: The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal
text: cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.
dialog: 
text: The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS
text: The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a
text: sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each

dialog: 
text: They surround the prey. Escape looks impossible.
text: WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the

dialog: 
text: The dogs head off in pursuit.

speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: My elbow hurts and I have to go to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: CARL

text: He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand
text: and a pile of leaves in another.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: I've always wanted to try this!
dialog:

speaker_heading: RUSSELL (O.S.)

speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Huh? Tracks?!
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

dialog: Snipe!
text: The footprints continue for a time, then stop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Huh.
text: Russell munches on a chocolate bar.
dialog: 
text: Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him. He turns to look.

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: RUSSELL (O.S.)

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Alright, here goes. I never

dialog: There. I said it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: You've been camping before, haven't
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Well, never outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Well, why didn't you ask your Dad

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Why don't you try him sometime?

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

speaker_heading: CARL

dialog: 
text: Carl studies Russell's sad optimism. He looks at the missing

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: DUG

speaker_heading: RUSSELL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: Her house is over there in those

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: She has been gathering food for her

dialog:

speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But
dialog: you promised to protect her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Her babies need her, we gotta make
dialog: sure they're together.

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: VOICE

speaker_heading: MUNTZ

speaker_heading: MUNTZ
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MUNTZ

speaker_heading: MUNTZ

speaker_heading: MUNTZ (cont'd)

dialog: dogs...
text: Muntz is lost in reverie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: And here they come, these bandits,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: That's the best one yet. I can't
dialog: wait to hear how it ends.
text: Carl glances around nervously.
dialog: 
text: Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE
speaker_heading: BIRD!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Well! It's been a wonderful
dialog: evening, but we'd better be going.
dialog: 
text: Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table.
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: Oh, you're not leaving?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We don't want to take advantage of
dialog: your hospitality. Come on Russell.
dialog: 
text: Carl leads Russell toward the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: But we haven't even had dessert
dialog: yet.
dialog: 
text: Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: No, the boy's right. You haven't
dialog: had dessert. Epsilon here makes a
dialog: delicious Cherries Jubilee.
dialog: 
text: Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like
text: something out of a bad dream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: Oh, you really must stay. I
dialog: insist! We have so much more to
dialog: talk about!
dialog: 
text: A distant HAUNTED WAIL. Everyone stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Kevin?
text: Muntz walks to the window and looks out. Atop the roof he
text: sees THE BIRD.
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: It's here.
text: He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: (to dogs)
dialog: Get them!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CAVE
dialog: 
text: Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hurry!
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: I am hurrying!
dialog: 
text: Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: They're coming!
dialog: 
text: Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening.
text: Dogs block the cave opening. Carl stops short.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUG (O.S.)
dialog: Master, over here!
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave. Carl
text: and Russell run toward him.
dialog: 
text: The cave leads to a steep incline. The dogs are getting
dialog: closer.
text: There's no choice but to JUMP.
dialog: 
text: The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell
text: to leap down the incline, like astronauts.
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: Go toward the light, master!
text: Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.
dialog: 
text: The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts
text: Carl and Russell on her back.
text: She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.
text: Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.
dialog: 
text: BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the
text: ceiling. The house lowers.
dialog: 
text: Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the
text: house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto
dialog: the ground.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Russell!
dialog: 
text: Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS
text: The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels.
text: Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Get back!!
text: Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
text: down! The dogs stop short.
dialog: 
text: Carl looks back as the bird keeps running. Dug is up on the
dialog: canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: Go on Master! I will stop the
dialog: dogs!
text: Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: Stop you dogs!!
dialog: 
text: The dogs run around Dug.
dialog: 
text: Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.
dialog: 
text: The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind. She
text: rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.
dialog: 
text: The bird jumps from rock spire to spire. Russell swings back
text: and forth wildly in the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Help! Help!
dialog: 
text: Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Gimme your hand!
text: Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
text: PULLS him back onto the bird.
text: Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
text: to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE. A river winds
text: 100 feet below.
dialog: 
text: Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Hang on to Kevin!
dialog: 
text: Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.
dialog: 
text: Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries
text: them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but
text: is kicked loose and falls into the river below.
dialog: 
text: Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm. The dogs
text: are stuck on the other side.
text: Carl painfully gets up. He looks up at his house. It's
text: still intact.
dialog: 
text: He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL (O.S.)
dialog: Kevin!
dialog: 
text: The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back
text: to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite. She
dialog: can't stand.
dialog: 
text: Russell applies a bandage.
dialog: 
text: From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.
text: Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.
dialog: 
text: Russell runs to her side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
dialog: (to Carl)
dialog: She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
dialog: her get home?
dialog: 
text: Carl looks at the bird's wounds. He looks to the rock maze,
text: then to his house.
text: He knows the right thing to do. And he hates himself for it.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Alright. But we've got to hurry.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT
dialog: 
text: Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz.
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: You lost them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETA
dialog: Uh, it was Dug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAMMA
dialog: Yeah, he's with them. He helped

dialog: 
text: Muntz snarls in anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: Wait. Wait a minute. Dug...
dialog: 
text: He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on
dialog: Dug's location.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.
dialog: 
text: Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: See anything?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: No, my pack is not following us!
dialog: Boy they are dumb.
text: Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
text: from behind a tree canopy.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: This is crazy. I finally meet my
text: childhood hero and he's trying to
dialog: kill us! What a joke.
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel
text: walks up to a tree and says I
dialog: forgot to store acorns for winter
dialog: and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
dialog: because the squirrel gets dead.
text: They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Careful Russell.
text: The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
dialog: porch.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: You okay, Kevin?
text: Kevin goes back to sleep. Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
dialog: The wilderness isn't quite what I
dialog: expected.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yeah? How so?
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
dialog: not how they made it sound in my
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hmm, get used to that, kid.
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: My dad made it sound so easy. He's
dialog: really good at camping, and how to
dialog: make fire from rocks and stuff. He
dialog: used to come to all my Sweatlodge
dialog: meetings.
dialog: 
text: Russell smiles at the thought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: And afterwards we'd go get ice
dialog: cream at Fentons. I always get
dialog: chocolate and he gets butter-
dialog: brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
dialog: curb, right outside, and I'll count
dialog: all the blue cars and he counts all
dialog: the red ones, and whoever gets the
dialog: most, wins. I like that curb.
text: He looks up at Carl.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: That might sound boring, but I
dialog: think the boring stuff is the stuff
dialog: I remember the most.
text: They walk in silence. Carl understands.
dialog: 
text: The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance. Kevin CALLS BACK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Look, there it is!
dialog: 
text: Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by. He tries to run
text: but is pulled back by his tether.
dialog: 
text: LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Hold on Russell, stand still!
dialog: 
text: Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.
text: Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward
text: the labyrinth entrance.
dialog: 
text: Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies. She runs
text: off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Look at that bird go!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Wait up, you overgrown chicken!
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: That's it, go Kevin! Go find your
dialog: babies!
dialog: 
text: Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce
text: spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Run Kevin! Run!
dialog: 
text: A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Oh no!
dialog: 
text: The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Russell, give me your knife!
dialog: 
text: Carl saws frantically at the net.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ (O.S.)
dialog: Get away from my bird!
dialog: 
text: Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible. Beside them,
text: a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.
dialog: 
text: Muntz hurls a lit lantern. Flames burst up beneath the house.
dialog: 
text: Heat waves ripple up. Balloons POP. Carl's house LOWERS
text: into the fire.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Carl panics. He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.
dialog: 
text: Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking
text: him down and grabbing the bird in the net.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: No!
text: Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the
text: dirigible.
dialog: 
text: Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUNTZ
dialog: Careful. We want her in good shape
dialog: for my return.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Let her go! Stop!
dialog: 
text: Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.
text: The dirigible flies off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: Kevin!
text: Carl beats out the flames with his jacket. He extinguishes
text: the flames.
dialog: 
text: Carl collapses on the side of his house.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: You gave away Kevin. You just gave
dialog: her away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: This is none of my concern. I
dialog: didn't ask for any of this!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUG
dialog: Master. It's alright.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I am not your master! And if you
dialog: hadn't a shown up, none of this
dialog: would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
dialog: dog!
dialog: 
text: Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.
text: Carl angrily puts on the harness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Now, whether you assist me or not,
dialog: I am going to Paradise Falls if it
dialog: kills me.
dialog: 
text: He walks off. Russell falls in behind.
text: An angry dawn breaks.
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky
dialog: landscape.
dialog: 
text: Russell's harness drags along side, empty.
dialog: 
text: Russell walks behind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place.
text: The house groans as it comes to rest.
dialog: 
text: Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING
dialog: 
text: He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls.
text: Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.
dialog: 
text: Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing. Next to him stands
dialog: the real house, just like Ellie wanted.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL (O.S.)
dialog: Here.
text: Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: I don't want this anymore.
text: Russell walks away. He sits on a rock, alone.
dialog: 
text: Carl picks up the sash. He walks up the steps of his house.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: The door opens. Carl steps in. He's back in his house for
dialog: the first time in days.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess
dialog: from the rough journey.
dialog: 
text: Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the
dialog: table into position.
text: He pushes their two chairs back into their place.
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.
dialog: 
dialog: Quiet.
dialog: 
text: Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside.
text: Carl surveys the room.
dialog: 
text: The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him. He opens it
text: and puts Ellie's drawing back.
text: He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper
text: clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.
text: He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.
dialog: 
text: Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but
dialog: Ellie never made it.
text: He closes the book. But as he does, Carl sees something he
dialog: hadn't before.
dialog: 
text: The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.
text: A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.
text: On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...
text: photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.
text: Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw
dialog: adventure in everyday life.
dialog: 
text: A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in
text: their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:
dialog: 
text: "THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!
scene_heading: LOVE, ELLIE."
text: Carl smiles.
dialog: 
text: He looks over to Ellie's empty chair. On the arm is
text: Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.
text: He looks to Ellie's chair.
dialog: 
text: He crosses his heart.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Russell?
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But Russell is nowhere to be seen.
dialog: 
text: A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating
text: off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Russell!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUSSELL
dialog: I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
dialog: won't!
dialog: 
text: Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into
dialog: the sky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No, Russell! No!
text: Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
text: it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
dialog: have lost too much helium.
dialog: 
text: Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch. It lands atop the
text: mountain rocks with a thud.
dialog: 
text: This gives him an idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,
text: dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, one corner of the house lifts. Then another.
text: Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch. It
text: teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Wahhoo!
dialog: 
text: The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of
text: things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side
text: atop Paradise Falls.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING
text: The house soars into the air, sails billowing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Can you stay? Well, you're my dog

speaker_heading: DUG

speaker_heading: CARL
