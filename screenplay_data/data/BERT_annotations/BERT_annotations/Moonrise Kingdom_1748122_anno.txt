scene_heading: INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is
text: a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide
text: corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and
text: battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at
text: the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are
text: clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.
dialog: 
text: Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling
text: the gutters.
dialog: 
text: A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully
text: eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel
text: slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He
text: takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the
text: turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.
dialog: 
text: A child's voice says over the speaker:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
dialog: In order to show you how a big symphony
text: orchestra is put together, Benjamin
dialog: Britten has written a big piece of music,
text: which is made up of smaller pieces that
dialog: show you all the separate parts of the
dialog: orchestra.
dialog: 
text: As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their
text: bedrooms and down to the landing.
dialog: 
text: The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is
text: Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer
text: shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a
text: twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high
text: socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is
text: Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.
dialog: 
text: The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They
text: lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their
text: fists, listening.
dialog: 
text: Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly
text: and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the
text: cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her
dialog: neck.
dialog: 
text: Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She
text: raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out
text: into the rain.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: A rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside
text: with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings
text: creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The
text: sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland
text: is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window,
dialog: watching.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TITLES OVER:
dialog: 
text: The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain.
dialog: 
text: In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They
text: shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat
text: grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen.
dialog: 
text: In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a
text: tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed
text: glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.
text: Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly
text: Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,
text: topless, in the kitchen sink.
dialog: 
text: In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet
text: branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker
text: fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.
text: She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.
dialog: 
text: In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: The edge of a cliff above a white beach. A rocky peninsula
text: curls into the background. Brisk wind rustles the tall grass.
text: A fifty-year-old man, bald on top with long hair on the
text: sides, stands next to a surveyor's levelling instrument on a
text: tripod. He wears rubber boots and a parka. He is the
text: narrator. He speaks to the camera:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: This is the island of New Penzance.
text: Sixteen miles long. Forested with old-
text: growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by
text: shallow tidal creeks. An important
text: seabird habitat. There are no paved roads
text: but instead many miles of intersecting
text: foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry
text: that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.
dialog: The year is 1965. We are on the far edge
dialog: of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the
text: ferocious and well-documented storm which
dialog: will strike from the east on the fifth of
dialog: September -- in three day's time.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
dialog: 
text: A clearing in the woods with ten small, khaki tents pitched
text: in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It
text: reads Camp Ivanhoe. A bugler in a khaki uniform with a yellow
text: neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch
text: over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.
dialog: 
text: A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges
text: through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.
text: He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown
text: reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin
text: scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.
dialog: He is Gadge.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Morning, Gadge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GADGE
dialog: Morning, sir.
dialog: 
text: Gadge flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book. Scout
text: Master Ward goes over to a latrine made from thick sticks and
text: rope. A tall, stooped scout digs a trench next to it with an
text: army-shovel. He is Deluca.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
text: Deluca. Latrine inspection.
dialog: 
text: Deluca stops digging. He pulls on a rope and water runs down
text: a chute. It bursts through a valve, spins a little door, and
text: a small, red flag flips up. Scout Master Ward nods.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
text: Gadge makes a note. Scout Master Ward strides away. He stops
text: in front of a scout with long hair over his eyes sitting on a
text: stump twisting something in his fingers. He is Roosevelt.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Roosevelt. How's that lanyard coming?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
speaker_heading: (FRUSTRATED)
dialog: I don't know. I think I skipped a stitch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A small, woven, multi-colored cord with a rabbit's foot
text: attached to the end of it. It has been braided exceedingly
text: badly and is brutally twisted and misshapen.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward studies the lanyard briefly. He looks
text: perplexed. He pats Roosevelt on the back gently and does a
text: secret handshake with him. Gadge makes a note. Scout Master
text: Ward strides away.
dialog: 
text: An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the
text: tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air,
text: and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs
text: stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and
text: a crooked tooth approaches with more logs in his arms. He is
dialog: Skotak.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Skotak. What's all this lumber for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
speaker_heading: (CHEERILY)
dialog: We're building a tree house.
dialog: 
text: Skotak points up. Scout Master Ward squints. There is a small
text: platform under construction about sixty feet above them. Two
text: scouts are sawing something in half on it. Scout Master Ward
text: looks astonished.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: That's not a safe altitude.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward circles around the trunk while looking up
text: at the tree house. He stammers:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Why's it up so high? If somebody falls --
dialog: it's a guaranteed death.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Well, where would you've built it?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Lower!
dialog: 
text: Gadge makes a note. Skotak looks sheepish. Scout Master Ward
text: strides away. He stops in front of a very small scout with
text: tiny eyes poking at an anthill with a stick. He appears to be
text: contemplating pouring lighter fluid on it. He is Nickleby.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Nickleby. Spot check.
dialog: 
text: Nickleby stands up. He looks extremely disheveled.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Your socks are down. Your shirt-tails are
dialog: untucked. Your trousers are not properly
dialog: pressed. You are reported for uniform
dialog: violation!
dialog: 
text: Gadge makes a note. Nickleby slouches. Scout Master Ward
text: strides away. He stops in front of a work-bench covered with
text: newspaper where one scout sifts green powder through a funnel
text: into cardboard tubes and another makes wax stoppers with a
text: metal press. They are Panagle and Izod. A sign on the side of
text: the table reads No Smoking. Scout Master Ward hands his
text: cigarette to Gadge, who holds it away at arm's length.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: How many rockets you up to, Panagle?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PANAGLE
text: Sixteen and a half.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (TO GADGE)
dialog: That enough for the Jubilee?
dialog: 
text: Gadge shakes his head. Scout Master Ward turns to Izod.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Izod, go fetch another pint of gun-powder
text: from the armory shed.
dialog: 
text: Izod dashes around the corner. Scout Master Ward strides
text: away. He shouts:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Redford! Halt!
dialog: 
text: The motorcycle skids to a stop in front of Scout Master Ward,
text: engulfing him in a thick cloud of dust. He coughs and waves
text: his arms in the air. As the smoke clears, we see that the
text: rider is a bronze, all-American-looking boy with blond hair.
text: He is Redford. His motorcycle has flames painted on the gas
text: tank. He tries to cover for himself:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: Safety-test, sir.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (BRISTLING)
dialog: Come again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
text: The vehicle appears to be in good working
dialog: order. I'm just checking if --
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: Reckless cycling. Second warning. Next
text: time, I take away the keys.
dialog: 
text: Gadge makes a note. Redford scowls. Scout Master Ward strides
text: away. He walks past a scout in a white apron cooking bacon
text: over a charcoal grill. He is Chef.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Morning, Chef.
dialog: 
text: Chef rings a bell hanging on a post. Scout Master Ward
text: arrives at a long picnic table. He sits down and opens a
text: magazine called Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover
text: of a scout troop crossing a bridge in Indonesia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: The first page. A caption across the top reads Scout Master-
text: in-Chief. There is a drawing of a seventy-year-old man on
text: horseback. He has silver hair and a moustache. A signature
text: below reads Commander Pierce. There is a quotation in large
text: text: "An eagle was never hatched from a goose's egg."
dialog: 
text: As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him
text: one-by-one. They range in age from twelve to fifteen. They
text: unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding
text: utensils. The chef brings a tray of scrambled eggs to the
text: table. The scouts serve themselves noisily.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward starts to take a sip of coffee from a metal
text: cup -- then stops. He looks up from his magazine.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Who's missing?
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward silently reels off a list of names,
text: scanning the troop. He turns and shouts across the camp:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Shakusky! Breakfast!
dialog: 
text: Silence. Scout Master Ward calls to Lazy-Eye:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Lazy-Eye.
dialog: 
text: Lazy-Eye plays another tattoo. Silence.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward closes his magazine. He flicks his
text: cigarette into a red bucket labelled Fire. He picks up a
text: strip of bacon and chews on it as he rises to his feet and
text: walks down the row of smaller tents. The last one is sealed
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: at the front. Scout Master Ward stands with his hands on his
dialog: hips and says:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Shakusky? You in there?
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward tugs on the tent's flaps. He frowns. He
dialog: says to Gadge:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
text: It's zipped from the inside.
dialog: 
text: The other scouts begin to gather with their tin breakfast
text: plates in their hands, watching curiously while they eat.
text: Scout Master Ward's voice softens:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Sam?
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward looks concerned. He produces a wooden-
text: handled scout pocket-knife. He unfolds a few blades and
text: gadgets and decides quickly on a thin tool with a hook on the
text: end. He crouches down and slips the hook through a small gap
text: at the base of the flap, twists left and right, then pulls up
text: briskly, unzipping the tent.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCOUT TENT. DAY
dialog: 
text: The lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and
text: pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. There is a foot
text: locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it,
text: and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent
text: over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot
text: locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks
text: up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from
text: under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns
text: suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides
dialog: it aside.
dialog: 
text: There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a
text: basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. Scout
text: Master Ward looks to his staring troop.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
text: Jiminy Cricket. He flew the coop.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
dialog: 
text: A one-room bungalow with a sign on the door that reads Island
text: Police. There is a wood-panelled station wagon parked
text: alongside it with roller-lights on the roof and a sheriff's
text: office insignia on the door. (This is the only car on the
text: island.) A dock stretches from the cottage into a small
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: harbor. There is a launch moored at the end of it which bobs
text: in the rough tide.
dialog: 
text: A silver Airstream trailer is parked under a tree nearby.
dialog: 
text: A six-foot tall, forty-five-year-old man sits on a stool
text: fishing from the side of the dock. He wears a short-sleeved
text: police uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap. His
text: glasses have clear, plastic frames and a strap. He is Captain
dialog: Sharp.
dialog: 
text: Two grouchy, leathery, very old men in plaid flannel and
text: hunting caps fish alongside Captain Sharp. A speaker on a
text: post emits an electric buzz. Captain Sharp turns. He stands
text: up briskly and says to one of the old men:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Watch my line, Edgar.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION. DAY
dialog: 
text: A small office with a desk, a file cabinet, and a two-way
text: radio. Captain Sharp comes inside, sits down, grabs a
text: microphone, and presses a red button on the side of it with
text: his thumb.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward's voice comes over a crackly speaker:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
dialog: Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over
text: at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot on a
text: hot-plate as he answers distractedly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Morning, Randy. What can I do for you?
dialog: Over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
dialog: I'm not sure, exactly. I've got an
text: escaped Khaki Scout. Over.
dialog: 
text: Silence. Captain Sharp frowns slightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: What does that mean? Over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
dialog: One of my boys seems to have stolen a dug-
dialog: out and some fishing tackle, ten pounds
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
text: of sundries, two bedrolls, plus an air
text: rifle -- and disappeared. Over.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp slowly stirs sugar into his coffee as he
text: contemplates this. He says finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Any idea why? Over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
dialog: No. He left me a letter of resignation.
dialog: Over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A sheet of wide-ruled yellow paper which reads in a boy's
scene_heading: PENCILED SCRAWL:
dialog: 
dialog: Dear Scout Master Ward, I am very sad
dialog: to inform you I can no longer be involved
dialog: with the Khaki Scouts of North America.
dialog: The rest of the troop will probably be
dialog: glad to hear this. It is not your fault.
dialog: Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp scratches his head. He checks his watch. Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I guess we better notify his folks. Over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
text: OK. Over and out.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POST OFFICE. DAY
dialog: 
text: A clapboard cottage surrounded by a white, picket fence. A
text: sign on the door reads U.S. Mail. Captain's Sharp station
text: wagon is parked in the background.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POST OFFICE. DAY
dialog: 
text: A young woman with her hair in a bun sits at an operator's
text: switchboard eating a sandwich wrapped in wax-paper. She is
text: Becky. She wears bulky head-phones with a microphone
text: attached. Captain Sharp paces behind her. Scout Master Ward
text: flips through a stack of letters and post cards.
dialog: 
text: A bell rings on the switchboard. Becky plugs cords into
text: sockets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Hello, Diane.
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Becky, I have your person-to-person from
dialog: Chesterfield.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Hold the line, please.
dialog: 
text: Becky signals to Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward. They
text: sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head-
dialog: phones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Go ahead, Chesterfield.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
text: Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
text: seventy-five-year-old man with a grizzled face sitting at a
text: kitchen table drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette while a
text: white-haired woman ices a cake in the background. They are
text: Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. Mr. Billingsley says into his
speaker_heading: TELEPHONE:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank
dialog: you very much. In fact, we've come to a
dialog: decision, as a family, because this is
dialog: only the most recent incident involving
dialog: Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to
dialog: the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't
dialog: invite him back, at this time.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky all look puzzled.
dialog: Captain Sharp says evenly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll
dialog: find him. We're just notifying you as a
dialog: matter of protocol and so on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: I understand that. I'm notifying you of
dialog: the situation on my end.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I'm confused by that statement. You can't
dialog: invite him back?
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got
dialog: a good heart, but it's just not fair to
dialog: the others, you see? He's emotionally
dialog: disturbed.
dialog: 
text: Long pause. No one moves except Mrs. Billingsley icing her
text: cake. Captain Sharp says finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Am I speaking to Sam's father?
dialog: 
text: Mr. Billingsley frowns. He says, surprised:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a
dialog: number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs.
dialog: Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's
dialog: been with us since last June.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Billingsley has stopped icing her cake. She watches Mr.
text: Billingsley. Scout Master Ward interjects:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Excuse me, sir. This is Scout Master Ward
dialog: speaking. Are you implying Sam's an
dialog: orphan?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he
dialog: is.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Why the hell doesn't it say that in the
dialog: register? Excuse my language.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward holds up a manila file-card. Mr.
text: Billingsley shrugs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: I don't know. What register?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: The manila file-card. It is labelled Khaki Scout Register.
text: Sam Shakusky is typed across the top line. There is an
text: address, health information, and a small, faded snap-shot
text: stapled to the corner of it of a twelve-year-old boy standing
text: in a sunny tobacco field. He wears his scout uniform with a
text: Davy Crockett-style coon-skin cap.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: We sent him a letter. It should reach you
dialog: presently.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward looks quickly through his stack of letters.
text: He stops and pulls out an air-mail envelope. He stares at it.
text: Captain Sharp says forcefully but highly agitated:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped
dialog: Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a
dialog: matter of protocol. You say you can't
dialog: invite him back? You say he's an orphan?
dialog: Well, I don't understand how that works.
speaker_heading: (TOTALLY CONFUSED)
dialog: What am I supposed to do with him?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MR. BILLINGSLEY
dialog: That's up to Social Services. They'll be
dialog: in touch with you. They'll look after
dialog: Sam. Good luck to you.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Billingsley hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
text: out of their sockets. Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master
text: Ward. Silence.
dialog: 
text: Becky opens a tin of home-made chocolate chip cookies.
text: Captain Sharp declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He
text: looks very impressed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward stands on a bench addressing his assembled
text: troop. The scouts are equipped for hiking with back-packs and
text: walking-sticks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: You have your orders. Use the
dialog: orienteering and path-finding skills
dialog: you've been practicing all summer. Let's
dialog: find our man and bring him safely back to
dialog: camp. Remember: this isn't just a search
dialog: party, it's a chance to do some first-
dialog: class scouting. Any questions?
dialog: 
text: Lazy-Eye raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him.

scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Lazy-Eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAZY-EYE
dialog: What's your real job, sir?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (CAUGHT OFF-GUARD)
dialog: I'm a math teacher.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAZY-EYE
dialog: What grade?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (STIFFENING)
dialog: Eighth. Why?
dialog: 
text: Lazy-Eye shrugs. Scout Master Ward frowns.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: You know, we're, actually, kind of, in
dialog: the middle of something, if you didn't
dialog: notice. This is a crisis. Anybody else?
dialog: 
text: Redford raises his hand. Scout Master Ward points to him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Redford.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: What if he resists?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on
dialog: him?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: No, you're not. This is a non-violent
dialog: rescue effort. Your instructions are to
dialog: find him, not to hurt him. Under any
dialog: circumstances. Do I make myself
dialog: understood?
dialog: 
text: The scouts murmur their understanding. Scout Master Ward
dialog: nods.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Scout Master Ward wheels back to Lazy-Eye:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: I'm going to change my answer, in fact.
dialog: This is my real job. Scout Master, Troop
dialog: 55. That's us. I'm proud of that.
dialog: 
text: The scouts look impressed but slightly lost. Scout Master

scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Be leery out there. OK, let's get
dialog: started. Where's Snoopy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Right here.
dialog: 
text: Skotak holds up a leash attached to a wire-haired terrier.
text: Scout Master Ward takes a sock with a fleur-de-lis on it out
text: of a paper sack.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Give him the scent.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward hands the sock to Skotak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Redford, Deluca, Nickleby, Lazy-Eye, and Gadge at the back of
text: the group talking under their breath while Skotak waves the
text: sock under the dog's nose:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAZY-EYE
dialog: I heard he ran away because his family
dialog: died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GADGE
dialog: I heard he never had any family in the
dialog: first place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELUCA
dialog: That's probably why he's crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: I'll tell you one thing: if we find him,
dialog: I'm not going to be the one who forgot to
dialog: bring a weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKLEBY
dialog: Me, neither.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
dialog: 
text: The troop moves in a wide line searching through a thicket of
text: skinny trees. Redford carries a net and a giant tomahawk in a
text: sling. Deluca has a large hunting knife tucked under his
text: belt. Panagle holds a walking stick with a cluster of nails
text: sticking out on the end of it. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye
text: all wear bows and quivers of arrows strapped to their backs.
text: The wire-haired terrier strains at the end of a leash,
text: sniffing down a foot-path.
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward speeds up the river in a small boat with an
text: out-board motor. He gives orders over a walkie-talkie. Gadge
dialog: steers.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp stands on the doorsteps of various big houses
text: showing the snap-shot of the missing scout to: an elderly
text: woman, a house-keeper, a group of children, a priest. They
text: all shake their heads.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp drives his station wagon down a beach, through
text: a field, and over a bridge.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp stands at the front door talking with Mr. and
text: Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop holds a glass of red wine in one hand
text: and an open bottle in the other. Mrs. Bishop looks slightly
text: uneasy. They both study the snap-shot.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Camp Ivanhoe? That's all the way across
dialog: the other side of the island. You really
dialog: think a twelve-year-old boy could row
dialog: this far in a canoe?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Most likely not.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: (with a shrug)
dialog: It's possible, Counsellor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
scene_heading: (SLIGHTLY IRRITATED)
dialog: I disagree, Counsellor. It'd take him
dialog: three days, at least.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I don't think so. Two days, maximum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Well, I'm not going to argue about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Be that as it may, will you let me know
dialog: if you see anything unusual?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A binocular shot of Captain Sharp from overhead as he walks
text: away down the front steps. He passes Lionel, Murray, and Rudy
text: on their way up the path. They wear wet bathing suits and
text: towels around their shoulders. Captain Sharp pats Rudy on the
text: top of his head. He dries his hand on the leg of his
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: trousers. He gets into his station wagon, backs out of the
text: driveway, circles through the woods, and drives around to a
text: small dirt road a hundred yards behind the house. He stops
text: the car. He gets out, sits on the hood, and lights a
dialog: cigarette.
dialog: 
text: Suzy watches from the widow's walk with her binoculars. She
text: lowers them. She looks curious. She raises them back to her
text: eyes and sees:
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop from overhead as she comes out the back door of
text: the house carrying a basket of damp laundry. She pauses at a
text: clothesline, looks left and right, then walks quickly into
text: the trees. She crosses a foot-bridge and arrives at the dirt
text: road. Captain Sharp stands up. They talk briefly but
text: intensely. Mrs. Bishop leans against the car and stares into
text: space. Captain Sharp touches her hair. Mrs. Bishop makes a
text: gesture with her fingers. Captain Sharp hands her his
text: cigarette. Mrs. Bishop takes a puff, hands it back, and
text: strides away again through the woods. Captain Sharp gets into
text: his station wagon and drives off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A portable night stand. There is a reel-to-reel tape recorder
text: recording on it. A framed photograph next to it shows the
text: Scout-Master-in-Chief posing with a troop in front of the
text: Matterhorn.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The front flaps are tied-open, and a mosquito net is drawn. A
text: hanging lantern flickers on a hook. A bugle plays a variation
text: of taps in the distance. Scout Master Ward sits on a cot
text: dressed in pajamas. He smokes a cigarette and drinks a glass
text: of brandy while he speaks tensely into a microphone:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Scout Master's log. September second.
dialog: First day of search party for Sam
text: Shakusky. Morale is extremely low, in
dialog: part, I suppose, because Sam is,
dialog: unfortunately, the least popular scout in
dialog: the troop, by a significant margin. I'm
dialog: worried, and I'm confused. Please, let us
dialog: find him tomorrow. Please, don't let him
dialog: fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn
dialog: lake or something. A terrible day at Camp
dialog: Ivanhoe. Let's hope tomorrow's better. In
dialog: fact, I'm going to say a prayer.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward presses stop. He kneels down on the floor,
text: closes his eyes, presses his palms together, and whispers.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCOUT CAMP. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward zips up his tent and turns off the light.
text: Crickets chirp. Bats circle. The wire-haired terrier digs
text: carefully through a pile of trash.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. NARROW STREAM. DAY
dialog: 
text: The next morning. A fast current runs along a shallow ravine
text: deep in the forest. The boy from the snap-shot rows a mini-
text: canoe painted with Native American tribal symbols and
text: severely over-loaded with boxes, bags, and blankets. He wears
text: a pellet gun slung on a strap over his shoulder and his coon-
text: skin cap. He smokes a pipe. A sash across his chest is
text: decorated with numerous small, embroidered patches. There is
text: a woman's enamelled brooch pinned to his shirt. It is a
text: jeweled, black scorpion. He whistles to himself quietly as he
text: steers under a fallen tree-trunk and winds through gentle
text: rapids. He is Sam.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BANK. DAY
dialog: 
text: An eddy under a willow tree. The end of the canoe is tied to
text: a branch, and the cargo is stacked on the shore. Sam covers
text: the boat with a camouflage net and dresses the top with pine-
dialog: needles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROCKY GORGE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam hikes through a pass wearing an extremely large back-pack
text: with stakes, metal poles, and two bed-rolls strapped to the
text: bottom. He wears a compass on a string around his neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A binocular shot of Sam emerging from the woods into a wide
text: meadow. The grass comes up to his chest and flows in waves.
text: He pauses to check his compass. He spins slowly one direction
text: and then back the other while he stares at the dial. He looks
text: up again. He walks onward. He stops.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
dialog: 
text: Suzy lowers her binoculars. She stands at the end of a path
text: cut through the high grass. She has a leather folder in one
text: hand, the portable record player in the other, plus a small
text: suitcase and her kitten in a basket at her side. Sam takes
text: his coon-skin hat slowly off his head. He strides across the
text: meadow. Suzy watches him approach. She swallows. Her lips
text: part. Sam comes onto the path. He stops ten feet away from
dialog: Suzy.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy stare at each other. Silence. (NOTE: Suzy is
dialog: slightly taller than Sam.)
dialog: 18.

speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A poster box with St. Jack's Church across the top. A purple-

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Dusk. A brick church at the top of a bluff overlooking the

speaker_heading: TITLE:

dialog: One Year Earlier
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. EVENING
dialog: 
text: A play is in progress. The set includes a long ark with a
text: sail built on a platform behind the altar. Two teenagers
text: crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the
text: foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of
text: the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the
text: center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large
text: congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the
text: walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir
text: loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a
text: brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next
text: cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised.
dialog: 
text: Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the
text: church. A very young troop in a slightly different version of
text: the uniform fills a row near the exit. Sam sits on the aisle.
text: He looks bored.
dialog: 
text: A baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard
text: sings ominously on the stage. Cymbals crash. Sam stands up
text: and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in
text: his pockets. A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform
text: watches him from the end of the pew, frowning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sam quietly entering the lobby. The sound of the music
text: deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him. He turns
text: around and puts on a yellow scout cap with Junior Khaki
text: stitched on the bill. The room is jammed with children
text: dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: winds all around the space. They whisper and shuffle. A large
text: woman stares through a small window into the church with her
text: hand on a doorknob. She is Mrs. Lynn. She snaps her fingers
text: suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Lynn swings open the center doors. Music fills the room
text: again. The first twenty of the children begin to sing. They
text: march out of the lobby, two by two. The woman closes the
text: doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to
dialog: wait.
dialog: 
text: Sam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and
text: skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching
text: horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He
text: drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a
text: bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ROOM. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Sam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his
text: head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks
text: blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks
speaker_heading: THROUGH AT:
dialog: 
text: Five eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a
text: bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk
text: quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their
text: arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black
text: feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light
text: silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection. The other girls
text: turn around quickly, covering themselves.
dialog: 
text: Sam removes his cap and takes another step forward. His eyes
text: dart briefly among the other girls. He says to Suzy:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What kind of bird are you?
dialog: 
text: Suzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says
text: in a bossy voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOSSY GIRL
dialog: I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and --
dialog: 
text: Sam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"
dialog: 
text: The other girls all look to Suzy. Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I'm a raven.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead. The
text: other girls look annoyed but transfixed. The bossy girl
text: frowns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOSSY GIRL
dialog: Boy's aren't allowed in here.
dialog: 
text: Sam does not look away from Suzy as he answers quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll be leaving soon.
dialog: 
text: Sam points down at Suzy's lap. One of her hands is wrapped in
text: a bandage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What happened to your hand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I got hit in the mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (TAKEN ABACK)
dialog: Really. How'd that happen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: I lost my temper at myself.
dialog: 
text: Sam is deeply intrigued by this. The other girls look
text: puzzled. Suzy presses her hair back off her face. She watches
text: Sam nervously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: What's your name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sam. What's yours?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I'm Suzy.
dialog: 
text: Sam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's. Suzy bites her
text: fingernails. The bossy girl rolls her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOSSY GIRL
dialog: It's not polite to stare.
dialog: 
text: Sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking.
text: Mrs. Lynn steps into the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. LYNN
dialog: Birds! Ready?
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Lynn does a double-take. She snaps at Sam:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. LYNN
dialog: Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go
dialog: back to your seat.
dialog: 
text: Sam hesitates. He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out
text: through the clothing rack, and is gone. A skinny girl dressed
text: as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their
text: feet. She says quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKINNY GIRL
dialog: He likes you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH YARD. EVENING
dialog: 
text: Troops flood out from one side of the church while children
text: in animal costumes flood out from the other. They criss-cross
text: among grave-markers and head-stones. Sam stops abruptly, face
text: to face with the skinny owl. She whispers something, points
text: behind her, and thrusts a folded scrap of paper into Sam's
dialog: hand.

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT

text: row. He stares into space, entranced.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
scene_heading: (LOOKING AROUND)
dialog: I doubt it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
text: Sam frowns and squints. He points.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Did you bring a cat?
dialog: 
text: Suzy nods. Sam smiles. Suzy smiles. Sam takes a folded map
text: out of his pocket. He signals for Suzy to come closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Can you read a map?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I do cartography.
dialog: 
text: Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a
text: protractor embroidered on it. He unfolds the map.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I feel we should go halfway today and
dialog: halfway tomorrow, since you're a less
dialog: experienced hiker, and you're wearing
dialog: Sunday-school shoes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (pointing on the map)
dialog: Here's where we are right now. I'd like
dialog: to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred
dialog: (which means four o'clock). How does that
dialog: sound?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You want some beef jerky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: OK.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you thirsty?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, if your throat gets parched, stick
dialog: a pebble in your mouth and suck on it.
dialog: You can quench your thirst with the spit,
dialog: supposedly.
dialog: 
text: Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out
text: from under his coonskin cap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It
dialog: cools your head down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: That's a good idea. It might help also if
dialog: you didn't wear fur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: True, but this adds camouflage.
dialog: 
text: Sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass. He
text: holds it in his fist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air,
dialog: and you can see which direction the
text: wind's blowing.
dialog: 
text: Sam throws up the grass. It swirls and drifts vaguely. Suzy
text: squints.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Which way?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Unknown. I guess it doesn't really
dialog: matter, as long as we cover our tracks.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy stop to investigate and discuss: a patch of
text: mushrooms, moss on a stump, ferns, poison ivy, and a low bush
text: with purple fruit. Sam looks skeptical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: These might be poisonous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (STUDYING THEM)
dialog: No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try
dialog: one.
dialog: 
text: Suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry. Sam puts one
text: into his mouth and nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not bad. Anyway, they're good for
dialog: survival.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy look through Suzy's binoculars at a deer
text: drinking from a stream. Suzy whispers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: He knows someone's watching him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I agree. Why do you say that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (SQUINTING)
dialog: I don't know. I just think he can feel
dialog: us.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream. A snake
text: swims on the surface below them. Sam assists Suzy onto the
dialog: far bank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You smell like perfume.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: It's my mother's.
dialog: 
text: Sam picks up two pebbles. He and Suzy both put them in their
text: mouths. They click against their teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I brought water, too.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy watch a small, green worm wriggling in the air,
text: swaying from a silk thread. They stare, wide-eyed. Suzy cups
text: her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a
text: circle. Sam shrugs.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Should we catch him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: What for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Trout bait. We need worms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (SHARPLY)
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Pause. The worm curls and uncurls itself gently. Sam nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe
dialog: I've got a licorice whip.

scene_heading: EXT. LAKE SHORE. DAY

text: camouflage net from the canoe and says gravely:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How strong of a swimmer are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Pretty good. I broke our school record
dialog: for the back-stroke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (MILDLY SURPRISED)
dialog: OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a

text: of the canoe fishing with a bamboo pole. Sam drapes his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you,
dialog: if you put your fingers in their mouths.
dialog: Let me see if I can catch this one.
dialog: 
text: Sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small
text: turtle in it. He lifts it out of the net. It has red and
text: yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell. Sam flips it
text: over. The word Albert is written on the underside of the
text: turtle in magic marker. Sam says blankly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Somebody wrote on him.
dialog: 
text: The fishing pole jerks in Suzy's hands. She yells:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: The stick's moving!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (ALERTED)
dialog: You got one!
dialog: 
text: Sam jumps to his feet and heaves the turtle with two hands.
text: It sails through the air across the pond and splashes down
text: with a whack. Sam yells an announcement:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fish on hook!
speaker_heading: (TO SUZY)
dialog: Reel him in! Slowly.
dialog: 
text: The canoe rocks violently. Suzy snaps:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY

scene_heading: GENTLY ENCOURAGING:

text: He holds out a bite on a spatula to Suzy sitting on a log
text: next to him. She tastes it. She looks surprised and nods
scene_heading: ENTHUSIASTICALLY:

speaker_heading: SUZY

speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (STIFFENING)

dialog: What else did you bring? We should make
text: an inventory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
text: Sam flips open a small, spiral-bound note-book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Go ahead.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suzy opens the top of her portable record player. She
text: displays it like a salesman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: This is my record player. It works with
dialog: batteries. Actually, it belongs to my
dialog: little brother Lionel. I left him a note.
dialog: Do you like music?
dialog: 
text: Sam nods and makes a note. Suzy opens her leather folder.
text: There are three L.P. records in it. She takes out one by a
dialog: French singer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: This is my favorite record album. My
dialog: godmother gave it to me for my birthday.
dialog: She lives in France.
dialog: 
text: Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy opens her suitcase. It
text: is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy books.
text: It contains no other items of any kind (including clothing).
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: These are my books. I like stories with
dialog: magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms
dialog: on earth or on foreign planets. Also,
dialog: time-travel, if they make it realistic.
dialog: Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not
dialog: always. I couldn't bring all of them
dialog: because it got too heavy. You can borrow
dialog: any you want.
dialog: 
text: Sam nods and makes another note. Suzy produces a few more
speaker_heading: ITEMS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I also brought my lefty scissors because
text: I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some
dialog: rubber bands, extra batteries, and my
dialog: binoculars, as you know. I forgot my
dialog: comb.
dialog: 
text: Sam surveys the entire collection of articles. He scratches
text: his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No
dialog: canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't
dialog: you get the packing list I sent you in my
dialog: last letter?
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (FROWNS)
dialog: I thought that's what you're supposed to
dialog: bring. I don't own a canteen.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Sam shrugs. He smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's OK. We can share.
dialog: 
text: Sam picks up one of the books. It is called The Girl from
text: Jupiter. There is an illustration on the cover of a young,
text: alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks. Sam
text: examines the other books in the suitcase. He looks slightly
dialog: puzzled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: These are all library books. In my school
dialog: you're only allowed to check-out one at a
dialog: time. Some of these are going to be
text: overdue.
dialog: 
text: Sam hesitates. He suddenly realizes something. He asks
speaker_heading: BLUNTLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you steal?
dialog: 
text: Silence. Suzy nods reluctantly. Sam looks confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why? You're not poor.
dialog: 
text: Suzy stares at the books. She absently brushes some dust off
text: them. She rearranges them slightly. She says finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I might turn some of them back in one
dialog: day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's
dialog: bad. I think I just took them to have a
dialog: secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason,
dialog: it makes me feel in a better mood
dialog: sometimes.
dialog: 
text: Sam thinks about this. He leans his chin against his fist. He
scene_heading: SAYS SERIOUSLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you depressed?
dialog: 
text: Suzy bites her fingernails. She shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How come?
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Pause. Suzy says philosophically:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Well, I can show you an example, if you
dialog: want -- but it doesn't make me feel very
dialog: good. I found this on top of our
dialog: refrigerator.
dialog: 
text: Suzy looks into her leather folder and shuffles through some
text: pages. She withdraws a small pamphlet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: The cover of the pamphlet. There is a drawing of a broken tea-
text: cup and the title "Coping with the Very Troubled Child".
dialog: 
text: Sam frowns. His eyes widen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Does that mean you?
dialog: 
text: Suzy nods. Sam explodes with laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: It's not funny.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: To me, it is.
dialog: 
text: Sam slaps his knee and shakes his head. Pause. Suzy dumps her
text: fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a
text: frisbee into a tree trunk. It bounces off with a ding. She
text: stands up and says coolly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: You really know how to make friends.
dialog: 
text: Suzy walks away. She goes behind a bush and sits down on a
text: rock. She starts to cry. Sam looks stricken and confused. He
text: is very still. He gets up slowly. He tentatively approaches
text: the bush. He looks behind it. He takes two steps closer. He
text: stands above Suzy. He unties his neckerchief, crouches down,
text: and holds it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Suzy looks to Sam. She hesitates. She takes the neckerchief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: That's OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm on your side.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: Suzy dries her eyes. She unfolds the neckerchief and studies
text: its design. It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning off
text: the side of a galloping horse. Sam motions to the books:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Which one's the best?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Dusk. Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his
text: pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads
text: aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies. There is an
text: illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a
text: bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins,
text: Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the
text: rippling surface of the cool shallows and
dialog: down to its stone floor. "My people once
dialog: were lead by a great and noble beast --
dialog: and I no longer see his face in this
dialog: reflection."
dialog: 
text: Suzy looks to Sam. He is asleep. She takes the pipe out of
text: his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire. She draws a
text: blanket over his chest. She continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha,
text: Francine rested. There would be another
dialog: time for war.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The dining room. There is a long, wide, empty table with
text: sixteen chairs around it. Tucked in the corner, Lionel,
text: Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table. They have
text: plates on place-mats and forks and knives. There is one extra
text: seat. Mrs. Bishop's voice booms, amplified, from the next
speaker_heading: ROOM:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
dialog: Suzy! Dinner! I'm not going to say it
dialog: again!
dialog: 
text: Pause. Mrs. Bishop charges into the room with a steaming
text: casserole. She wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an
text: electric megaphone in the other. She sets the casserole on
text: the card table and looks out the window. Through the thicket
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: of trees behind the house, a pair of headlights blinks. Mrs.
text: Bishop checks her watch. She says sharply:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Where's your sister?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I don't know, but she borrowed my record
dialog: player for ten days without asking.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 
text: Lionel holds up a small, folded-up piece of pink stationary.
text: Mrs. Bishop snaps it out of his hand and opens it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A short note on pink stationary in a girl's red felt-tip
text: cursive. It reads:
dialog: 
dialog: Dear Lionel, I need to use your
dialog: record player. I will give it back in
dialog: ten days or less. Do not tell Mom.
dialog: (Or Dad.) I will replace the batteries
dialog: when I return. Signed, Suzy Bishop
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop frowns. She bolts back out of the room. Her voice
speaker_heading: BOOMS AGAIN:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
dialog: Walt! Where the hell are you?
dialog: 
text: There is a loud thump upstairs. Mr. Bishop shouts from
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
dialog: Right here! Why are you cursing at me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Exterior. Mr. Bishop leans out of an upstairs window. Mrs.
text: Bishop appears in one below. She yells up through the
speaker_heading: MEGAPHONE:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Does it concern you that your daughter's
dialog: just run away from home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: That's a loaded question.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop brandishes the note with her free hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Come down and read this.
dialog: 
text: A radio squawks in the woods behind the house. Mr. and Mrs.
text: Bishop turn quickly toward the sound. Mrs. Bishop looks
text: tense. Becky's garbled voice says over a tinny speaker:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BECKY (V.O.)
dialog: Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no
dialog: luck. They're going home for the --
dialog: 
text: There is a rustling and the sound of a car door opening --
text: then the radio cuts off. Mr. Bishop frowns. He shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp emerges slowly from the dark, tangled in a
text: bramble, hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from
text: around his ankle. He smiles awkwardly and says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was
speaker_heading: JUST --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (ANGRILY)
dialog: What are you doing here? Nobody called
dialog: the police.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I know, that's what I'm saying. The
dialog: search party's not over yet. In other
speaker_heading: WORDS --
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: OK. Where'd she --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Wait for me.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop disappears into the house. Captain Sharp and Mrs.
text: Bishop exchange an uncertain look.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp pans a spot-light back and forth in the
text: darkness while he steers the car. The lamp has a short in it
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: and flickers with each bump. Mr. Bishop rides in the
text: passenger seat. He stares ahead down the road and says to
speaker_heading: HIMSELF:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: How can we help her? She's got so many
dialog: problems. It's getting worse.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop looks strangely to Captain Sharp. He asks:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Whose fault is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: I don't know, but just for the record:
dialog: ninety-five percent of all runaways
dialog: return home within six hours. That
dialog: doesn't do you any good right now. It's
dialog: just a statistic -- but in all likelihood
text: Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at
text: her best friend's house playing Chinese
dialog: Checkers at this very moment, as we
dialog: speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: She doesn't have any friends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (LONG PAUSE)
dialog: How's Laura?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (IRRITATED)
dialog: How's Laura?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Mrs. Bishop, I mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: I don't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Is she upset?
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop looks baffled and disgusted. He throws his hands
text: into the air. He looks away and shakes his head. Silence.
text: Captain Sharp wiggles some wires.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I got to get this spot-light fixed.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp and Mr. Bishop come to a stop and get out of
text: the station wagon. They look dejected. The screen door bangs
text: open, and Mrs. Bishop quickly descends the front steps with a
text: open shoebox full of letters in her hands. She says
text: breathlessly, shouting:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: She has a pen pal! It's very intimate!
dialog: They planned this together!
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp takes one of the letters and studies it. He
dialog: says to himself:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki
dialog: Scout. His family died.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop takes a handful of the letters and flips through
text: them. He stops suddenly. He looks horrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Holy Christ. What am I looking at?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A small painting on construction paper of a naked girl
text: stepping into a bathtub. She wears a flower in her hair.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop continues to shout as she explains:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: He does watercolors! Mostly landscapes,
dialog: but a few nudes!
dialog: 
text: Lionel, Murray, and Rudy watch from a downstairs window.
text: Lionel takes a bite from a bowl of melting ice cream. Mr.
text: Bishop stares at the painting. He squints at it and asks
scene_heading: INCREDULOUSLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: She sit for this?
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp and Mrs. Bishop look over Mr. Bishop's
text: shoulder. Captain Sharp says calmly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: What does he say?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
dialog: 
text: The history of Sam and Suzy's correspondence.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sam, dressed in a greasy jump-suit, writes at a work bench in
text: a garage while six teenagers take apart carburetors behind
text: him. They are his foster brothers. Sam reads in voice-over:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Suzy, You have a superb voice. You
dialog: were my favorite animal in the program,
dialog: by far. Please, find enclosed --
dialog: 
text: Suzy writes at a small desk on the upstairs landing while
text: Lionel and Murray play a loud duet on a red piano behind her.
text: (Rudy turns the pages of the sheet music.) Suzy reads in
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Sam, Thank you very much. I got
dialog: replaced as the raven because I yelled at
dialog: Mrs. Lynn. After that I was only a blue
dialog: jay, but --
dialog: 
text: Sam works in an alley emptying garbage from several small
text: trash cans into a larger one. Mr. Billingsley watches
text: television in a window, smoking a cigarette. He points to a
text: crumpled wrapper on the ground. Sam picks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Suzy, I am sorry your brothers are
dialog: so selfish. Maybe they will grow out of
dialog: it. Sometimes people do things without
dialog: knowing the reasons for --
dialog: 
text: Suzy reads a book called Disappearance of the 6th Grade.
text: There is an illustration on the cover of a school-teacher
text: levitating at the front of her classroom. There are several
text: watercolor pictures taped to the wall behind her. Most are
text: landscapes of small-town vacant lots. One is a swimming girl
text: in a bikini.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Sam, You are an excellent painter,
dialog: especially trees and telephone poles. Is
dialog: the girl in the water supposed to be me?
dialog: My favorite color is --
dialog: 
text: Sam stands in pajamas staring blankly, eyes wide, at a dog
text: house in flames next to a rusty swing-set. A dachsund sits
text: next to him, also watching. Mrs. Billingsley comes running
text: out of the house with a fire extinguisher.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Suzy, I accidentally built a fire
dialog: while I was sleep-walking. I have no
dialog: memory of this, but my foster parents
dialog: think I am lying. Unfortunately, it is --
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suzy stands in the kitchen looking out through a pane of
text: glass with a hole smashed in the middle of it. Mrs. Bishop is
text: next to her with her hair hanging over the sink while the two
text: of them carefully pick bits of glass out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Sam, I am in trouble again because I
text: threw a rock through the window. My mother
text: still has glass in her hair. Also --
dialog: 
text: Five of Sam's foster brothers watch calmly as the sixth
text: throws Sam against the wall then jumps on top of him, pinning
text: his arms to the floor while Sam struggles crazily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Suzy, I have been trying very hard
dialog: to make friends, but I feel people do not
dialog: like my personality. In fact, I can
dialog: understand why they might --
dialog: 
text: A classroom of sixth graders watches in a panic as Suzy
text: throttles one of her classmates. The classmate flails and
text: grimaces as she is strangled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Sam, Now I am getting suspended
dialog: because I got in a fight with Molly. She
dialog: says I go berserk. Our principal is
dialog: against me. Why do --
dialog: 
text: Sam does sit-ups on a hard mattress in a basement room lined
text: with bunks. He counts out the repetitions under his breath.
text: There is a small, black and white photograph of a man and
text: woman at their wedding tacked to the wall above him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Suzy, I know your parents hurt your
dialog: feelings, but they still love you. That
dialog: is more important. If they --
dialog: 
text: Suzy stands in a doorway screaming at her family while they
text: watch wearily from the dinner table with forks and knives in
dialog: their hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Sam, I do think you should think of
dialog: their faces every day, even if it makes
dialog: you sad. It is too bad they did not leave
dialog: you more pictures of themselves. Can you --
dialog: 
text: Sam writes in his bunk crouched beneath a blanket with a

speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Suzy, Here is my plan.

dialog: Dear Sam, Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Suzy kneeling in the dark, crouched in front of an upper
text: window with the shoebox of letters beside her. Outside, the
text: woods are black beyond a moonlit field.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Suzy, Walk four hundred yards due
dialog: north from your house to the dirt path
dialog: which has not got any name on it. Turn
dialog: right and follow to the end.
dialog: 
text: Suzy raises her binoculars to her eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: I will meet you in the meadow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
dialog: 
text: The next morning. The end of the path cut through the high
text: grass where Sam and Suzy met the day before. Captain Sharp,
text: Scout Master Ward, Mrs. Bishop, and Becky stand in two groups
text: talking. Gadge and Skotak stretch a string with ribbons tied
text: to it from stake to stake marking a perimeter. Lazy-Eye walks
text: with the wire-haired terrier pulling at its leash. Other
text: scouts search the field and scan the horizon.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp's station wagon and Redford's motorcycle are
text: parked in the dirt.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop stands off to the side by himself poking at the
text: ground with a stick. He has two black eyes, and half his face
text: is swollen and purple. Scout Master Ward asks Becky quietly:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: What happened to him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: I'm not sure. I think he went searching
text: in the dark.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop says loudly without looking up from the ground:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: She stole the batteries out of my
dialog: flashlight.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward looks at Becky and grimaces. Becky raises
text: an eyebrow. Mrs. Bishop stands next to Captain Sharp. They
text: move slightly away from the others. Captain Sharp whispers
text: quickly, almost inaudibly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I think he's onto us.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (INSTANTLY)
dialog: Of course, he is.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp looks surprised and defensive. He whispers
speaker_heading: BACK:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Of course, he is?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Of course, he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: Why aren't we worried about that, then?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (ASTONISHED)
dialog: Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I
dialog: thought I was wrong. Did you hit him?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
text: No. He fell in a ditch.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Nickleby pops up from below the tall grass and thrusts an
text: empty can of cat food into the air. He shouts excitedly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKLEBY
dialog: Cat food! I think it's a clue.
dialog: 
text: The group quickly gathers around Nickleby. Mr. Bishop
text: snatches the can out of his hand and examines it. He says
speaker_heading: BLANKLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: That's her.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop throws the can away over his shoulder and walks
text: off with his hands in his pockets. Nickleby runs after the
text: can and picks it up again. Mr. Bishop continues down the
text: hill. Scout Master Ward watches him. He asks Mrs. Bishop,
speaker_heading: UNEASY:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Where's he going?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop follows Mr. Bishop. Captain Sharp turns to the
text: rest of the group and says briskly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: All right. We know they're together. We
dialog: know they're within a certain radius of
dialog: this spot. I'm declaring the case with
text: the county right now. Until help arrives:
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master Ward as he points to
text: various scouts and divides the group into teams:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny
text: one, and the kid with the curly hair to
dialog: come with me in the station wagon. Randy,
dialog: you drop-in and head up-river with the
dialog: rest of your troop, then split-up on
dialog: foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to
dialog: circle over this end of the island and
dialog: fly low.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A binocular shot of the seaplane flying in a pattern. It
text: banks sharply. The binocular shot tilts down. Far below, in
text: the distance, Captain Sharp's station wagon rumbles along a
text: dirt road through the woods. The binocular shot pans wide. On
text: the side of the river, Scout Master Ward's motorboat stops.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Two scouts, tiny figures, pull the camouflage net off the
text: hidden canoe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH RIDGE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Suzy watches through her binoculars while Sam crouches beside
text: her. They are hidden behind a pile of rocks. Suzy says
speaker_heading: OMINOUSLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: They found the canoe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (angry at himself)
dialog: Rats! I should've put more pine needles
dialog: on it. Let's go. We're almost there.
dialog: 
text: Sam lifts his backpack onto his back and slings his air-rifle
text: over his arm. Suzy picks up her suitcases and puts the kitten
text: on her shoulder. They walk down a narrow path through a
text: thicket. They emerge into a small clearing.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy stop in their tracks.
dialog: 
text: Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and Lazy-Eye stand in a row
text: along the edge of the woods ahead of them. Deluca brandishes
text: his hunting knife. Nickleby, Izod, and Lazy-Eye point their
text: bows and arrows. Panagle holds his walking stick weapon. The
text: wire-haired terrier strains growling at the end of his leash.
text: Deluca jerks him back. The kitten cowers. The sound of a
text: motorcycle guns, and Redford bursts through the trees, pops a
text: wheelie, and skids to a stop. He lifts his goggles.
dialog: 
text: The motor idles. Sam says finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you creeps want?
dialog: 
text: Redford shrugs and answers with a callous smile:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: We're looking for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: Because you're a fugitive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of
dialog: resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: You're still in uniform.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Sam quickly takes off his shirt and throws it aside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You
dialog: don't have that authority. We've been
dialog: deputized. Now are you going to come
dialog: along peacefully or not?
dialog: 
text: Sam takes a deep breath. He pleads:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Listen to some reason: I don't like you.
dialog: You don't like me. Why don't you stupid
dialog: idiots just let us disappear?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: It's tempting, but I can't allow it.
dialog: 
text: Deluca spits on the ground. He says to Suzy:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELUCA
dialog: You shouldn't be friends with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (OFFENDED)
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELUCA
dialog: Because he's crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (COLDLY)
dialog: Maybe you just don't know him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: We know him a lot better than you. He's
text: emotionally disturbed because his family
text: died. Nickleby, tie him up.
dialog: 
text: Nickleby takes a step forward with his bow and arrow pointed
text: and ready. Suzy looks furious. Sam flips his air-rifle off
text: his shoulder with a twirl. He points it at Redford and
text: Nickleby. Nickleby hesitates. Sam says darkly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do not cross this stick.
dialog: 
text: Sam motions to a twig on the ground in front of him. Silence.
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: You're doomed, Shakusky.
dialog: 
text: Redford revs the motor, pops the clutch, and races across the
text: clearing toward Sam and Suzy. The rest of the troop
text: converges, yelling crazily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: The wide canyon echoing with shouts, screams, and a small
text: explosion. One by one, Deluca, Nickleby, Panagle, Izod, and
text: Lazy-Eye come running out of the trees and down the hill.
text: Finally, Redford hobbles after them, limping and groaning and
text: clutching his side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Redford's charred, partially demolished motorcycle smoldering
text: in the branches of a tree.
dialog: 
text: Suzy stands on the edge of the ravine staring at the pair of
text: bloody scissors in her hand. She looks shaken. Sam takes the
text: scissors, cleans them with his fingers, and hands them back
text: to Suzy. He says gently:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It was him or us.
dialog: 
text: Suzy nods. She turns slowly away. Her eyes widen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Oh, no.
dialog: 
text: Suzy points. The wire-haired terrier lies on his back on the
text: ground with an arrow sticking out between his shoulder
text: blades. The kitten licks at the wound. Sam and Suzy run over
text: to the wounded dog. Sam crouches down, gently presses the
text: kitten away, and says bleakly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: They got Snoopy through the neck.
dialog: 
text: Suzy has tears in her eyes. She slides her hands under the
text: wire-haired terrier's body. She begins to hyperventilate as
speaker_heading: SHE SAYS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: He needs a doctor.
dialog: 
text: Sam puts his finger to the wire-haired terrier's neck. He
speaker_heading: SAYS SADLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: (trying to catch her breath)
dialog: He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go?
dialog: 
text: Suzy lifts the bleeding dog into her arms. Sam grabs her by
text: the shoulders. He locks eyes with her and says with grit and
speaker_heading: MELODRAMA:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to
dialog: make it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: Don't say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They're after us. We got to move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: (raising her voice)
dialog: He's dying! We can't just leave him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: It's too late! He's already gone!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: Stop yelling at me!
dialog: 
text: Sam slaps Suzy in the face. She falls silent. He says slowly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're
dialog: panicking. The first rule in any
dialog: emergency is you never --
dialog: 
text: Suzy drops the wire-haired terrier which hits the ground with
text: a thud. She slaps Sam back with a huge, roundhouse smack. Sam
text: falls over sideways. Suzy stands over him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Don't ever do that again. No one's
dialog: allowed to slap me.
dialog: 
text: Sam stands up and dusts himself off. He and Suzy stare down
text: at the lifeless animal. Suzy says quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: You're right. He's dead.
dialog: 
text: Sam reaches into a side-picket of his back-pack and takes out
text: an army-shovel. He assembles it. Suzy says hopefully:
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Was he a good dog?
dialog: 
text: Pause. Sam shrugs. He says distantly, even cosmically:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to
dialog: die.
dialog: 
text: Suzy slowly wraps her arm around Sam's shoulder. They squeeze
text: each other tightly. Sam sighs. He begins to dig.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STATION WAGON. DAY
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp speeds bouncing down a winding dirt road. Lazy-
text: Eye, Deluca, and Gadge sit next to him crowded into the
text: passenger seat. Lazy-Eye yells into the hand-set of the
speaker_heading: POLICE RADIO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAZY-EYE
text: She stabbed Redford in the back with
dialog: lefty scissors!
dialog: 
text: A voice responds over the speaker:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JED (V.O.)
dialog: Repeat that, please? Over.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp grabs the hand-set out of Lazy-Eye's hand. He
dialog: shouts into it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room
dialog: for a stretcher in the cockpit!
dialog: 
text: Redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the
text: vehicle. Scout Master Ward kneels next to him pressing his
text: hand firmly into the middle of his back. There is significant
text: blood. Redford moans loudly. Scout Master Ward reassures him:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: You're going to be OK. Thank goodness,
dialog: she missed the artery. Bite on this.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward puts a pencil in Redford's teeth. Redford
text: grimaces, crunching it. In the back seat, the rest of the
dialog: troop excitedly re-cap:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKLEBY
text: I tried to chop him, but he dodged my
dialog: tomahawk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PANAGLE
dialog: Who else got hit?
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IZOD
dialog: Not me. I ran away when the girl went
text: berserk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: He's got great marksmanship. He shot
text: Deluca in both arms.
dialog: 
text: Skotak points to the front seat. Deluca sits glumly in
text: silence. He has numerous small welts all over his arms. Gadge
scene_heading: SAYS SUDDENLY:

speaker_heading: GADGE
dialog: Where's Snoopy?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION. DAY
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp's station wagon skids to a stop next to his
text: office while the seaplane pulls up to the dock as Mr. and
text: Mrs. Bishop approach pedalling furiously on bicycles. Mr.
text: Bishop wears boating shoes. Captain Sharp and Scout Master
text: Ward jump out of the car. Skotak and Gadge help them remove
text: Redford on a stretcher from the back of the station wagon.
text: Mr. Bishop struggles with his kick-stand. He shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: What happened? Who's that? Why's he
dialog: bleeding?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Clear the dock, Edgar!
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp motions for the two old fishermen to get out of
text: the way. He and Scout Master Ward run with the stretcher onto
text: the dock. Mrs. Bishop is frantic:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Is Suzy with you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GADGE
text: No, she's in the woods with Shakusky.
dialog: 
text: Gadge points toward the hills. A man wearing a jumpsuit and
text: aviator sunglasses stands next to the seaplane. He is Jed. He
text: shouts as the stretcher approaches:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JED
dialog: Where'm I going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be
dialog: right behind you.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp motions for Skotak, Gadge, and Lazy-eye to help
text: Jed load the stretcher into the small cockpit. He tosses a
dialog: set of keys to Scout Master Ward and says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Warm up the motor. I'll be right back.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward takes the keys and starts untying the
text: police launch. Captain Sharp heads toward his office. Mr.
dialog: Bishop says firmly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Hold it right there. You're not leaving
dialog: this island. Our daughter's been abducted
dialog: by one these beige lunatics.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Walt, it's very clear: the two of them
dialog: conspired in this together.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Don't worry, Mr. Bishop. She'll be safe.
dialog: Sam's got excellent wilderness skills.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop wheels on Scout Master Ward. He explodes:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Why can't you control your scouts?
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward recoils. He says quietly, troubled:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: I'm trying.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop takes off his shoe and throws it at Scout Master
text: Ward. Scout Master Ward ducks, and the shoe bounces off his
text: back. Captain Sharp blocks Mr. Bishop.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Stop.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop scuffles with Captain Sharp. Mrs. Bishop jerks him
text: backwards and shouts:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Stop it, Walt!
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop faces Mrs. Bishop and Captain Sharp, breathing
text: heavily. Scout Master Ward looks depressed. Jed, Gadge,
text: Skotak, and Redford watch frozen from a gangplank alongside
text: the seaplane.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I do blame him --
dialog: (pointing to Scout Master Ward)
dialog: -- but I also blame myself and both of
dialog: you. With all due respect: you can't let
dialog: your children stab people.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: She's violent, Mrs. Bishop. Look.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward shows Mrs. Bishop the blood all over his
text: hands and uniform. Mrs. Bishop looks confused.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I don't get it. Were there witnesses?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Of course. It's assault.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I beg your pardon. Are you a lawyer?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: No, ma'am, but --
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (FURIOUS)
dialog: Well, I am!
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp gently draws Mrs. Bishop away by the shoulder.
text: He links arms with her as he tries to placate the group:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Easy does it. Calm down, Laura.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Stay away from my wife.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop pushes Captain Sharp away from Mrs. Bishop into
text: Scout Master Ward. Scout Master Ward lunges at Mr. Bishop but

speaker_heading: REPEATEDLY:
dialog: 
scene_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP/MR. BISHOP SCOUT MASTER WARD/MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Dammit! Christ! Shit! Jesus!
dialog: 
text: At this moment, a voice interjects from the shore:
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me, Captain
dialog: Sharp?
dialog: 
dialog: Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop
text: stop fighting and turn around at once. They see: the
text: narrator. He stands at the foot of the dock holding a journal
text: with rubber bands wrapped around it. They all stare at him
text: blankly. He continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: As some of you know, I taught Sam for the
dialog: cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a
dialog: smart boy, and he expressed a keen
dialog: interest in the history of the island's
dialog: indigenous peoples. In particular, I
dialog: recall his fascination with the idea of
text: retracing the original path of the old
dialog: Chickchaw harvest migration.
dialog: 
text: Long pause. Everyone looks utterly perplexed. The propeller
text: of the seaplane starts up, and they all shield their eyes
text: from the blast of wind and dust. The narrator hesitates. He
text: yells over the noise:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: What I'm getting at is this: I think I
dialog: know where they're going.
dialog: 
text: The narrator removes the rubber bands from his journal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A carefully hand-drafted nautical chart. A cove is marked
text: with a red arrow and the caption Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: The portable record player. Suzy's fingers place the needle
text: onto a spinning disc.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TIDAL LAGOON. DAY
dialog: 
text: A small cove enclosed by a low, rocky cliff. It forms an
text: almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines, flowers,
text: and branches. A thin channel leads out to the ocean. The sand
text: on the shore is white, and the water is perfectly clear and
text: crowded with shells at the bottom. Birds echo and fly from
dialog: tree to tree.
dialog: 
text: Sam's and Suzy's luggage is piled on the beach. The kitten
text: wanders, exploring. The lid of the portable record player is
text: open. The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker:
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
dialog: Onto the bird-house, where every kind of
text: bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling
text: around. This is a real acrobatic act for
dialog: our gifted young flute player, Paula
dialog: Robeson.
dialog: 
text: As they listen, Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks
text: and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove.
text: They each climb up a rock over the water. They look at each
text: other across the lagoon. They both laugh. Suzy shouts,
speaker_heading: SMILING:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: This is weird.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know!
dialog: 
text: Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside. Suzy
text: removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground. Sam strips
text: off his uniform down to his white briefs. Suzy take off
text: everything except her underwear and a training bra. They
text: throw their clothes into the water. Sam yells:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: On three!
dialog: 
text: Suzy immediately counts very quickly. They both scream as
text: they leap into the water. They swim toward each other,
text: laughing and shouting.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A clothesline hung with Sam's and Suzy's wet clothes swaying
text: like flags and snapping in the wind. The tent has been
text: pitched on a low, sandy plateau close to the water. Two lines
text: of shells mark a path to the entrance. A long stick is jammed
text: into the ground with a flickering safety-candle stuck into
text: the Y at the top. The kitten is asleep.
dialog: 
text: Sam sits on a folding stool in front of a portable easel. He
text: dips his brush into a tin cup and paints. Suzy poses
text: stretched out and propped up on one arm. She adjusts herself
dialog: slightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I like it here, but I don't like the
dialog: name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Me, neither.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring
dialog: to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let's change it. What should it be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Let me think for a minute.
dialog: 
text: Sam continues to paint while Suzy thinks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A binocular shot of a deep blue, star-filled sky.
dialog: 
text: Suzy lies on her back on a flat rock in the middle of the
text: cove looking up into the night. Sam wades out to her and
text: climbs up beside her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I made you some jewelry.
dialog: 
text: Sam holds up two dead, shimmering, opalescent beetles with
text: fish-hooks threaded into their shells. Suzy looks enchanted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are your ears pierced?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Inside the tent, lit by a lantern. Sam clenches his teeth as
text: he forces one of the fish-hooks through Suzy's earlobe. Suzy
text: screams murderously. Sam releases her. The beetle dangles
text: neatly. A line of blood runs down the side of Suzy's neck.
text: Sam holds up a little mirror. Suzy nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: It's pretty. Do the other one.
dialog: 
text: Sam switches to Suzy's other earlobe. She resumes her
text: screaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy standing on the beach listening to the French
text: singer's record. They face each other, bobbing their heads
text: and tilting awkwardly to the music. Suzy eventually begins to
text: dance. Sam does something vaguely like the Twist. They press
text: against each other and kiss. Suzy says quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: It feels hard.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (EMBARRASSED)
dialog: Do you mind?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I like it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Tilt your head sideways.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy kiss again. Sam pushes his hands through Suzy's
text: hair and draws it back behind her ears. Suzy whispers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: You can touch my chest.
dialog: 
text: Sam slides his hand up under the training bra and presses it
text: onto Suzy's breast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: They're going to grow more.
dialog: 
text: Sam nods. He looks to be in a trance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy sitting on a tree branch over the water eating
text: raisins from Sam's hand. Suzy has flowers in her hair. She
text: looks down into the water with her binoculars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why do you always use binoculars?
dialog: 
text: Suzy thinks for minute. She says finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: It helps me see things closer. Even if
text: they're not very far away. I pretend it's
dialog: my magic power.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: That sounds like poetry. Poems don't
dialog: always have to rhyme, you know. They're
dialog: just supposed to be creative.
dialog: 
text: Suzy gives Sam the binoculars. He points them at her and
text: stares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you want to be? When you grow up.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I don't know. I want to go on adventures,
dialog: I think. Not get stuck in one place. How
dialog: about you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck,
dialog: too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm
dialog: just repeating what you just said, but I
dialog: couldn't think of anything as good as it.
dialog: On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown
dialog: up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the
dialog: exact future.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: That's true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's possible I may wet the bed, by the
dialog: way. Later, I mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (SURPRISED)
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (RELUCTANTLY)
dialog: I wish I didn't have to mention it, but
dialog: just in case. I don't want to make you be
dialog: offended.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Of course, I won't.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Some people frown on these problems.
dialog: 
text: Suzy nods. She holds Sam's hand. She points to the scorpion
text: brooch pinned to Sam's shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: What's that one for?
dialog: 
text: Sam looks at the brooch. He shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's not an accomplishment. I inherited
dialog: it from my mother. It's actually not
dialog: meant for a male to wear -- but I don't
dialog: give a damn.
dialog: 
text: Suzy nods thoughtfully. Pause.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Are your foster parents still mad at you?
dialog: For getting in trouble so much.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think so. We're getting to know
dialog: each other better. I feel like I'm in a
dialog: family now. Not like yours, but similar
dialog: to one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I always wished I was an orphan. Most of
dialog: my favorite characters are. I think your
dialog: lives are more special.
dialog: 
text: Sam frowns. Tears suddenly well-up in his eyes. He shakes his
dialog: head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I love you, but you don't know what
dialog: you're talking about.
dialog: 
text: Long pause. Suzy says genuinely:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I love you, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A campfire burns in front of the tent. Sam lies on his back
text: on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits
text: Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud from a book called
text: The Light of Seven Matchsticks. There is an illustration on
text: the cover of a child's hand extinguishing a little flame. A
text: ribbon of smoke curls between its fingers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: The flashlight's beam drew a moon through
text: the black across the attic and settled on
text: a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no
text: bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched
text: on his flat feet and placed his hand in
text: front of the tiny opening. "It's windy,"
dialog: he said. "Like someone in there's blowing
dialog: on my fingers." Christy rolled her eyes
dialog: and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she
dialog: thought. Little brothers drive people
dialog: crazy.
dialog: 
text: Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam nods and
text: signals for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page and reads
dialog: ON:
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Part Two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OMIT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: The next morning. Sam and Suzy are asleep with their arms
text: wrapped around each other inside the tent. They wear only
text: their underwear. The sound of an airplane approaches. Sam's
text: eyes open. The noise buzzes by loudly overhead. Suzy sits up.
text: Sam scrambles to his feet, unzips the flaps of the tent, and
text: looks out. Suzy crouches beside him, holding onto his leg.
speaker_heading: THEY SEE:
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp standing on the beach fifteen feet away. Scout
text: Master Ward waits behind him with Gadge, Skotak, and Lazy-
text: Eye. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop stride up out of the water. Mr.
text: Bishop looks incensed. They are wet to the waist. The police
text: launch is moored in the lagoon. Two larger boats with St.
text: Jack Wood Fire Brigade printed on their hulls float further
text: away. Men in red caps stand on their decks.
dialog: 
text: Suzy pulls Sam back inside. She zips up the tent again. She
text: kisses Sam. Mr. Bishop hollers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Suzy! Get out here!
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop grabs hold of the entire tent by the top and rips
text: it up out of the ground, uprooting the stakes which go
text: flying. This reveals:
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy, half-naked, entwined, kissing.
dialog: 
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both freeze. Sam and Suzy look up to
text: them. Mr. Bishop growls and roars at them ferociously like a
text: monster. Sam and Suzy look horrified. Mr. Bishop's face
text: suddenly drains of all emotion. Pause. Mrs. Bishop commands
dialog: Sam and Suzy:
dialog:

dialog: Put your clothes on. Both of you.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy remain perfectly still. Mrs. Bishop grabs Suzy
text: by the arm and jerks her to her feet. Sam and Suzy hang onto
text: each other. Mrs. Bishop slaps Suzy with a whack. Sam lets go,
text: and Suzy is gone.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward comes over to Sam sadly and hands him his
text: uniform. Sam takes it. Scout Master Ward turns to the other
text: scouts, claps his hands twice, and says:
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Strike this camp.
dialog: 
text: Sam starts putting on his socks. Captain Sharp watches him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. POLICE LAUNCH. DAY
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp drives his boat along the coast with a grim
text: look on his face. Suzy rides in the back with Mr. and Mrs.
text: Bishop. Sam rides in the front with the other scouts. An
dialog: interrogation is in progress:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: How long were you planning to stay there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURRAY
dialog: You said ten days or less.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: That was a lie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GADGE
dialog: Didn't you ever think about what would
dialog: happen next?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not to my recollection.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You're a traitor to our family.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Good. I want to be.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward sits next to Captain Sharp. He shows him
text: the air-mail envelope.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: What do I do about this?
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp shrugs. He says, resigned:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Give him his mail.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward turns to Sam. He holds out the envelope.
text: Sam takes it. He opens it. He reads. Suzy watches him from
text: across the boat. She calls out anxiously:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: What does it say?
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (PUZZLED)
dialog: They can't invite me back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (OUTRAGED)
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (UPSET)
dialog: I gave them too much aggravation.
dialog: 
text: Suzy stands up. She says as she starts across the boat:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Let me read it.
dialog: 
text: Sam holds out the note. Mr. Bishop pulls Suzy back down to
text: her seat. He stands up, himself, and walks over to Sam. He
text: takes him by the wrist and leads him to a small cabin. He
text: opens the door and presses him forward. Sam stumbles down the
text: steps and looks back. Mr. Bishop shuts the door. Captain
text: Sharp glares at him. Suzy says icily:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: That's child abuse.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop returns to the back of the boat and sits down
text: again. He gives Suzy a direct order:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Be advised: the two of you will never see
dialog: each other again. Those were your last
dialog: words. Do you understand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (DARKLY)
dialog: I'd be careful if I were you. One of
dialog: these days somebody's going to be pushed
dialog: too far, and who knows what they're
dialog: capable of.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Is that a threat?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (SIMPLY)
dialog: It's a warning.
dialog: 
text: Suzy looks from Captain Sharp to Mrs. Bishop and back to Mr.
text: Bishop. Mr. Bishop falls silent.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I wish I knew what makes you tick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: I beg your pardon?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Please, terminate this conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (TO LIONEL)
dialog: She's saying that to me?
dialog: 
text: Lionel shakes his head bitterly. Suzy stares out to sea.
text: Scout Master Ward walks over to the cabin, opens the door,
text: and goes inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE LAUNCH. DAY
dialog: 
text: A small room with two bunks, two portholes, and a pile of
text: ropes. Sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap. He
text: stares at the envelope. Scout Master Ward sits down across
text: from him. He motions to the envelope and says quietly,
dialog: pausing between each sentence:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your
dialog: situation. It's not on the register.
dialog: How'd you lose your parents? I shouldn't
dialog: ask that. Never mind. I wish we had time
dialog: for an inspection back there. On the
dialog: beach. I would've given you a
dialog: "commendable". That was one of the best-
dialog: pitched camp-sites I've ever seen.
dialog: Honestly.
dialog: 
text: Sam does not respond. Scout Master Ward asks in a wounded
speaker_heading: VOICE:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: You don't want to be a Khaki Scout
dialog: anymore?
dialog: 
text: Sam shakes his head.

scene_heading: INT. POST OFFICE. DAY

speaker_heading: BECKY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
text: Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
text: fifty-year-old woman in a blue and white uniform pants-suit
text: with a Salvation Army officer-style hat and a red ribbon tied
text: in a bow around her neck. She is Social Services. She sits at
text: a desk in a cinder block office. Guards and orderlies criss-
text: cross in a bullet-proof window to a long, grey corridor
text: behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Hello? This is Captain Sharp.
dialog: 
text: Social Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball-
text: point pen. (She takes notes throughout the conversation.) She
dialog: says into her telephone:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social
dialog: Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam
dialog: Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand
dialog: he's in your custody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: That's correct.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: What's his condition? Has he suffered any
dialog: injury or trauma of any kind?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: He's OK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Very good. How do I get to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can
dialog: bring you in with the mail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's
dialog: acceptable to you. Is someone able to
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES (cont'd)
dialog: provide reasonable care and nourishment
dialog: for the boy until that time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Is that a yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Uh-huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Very good. I'll contact you again before
text: the end of the day.
dialog: 
text: Social Services starts to hang up the telephone. Captain

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Wait a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP

speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
speaker_heading: (EVENLY)
dialog: Captain Sharp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (ANXIOUS)
dialog: What's going to happen to him?
dialog: 
text: Pause. Social Services puts down her pen. She clasps her
text: hands together in front of her. She says finally:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Well, normally, we'd try to place him in
dialog: another foster home, but that option is
dialog: no longer available to us, in my opinion,
dialog: with his case history -- which means
dialog: he'll go to Juvenile Refuge.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp exchanges a look with Scout Master Ward. Scout
dialog: Master Ward interjects:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: What's that? An orphanage?
dialog: 
text: Social Services frowns. She asks calmly:
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Who's speaking?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: This is Scout Master Ward.
dialog: 
text: Social Services refers to a document in her file-folder. She
dialog: nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Right. An orphanage -- but the first step
dialog: is the admissions panel requires a
dialog: psychological evaluation to determine
dialog: whether or not the boy's a candidate for
dialog: institutional treatment or electroshock
dialog: therapy. Beyond that --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that
dialog: be necessary? He's not violent.
dialog: 
text: Social Services picks up the document. She points to it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
text: The report describes an assault with
text: scissors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (OBJECTING)
dialog: That was the girl! Who did that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but
dialog: that's not our job. OK?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (LONG PAUSE)
dialog: OK.
dialog: 
text: Social Service hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
text: out of their sockets. Scout Master Ward looks to Captain
dialog: Sharp. Silence.
dialog: 
text: Becky opens a tin of home-made lemon bars. Captain Sharp
text: declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He looks
text: completely enchanted.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The living room. There is a wicker rocking chair, a vase
text: filled with wilted wildflowers, and a portrait of some
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Pilgrims hanging over a stone fireplace. Lionel, Murray, and
text: Rudy sit together on the floor playing Parchesi.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop lurches into the doorway, shirtless. He carries an
text: open bottle of red wine with a glass in one hand and a long-
text: handled woodsman's axe in the other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: I'll be out back.
dialog: 
text: Lionel, Murray, and Lionel look up from their game. Mr.
text: Bishop hesitates. He seems slightly disoriented.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: I'm going to find a tree to chop down.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop exits. Pause. Lionel rolls a pair of dice.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SUZY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Old linoleum floor. Dark curtainless window. One bare light
text: bulb. Suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into
text: space. Mrs. Bishop washes her with a soapy sponge. Suzy's
text: clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten
text: scratching at them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean.
dialog: I've had moments myself where I say: what
dialog: am I doing here? Who made this decision?
dialog: How could I allow myself to do something
dialog: so stupid --
speaker_heading: (WITH FEELING)
dialog: -- and why is it still happening? We
dialog: women are more emotional. You have to
speaker_heading: REMEMBER --
dialog: 
text: Suzy turns to Mrs. Bishop and interrupts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I hate you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Don't say "hate".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Why not? I mean it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: You think you mean it. In this moment.
dialog: You're trying to hurt me.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: I know what you do with that sad, dumb
dialog: police man. You go to bed with him.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop looks stunned. She says quietly:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of
dialog: sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that.
dialog: It's not appropriate for me to even
dialog: acknowledge what I already just said.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather
text: folder. She pulls it out and stares at it. It is the "Coping
text: with the Very Troubled Child" pamphlet. She looks to Suzy.
text: Suzy looks away. Mrs. Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the
dialog: verge of tears:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for
dialog: you?
dialog: 
text: Suzy starts to cry. She covers her face. Her voice breaks as
speaker_heading: SHE SAYS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: We're in love. We just want to be
dialog: together. What's wrong with that?
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop puts her arms around Suzy. Suzy shakes, silently
text: sobbing. Mrs. Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's
text: hair. She studies the beetle earrings. She says wearily:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Oh, my God. How are we going to get these
dialog: fish-hooks out?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette.
text: He has a bottle of beer in his hand. Sam sits waiting at a
text: fold-out table with a glass of milk in front of him. He says
dialog: without looking up:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That
dialog: part's true. We knew people would be
dialog: worried, and we still ran away, anyway --
dialog: but something also happened which we
dialog: didn't do on purpose. When we first met
dialog: each other. Something happened to us.
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan. He nods. He says
speaker_heading: SERIOUSLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I agree with you. That's eloquent. I
dialog: can't argue against anything you're
dialog: saying -- but I don't have to, because
dialog: you're twelve years old.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves
text: three links onto one plate and three onto another. He sits
dialog: down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Look, let's face it, you're probably a
dialog: much more intelligent person than I am.
dialog: In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart
dialog: kids sometimes stick their fingers in
dialog: electrical sockets, if you see what I
text: mean. It takes time to figure things out.
dialog: It's been proven by history: all mankind
dialog: makes mistakes. It's our job to try to
dialog: protect you from the dangerous ones. If
dialog: we can.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides
text: it over to Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: You want a slug?
dialog: 
text: Sam nods. He and Captain Sharp both drink sips. Captain Sharp
text: asks gently and sincerely:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: What's the rush? You've got your whole
dialog: life in front of yourself. Ahead of you,
dialog: I mean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (DEFENSIVE)
dialog: What does that have to do with it? So are
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (SADLY)
dialog: That's true. Did you love someone ever?
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Yes, I did.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: She didn't love me back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ah.
dialog: 
text: Sam considers this. Captain Sharp looks depressed. They start
text: eating their sausages. Captain Sharp says quietly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's
dialog: what people say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
text: A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (PAINED)
dialog: Good grief.
dialog: 
text: Silence. Captain Sharp refills both their beer glasses.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a
text: cigarette in his mouth. His tape recorder is recording. He
dialog: says into the microphone:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
text: Scout Master's Log. September fourth.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward hesitates. He thinks for a minute. He takes
text: a deep breath. He closes his eyes. He opens them again. He
text: looks desperate. He looks up at the ceiling. He shakes his
text: head. He presses stop. He kneels on the floor with his palms
text: together and smokes.
dialog: 
text: There is a slight commotion outside. Scout Master Ward
speaker_heading: SHOUTS:
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Stow it, out there! I want to hear some
dialog: Z's!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TREE HOUSE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The fort sixty feet above the camp. It is still under
text: construction. The entire troop (with the exceptions of
text: Redford and Sam) has gathered for a clandestine meeting. They
text: all wear pajamas. Skotak stands on a balcony with his back to
text: the group and his hands on a wooden railing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GADGE
dialog: I heard he's going to reform school.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELUCA
dialog: I heard they're going to take out a piece
text: of his brain and send him to an insane
dialog: asylum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: I like his girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PANAGLE
dialog: She's too scruffy for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKLEBY
text: Supposedly, they got to third base.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAZY-EYE
text: That's not true. He just felt her up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
speaker_heading: (DEEPLY INTRIGUED)
dialog: Over-shirt or under-shirt?
dialog: 
text: Skotak slams his fist on the railing. Everyone looks
text: startled. Skotak turns around to face the group. He says
speaker_heading: ANGRILY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Damn us.
dialog: 
text: The railing collapses behind Skotak, ripping part of a wall
text: and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away.
text: There is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a
text: splintering thud. Skotak hesitates. He moves a half-step away
text: from the edge. He continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: This troop has been very shabby to Field
dialog: Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a
dialog: bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so
dialog: unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK (CONT'D)
text: emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a
dialog: disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?
dialog: 
text: Skotak moves among the group, looking from face to face, as
speaker_heading: HE ASKS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye?
dialog: (from the heart)
dialog: Gadge?
dialog: 
text: Skotak circles around the edge of the tree house. He says
scene_heading: WITH FEELING:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs
dialog: our help. Are we man enough to give that?
text: So part of his brain doesn't get removed
text: out of him.
dialog: 
text: Skotak stands still. He says mysteriously:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: They were prepared to die for each other
dialog: out there.
dialog: 
text: Silence. The other scouts begin to murmur to each other,
text: shaking their heads, shrugging, whispering, and gesturing.
text: Finally, Deluca looks up to Skotak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELUCA
dialog: What do you need?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
speaker_heading: (EXCITED)
dialog: For starters? Three yards of chicken
text: wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a
text: bucket of wheatpaste.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A thick tree has been chopped almost completely through its
text: trunk. For some reason, it remains standing. Mr. Bishop sits
text: on the ground leaning against it. He breathes heavily. The
text: axe rests across his lap.
dialog: 
text: A twig snaps. Mr. Bishop looks up, listening. Pause. He
text: drinks a sip of wine.
dialog: 
text: In the background, on the other side of the lawn, five small
text: silhouettes run silently in a row away from the house into
text: the trees on the left. A moment later, one taller silhouette
text: rides a bicycle silently away from the house into the trees
text: on the right.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DIRT ROAD. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp sits on the hood of his station wagon. Mrs.
text: Bishop leans against it with her bicycle in front of her.
text: They smoke cigarettes. Captain Sharp says sadly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
text: In other words, it's over.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I guess so. For the moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Until further notice.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I understand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I've got to do better. For everybody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Except me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Except you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (SINCERELY)
dialog: Well, I hope you can. I think you will.
dialog: You're doing the right thing.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Captain Sharp suddenly slides his hand inside Mrs.
text: Bishop's shirt onto her breast and simultaneously kisses her
text: -- then just as suddenly gets into his car and starts the
text: engine. Mrs. Bishop hesitates. She reaches inside the window
text: and puts her hand on the top of Captain Sharp's head. She
dialog: says, worried:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Who know what's going to happen, Duffy?
dialog: I'll probably see you tomorrow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (CALMLY)
dialog: No, you won't.
dialog: 
text: Silence. The motor idles. Captain Sharp says distantly:
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I admire them, you know? There's a purity
dialog: to it. I only feel bad because they both
dialog: seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable
dialog: people -- but maybe that's romantic.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (PUZZLED)
dialog: I don't see it that way.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp puts the car into gear and drives off. Mrs.
text: Bishop finishes her cigarette. She gets on her bicycle and
text: rides away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AIRSTREAM TRAILER. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot
text: of a bunk where Sam lies sleeping. He has the sheet pulled up
text: to his chin, but his toes stick out. He opens one eye. Dust
text: descends and settles. Something scrapes and scratches. The
text: flame burns out.
dialog: 
text: Sam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the
text: floor. He crouches in front of the fireplace. He flicks on a
text: scout flashlight and sees:
dialog: 
text: The end of a hanging rope.
dialog: 
text: Sam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up,
text: shining his flashlight. Skotak is looking down at him from
text: the top of the chimney. He puts his finger to his lips. Sam
scene_heading: WHISPERS SHARPLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Get out of my chimney.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Listen to me. We're here for friendship.
dialog: We're going to get you off this island.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (LONG PAUSE)
dialog: No, thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's worthless to me. There's no point.
dialog: Not without Suzy.
dialog: 
text: Skotak gestures for Sam to wait. He disappears from view. A

dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How'd you get here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: They snuck me down the laundry chute and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: Diversion tactics. Good thinking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: Five mini-canoes race across a wide, choppy strait close to
text: the open sea. Skotak, Deluca, Nickleby, Gadge, Lazy-Eye,
text: Panagle, Roosevelt, Chef, and Izod paddle aggressively. We
dialog: hear in voice-over:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Where we going?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK (V.O.)
dialog: Fort Lebanon. My cousin Ben runs the
dialog: Supply and Resources outpost for the
dialog: Jubilee. He's a Falcon Scout,
dialog: Legionnaire. Cousin Ben'll know what to
dialog: do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Can we trust him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK (V.O.)
dialog: Normally, I'd say no.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy ride in the back of the canoe that Skotak rows.
text: Sam has his arms around Suzy's waist. The kitten is on her
text: shoulder. Sam sees the portable record player among Suzy's
dialog: things.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Did you leave another note for Lionel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Not this time. He can't keep his trap
dialog: shut. Besides, I'll probably never see
text: him again.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's true.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A pebble beach below high dunes. Large waves sweep into the
text: shore. Spray blows through the air. There is a black
text: lighthouse on a rocky point in the distance. The narrator
text: stands at the water's edge holding a meteorologist's
text: measuring stick. He braces himself against the gusting winds.
text: He speaks to the camera:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: This is the island of St. Jack Wood,
text: extending far north from Land's End along
text: the deep-water channel that leads to
text: Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates
text: the beach from the town-ship above. A
text: small but prosperous community.
dialog: 
text: The narrator takes out a pocket barometer. He reads it. He
scene_heading: SAYS GRAVELY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: The barometer reads twenty-seven inches
dialog: and dropping. Strong winds, as you can
text: see, already at twenty-two knots.
dialog: (checks his watch)
text: The time is now four thirty-five A.M.
dialog: 
text: The narrator walks quickly out of the shot. The five canoes
text: land on the beach with the tide. Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the
text: rest of the troop quickly jump out and drag the boats up the
dialog: shore.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The room is black. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop lie in separate single
text: beds side-by-side. They both stare at the ceiling. The
text: windows rattle, the walls creak, and trees sway outside.
dialog: 
text: Long pause. Mrs. Bishop whispers:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Did you file the motion for continuance?
dialog: Peabody vs. Henderson.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: It was sustained.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Good.
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (PAUSE)
dialog: Did the judge consider your application
dialog: for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: He granted it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Great.
dialog: 
text: Silence. Mrs. Bishop's voice breaks as she says quietly:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I'm sorry, Walt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: It's not your fault. Which injuries are
dialog: you apologizing for? Specifically.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (WISTFULLY)
dialog: Half of those were self-inflicted.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop shakes her head and smiles with tears on her
text: face. A powerful blast of wind shakes the room. A night-light
text: blinks. Mr. Bishop has a lump in his throat as he says:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: I hope the roof flies off, and I get
dialog: sucked up into space. You'll be better
dialog: off without me.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (SADLY)
dialog: Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (PAINED)
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop look across at each other in the dark.
text: Mrs. Bishop says desperately:
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: We're all they've got, Walt.
dialog: 
text: Mr. Bishop takes a deep breath. He says finally, with a
scene_heading: DAWNING REALIZATION:
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: It's not enough.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STONE CAVE. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Flashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls.
text: Skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock. Gadge is tucked
text: into a sleeping bag under a ledge. The troop nestle on rocks
text: and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep
dialog: cavern.
dialog: 
text: Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe
text: while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud
text: from a book called Annabelle's Midnight. There is an
text: illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a
text: window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: "-- but I'm not going," said Barnaby
dialog: Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good,
dialog: and this time I won't get caught."
dialog: Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with
text: you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the
text: roots, caught up in the wind and danced.
text: Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and
text: pressed something into it the size of a
dialog: jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and
dialog: be ready at midnight."
dialog: 
text: Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam looks to
text: the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake. They
text: all nod and signal for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page
dialog: and reads on:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: He leapt out the window and landed in the
text: fresh-fallen snow.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
dialog: 
text: The next morning. Camp Ivanhoe. Scout Master Ward emerges
text: from his tent. He puts on his hat. The wind whips it off his
text: head. He chases it, catches it, and puts it back on with the
text: chin-strap tight. He frowns. He shouts:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: No bugle? No reveille? Lazy-eye, Gadge,
dialog: Deluca, Izod? Where's my troop? Let's go!
dialog: You're late!
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward tries to light a cigarette, but the match
text: blows out. He walks past the latrine, the workbench, the row
text: of smaller tents, and the charcoal grill. He throws his hands
text: into the air.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Chef? Breakfast?
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward shakes his head. He arrives at the picnic
text: table and rings his bell. He sits down. He opens a new issue
text: of Indian Corn. There is a picture on the cover of a scout
text: troop rappelling in Tasmania. He struggles to keep the
text: rippling pages from turning by themselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: The first page. There is another drawing of the Scout Master-
text: in-Chief. This time he is behind the wheel of a ship. His
text: signature below, once again, reads Commander Pierce. There is
text: a quotation in large text: "Anyone can hold the helm when the
dialog: sea is calm."
dialog: 
text: Pause. Scout Master Ward lowers his magazine. He looks
text: around, confused. Something dawns on him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
dialog: 
text: A small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps, charts, and
text: documents at folding tables. One of them sits at a telegraph
text: machine. He wears headphones and taps Morse code on a paddle
text: as he listens to a transmission. He looks puzzled. He swivels
text: his chair to a steno-machine and begins typing rapidly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COMMAND TENT. DAY
dialog: 
text: A triple-sized tent with a canopy in front and a large totem
text: pole looming over it. It stands on five-foot stilts. There is
text: a school bus parked next to it with letters painted across
text: its side which read Regional Jubilee.
dialog: 
text: A forty-five-year-old scout master with several medals on his
text: chest is sharpening a straight razor. He is Secretary
text: McIntire. He adjusts a hot towel on the face of a man in a
text: barber's chair.
dialog: 
text: The young telegraph operator hurries out of the tent carrying
text: a strip of paper. He hands it to Secretary McIntire.
text: Secretary McIntire stares at it. He says to the man under the
speaker_heading: TOWEL:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
dialog: You're not going to believe this one,
dialog: sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance?
text: Has now lost his entire troop.
dialog: 
text: The seated man whips the towel off his face and rises to his
text: feet. He is Commander Pierce himself. He has silver hair, a
text: moustache, and a much greater number of medals. He says in
text: disbelief as he snatches the slip of paper:
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
speaker_heading: (VAGUELY)
dialog: I couldn't say.
dialog: 
text: Commander Pierce shakes his head. He continues to study the
text: document as he sits back down. Secretary McIntire begins to
text: lather his cheeks with a brush.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A vast archway of wood, straw, and rope construction. Fort
text: Lebanon is spelled out across the top with bound sticks. A
text: large flag waving madly on a pole reads Khaki Scouts of North
text: America. A bugler on a platform plays the familiar staccato
text: tattoo. It echoes for miles.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy wait inside the gates crouched behind a row of
text: trash cans with the rest of the troop except Skotak. They
text: shiver. Sam has on his back-pack. Suzy carries her suitcase.
text: Gadge holds a tennis ball can.
dialog: 
text: A scout master in an Indian chief's headdress stops as he
text: walks by. He looks curiously at Sam and especially Suzy. He
dialog: says to Nickleby:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD SCOUT
dialog: Who's your unit leader?
dialog: 
text: Pause. Nickleby points to a fat man in an apron cooking
text: hamburgers on a grill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKLEBY
dialog: That guy.
dialog: 
text: The scout master shrugs. Skotak comes over and says
speaker_heading: FURTIVELY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
text: There's a broken gum-ball machine behind
text: the snack tent.
dialog: 
text: Skotak distributes a handful of gum-balls among Sam, Suzy,
text: and the rest of the troop. They all put them in their mouths.
text: Skotak motions for everyone to follow him.
dialog: 
text: A footbridge across a stream leads to a Quonset hut with an
text: awning in front labelled Supply Tent. A crowd of very young
text: scouts waits at a wide counter bartering over boxes of food,
text: drink, and equipment. A team of helpers collects money and
text: packages goods. At the center, there is a twenty-year-old
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: scout with a pencil behind his ear. He is Cousin Ben. He says
text: to a nine-year-old Junior Khaki:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: I don't care how they do it where you
dialog: come from. You want pop? You want candy?
dialog: You want a snake-bite kit? Get some
dialog: money.
dialog: 
text: Skotak appears and whispers something to Cousin Ben. Cousin
text: Ben nods. He says to his customers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Come back in five minutes.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben pulls a curtain shut behind the counter.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODEN PROMENADE. DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam, Suzy, Skotak and the rest of the troop follow Cousin Ben
text: briskly out a door and onto a cat-walk that runs along the
text: top of a wall made from tall, pointed logs. As they talk,
text: they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped
text: by color in the fields below. They walk past towers, huts,
text: ladders, latrines, and a catapult under construction. They
text: walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it and a
text: doctor taking a boy's blood pressure. They walk past a fleet
text: of small, antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners.
text: Five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work, eat, talk,
text: cook, and play sports and games all around the compound in
text: spite of the fierce winds. One group rides motorcycles,
text: another fires model rockets, another flies by overhead on a
dialog: cable-trolley.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben points to Sam and asks Skotak over the sound of
speaker_heading: THE WIND:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Is this him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55,
dialog: resigned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
text: He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the
dialog: can?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in
dialog: nickels.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Give it to me.
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Skotak motions for Gadge to hand Cousin Ben the tennis ball
text: can. It appears to be very heavy and jingles as it moves.
text: Cousin Ben takes it. He says to Sam:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: You badge in seamanship?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
text: Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has an
text: anchor embroidered on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
text: Good. There's cold-water crabber moored
dialog: off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an
dialog: I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as
dialog: a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life,
dialog: but it's better than shock therapy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the
dialog: chapel tent?
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben hesitates. He points behind them with his thumb:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
text: Back there, but the padre's home with the
dialog: mumps. Why do you ask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I want to bring my wife.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben stops walking. He looks Sam up and down. Suzy says
speaker_heading: BEHIND HIM:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: But we're not married yet.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben turns to Suzy. He looks back to Sam and back to
text: Suzy again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: You his girl?
dialog: 
text: Suzy nods. Cousin Ben looks intrigued. He says tentatively:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener.
dialog: I'm authorized to declare births, deaths,
dialog: and marriages. You're kind of young. You
dialog: got a license?
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy shake their heads. Cousin Ben nods. He speaks
dialog: more gently now:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: I can't offer you a legally binding
dialog: union. It won't hold up in the state, the
dialog: county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the
dialog: world due to your age, lack of a license,
dialog: and failure to get parental consent --
dialog: but the ritual does carry a very
dialog: important moral weight within yourselves.
dialog: You can't enter into this lightly. Do you
dialog: love each other?
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Are you sure you're ready for this?
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy immediately nod. Cousin Ben looks perturbed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Let me rephrase it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: We're in a hurry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
speaker_heading: (SNAPPING)
dialog: Spit out the gum, sister. In fact,
dialog: everybody.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben puts out his hand. Suzy spits her gum into his
text: palm. He throws it away over his shoulder. Sam and the rest
text: of the troop spit their gum out on the ground. Cousin Ben
scene_heading: SAYS STERNLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: I don't like the snappy attitude. This is
dialog: the most important decision you've made
dialog: in your lives. Now go over by that
dialog: trampoline and talk it through before you
dialog: give me another quick answer.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben watches as Sam and Suzy walk away and stand next
text: to a large trampoline. A small scout jumps from a high
text: ladder, bounces, and does a back-flip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy uncertain how to begin the conversation. Sam
dialog: shrugs.
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I guess we better try to pretend we're
dialog: struggling over our decision for a minute
dialog: before we go back over there and tell him --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.
dialog: 
text: Sam looks stunned. He is speechless. He stammers:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? Why? How?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to
dialog: me. It might be better to just go steady
dialog: permanently.
dialog: 
text: Sam shakes his head. He looks off into the distance. He says
speaker_heading: QUIETLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know what to say.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben counting nickels in the tennis ball can. He jerks
text: his thumb toward Sam and Suzy and says dismissively:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: I guess they're probably just trying to
text: pretend they're struggling over their
dialog: decision, but at least --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Woah!
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben looks. Suzy has her hands around Sam's throat and
text: is throttling him. Sam squirms loose and calms her down. The
text: troop watches transfixed. Sam takes a snapshot out of his
text: pocket and shows it to Suzy, explaining. Suzy nods. They come
text: back over to the group. There are tears on Suzy's cheeks. She
dialog: says to Cousin Ben:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: We're sure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: OK. Let's do a blood test.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHAPEL TENT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben stands at a collapsible altar. He wears a purple,
text: silk stole around his neck with crosses stitched into it. Sam
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: and Suzy hold a Bible with their hands on it. Skotak and the
text: rest of troop listen solemnly as Cousin Ben reads from a
speaker_heading: MANUAL:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: -- which we hereby consecrate on this
dialog: day, the fifth of September, 1965.
speaker_heading: (LOOKING UP)
dialog: That's the end of the short-form. Do any
dialog: of the witnesses have objections or
dialog: remarks? Usually, they don't.
dialog: 
text: Skotak raises his hand. Cousin Ben reluctantly calls on him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Skotak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried
dialog: about their future.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
speaker_heading: (OFFENDED)
dialog: That's my fee.
dialog: 
text: Skotak and the rest of the troop look very concerned. They
dialog: murmur to each other:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKLEBY
dialog: What's going to happen to them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GADGE
dialog: Nobody knows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELUCA
dialog: Let's take a vote.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: All in favor --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
speaker_heading: (LOUDLY)
dialog: That's my fee.
dialog: 
text: Skotak and the rest of the troop look to Cousin Ben. Cousin
text: Ben glares at them. He sighs. He points to Skotak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: You're just like your brothers. OK, give
dialog: them the tennis ball can.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to
text: his feet. Skotak takes it and zips it into a side-pocket of
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sam's back-pack. Cousin Ben hands Sam and Suzy a receipt on a
text: clipboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Sign here -- and initial here and here.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy sign and initial. Cousin Ben tears out a copy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's
dialog: go.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding
text: hands. They do not smile. Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of
text: the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces.
text: Sam touches Suzy's hair. Suzy kisses Sam's hand. They walk as
text: a group through the camp.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OMIT
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMP MARINA. DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end
text: of a narrow dock. Cousin Ben stands below them in a small
text: sailboat. He reaches up to Suzy and lifts her onboard. He
text: reaches up to Sam and lifts him onboard, too. He rigs the
dialog: sail.
dialog: 
text: Sam smiles sadly. He and Skotak do the secret handshake. The
text: others quickly join in. Suzy blows them a kiss. Everyone
text: looks choked up.
dialog: 
text: Cousin Ben unloops a line. The sails quickly catch the strong
text: wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor. Skotak and the
text: rest of troop wave and salute. They watch, bittersweet.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKLEBY
dialog: Where they going again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GADGE
dialog: He's going to work on a shrimper, if I
dialog: understand correctly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
speaker_heading: (WISTFULLY)
dialog: I wish them well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAZY-EYE
dialog: Me, too. Me, too.
dialog: 
text: Skotak sighs. He turns and starts up the dock. The others
text: follow him. Roosevelt hesitates. He points.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROOSEVELT
dialog: I think they're coming back.
dialog: 
text: Skotak and the rest of the troop stop and turn around. The
text: sailboat glides back in. Sam leaps onto the dock with the
text: tennis ball can. Suzy looks worried. Cousin Ben yells:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Be quick, sailor!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
speaker_heading: (PUZZLED)
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (QUICKLY)
text: She left her binoculars on a hook in the
text: chapel tent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DELUCA
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Just leave them.
dialog: 
text: Sam sprints up the dock. He yells back over his shoulder:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We can't. It's her magic power!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A binocular shot of Sam running full-speed through the
text: compound. He approaches quickly -- then skids to a stop.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHAPEL TENT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Redford blocks the entrance. He is dressed in white hospital
text: pajamas with a red cross on the breast pocket. His side is
text: heavily bandaged and his arm is attached to an I/V drip. He
text: lowers Suzy's binoculars.
dialog: 
text: Sam stands frozen in front of Redford. Redford stares at him
text: icily. Sam starts to say something -- then pauses. He says,
speaker_heading: INSTEAD:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You killed your dog, by the way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Snoopy?
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: Well, it couldn't be helped.
dialog: 
text: Sam nods. He asks quietly:
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why do you consider me your enemy?
dialog: 
text: Redford frowns. He says in disbelief:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the
text: back with lefty scissors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She's my wife now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: Congratulations.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago.
dialog: From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm
text: trying to understand.
speaker_heading: (IN SUMMATION)
dialog: Why don't you like me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
speaker_heading: (LONG PAUSE)
dialog: Why should I? Nobody else does.
dialog: 
text: Sam runs up to Redford and pokes him as hard as he can in the
text: scissor cut with his finger. Redford screams.
dialog: 
text: Scouts and scout masters everywhere stop what they are doing
text: and look to the chapel tent. Across the compound, Commander
text: Pierce comes out of his tent, alerted.
dialog: 
text: Sam whips the binoculars out of Redford's hands, turns away,
text: and sprints. No one moves anywhere except Sam dashing toward
text: the marina. Redford shouts at the top of his lungs:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
dialog: He's here! The fugitive! Stop him!
dialog: 
text: An emergency alarm sounds. The entire camp swings into
text: action. Two teams of scouts playing capture-the-flag descend
text: from both sides and cut Sam off from the dock. They wear red
text: and yellow jerseys over their uniforms.
dialog: 
text: Suzy jumps out of the boat onto the dock. Sam sees her beyond
text: the blockade of scouts. She waves her arms. Sam throws up his
text: hands. He sprints in a new direction, onto a wide field.
text: There is a small, pink flag on a thin stick stuck in the
text: ground at the center of a plastic ring. Sam grabs it as he
text: runs past. He looks back and sees:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A mob of fifty scouts chasing him. He circles in a giant
text: figure eight trailed by the huge group. He races up a hill
text: and stops at the top.
dialog: 
text: Sam looks down at the approaching scouts and hundreds of
text: others watching. A dark cloud rolls in casting a giant shadow
text: over the entire camp. Sam throws the little flag down at his
text: pursuers like a javelin. It sails in an arc and pokes down
text: into the grass. There is a thunderclap. Sam looks up into the
dialog: sky.
dialog: 
text: A bolt of lightning strikes him.
dialog: 
text: Sam is thrown ten feet through the air and lands on his back.
text: The tennis ball can explodes nickels. The mob of scouts stops
text: with a jolt. They look terrified. Sam sits up. He is covered
text: in black soot. His shoes are on fire. He shakes them off his
dialog: feet.
dialog: 
text: Suzy runs through the crowd of scouts and drops down on her
text: knees in front of Sam. She looks astonished. Sam says
speaker_heading: QUICKLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm OK.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Follow me!
dialog: 
text: Sam leads Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop fly at a

dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
text: Scout Master Ward, and Becky wearing their operator head-
text: phones. On the other side, we see Commander Pierce, Secretary

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
text: Stand by, Commander Pierce.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp spins around in his chair and flips a switch on
text: a two-way radio. He says into a microphone:

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Jed, re-route to St. Jack Wood. Tell
dialog: Social Services the boy's been spotted at

speaker_heading: JED (V.O.)

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP

dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
text: Affirmative. I'm on my way.
dialog: 
text: Becky plugs a cord into a socket and says:

scene_heading: INT. BISHOP HOUSE. DAY

speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP

scene_heading: EXT. MOTORBOAT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward steers his outboard through the open

text: or even appear to notice.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST PATH. DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop scramble through
text: the woods as fast as they can. There are flashes of lightning

scene_heading: INT. COMMAND TENT. DAY

dialog: Secretary McIntire says gravely:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
dialog: That's coming our way.
dialog: 
text: Captain Pierce nods, worried. The capture-the-flag scouts in

text: Commander Pierce points to him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: You find them?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEAM CAPTAIN
dialog: No, sir.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: (to the entourage)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICES (O.S.)
dialog: More sandbags! We need dry blankets! Wake

dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCOUT FESTIVAL. DAY
dialog: 
text: The entire brigade of scouts stands assembled in formation in

dialog: Commander Pierce shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: Attention, company! Prepare for --

dialog: Who's that?
dialog: 
text: Secretary McIntire and the commander's entourage turn to see:
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward speeding toward the dock in his motorboat.
text: He leaps to shore, throws a line over a post, and sprints up
text: to the assembly. He salutes Commander Pierce. Commander
text: Pierce frowns and asks with quiet ferocity:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: You call yourself a Khaki Scout?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: I'm sorry, sir?

speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
speaker_heading: (DISGUSTED)
dialog: You're a liability to us.

scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
speaker_heading: (IN EXPLANATION)
dialog: The incident may affect our insurance

text: Commander Pierce looks at Scout Master Ward's breast pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: A name-tag that reads Scout Master Ward next to a patch with

text: Leadership underneath.
dialog: 
dialog: Commander Pierce says bitterly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: I'm field-stripping you of your command.
dialog: 
text: Commander Pierce rips the patch off Scout Master Ward's
text: uniform and throws it aside. He holds out his hand, palm up.
text: Scout Master Ward looks stricken. He reaches into his pocket,
text: takes out his scout pocket-knife, and hands it Commander
text: Pierce. Commander Pierce puts it into his own pocket. He
speaker_heading: SHOUTS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: Attention, company! Prepare for emergency
dialog: evacuation!
dialog: 
text: Secretary McIntire leans close to Commander Pierce. He
scene_heading: WHISPERS DISCREETLY:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
dialog: Sir, do you have your medicine?
dialog: 
text: Commander Pierce hesitates. He holds up a finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: I'll be right back.
dialog: 
text: Commander Pierce strides back into the command tent.
text: Secretary McIntire looks to Scout Master Ward, uneasy. Scout
text: Master Ward stares down at the ground.
dialog: 
text: The flash-flood explodes out from the woods.
dialog: 
text: Gushing water pours down the hillside, cuts a swath through
text: the center of the camp, and tears down everything in its
text: narrow path. The command tent suddenly becomes a tiny island
text: at the center of a rushing river.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The company is taken aback. Scout Master Ward stiffens,
text: watchful. The totem pole creaks and sways, then falls cleanly
text: onto the command tent, splitting it down the middle. Inside,
text: something sparks, pops, then blows up. The tent bursts into
text: flames.
dialog: 
text: Secretary McIntire does not react. He stands perfectly still,
text: watching the fire. Scout Master Ward taps him, grabs him, and
text: shakes him. Secretary McIntire looks at him blankly. Scout
text: Master Ward makes a snap decision. He turns to the company
scene_heading: AND SHOUTS:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Hold your position!
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward runs ahead, splashes into the raging flood,
text: wades through it against the current, dodging branches and
text: debris, then pulls himself up onto the fallen totem pole and
text: walks balancing on it to the burning tent. He disappears
dialog: inside.
dialog: 
text: Secretary McIntire and the vast company watch, riveted.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward comes out the opposite side of the tent
text: onto the other end of the fallen totem pole carrying
text: Commander Pierce over his shoulders. He descends back into
text: the water, trudges through it, and steps up onto the
text: embankment. The company looks deeply, permanently impressed.
dialog: Scout Master Ward hollers:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Company Secretary! Status report, sir!
dialog: 
text: Secretary McIntire hesitates. He stirs to attention and says
scene_heading: ENTHUSIASTICALLY:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
dialog: All accounted for, Scout Master!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Supply and Resources! Call it out!

speaker_heading: COUSIN BEN
dialog: Affirmative, sir!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Fall in! We're going to run for it, boys!
dialog: Let's move!
dialog: 
text: The entire company follows Scout Master Ward with Commander
text: Pierce over his shoulders at a fast jog out of the camp.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH. DAY
dialog: 
text: The room has now been converted into a full-fledged refugee
text: center. Families from the town-ship huddle in pews with bags
text: and piles of their wet belongings. Priests and nuns
text: distribute towels and sandwiches to frightened children. Dogs
text: and cats prowl nervously. Sandbags are stacked in low walls
text: outside the doors and windows. The rain beats on the roof,
text: and lightning continues to flash through the stained glass.
dialog: 
text: A side door opens. Captain Sharp comes in from the storm with
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Lionel, Murray, Rudy, and the two old
text: fishermen follow closely behind them. They slam the door.
text: Captain Sharp looks around frantically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Who's in charge here?
dialog: 
text: Another side door opens. Scout Master Ward jogs in with
text: Commander Pierce still over his shoulders and the entire
text: company behind him flooding into the room. Captain Sharp
dialog: yells to him:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Randy! What happened?
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward goes over to Captain Sharp and turns his
text: back to him, jogging in place.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Take the commander off of me.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp helps Commander Pierce down off Scout Master
text: Ward's back and into a pew to rest. Secretary McIntire
text: assists them. Mr. Bishop strides up the aisle yelling to the
dialog: left and right:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Suzy? Sam?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: (shaking his head)
text: They ran away again.
dialog: 
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop grimace, unbelievably frustrated. Scout
dialog: Master Ward addresses the scouts:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: We're going back out. I need volunteers.
dialog: 
text: Hands raise. Scout Master Ward passes out walkie-talkies as
dialog: he chooses his squad:
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: You, you, you, you --
dialog: 
text: Becky steps in front of Scout Master Ward with her hand
text: raised. Scout Master Ward hesitates.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: -- and you?
dialog: 
text: Becky takes a walkie-talkie. She looks at Scout Master Ward
text: with admiration and asks, concerned:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Are you all right?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (WARMLY)
dialog: Of course, I am. Come on.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward leads Becky by the arm through the crowded
text: church as they begin to gather supplies: extra flashlights, a
text: flare gun, coils of rope.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp looks up to the choir loft. Eleven children
text: dressed in animal masks sit quietly in a row. Captain Sharp
text: does a double-take. One of the animals is an otter wearing
text: Sunday-school shoes and binoculars around its neck. Next to
text: her is the male of the species in a sash with numerous small,
text: embroidered patches on it.
dialog: 
text: The front doors open. There is lightning, thunder, wind, and
text: rain. Social Services enters. She takes off a wet cape with a
text: red lining and hands it to an acolyte in a robe. Jed presses
text: the doors shut behind them. Social Services asks immediately:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Where's the boy?
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp hesitates. He says reluctantly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: We don't know yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: That's not acceptable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: (pretending to be irritated)
dialog: What do you want me to say, lady?
dialog: (to no one in particular)
dialog: Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee.
dialog: 
text: The acolyte runs to the coffee dispenser with a cardboard
text: cup. Social Services charges over to Captain Sharp.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: You're Captain Sharp?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy
dialog: to your personal custody. You're
dialog: responsible for his safety. I'm told he
text: was just struck by lightning.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp frowns. He looks to Scout Master Ward and says
speaker_heading: SKEPTICALLY:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: That's the first I heard of it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (UNFORTUNATELY)
dialog: It's true.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp tries to process this. Social Services now
text: moves in on Scout Master Ward. She says aggressively:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Scout Master Ward, I presume?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Yes, ma'am.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
speaker_heading: (BITINGLY)
dialog: Your reputation precedes you.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward stand side-by-side in
text: front of Social Services. She berates them:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: You two are the most appallingly
dialog: incompetent custodial guardians Social
dialog: Services has ever had the misfortune to
speaker_heading: ENCOUNTER --
speaker_heading: (SHOUTING)
dialog: -- in a twenty-seven year career!
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward look sheepish. Social
dialog: Services says bitterly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: What do you have to say for yourselves?
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp hesitates. He says strangely:
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: You can't do this. They'll eat him alive
dialog: in there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: (aside, to Scout Master Ward)
dialog: What's the name of the place again?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Juvenile refuge?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (HORRIFIED)
dialog: Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail.
dialog: 
text: Silence. In the background, the acolyte picks up Panagle's
text: walking stick weapon off the floor. He stares at it, puzzled.
dialog: Social Services says carefully:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Just find the boy -- and deliver him --
dialog: (motioning to herself)
dialog: -- to Social Services. Nothing else is in
dialog: your power.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (SHARPLY)
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
text: Social Services, Captain Sharp, and Scout Master Ward turn to
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop looks tense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: Can we get back to the rescue now?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (URGENTLY)
dialog: Suzy's still out there.

speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
speaker_heading: (FROWNING)

scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD

dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: I object to that description. She was

dialog: 
text: Commander Pierce appears with an oxygen mask over his face.
text: He pulls it aside briefly and says to Secretary McIntire:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: I want the details. Where's the scout she
dialog: knifed?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
dialog: Right here.
dialog:

speaker_heading: COMMANDER PIERCE
dialog: (through the oxygen mask)
dialog: What's his condition?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRETARY MCINTIRE
dialog: He may suffer some limited chronic kidney
dialog: insufficiency. Here's the report.
dialog: 
text: Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce a doctor's report.
text: Mrs. Bishop snatches it and throws it over her shoulder.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
dialog: We don't have time for this!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: She's right!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Let's go!
dialog: 
text: Social Services turns and starts up the aisle. She stops
text: suddenly. Captain Sharp is standing in their path brandishing
text: Panagle's walking stick weapon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Nobody's going anywhere.
dialog: 
text: Everyone stops. Captain Sharp locks eyes with Social
text: Services. He says in a steely voice:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
text: He's not getting shock therapy.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Social Services looks furious. Her jaw sets. She reaches
text: inside her jacket and withdraws a small pad labelled Citation
dialog: Book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: That's it! I'm citing you for gross
dialog: misconduct! You are hereby summoned to
dialog: appear before the board of --

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: I'm writing you up back! Be notified that
dialog: you stand accused of the mistreatment and

speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: I won't let you do it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REDFORD
speaker_heading: (SCREAMING)
dialog: Look!
dialog: 
text: Everyone looks. Redford is standing on a pew with his arm
text: stretched out pointing up at the choir loft in amazement. The
text: troop is there, but Sam's and Suzy's seats are empty.
dialog: 
text: There is a flash, a bang, and all the lights in the room go
text: out at once. People gasp. Candles flicker alight on
text: candlesticks. A back-up generator kicks into gear, humming,
text: and the room fills with a new, different light.
dialog: 
dialog: Captain Sharp says to himself:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: They're gone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (CONFUSED)
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP

speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: They're here?
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp strides down the aisle. He shouts up to Skotak:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Where'd they go? Answer me!
dialog: 
text: Skotak hesitates. He and the rest of the troop all look up to
text: a small, rickety, attic door. It is slightly ajar above a
text: long, narrow ladder behind the pipes of the organ.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp bolts up the steps. Everyone follows him,
dialog: running.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The storm rages. Captain Sharp opens a trap door onto the
text: high eaves. Faces appear in numerous windows below, looking
text: up. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop poke their heads out behind Captain
text: Sharp. On the far end of the rooftop, Sam and Suzy huddle
text: together at the base of the high steeple.
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp stares up at Sam and Suzy, dumbstruck.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy quickly start climbing a rusty gutter up the
text: side of the steeple. Captain Sharp looks astonished. He
speaker_heading: HOLLERS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Halt! Stop!
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy continue to climb. Captain Sharp shouts back to
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop over the roaring wind:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Stay there!
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward appears and thrusts out the coil of rope.
text: He yells to Captain Sharp:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Take this!
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp throws the rope over his shoulder and advances.
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop both crawl out after him, but Scout
text: Master Ward pulls them back. Mr. Bishop looks to Mrs. Bishop.
text: They are both terrified and helpless. They hold on to each
dialog: other tightly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp tight-rope-walking along the edge of the
text: slippery roof with his arms stretched out sideways,
text: balancing. He army-crawls up steep slate shingles and reaches

text: arrived at the top. They inch away sideways around a ledge
text: and disappear to the other side. Captain Sharp's voice
speaker_heading: STRAINS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Where you going? What are you doing? Come
dialog: down!
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp rubs his eyes. He knots one end of the rope
text: around his waist and ties the other to a pipe at the foot of
text: the gutter. He pulls the rope tight, presses his foot on the
text: wall, and gets ready to start climbing -- then stops
text: suddenly. He hesitates. He pulls the walkie-talkie off his
text: belt and yells into it:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Social Services? Do you read me? Over!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy at the top of the steeple standing with their
text: backs against a painted cross. They look out.
dialog: 
text: The entire church has become an island. The cemetery is under
text: water, and the circling streets are fast rivers. Suzy turns
text: to Sam. They both appear relatively calm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: We might have to swim for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How deep is it? I didn't bring my life
dialog: jacket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I don't know, but if it's too shallow,
dialog: we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: OK.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy link arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp climbing the steeple as Social Services yells
text: at him over the speaker of his walkie-talkie:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.)
dialog: Application denied! I'm sorry! Over!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
speaker_heading: (FRUSTRATED)
dialog: Counsellors? What's the legal
dialog: perspective? Over!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Mr. and Mrs. Bishop watching from the trap door with Scout
text: Master Ward. Mr. Bishop's eyes widen. He turns quickly to
text: Mrs. Bishop. She nods, energized. Mr. Bishop grabs Scout
text: Master Ward's walkie-talkie and shouts forcefully:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
dialog: In this state? I would litigate with
dialog: extreme confidence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (ABSOLUTELY)
dialog: I concur.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MRS. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (INSPIRED)
dialog: Open with article fifteen of the Codes of
dialog: Civic Jurisdiction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP
speaker_heading: (FROM MEMORY)
dialog: No party, under any circumstance, shall
dialog: be denied due and proper consideration...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Social Services' face, inscrutable, as she listens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy preparing to jump. They each take a deep breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
text: On three again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (SUDDENLY)
dialog: Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: they capture us, and we never see each
dialog: other again anymore -- thank you for
dialog: marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you,
dialog: Suzy.
dialog: 
text: Suzy looks deeply moved. She kisses Sam. A little electric
text: zap crackles at their lips. Suzy's eyes widen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUZY
dialog: I think you've still got lightning in
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let's jump.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy look down at the water again. Captain Sharp's
text: voice screams from off-screen:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP (O.S.)
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy recoil. Captain Sharp appears, clinging to the
text: corner of the ledge. He shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Goddammit!
dialog: 
text: Sam and Suzy retreat slightly. Captain Sharps waves his hands
text: in surrender. He yells into the walkie-talkie:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Tell him! Over!
dialog: 
text: Captain Sharp holds out the walkie-talkie. Social Services
text: voice comes over the scratchy speaker once more. She shouts:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES (V.O.)
dialog: Captain Sharp is offering to assume the
dialog: responsibility of foster parenthood!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward watching from the trap door with Mr. and
text: Mrs. Bishop. He says excitedly into his walkie-talkie:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: He wants you to live with him!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Social Services watching from an attic window. She says
text: softly into her own walkie-talkie:
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCIAL SERVICES
dialog: Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sam staring at Captain Sharp. Captain Sharp says hopefully:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: What do you think, pal?
dialog: 
text: Tears stream down Sam's cheeks in the rain. He looks to Suzy.
text: She nods. She holds Sam's hand, and Sam reaches out to take
text: Captain Sharp's. Captain Sharp says into the walkie-talkie:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: We're coming down! Over and out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Inside the church. The congregation listens on another walkie-
text: talkie. They are all just about to burst into a cheer -- when
text: there is a second, brighter flash followed by a much louder
text: bang and then a terrible, thunderous, ripping explosion. The
text: lights go out again. Everyone screams.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH ROOF. NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: Scout Master Ward, Mr. and Mrs. Bishop, and Social Services
text: stare with their mouths open in frozen horror. The entire
text: steeple has disappeared. Only a twisted stump remains. Off
text: the edge of the roof, at the end of the rope, dangling in the
text: rain, Captain Sharp hangs swinging with Sam's hand in his
text: fist and Suzy's in Sam's. Voices shout in a panic above. Sam
text: and Suzy look up at Captain Sharp. He says to them evenly,
text: swaying above the rushing water:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN SHARP
dialog: Don't let go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Three days later. The detached steeple of the church lies on
text: its side on the roof of a smashed Volkswagen. The ground is
text: covered with strewn branches and trash. Sandbags still
text: surround the building. The narrator stands in front of the
text: wreckage and addresses the camera:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: The Black Beacon storm was considered by
dialog: the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather
dialog: to be the region's most destructive

dialog: meteorological event of the second half
dialog: of the twentieth century.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD. DAY
dialog: 
text: A basketball backboard sticks up out of nine feet of standing
text: water. The net grazes the surface. The narrator sits in a
text: rowboat floating alongside it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: It lingered through six high-tides and
dialog: inundated the islands with punishing
text: winds and extreme high waters.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC BEACH. DAY
dialog: 
text: An enormous neon ace-of-spades with the word Open spelled in
text: broken light-bulbs above it is jammed sideways into a sandy
text: beach. Brightly painted wooden planks are littered
text: everywhere. The black lighthouse remains intact in the
text: background. The narrator, now tiny in the frame, continues:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: On St. Jack Wood, powerful surges broke
text: the arcade boardwalk and demolished the
text: village bandstand and casino.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCOUT CAMP. DAY
dialog: 
text: One week later. A repaired Camp Ivanhoe sign is being hoisted
text: up into place above the entrance. Scouts throughout the camp
text: hammer, chop, nail, and saw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT:
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward's portable night stand. The reel-to-reel
text: tape recorder is recording. The photograph of the Scout
text: Master-in-Chief at the Matterhorn has been replaced by a
text: picture of Becky operating her switchboard.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCOUT MASTER WARD'S TENT. DAY
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward says into the microphone:
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Scout Master's log. October tenth.
dialog: Reconstruction continues increasingly
dialog: ahead of schedule, which I attribute to a
dialog: particularly robust esprit de corps among
text: the troop. The latrine, however,
dialog: continues to present --
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward notices Skotak and a young boy with glasses
text: standing in the doorway. He says, off-mic:
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: Is this the new recruit?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: Yes, sir.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
dialog: What's his rank?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SKOTAK
dialog: He doesn't have one.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SCOUT MASTER WARD
speaker_heading: (ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
dialog: Pigeon Scout! Let's get you a patch.
dialog: 
text: Scout Master Ward presses stop on his tape recorder and leads
text: Skotak and the young boy out of the tent. The narrator

dialog: The coastal areas of New Penzance were

text: The narrator's nautical chart. The cove is no longer

text: Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WIDE MEADOW. DAY
dialog: 
text: One year later. The sky is blue. Wildflowers grow in the tall
text: grass. The narrator, now in shirtsleeves, concludes:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: But harvest yields the following autumn
dialog: far exceeded any previously recorded, and
dialog: the quality of the crops was said to be
dialog: extraordinary.
dialog: 
text: The narrator lingers for a moment, looking into the camera --
text: then turns away and walks down the hillside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY
dialog: 
text: The landing at the top of the staircase. The portable record
text: player sits on the braided rug with the turntable spinning. A
text: child's voice says over the speaker:
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
dialog: So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten
dialog: has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now
text: he puts it back together again in a
dialog: fugue.
dialog: 
text: Lionel, Murray, and Rudy lie on the floor on their stomachs,
text: propped up with their chins on their fists. They listen.
dialog: 
text: Suzy sits in a small armchair reading a book called The
text: Return of Auntie Lorraine. There is an illustration on the
text: cover of a leathery, old woman and a girl with a pony-tail
text: looking together into a crystal ball. The kitten scratches at
text: Suzy's feet.
dialog: 
text: Sam sits on a stool painting a picture at the small easel. He
text: wears a miniature version of Captain Sharp's short-sleeved
text: uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Bishop's amplified voice booms from the bottom of the
speaker_heading: STAIRS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
dialog: Suzy? Lionel, Murray, Rudy! Dinner!
dialog: 
text: Sam starts. Lionel, Murray, and Rudy look up from the record
text: player. Suzy is impassive. Mr. Bishop's voice takes over the
speaker_heading: MEGAPHONE:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
dialog: Don't make us ask twice!
dialog: 
text: Lionel, Murray, and Rudy jump to their feet and race down the
text: stairs. Sam dashes to the window. He opens it, climbs out,
text: and disappears. Suzy closes her book and rises to her feet.
text: Sam's head pokes back up from below. He and Suzy lock eyes.
dialog: 
text: Sam smiles. He whispers to Suzy urgently:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: See you tomorrow.
dialog: 
text: Suzy smiles back. Sam ducks away. Suzy goes over to the
text: window and looks out with her binoculars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: A binocular shot of Sam dropping to the ground and running
text: across the back lawn, into the trees. He comes out on the
text: dirt road where Captain Sharp waits, sitting on the hood of
text: his station wagon, smoking a cigarette. They both get into
text: the car and drive off.
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suzy lowers the binoculars. She pauses in front of the easel
text: and looks at the picture. She walks quietly away down the
text: stairs. The kitten follows her. The record continues to play
text: on the empty landing.
dialog: 
text: The camera moves in toward Sam's painting on the easel. It is
text: a watercolor landscape of Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. The tent is
text: pitched on the beach, and Sam's and Suzy's clothes hang on
text: the clothesline. Written in the sand with seashells just at
dialog: the water's edge are the words:
