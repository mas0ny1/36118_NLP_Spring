text: TITLE UP: THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A series of shots of a pristine, classic American small town.
text: Something straight out of Pleasantville.
text: --People walk down the street and say smiling goodmornings as
text: they pass each other.
text: --A milkman drops off milk to a white picket fenced house
dialog: --Children ride their bikes to school
text: -- People exit a bakery with fresh rolls.
scene_heading: TITLE UP: SMALLTOWN, USA
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
text: We pan through a bedroom who’s walls are covered with
text: posters. Muppet posters. Muppet newspaper clippings. A framed
text: photo of a Time magazine cover which features Kermit standing
text: in front of the rest of the Muppets with a headline that
dialog: reads “Who's the funniest Muppet.”
text: There is also a row of framed photos, the first is of a young
text: boy with a nondescript brown Puppet. We follow the row of
text: photos as the boy grows progressively older, his puppet
text: always by his side, ageless. We reach the last photo of the
text: row and the boy is now thirty, arm around his puppet.
text: We continue to pan and find the man, Gary, laying in bed
text: peacefully asleep, a contented smile on his face. THE ALARM
text: GOES OFF. Gary lazily wakes up.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Walter! Wake up! Today’s the day we
dialog: go to Los Angeles!!!
text: We widen to reveal Gary’s brown puppet asleep in a smaller
text: bed next to Gary ala Ernie and Bert.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (waking excitedly)
dialog: Los Angeles!!! I can’t believe it!!
dialog: We’re gonna get to go to Muppet
dialog: Studios right!? You promised!? You
dialog: weren’t pranking me right!!? If you
dialog: were pranking me that’s a really
dialog: mean prank!!!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: No buddy! I would never prank you
dialog: like that! You’re my best friend! I
dialog: know you love the Muppets!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Wooo hooo! Let’s get ready! Los
dialog: Angeles, here we come!!!!
text: Walter hops out of bed and begins dancing around the room. He
text: is actually a pretty good dancer, if not a bit spastic.
scene_heading: EXT. GARY AND WALTER'S HOUSE - LATER
text: Gary and Walter exit their small but charming house wearing
text: matching Powder Blue suits and brown ties which are way too
text: short with knots that are far too large. They each carry a
text: suitcase, Walter’s obviously is far smaller.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Alright old buddy, let’s go grab
dialog: Mary at School and we’re off to Los
dialog: Angeles!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Los Angeles!
text: The two walk, a spring in their step, literally across the
text: street to a charming and small schoolhouse which reads
scene_heading: “SMALLTOWN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL”
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOLHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Gary and Walter enter the back of a small classroom where
text: MARY (25) is teaching a class of 3rd Graders.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: So, I hope you all have an amazing
dialog: spring vacation! Try to study your
dialog: timetables in between having a
dialog: whole lotta fun!!! Love you kids!
dialog: See you in two weeks!!
text: The kids all rise and head out. One by one, they each hand
text: Mary an apple until she is left with thirty or so apples.
text: Gary approaches and gives her a small kiss.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Hey, so you all ready for our big
dialog: vacation?!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You bet! This is the best
dialog: anniversary present ever! We are
dialog: gonna have such a great time. I've
dialog: always dreamt of seeing Los
dialog: Angeles!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And the Muppet Studios!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You bet Walter! Now let me grab a
dialog: sack for these apples and let’s get
dialog: going! To Los Angeles!!
speaker_heading: WALTER/GARY
dialog: To Los Angeles!!!!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - LATER
text: Walter, Gary and Mary wait excitedly at the Smalltown bus
text: stop. Mary has her suitcase and a big sack of apples. After a
text: moment an absolutely pristine, perfectly polished shiny
text: silver old time greyhound bus pulls up with a sign that says
text: “LOS ANGELES” They get on the bus. We watch as the bus pulls
text: away, travelling only a few yards before it passes a sign
dialog: which reads:
text: “NOW LEAVING SMALLTOWN, USA. WE’LL MISS YOU!!!”
text: As they leave Smalltown, USA the population sign drops from
dialog: 102 to 99.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
text: We pan through the bus. Literally everyone is eating one of
text: Mary’s apples. We reach Gary, Mary and Walter towards the
text: back of the bus.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I can’t believe it! A tour of the
dialog: Muppet Studios! Who knows, maybe
dialog: Kermit will be there!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I wouldn’t get your hopes up
dialog: Walter. You know the Muppets broke
dialog: up. I don’t think they use the
dialog: studios for anything but tours
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I think that’s just an internet
dialog: rumor, like Global Warming.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Actually Global Warming is a very
dialog: real---
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Muppet Studios! I just can’t
dialog: believe it!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: It'll be great. Now if you don’t
dialog: mind, I think we’re gonna try to
dialog: get some sleep buddy!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Sure, no problem!
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER:
text: Walter is sitting next to an old lady who is clearly trying
dialog: to sleep.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: And then there was an episode where
dialog: Gonzo and Fozzie---
speaker_heading: OLD LADY
dialog: If you don’t mind, I’m trying to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER:
text: Walter sits next to a ten year old kid.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And then one time, Miss Piggy was
dialog: doing “Pigs in Space” and she---
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: If you don’t mind, I’m trying to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: MOMENTS LATER:
text: Tight on Walter talking.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: And Rolph, man, Rolph could play
dialog: piano like nobody else.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Listen kid, I’m trying to sleep.
text: Widen to reveal Walter is talking to the bus driver.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY
text: The bus, which is now a regular, dirty, modern day Greyhound
text: pulls up in front of the Mann’s Chinese Theater. The doors
text: open and our heroes get off and take in their surroundings,
text: awestruck.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I can’t believe it. Los Angeles!!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We're really here!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (really excited)
dialog: Oh my gosh!! It’s Superman!!
text: A middle aged, unshaven man dressed as Superman approaches.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Want a Picture?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (thrilled)
dialog: Please!!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Thank you so much!!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (pulling out her camera)
dialog: I'll take it!
text: She snaps a picture of the three of them.
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: Ten bucks.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh...um...I didn’t realize...
speaker_heading: SUPERMAN
dialog: You already took the picture. Ten
dialog: bucks, now, or I break your camera.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (sotto to Gary)
dialog: Gary, he’s Superman, you better do
dialog: what he says.
text: Gary hands over ten bucks. Superman walks away.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Just... unbelievable. I can’t
dialog: believe we met Superman!!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Guys, I don’t think that was the
dialog: real---
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Superman! Unbelievable! So, when do
dialog: we go to the Muppet Studios?!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (checking his itinerary)
dialog: Our tour isn’t for an hour! Let’s
dialog: check out Los Angeles!!
text: The group cheers! BEGIN CHECKING OUT LOS ANGELES MONTAGE.

scene_heading: EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK —- CONTINUOUS
text: Our heroes are walking down the boardwalk. Gary checks his
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh my gosh! We only have twenty
dialog: minutes to get to the Muppet
dialog: Studios! Let’s go check into the
dialog: motel, unpack our things, wash up,
dialog: change, and get over there!!!!
scene_heading: EXT. MUPPET STUDIOS LA BREA - DAY
text: Our heroes come running up to the Muppet Studios out of
text: breath, showered and changed. Walter is wearing a Kermit t-
text: shirt. He takes a moment to admire the huge sculpture of
text: Kermit which adorns the studio. He begins to tremble a bit.
text: Mary puts her arm around him.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don’t be nervous Walter. It’1ll be
dialog: great!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (shaking, growing
dialog: agitated)
dialog: But..but... What if I get to meet
dialog: Kermit...and we reunite the gang to
dialog: put on a show!!! And for a while it
dialog: seems like I'll be too nervous to
text: perform, but then at the last
dialog: minute I overcome my fears! And
dialog: then he asks me be a Muppet...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Don’t worry buddy, that’s not gonna
dialog: happen. I promise. You have nothing
dialog: to worry about.
scene_heading: INT. MUPPET STUDIOS LA BREA - LATER
text: Walter, Gary, Mary and three or four other really tourist
text: looking visitors are taking a tour of the Muppet Studios,
text: which has now been turned into a Paper Factory. It could not
dialog: be more boring or corporate in appearance.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: So, this used to be the building
dialog: where all of the costumes were
dialog: designed. Now its where American
text: Paper Company punches the holes in
text: their three hole punched paper.
text: The tour watches on bored. They walk to the next building.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
text: This is where Dr. Bunsen Honeydew
dialog: and his assistant Beaker developed
dialog: almost all of their unique and
dialog: wholly impractical inventions.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Can we go inside!?
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
dialog: I'm afraid not. Now its where trees
text: are turned into mulch and pressed
text: into colored construction paper.
text: It’s filled with toxic chemicals.
text: The tour guide continues walking. He passes a very small
text: bungalow.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE (CONT’D)
dialog: And this used to be Kermit’s
dialog: office, it’s perfectly preserved
dialog: inside, just as Kermit left it. You
dialog: really should see it.
dialog: (beat, then continues
dialog: walking)
dialog: Now this next building is where
dialog: they put the lines on paper to make
dialog: lined paper. Let’s go inside and
dialog: take a look.
text: The tour follows, all except for Walter, who lags behind
text: staring at Kermit’s office. He takes a sneaky look to the
text: group, who all look extremely bored, and decides to make his
dialog: move.
scene_heading: INT. KERMIT’S OLD OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Walter opens the door to Kermit’s office. There is dust and
text: cobwebs everywhere, though everything seems to be untouched.
text: There are framed photos on the walls of Kermit with all sorts
text: of celebrities, including one with Jim Henson.
text: He passes a shelf with many award statues: An Emmy, An Oscar,
dialog: A Grammy, An NAACP Award, A Nobel Prize, An Olympic Medal. He
text: is in awe, when SUDDENLY THE DOOR BURST OPEN.
text: Walter ducks behind the desk for cover. In walk STATLER and
text: WALDORF, who are giving a tour to a man in a suit anda
text: cowboy hat. This is TEX RICHMAN, and for now, he seems nice
text: enough. He is with several of his “associates,” including an
text: unnatractive Bear puppet called Bobo.
speaker_heading: STATLER
text: This is Kermit’s old office.
speaker_heading: WALDORF
dialog: Or so we've been toad.
text: The two share a trademark chuckle.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: I’ve loved the Muppets since I was
dialog: just a boy. And what better way
dialog: sirs, to honor the Muppets than to
dialog: make this beautiful studio a Muppet
dialog: museum. A shrine if you will. I
dialog: think I’1l call this room -- The
text: Kermit’s Office Room.
speaker_heading: STATLER
dialog: We don’t care what you call it.
speaker_heading: WALDORF
text: As long as the check clears.
text: Waldorf hands Tex a giant contract.
speaker_heading: WALDORF (CONT'D)
dialog: Here’s the Standard Rich and Famous
dialog: Contract Kermit signed twenty five
dialog: years ago. This contract is
text: absolutely, positively iron clad.
dialog: With one exception that shouldn't
dialog: be an issue for any logical reason,
dialog: but I should let you know if the
dialog: Muppets put on a show and get ten
dialog: million viewers before this
dialog: contract expires, we can no longer
dialog: sell Muppet studios to you. The
dialog: contract expires...
text: (he uses a monocle to read
dialog: the fine print.)
dialog: .. in two weeks at which point this
dialog: property is yours.
speaker_heading: STATLER
dialog: If I didn’t know better I’d say you
dialog: were reciting some sort of
dialog: important plot point.
speaker_heading: WALDORF
dialog: I hope so. Otherwise I just bored
text: the audience half to death.
speaker_heading: STATLER
dialog: You mean half the audience is still
dialog: alive?
text: Statler and Waldorf laugh and exit. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
text: DOOR CLOSES, TEX’S TONE SHIFTS. HE SPEAKS MANICALLY TO HIS
speaker_heading: COHORTS.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: TEX
dialog: There’s oil under this studio,
dialog: see!!! I can smell it. I can smell
dialog: it in my wallet. Sweet sweet oil.
dialog: In two weeks, we tear this place to
dialog: the ground and start harvesting the
dialog: sweet sweet oil under this waste of
text: space. Muppets.
dialog: (he spits)
dialog: The Muppets ain’t funny!!! No one
dialog: is!! Least of all the Muppets!
dialog: They’ve never made me laugh! Not
dialog: once. The only way they could save
dialog: the studio according to this
dialog: contract is if they get back
dialog: together and put on a show within
dialog: the next two weeks that draws in 10
dialog: million viewers, but that ain’t
dialog: gonna happen. No sir. This studio
dialog: is gone, see. And me, well I’m
dialog: gonna be even richer than I already
text: am. Maniacal Laugh. Maniacal laugh.
text: Walter listens in shock as Tex’s cohorts begin laughing
text: Maniacally. Oddly Tex Richman just keeps repeating “Maniacal
text: laugh” as they all exit. Walter rises, looks around
text: nervously, then sprints out of the room.
scene_heading: EXT. HENSON STUDIOS LA BREA - MOMENTS LATER
text: Walter comes tearing out of the studio, past security,
text: emitting a high pitched and frantic scream. Gary and Mary
text: chase after him.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - MOMENTS LATER
text: The entire bus stares silently at Walter who continues to let
text: out his high pitched scream as he rides. Gary and Mary sit
text: beside him, also just staring, confused.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Walter sits on the bed continuing to scream. Finally:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (to Gary)
dialog: Gary, you've got to do something.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’ve tried everything I can think
dialog: of.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: There’s got to be something.
dialog: Gary considers.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: Sorry buddy.
text: And Gary SLAPS WALTER, sending him flying.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: WE'VE GOT TO FIND KERMIT!!!!
text: AHHHHHH!!!!! WE'VE GOT TO SAVE THE
text: STUDIO!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!1!1!
dialog: 
text: Walter runs over and SLAPS GARY sending him flying.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Gary, Mary and Walter drive through Los Angeles.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: ...then when he thought he was
dialog: alone, he said “There's oil under
dialog: this studio, see! I'm gonna tear it
dialog: the ground, see? Sweet sweet oil,
dialog: see!"
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: People still talk like that?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I know, it seemed kind of on the
dialog: nose. He said the only thing that
dialog: could stop him would be if the
text: Muppets got back together and put
dialog: on a show.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: That's impossible. The Muppets
dialog: broke up. No one can get them back
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: They're just taking a break! Kermit
dialog: can get them back together. Kermit
dialog: can do anything!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yeah, but how do we find him? No
dialog: one’s seen Kermit in years. Not
dialog: since he retired.
dialog: 12.
text: They drive past PINK’S HOT DOGS where a man with a STAR MAPS
text: SIGN is set up in front.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: STOP THE CAR!!!!!
dialog: 
text: Gary screeches to a halt.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve got an idea!!!
scene_heading: INT. CAR - LATER
text: Gary, Mary and Walter drive while eating HUGE CHILLI DOGS.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So how are we gonna find Kermit?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: The hot dog guy told me he lives in
dialog: Malibu. He’s become some sort of a
text: recluse. He never leaves his house,
dialog: and nobody ever goes in.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: So let’s go to Malibu. We’ll find
dialog: him, I know we will. To Malibu!
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DUSK
text: Our heroes drive slowly through Malibu, crestfallen.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We've been driving for hours. I
dialog: think it’s time to call it a day.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (seeing something)
dialog: Guys?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: We can’t give up Gary. We just
dialog: can’t. Even if it means searching
dialog: for days and weeks --
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’m sorry. It’s too late.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Guys!?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: WALTER/GARY
dialog: What?
text: She points out the window. Next to them is a GIGANTIC GREEN
text: MANSION WITH KERMIT’S FACE ADORNING THE SECURITY GATES.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You think they know where Kermit
dialog: is!?!?!
text: Gary and Mary just look at Walter.
scene_heading: EXT. KERMIT’S MANSION - LATER
text: Our heroes stand at Kermit’s gates, unsure as how to proceed.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: So what do we do now?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Throw me over.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What if we...
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: GARY!! THROW ME OVER ALREADY!!!
text: Walter jumps into Gary’s arms. He balls Walter up and HURLS
text: WALTER, but he doesn’t quite make it over the fence. Instead
text: he hits the top and gets ELECTROCUTED.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: OH MY GOSH!!!! WALTER!!!
text: The electricity keeps Walter on the gates for an
text: excruciatingly long time, until finally he falls, smoking, to
text: the ground. Gary rushes to his side.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT’D)
dialog: Walter!!! Walter! Are you okay?!?
text: Walter, delirious, looks up at him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Throw me again.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Guys, I have an idea...
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (melodramatic)
dialog: THROW ME AGAIN!!!
text: Mary RINGS THE DOORBELL.
speaker_heading: GARY /WALTER
dialog: ARE YOU CRAZY, WOMAN! ?
text: They wait in anticipation, finally a voice comes through the
text: intercom. IT IS KERMIT THE FROG!!!
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Hi ho.
text: A long beat. No one knows what to do.
text: BUZZZZZ. Like a scene from the Wizard of Oz, Gary, Walter and
text: Mary stand frozen as the huge gates open to Kermit’s mansion.
text: After a long beat, Kermit emerges from his front door and
text: walks towards them. He looks the same physically, but he
text: walks very slowly with a cane and wears a Hugh Hefneresque
text: smoking jacket. As he limps towards them, our group takes in
text: what is by any stretch, a sad sight. Kermit is old.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh my gosh. He’s... he’s... old.
text: As Kermit walks towards them, Walter begins to cry. Kermit
text: sees this and stops.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Are you crying? No, I was just...
text: He throws down his cane, does a perfect summersault, and
text: begins tap dancing. The gang watches confused.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: I was just kidding. It’s the whole
dialog: Willy Wonka thing. I’ve just always
dialog: wanted to do that. Come on in!
scene_heading: INT. KERMIT’S MANSION - LATER
text: Kermit, Gary and an EMBARRASSINGLY STAR STRUCK WALTER sit in
text: Kermit’s lavish living room.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I thought you were a recluse?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: No, not at all. I love people.
dialog: After I retired, that rumor got
dialog: started and then people just
dialog: stopped coming by. It gets kind of
dialog: lonely. I’m actually glad you came
dialog: by. So, what brings you here?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Well sir, my friend Walter heard
dialog: some disturbing news today.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: (to Walter)
dialog: Oh yeah, what’s that?
text: All turn to Walter who just stares at Kermit, trembling.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s the matter, cat got your
dialog: tongue?
text: Walter NODS vigorously. Kermit BENDS DOWN and grabs his cat.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, Miss Fluffy. This is
dialog: neither the time nor the place.
text: The cat SPITS OUT a puppet tongue. Kermit hands the tongue
text: to Walter who reattaches it to his mouth. They watch for a
text: painfully long beat as Walter starts shaking again, harder
dialog: and harder. Finally:
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (terrified)
text: P...PP....PPPPPPP..... Peanut!!!
text: All look at Walter, confused.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: When he’s nervous, peanut’s the
dialog: only thing he can say.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Peanut! I’m sorry. I’m nervous!!!
dialog: Peanut!!!
dialog: (growing more and more
dialog: agitated)
dialog: Peanut! Peanut!
dialog: Peanutpeanutpeanutpeanut!
text: Walter stops to catch his breath.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Oil Barron Tex Richman is gonna
dialog: tear down the studio to drill for
dialog: oil!?? And the only thing that’1l
dialog: save it is if we put on a show that
dialog: gets ten million viewers within two
dialog: weeks!?!?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (panting and nodding)
dialog: Peanut.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Put on a show? I couldn’t do that
dialog: on my own.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Well, what about the rest of the
dialog: Muppets?
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: I haven't been in touch with those
dialog: guys in years.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: You should get them back together!
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: It’s easier said than done.
text: Kermit’s face falls.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
text: SINGS “I MISS THE MUPPETS” SONG.
text: As Kermit sings he walks down a hallway of photos and
text: memories. When he reaches the end of the hallway, he
text: awkwardly turns around and sings about the same memories he
text: passed once again, however, this time he sings about how
dialog: impossible it’ll be to get back together because they all
text: have gripes with each other now.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: (a song version of this)
dialog: We would need someone to rally
text: around, someone young and innocent
dialog: and not specifically any one sort
dialog: of animal or figure in particular.
dialog: Someone like...well...
dialog: (reaching Walter)
dialog: «you.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: (shaking)
dialog: Me!?! But I’m not a Muppet.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: You could be. You seem a little...
dialog: Muppety. What’s your talent?
text: Walter starts shaking.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I...I...I don’t even have a talent!
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Of course you do. Everyone does.
dialog: You just have to find it.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: But...I don’t know where to look.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: (smiling sweetly)
dialog: I don’t know it’s just sort of...
dialog: in you. Don’t worry, you'll find
dialog: it. It’s funny, but you sort of
dialog: remind me of me when I was young.
text: Walter immediately faints.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now where were we? Ah yes, Muppets.
text: Kermit hits a button and his wet bar SPINS AROUND revealing a
scene_heading: GIANT GREEN BUTTON.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What... is... that?
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: It’s the Muppet Emergency Put ona
dialog: Show Beacon... to be pressed only
dialog: in case we need to put on a show.
dialog: I outfitted every Muppet with one
dialog: of these.
text: Kermit shows our guys his green wristwatch.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: As soon as that’s pressed, all the
dialog: Muppets shall be alerted. Will you
dialog: do the honors?
dialog: 18.
text: Walter walks over, lifts the glass shield and very
text: tentatively hits the button. The button lights up BRIGHT
text: GREEN. Suddenly SIRENS DROP DOWN all over Kermit’s house.
scene_heading: EXT. KERMIT’S HOUSE
text: Batman-style SPOTLIGHTS with a M SHOOT into the NIGHT SKY.
scene_heading: INT. KERMIT’S HOUSE
text: Kermit starts RUNNING BACK AND FORTH with his arms in the
text: air, doing a fulls scale MUPPET-PANIC.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Ahhhhh!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (panicked)
dialog: What’s happening?
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: It’s an emergency! We have to
dialog: panic!
text: After a beat, Gary, Kermit, Mary and Walter all start running
text: back and forth with their arms up.
scene_heading: EXT. CAESAR’S PALACE
text: A sign that says “FOZZIE BEAR ROAST.”
scene_heading: INT. CAESAR'S PALACE — CONTINUOUS
text: A line of comedians including Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried,
text: Jeff Garlin, Cloris Leachman, and Lisa Lampanelli roast
text: Fozzie. Fozzie pulls his hat off and wipes his face with it.
text: His watch goes off, and he runs offstage in a panic as Lisa
text: continues, though all of her curse words are Meeped out with
text: an oddly familiar MEEP...
speaker_heading: LISA LAMPANELLI

dialog: un-funny Jokesters. Fuel up my jet.
dialog: A little taunting from me and those
text: Muppets will run home with their
text: tails between their legs. Some of
dialog: them literally.
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: Isn't it possible taunting them
dialog: might only galvanize the group?
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: Galvanize!! I told you to stop
dialog: making up words you dumb Muppet
dialog: looking moron! Now git!
text: Bobo looks at him a bit hurt. He begins to leave along with
text: the cohorts.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Ain’t you boys forgetting
dialog: something?
text: They turn to him confused.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN (CONT’D)
text: Maniac laugh. Maniacal laugh.
text: Maniacal laugh.
text: They all let out their Maniacal laughs and exit.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: The cohorts and Bobo exit and stop laughing.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: COHORT
dialog: Bobo, why does he always do that?
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: COHORT
dialog: Say Maniacal laugh? Why doesn’t he
dialog: just laugh?
speaker_heading: BOBO
dialog: He can’t. He’s never laughed. Not
dialog: once. He’s never found anything
dialog: funny. That’s why he hates the
dialog: Muppets. If they can’t make him
dialog: laugh, then no one can.
speaker_heading: COHORT 2
text: He doesn’t think the Muppets are
dialog: funny...that’s crazy.
text: TEX RICHMAN’S VOICE COMES OVER THE INTERCOM.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN (0.S.)

scene_heading: INT. KERMIT’S MANSION - NIGHT
text: The entire ragtag band of heroes sit in Kermit’s living room.
text: A long beat as everyone sits in silence, then:
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: This is your house!?!?
speaker_heading: ROWLF
dialog: Whoa, man!! I thought we split up
dialog: the dough evenly!!
speaker_heading: RIZZO
dialog: Seriously! I share a basement in
dialog: Chicago with 123 other rats!!
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Oh, well, I invested in Apple stock
dialog: twenty years ago.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: I invested all my money with...BEAR
dialog: Sterns. Waca Waca! Bad move.
dialog: Seriously.
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: You guys are welcome to stay here
dialog: whenever you want. I have twenty
dialog: eight bedrooms.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Like, far out man!
speaker_heading: PEPE THE PRAWN
dialog: Far out??? Come on, ok! This is
dialog: ridiculous, ok!
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Ridiculously far out!
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: Well well. I see someone is still
dialog: celebrating being the best Muppet.
text: REVEAL that on the wall, amidst all of Kermit’s Muppet stuff
text: is a framed Time cover that reads “Who’s the Best Muppet?”
text: Kermit stands in the foreground raising his hand, while the
text: rest of the Muppets sit in the background.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Not this again. Piggy, it’s been
dialog: ten years, why won’t you let me
dialog: explain! !
scene_heading: INT. TIME MAGAZINE PHOTO SHOOT - FLASHBACK
text: The whole gang is lined up for the photo shoot.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
dialog: Alright, on the count of three
dialog: everyone say delicious flies. One,
dialog: two...
text: Kermit raises his hand and runs up to the Photographer still
text: with his hand up.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: I have to go to the little
dialog: tadpole’s room really badly. Where
dialog: is it?
text: The Photographer TAKES the photo.
speaker_heading: PHOTOGRAPHER
text: Down the hall, to the right.
scene_heading: INT. KERMIT’S MANSION
dialog: And we're back.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: I don’t believe it!
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: I swear. The Photographer took the
dialog: photo and used it without my
dialog: permission. It was a simple
dialog: miscommunication caused by my tiny
dialog: amphibian-sized bladder!
dialog: 39.
text: TIGHT ON MISS PIGGY as we go into QUICK CUTS FLASHBACK
text: -- Miss Piggy and Kermit in a line at the airport.
text: acting really antsy because he has to pee.
dialog: Kermit is
text: -- Kermit and Miss Piggy are in a theater. Kermit’s opening
text: and closing his legs really fast because he has to pee so
dialog: badly.
text: -- Miss Piggy and Kermit are at the altar. Kermit holds up
text: his finger and runs behind a bush.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: (defeated)
dialog: It is true. He does have to pee a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: That was kind of an unnecessarily
dialog: personal flashback to share,
dialog: dontcha think?
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: Wow, I guess we really should have
dialog: let you explain sooner!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sorry to interrupt guys, but if
dialog: we're going to get a show on tv in
dialog: time to save the studio, we really
dialog: gotta shake a leg!
dialog: (then, confused)
dialog: What’re you doing?
text: REVEAL all the Muppets are shaking their legs.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean we gotta kick it into high
dialog: gear!
dialog: 40.
text: REVEAL Gonzo’s on a motorcycle changing into high gear.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: No! I’m just saying we’re already
text: playing catch up.
text: REVEAL all the Muppets are holding Ketchup bottles and
text: hitting them with spoons. Mary puts her arm on Kermit’s
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: You talk to them, Kermit.
text: Piggy takes notice of her hand.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: Eh-hem. Who’s the chick...frog!?!?
text: Gary, who is next to Piggy speaks up.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh, that’s my girlfriend, Mary. She
dialog: was on the plane with us. Remember?
text: Piggy eyes her skeptically, then puts her arm around Gary.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: Really? Hmm. I never would have
dialog: guessed her for your type of
dialog: species.
text: Mary now eyes Piggy, confused and offended.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Mary’s right! Let’s get to the
dialog: network before we run out of time!
text: ANGLE ON Chef who is holding an empty jar of Thyme.
speaker_heading: SWEDISH CHEF

scene_heading: -- A UNIVISION EXECUTIVE.
speaker_heading: UNIVISION EXECUTIVE
dialog: Lo siento, perro no.
text: The Muppets all act really excited.
speaker_heading: UNIVISION EXECUTIVE (CONT'D)
dialog: That means no.
text: Their smiles fade.
scene_heading: INT. ABC EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY
text: Kermit sits across from an ABC executive who looks very
text: uncomfortable. Most likely, this is because ALL OF THE OTHER
text: MUPPETS ARE ALSO CRAMMED INTO THE ROOM. There is literally NO
text: SPACE TO MOVE.
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: I don’t get it. Why don’t you just
dialog: keep doing your internet movies?
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: What internet movies?
text: The Exec flips on her computer. They see Beaker’s youtube
text: “Ode to Joy.” Beaker guiltily leaves the meeting.
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: Listen Kermit, I like you, and so
dialog: I’m gonna shoot straight. You guys
dialog: aren’t famous anymore.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: I wish he’d shot a little more
dialog: curvy! Waca Waca.
text: The exec looks at Fozzie annoyed and motions to the door.
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: The answer is no. Not going to
dialog: happen. Not today, not tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: So, like, Thursday then?
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: Guys...You’re just not cynical
dialog: enough or violent or ironic enough.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at the shows that are popular
dialog: today. Robot Wars.
text: CUT TO two COMPUTER-ANIMATED ROBOTS DESTROYING EACH OTHER

speaker_heading: RICH KID 2
dialog: Gucci-tastic!
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: And, of course, the hyper-

text: A QUICK CUT OF NUMBERS and SOY PRODUCTS floating around a

speaker_heading: SOOTHING VOICE
dialog: How many letters are in the word
dialog: Harvard?
text: BACK TO THE ABC EXECUTIVE.
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: I’m sorry, but you guys are no
dialog: longer relevant.
text: Kermit rises to leave and heads for the door. Then he stops
text: and turns back.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Before I go...well, there’s just
dialog: something I want to say. I think
dialog: children are smarter and better
dialog: than all this junk. Sure, they’1l
dialog: watch that stuff if you don’t offer
dialog: them anything else, but we have a
dialog: chance to make this world better
dialog: and more fun! You’re not going to
dialog: do that by filling their heads with
dialog: robots and violence or with rich
dialog: kids shopping or with boring
dialog: floating numbers, you’re going to
dialog: do it by filling their heads with
text: laughter and friendship and hope.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: I just think... well, I know we're
dialog: not famous anymore but I want you
dialog: to know I think you’re making a big
dialog: mistake.
text: Kermit nods, and reaches for the door handle to leave.
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: Kermit, wait.
dialog: (Kermit turns back)
dialog: You're right.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: I am?
speaker_heading: ABC EXEC
dialog: Yes. You’re not famous anymore.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: My kids sit in front of the
dialog: television watching Robot Wars all
dialog: day, and I wonder why they can’t
dialog: stop beating each other up. My
dialog: daughter wants a Louis Vuitton hand
dialog: bag. She’s three. I hate myself
dialog: for selling this stuff and, so...
dialog: I’m going to take a chance and
dialog: broadcast your show.
speaker_heading: MUPPETS
dialog: Yay!
speaker_heading: ABC EXECUTIVE
dialog: I want you to know that if I get
dialog: fired for this I’m taking you all
dialog: down with me.
dialog: (as they’re leaving)
dialog: I mean it. I go down. You go down.
scene_heading: INT. MUPPET STUDIOS
text: Kermit and the Muppets enter the Muppet studios. Walter and
text: Gary look around in amazement. Walter starts shaking
text: uncontrollably.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Peanut!
text: REVEAL that the stage is still there, but quite run down and
text: dirty. It’s no matter. Walter is really excited.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: PEPE THE PRAWN
dialog: I thought they turned this whole
dialog: place into a paper factory, ok!?
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Everything but the theater.
speaker_heading: DR. TEETH
dialog: (sniffing)
dialog: I’m guessing they couldn’t get rid
dialog: of the smell.
text: We watch as SHEETS are pulled off the THEATER SEATS and the
text: curtain’s PULLED BACK. The stage is dusted by Beaker.
text: Electric Mayhem PULLS a sheet off their instruments. Animal
text: goes to touch the drums and then BACKS AWAY scared. Gonzo
text: walks into his supply room and PULLS a sheet off his various
text: stunts. He looks scared to even touch them. Chef walks onto
text: his kitchen set and opens the fridge. It’s filled with
text: rotten food. He pulls a flamethrower and BURNS all the food
text: to a crisp and smiles. He’s back. Miss Piggy walks into her
text: dressing room and uncovers a bunch of paintings and headshots
text: that feature her. She then sees a photo of her and Kermit
text: which she tosses in the trash.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE - DAY
text: Kermit stands before all the Muppets.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Alright, guys! It’s time to
dialog: practice! Let’s start with our
dialog: opening!
text: Electric Karma starts the Muppet Theme. There are no drums
text: because Animal’s playing the flute. None of the Muppets can
text: keep time as they march in.
speaker_heading: ROWLF
dialog: We can’t keep time without drums.
speaker_heading: ANIMAL
dialog: No drums! Sean Penn say no drums
dialog: for Animal!
speaker_heading: SAM THE EAGLE
dialog: I am a fighter, not a dancer.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: And by the way Kermit, why do you
dialog: always get to open the show!
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Because I’m the only one who can
dialog: fit in the oO.
scene_heading: INT. MUPPET STUDIOS - FLASHBACK
text: We see a flashback of the the Muppet Show sign dropping with
text: Fozzie in the “0.” The O breaks off and hangs by one screw.
text: It then smashes to the ground.
text: -- Miss Piggy in the “0.” She’s holding on for dear life and
text: screaming.
dialog: -- Sweet Ums in the “0.” Or rather, only the bottom half of
text: Sweet Ums. The top half of him is off screen.
text: -- The Muppet Show sign is dropping. There’s no one in the
text: O. Suddenly the O CATCHES FIRE and Gonzo, in a motorcycle,
text: FLIES THROUGH THE O. Or rather tries to fly through the Oo.
text: He basically SMASHES right into the 0. He and the rest of
text: the sign catches on fire. Several Muppets put him out with
text: fire hoses.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE - PRESENT DAY
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Look, guys, let’s not argue. Maybe
dialog: we're just jumping too far ahead.
dialog: Let’s see some acts!
scene_heading: CUT TO MOMENTS LATER:
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: The Great Gonzo needs a fearless
dialog: human volunteer willing to risk his
dialog: life, or at the very least his
dialog: cognitive capacity.
text: Everyone looks to Gary, the only human. He rises tentatively
text: and Gonzo sits him in a chair and places a pin on his head.
text: Camilla comes out and brings Gonzo a bowling ball.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
text: Oh, wait... NOT THE BOWLING BALL
dialog: TRICK! No!! Don’t do it Gary!!!
dialog: He’1l kill you!!!
text: The Muppets all turn and hush Kermit. Walter turns to Kermit.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: What’s wrong with the bowling ball
dialog: trick?
dialog: 46.
scene_heading: INT. MUPPET STUDIOS - FLASHBACK
text: Several quick shots of the young Gonzo flinging bowling balls
text: at people with pins on their heads and NAILING THEM IN
text: DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY VERY VIOLENTLY, sending them
text: flying off their chairs.
scene_heading: INT. STAGE - PRESENT
text: And we're back. Now Walter looks terrified too. Gonzo
text: begins swinging the bowling ball in a circular motion, round
text: and round, building anticipation.
speaker_heading: KERMIT/WALTER
dialog: No!!! Please!!! Not again!
dialog: Somebody stop this madness
dialog: down from there Gary!
speaker_heading: nN
dialog: !li!/Get
text: But it is too late. Gonzo releases the Bowling ball and it
text: flies towards Gary’s head, who closes his eyes in terror. The
text: crowd gasps in fear as the bowling ball PERFECTLY KNOCKS THE
text: PIN OFF Gary’s HEAD! The group erupts in applause.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: HE DIT IT!!!
dialog: (to God)
dialog: THANK YOU!!!! Thank you!!!
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (with a bow)
dialog: You're welcome. Donations are
dialog: gladly accepted. Just drop them in
text: the collection cluckets.
text: A gaggle of CHICKENS walk through the group with buckets and
text: some Muppets throw in money. Kermit runs onstage. Kermit
text: looks down at his clipboard.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Okay, next. Bunsen and Beaker!
text: Bunsen and Beaker pull back a curtain immediately behind
text: Gonzo where they stand next to a mysterious device.
scene_heading: DR. BUNSEN HONEYDEW
dialog: The Bowling ball act is actually a
dialog: group routine.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Bunsen don’t---
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: DR. BUNSEN HONEYDEW
dialog: Allow me to explain. This is my
dialog: Temporal Displacement Machine. To
text: the casual observer, Gonzo’s stunt
text: looks indeed miraculous. However,
dialog: it is in fact my device that is
dialog: truly astonishing.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Dr.! NO!
text: Bunsen flips a screen around on the Machine and replays the
dialog: stunt for the Muppets.
scene_heading: DR. BUNSEN HONEYDEW
dialog: You see at the moment of release,
dialog: my faithful assistant Beaker--
speaker_heading: BEAKER
dialog: Meep Meep.
scene_heading: DR. BUNSEN HONEYDEW
dialog: (cont. )
dialog: --- turns the temporal displacement
dialog: dial...
text: (pointing to a dial on the
dialog: device)
text: Slowing time to a near halt...
text: We watch on the screen as everything begins to move
text: incredibly slowly. The bowling ball is clearly going to hit
text: Gary in the crotch. We watch as Beaker walks on stage and
text: literally guides the bowling ball directly to the pin on
text: Gary’s head, then casually walk out of frame.
speaker_heading: DR. BUNSEN HONEYDEW (CONT’D)
text: Time then resumes it’s normal speed
text: and the audience is none the wiser.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: (guiltily)
dialog: What? I don’t want to kill someone!
dialog: Again!
text: Kermit looks at the dial.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Wait. The dial here says slow,
dialog: slower and perfect pasta? Why the
dialog: perfect pasta setting?
scene_heading: DR. BUNSEN HONEYDEW
dialog: You never know when you might need
dialog: perfect pasta!
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: (to Gonzo)
dialog: Gonzo, you do stunts! That’s what
dialog: the people expect. The Muppets
dialog: aren’t about cheap tricks. We're
dialog: about actual talent! Now you have
dialog: to promise if you do this stunt,
dialog: you won’t be using that freezing
dialog: time machine.
text: Gonzo nods and skulks off.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, who’s next?
text: MONTAGE OF MUPPETS PERFORMING THEIR ACTS.
dialog: Everyone is terrible.
text: -- Fozzie Bear does his stand-up act. In the BG, Scooter’s
text: on a pogo stick.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: What’s the bear capital of the
dialog: world? Koala Lampur!
text: Kermit looks at Rowlf and signals for him to play off Fozzie.
text: Rowlf shakes his head “no.”
text: -- Gonzo destroys another mannequin with his bowling ball.
text: -- Camilla leads a bunch of chickens in a synchronized swim.
text: They all run into each other. It turns into a chaotic
text: chicken splash fight. In the BG, Rowlf is eating sushi.
text: -- Sam the Eagle has his firework display. He lights it and
text: stands proudly before it. One single sparkler lights up.
text: -- Gonzo destroys a mannequin with his bowling ball. Then he
text: accidentally whips another bowling ball behind him,
text: destroying the wall. In the BG, Sweet Ums walks by on his
dialog: hands.
text: -- Animal’s behind the drum set, still playing flute.
speaker_heading: ANIMAL
dialog: Baby steps!!! Ahhhhhh!
scene_heading: INT. STAGE
text: Kermit stands on the stage.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Alright, now let’s see Walter's
dialog: act.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: My... my act?
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Yup.
text: Walter begins shaking and then runs offstage.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay...let’s see. Who else is left
dialog: here?
text: All the Muppets look at Kermit. He realizes he’s the last
dialog: one to do an act.
scene_heading: INT. MISS PIGGY’S DRESSING ROOM
text: There’s a knock at the door. Miss Piggy turns. Kermit pokes
text: his head in. He notices a bottle of hair dye labelled: JUST
text: FOR PIGS, but looks away respectfully.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Ready to practice our duet?
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: I was ready for the duet of life
text: Frog, but that ship has sailed.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: But Piggy, we have to. The
dialog: audience expects it.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: Oh, Kermy... I might lie to get a
dialog: job. I might lie to get out of a
dialog: parking ticket. I might lie to get
dialog: a free croissant. But I will never
dialog: ever ever lie on stage.
dialog: (then, making it up)
dialog: Besides... I’m already doing a duet
dialog: ... with Gary. Bring him to me!
text: Miss Piggy turns. Kermit, clearly jealous, leaves the room.
scene_heading: EXT. AUDIENCE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Gary watches the acts when Mary walks up smiling.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hey, Gary, how’s it going?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Couldn't be going better!
text: Angle on Stage: Lou Zealand is hurling fish at Walter who is
text: pinned to a target. They barely miss him, sticking like
text: daggers in the target.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Wow, that looks dangerous.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: No, Lou is like, an expert.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Look, I don’t mean to be weird but
dialog: do you think Miss Piggy was a
dialog: little...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: A little what?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I don’t know, she didn’t seem to
dialog: like me very much. Not nearly as
dialog: much as she liked you at least.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Oh my gosh! You're jealous. That’s
dialog: so cute. Believe me babe, Miss
dialog: Piggy is just a friend.
text: Kermit walks into the theater and approaches Mary and Gary.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Hey, umm... sorry to interrupt, but
dialog: Miss Piggy wanted to talk to you
dialog: about something Gary. She’s in her
dialog: dressing room.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh... ok, I’1l be right back.
text: He kisses Mary on the cheek, and Kermit and Mary look after
text: him as he goes. Kermit sighs and walks off. Mary watches
dialog: this concerned.
scene_heading: INT. PIGGY’S DRESSING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: A knock. Piggy calls out from behind her dressing screen.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: PIGGY
dialog: Entre mon amour, s’il vous please.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Hi. You wanted to see me?
text: Piggy walks out from behind the screen in a lovely dress.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: Could you help me with the zipper?
text: She turns revealing the dress is literally busting open in
text: the back, this zipper is clearly not going up.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Oh. Wow. Okay. Sure.
scene_heading: EXT. PIGGY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mary comes walking down the hallway towards the bathroom.
text: However, as she passes Piggy’s dressing room she hears:
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: I really don’t think this will
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: PIGGY (0.S.)
dialog: We can make it work.
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: But Piggy, I’m only human.
speaker_heading: PIGGY (0.S.)
dialog: Just try!!
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: Okay. I don’t think it’s a good
dialog: idea, but I’1l try.
text: Mary peeks inside the dressing room and sees GARY trying to
text: zip up PIGGY’S DRESS!!!!! Mary looks hurt, and leaves.
scene_heading: INT. PIGGY’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Gary is pulling with all his might on the Zipper, and Piggy
text: is clearly in a great deal of pain. Gary gives up and lets
text: go, and Piggy is able to breath.
speaker_heading: PIGGY
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: When I find out who shrunk my dress-
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’m sure we can alter it!
speaker_heading: PIGGY
dialog: Nonsense! We have to find a new,
dialog: non shrunken dress!! And you’re
dialog: coming with me! We must discuss our
dialog: duet!! Perhaps over a romantic
dialog: candle lit all you can eat buffet.
dialog: I’m starving. Go gather your
dialog: things, I’1l meet you on stage
dialog: where Kermit can see us.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: I’m sorry, what?
speaker_heading: PIGGY
dialog: Nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. STAGE
text: All the Muppets are on lunch break. Gary walks up to Walter.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: (Walter)
dialog: Hey bud, you seen Mary?
speaker_heading: WALTER
text: She took off. Felt like she was
dialog: “hogging” all your time.”
text: Gary knows this is odd. As soon as Kermit enters, Piggy takes
text: Gary’s arm.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Alright, everyone. Let’s practice
text: the opening again.
text: No one is listening to him. Kermit grabs a megaphone.
speaker_heading: KERMIT (CONT'D)
dialog: WHAT DO YOU SAY WE PRACTICE THE
scene_heading: OPENING AGAIN?
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: Oh boy. Here we go again!!
speaker_heading: GONZO

speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Oh. Okay, but let’s eat up then,
dialog: cause we really should get back to
dialog: work. We don’t have much time.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: You’re not the boss of us!!
speaker_heading: ROWLF
dialog: Well, he is the leader.
speaker_heading: RIZZO
dialog: Says who?
speaker_heading: ROWLF
dialog: It’s just the truth.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
dialog: Well if that’s the truth, does that
dialog: mean that I’m a liar!
text: The group erupts into fighting again. A cacophony of arguing.
text: A second later, TEX RICHMAN WALKS INTO THE THEATER WITH HIS
text: COHORTS. .
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
text: Maniacal laugh, Maniacal laugh,
dialog: Maniacal laugh. Lookie what we got
dialog: here. We got a frog, a pig, a dog.
dialog: Looks like a good old fashioned
dialog: Korean BBQ to me. Muppets...
dialog: (he spits)
dialog: Can’t even pull it together to
dialog: unite against a common enemy... me,
dialog: to save their studio. Pathetic.
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Now you listen here! We have
dialog: united! We're just rehearsing our

dialog: only way you can do it is if you
dialog: work together to defeat this Tex
dialog: Richman guy. Don’t you get it! If
dialog: you don’t, you’ll never get to
dialog: perform together AGAIN!!! We can’t
dialog: let that happen. Now I know I’m not
dialog: one of you, but maybe that’s why I

text: each other's eyes. Kermit leans in and kisses Miss Piggy as
text: the music begins to swell. Kermit extends his hand. Piggy
text: throws off her rope revealing the most beautiful gown a pig
text: has ever worn. She takes his hand. They walk a few steps
text: hand in hand. Then:
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY (CONT’D)
dialog: (screaming)
text: SORRY GARY! I’M DOING MY DUET WITH
dialog: KERMIT!!!
text: She smiles at Kermit and they walk out of frame together.
scene_heading: INT. MUPPET SHOW STAGE - NIGHT
text: The curtain opens. Kermit’s in a tux on a crescent moon piece
text: with Miss Piggy in a chiffon bridal gown. The band starts
text: playing, Animal still not at the drums. Miss Piggy and
text: Kermit sing “I’M YOUR PUPPET.” The graph SPIKES TO 9.5
text: MILLION VIEWERS!!! The audience claps. Gary and Mary watch
text: on smiling.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: GARY

scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

dialog: Muppet Benefit Show.
speaker_heading: GARY (0.S.)
dialog: What’re you doing, Walter?
dialog: gl.
text: Walter turns to find Gary running up to him.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: How did you find me?
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: This is where people always go when
text: they’re running away from a
dialog: personal challenge. See?
text: REVEAL that there’s a woman dressed as the witch from Wicked,
text: Conan O’Brien and a guy in a Jack in the Box uniform.
scene_heading: WITCH FROM WICKED

speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I don’t have an act! I can only go

speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Are you sure? I mean this is your

text: WALTER JUMPS ONTO GARY’S ARM AND SLAPS HIM.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I can’t handle the pressure!!!!! I

dialog: me!!! Please!!!!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Anything you need buddy. You still
dialog: remember our routine?
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: I’m pretty sure. Let’s go!
dialog: 92.
text: Gary and Walter turn, revealing that the Muppet Studios are
text: right behind them.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: It felt like I ran way farther.
text: They run into the studio.
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS
text: Scooter’s off stage, panicked. Fozzie on stage looks to
text: Scooter and gestures “What now?” Scooter looks around
text: concerned, sees Chef walking by, grabs him and pushes him
dialog: onstage.
scene_heading: INT. MUPPET STUDIOS STAGE - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: And now, for an encore, the Swedish
dialog: Chef!
text: Chef walks on stage tentatively, no act prepared. THE GRAPH
text: IS HOLDING STEADY AT 9.5 MILLION. No phones ring. Chef looks
text: around the stage. There’s no cooking equipment set up. He
text: stands there silently. The audience grows impatient.
text: Angle on: Backstage the Muppets look around nervously. IN A
text: FLASH BEAKER AND HONEYDEW QUICKLY WHEEL THE SLOW MOTION
text: MACHINE ON STAGE RIGHT TO CHEF AND QUICKLY TURN THE DIAL TO
scene_heading: “PASTA.” DELICIOUS SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS FLY EVERYWHERE
text: AND CHEF GOES NUTS.
speaker_heading: CHEF
text: FLURGY BURGY BURGY!!!!!
text: The audience applauds. More silence. THE GRAPH HAS NOT
text: MOVED. THEN: GARY RUNS ONSTAGE WITH WALTER ON HIS HAND AND
text: NODS TO FOZZIE! Fozzie quickly runs to the microphone.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: Now get ready for the biggest event
dialog: of the night, Gary and our newest
dialog: Muppet, Walter!!!!!
text: Fozzie claps and walks offstage leaving Gary holding Walter
text: like a puppet, like the act they did at the beginning of the
text: movie in Venice. They’re both in tuxes. The band begins
dialog: playing.
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: We're friends...
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Oh yes we're friends...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Until the end...
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: The very end...
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: And nothing, no sir, nothing...
text: Without warning, Gary TOSSES Walter off his hand and onto the
text: stage! IN SLOW MOTION, Walter flies through the air and
text: gives Gary a “what are you doing” look. Walter lands, limp,
text: on the stage. The audience lets out a SHOCKED GASP! A long
text: silent moment.
speaker_heading: GARY (CONT’D)
dialog: (sotto to Walter)
dialog: C'mon, Walt. You can do it. This
dialog: is your big chance, I’m not letting
dialog: you pass it up.
text: Long beat. Then Walter sits up.
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Can tear us apart!!!
text: Walter begins tap dancing... INCREDIBLY WELL. The audience
text: applauds loudly.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m a dancer! That’s it!!! MY
dialog: MUPPET TALENT IS I CAN DANCE!!!
text: Gary smiles and slowly takes a step back to give Walter
text: center stage. Walter is a brilliant and diverse dancer. He
text: does ballet, then capoeira, then a somersault and a
text: cartwheel. The audience is going nuts. As his dance solo
text: comes to an end, Walter does a standing backflip and lands
text: flawlessly RIGHT ON GARY’S HAND! It should look like a mix of
text: Cirque de Soleil, Stomp and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
speaker_heading: WALTER (CONT'D)
dialog: No nothing! Nothing!
speaker_heading: GARY
dialog: Can tear!
speaker_heading: WALTER
dialog: Us!
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: GARY /WALTER
dialog: Apart!i!!t!
text: Gary tosses Walter up into a triple flip which really just
text: looks like someone threw a puppet up into the air. He drops
text: onto the ground on his feet. THE CROWD GOES NUTS! Phone’s
text: are ringing off the hook! The graph spikes to 9.9 Million
text: viewers. The crowd rises to its feet in anticipation as the
text: graph ticks closer to 10 million. Muppets run on stage
text: exuberantly and hug Walter and Gary and each other. Gonzo,
text: bowling ball still spinning in his arm dances around the
text: stage. Suddenly the lights go out and house lights come on.
text: Tex Richman HAS APPEARED on stage. He pulls a GIANT RIFLE
text: OUT and points it at Kermit and Miss Piggy. THE GRAPH
text: ABRUPTLY STOPS AT 9,999,999.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: I tried to negotiate. I tried to
dialog: talk reason. But no, you all had
dialog: to put on a show and make America
dialog: fall in love with you all over
dialog: again. Well how’s this for a show,
dialog: America?
speaker_heading: GONZO
dialog: Somebody arrest him! He’s got a
dialog: gun!
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: I’m aiming at a pig and a frog!
dialog: What they gonna get me for, hunting
dialog: without a license?!
text: Just as Tex is about to pull the trigger the movie FREEZES.
text: DR. HONEYDEW appears.
scene_heading: DR. HONEYDEW
dialog: We here at Muppet Labs are aware
dialog: that puppetry is not the most
dialog: advanced form of entertainment.
text: His assistants PULL the Temporal Displace Machine on screen.
speaker_heading: DR. HONEYDEW (CONT'D)
dialog: Therefore we now present to you the
dialog: top secret fourth setting of the
text: Temporal Displacement Machine dial.
text: Dr. Honeydew flips the dial PAST PASTA to “Bullet-Point-of-
dialog: View-O-Matic.”
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: DR. HONEYDEW (CONT'D)
dialog: Bullet-Point-of-View-O-Matic. Once
text: the fake Texan pulls the trigger,
dialog: we will go into an exciting
text: computer animated point of view of
dialog: a slo mo bullet, thus bringing you
dialog: the cutting edge of visual stimuli!
text: BACK TO THE ACTION.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: If I don’t get my oil, then no one
dialog: does.
text: Dr. Honeydew FLIPS ON THE DEVICE and then GOES OFFSCREEN.
text: Tex Richman PULLS THE TRIGGER. We go to BULLET POINT OF VIEW
text: ie. We’re looking down the shaft of the rifle at Kermit and
text: Miss Piggy. Everyone is now moving in slo-mo. The gun
text: fires! And the bullet emerges... as a puppet bullet at the
text: end of a stick with whooshing bullet noises made by the
text: Muppet who’s holding the stick. The Muppets are moving in
text: slomo, but it should be clear that they’re pretending to move
text: in slomo. Fozzie walks in.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE
dialog: What’s going on guys?
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Ixnay ormalnay eedspay!
speaker_heading: FOZZIE
dialog: Oh, slo mo bullet pov! Sorry!
text: Fozzie goes into slo mo as well, blinking. He follows the
text: bullet with his eyes, like a bad actor, mouth open, eyes
text: super wide. The bullet continues on its trajectory towards
text: Kermit and Miss Piggy. Tex is smiling evil-y when Gonzo’s
text: bowling ball suddenly FLIES OFF HIS FINGERS and BLOCKS the
dialog: bullet! We RESUME NORMAL SPEED!
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: What! No!
text: Tex pumps his gun and is about to fire again when Piggy
text: KARATE CHOPS it out of his hands.
speaker_heading: MISS PIGGY
scene_heading: ENOUGH OF YOU, MISTER! HAAAY-YAAA
text: The audience cheers. But the graph does not move.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: What’s happening, why did the graph
dialog: stop?
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: Looks like you’ve run out of
dialog: viewers- and luck!! And just in
dialog: time.
text: He motions to a clock on the graph as it ticks to midnight. A
text: series of sad buzzer sounds go off and the graph flashes red
speaker_heading: MUPPETS
text: NOOOOOOO!!!!!E!!
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
scene_heading: YEEEEE-HAAAAWWWWWWWWWW. The studio
dialog: is mine see!!!! It’s mine!!!! And
dialog: so are the Muppets!!! You gaggle of
dialog: misfits will never make anyone not
dialog: laugh ever again!!!!!
text: The crowd and the Muppets are in stunned silence. Angle on
dialog: Statler and Waldorf.
speaker_heading: STATLER
dialog: Waldorf, I don’t know what to say.
dialog: I feel... sad.
speaker_heading: WALDORF
dialog: I don’t get it?
speaker_heading: STATLER
dialog: It’s not a sardonic joke, it’s the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: WALDORF
dialog: Oh. Ummm. I guess I do to.
text: Waldorf begins to cry, followed by Statler. The audience also
text: begins to cry.
text: A series of quick shots of home viewers also crying.
text: All of our celebrities back stage are crying.
text: On stage, all of the Muppets begin to cry and comfort each
text: other. Tex watches on pleased. Fozzie, determined, steps
dialog: forward.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: (holding back tears)
dialog: Everyone stop crying! Don’t give
dialog: him the satisfaction! This isn’t
dialog: over!
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: Oh it’s as over as Barney the
dialog: Dinosaur. Nothing you can do. The
dialog: Muppets are done for good!!
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: You might own the studio, and you
dialog: might own the Muppets, but you
dialog: don’t own our friendship and as
dialog: long as we got that... well we’1ll
dialog: figure something out. I promise
dialog: you, this ain’t over! You messed
dialog: with the wrong bear! So don’t you
dialog: worry Tex Richman, I guarantee
dialog: “oil” be seeing you very soon!!
text: Long beat as Tex Richman stares at Fozzie. Something begins
text: to happen to his face. He looks pained. It takes a long time,
text: but finally a strange sound emerges from Tex... a laugh. It
text: grows and he begins laughing hard.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: “Oil” be seeing you. I get it.
dialog: Because it sounds like “I'll be
dialog: seeing you”, but instead you said
dialog: “Oil”, because of my obsessive,
dialog: almost cartoonish love of Oil! I
dialog: get it!!!! I'm laughing!!!! I'M
text: LAUGHING!!!! HAHAHAHAH!! “OIL!I!!!1”
speaker_heading: HAHAHAHAHAH
dialog: 
text: Tex falls to his knees crying he is laughing so hard.

dialog: keep the studio!!! It’s yours!!
dialog: Just keep making me laugh!!!
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: Are you kidding, we're a “barrel”
text: of laughs.
text: Tex immediately stops laughing and glares at Fozzie.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR (CONT'D)
dialog: A barrel!? Like a barrel of oil?
text: Tex thinks, then shakes his head no.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: Do the other one again.
speaker_heading: FOZZIE BEAR
dialog: Oil be seeing you later?
text: Tex starts laughing hard again.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: Yes!!! That’s the one!!! HAHAHAHA.
dialog: It’s yours, the studio is yours!!
text: EVERYONE GOES NUTS CELEBRATING! ALL THE HAPPY SOUND EFFECTS

speaker_heading: DR. TEETH
dialog: Don’t touch him. He’s working
dialog: something out.
speaker_heading: ANIMAL
dialog: Ah! Ahhhh! Drums taking hold!!!!
text: Animal's going crazy on the drums. Animal pounds on the
text: drums so hard he starts to bash his way through the drums and
text: into the ground. He’s digging a hole with the drums.
speaker_heading: KERMIT
dialog: Someone stop him!
text: Mortar and bricks fly out of the hole as Animal digs himself
text: deeper and deeper. Then silence...
speaker_heading: ANIMAL
dialog: Uh oh.
text: There’s an UNEARTHLY SHAKING and suddenly...
speaker_heading: ANIMAL (CONT'D)
dialog: oil.
text: Animal SHOOTS OUT OF THE WHOLE on a FOUNTAIN OF OIL.

text: WE PAN to Tex Richman in HANDCUFFS. A BUSINESSMAN comes up
dialog: to him.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: I represent the shareholders of
dialog: Richman Oil. You are hereby
dialog: relieved of your duties as CEO.
speaker_heading: TEX RICHMAN
dialog: What? Why? All I live for is
dialog: tasty, tasty oil!
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Because instead of doing the work
dialog: that being a CEO of a global
dialog: multinational corporation requires,
dialog: you spent all your time in disguise
dialog: trying to get the oil that’s under
dialog: the Muppet studios. You realize
dialog: there’s only like twenty barrels
dialog: down there?
text: As he says that the oil fountain immediately DRIES UP.
