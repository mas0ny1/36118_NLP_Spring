scene_heading: EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 1A
text: FLYING OVER England, the green rolling Chiltern hills, over

text: The CAMERA FINDS a handsome manor house. In the field by the
text: house, a cricket match is in full swing.
scene_heading: EXT. CRICKET FIELD -— DAY 2
text: MOVING POV - A blur of tree trunks. Railings round a
text: pavilion terrace. Glimpses of women drinking tea on a sunny
text: English afternoon. Sounds of a cricket match in progress.
text: The UNKNOWN WATCHER is on the move, trying for a better
text: vantage point. Now at last he catches a clear sighting of -
text: DIANA, a beautiful young woman, 22 years old, dark hair,
text: calm manner. She’s seated on the pavilion terrace,
text: surrounded by others but looking as if she’s alone. A young
text: man, TOMMY, is clearly trying to talk to her, one hand
text: nervously fiddling with his straw hat as he does so. Diana
text: seems unaware of his existence.
text: Some other figure crosses the line of vision, obscuring
text: her. The MOVING POV shifts again. This time the watcher
text: gets an even better view of her.
speaker_heading: ROBIN (0.S.)
dialog: Dear God. What - is - that?
text: ON ROBIN CAVENDISH, staring. A good-looking 25-year-old,
text: dressed in cricketing whites, wearing pads. With him, also
text: in whites, his friend COLIN CAMPBELL.
speaker_heading: COLIN CAMPBELL
dialog: Not a chance.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: (gazing at Diana)
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: COLIN CAMPBELL
dialog: She’s a famous heart-breaker.
dialog: Breathe - Blue Revision - 26 June 2016 2.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Do you know her?
speaker_heading: COLIN CAMPBELL
dialog: I know her brothers.
text: A glance towards two young men watching the cricket,
text: identical twins BLOGGS and DAVID BLACKER. They too are
text: watching Diana, amused by Tommy’s utter failure to attract
text: Diana’s attention. They’re mimicking the way his hand fiddles
text: with his hat.
text: Robin’s gaze turns from the twins back to Diana. The sounds
text: of a wicket being taken, and the clapping of the
dialog: spectators.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: She’s gorgeous.
speaker_heading: COLIN CAMPBELL
dialog: No one’s ever got near. Martin
dialog: proposed twice.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Would you marry Martin? I wouldn't.
dialog: But I would marry me.
speaker_heading: COLIN CAMPBELL
dialog: And I’m sure you'd be very happy
dialog: together, Robin.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: The thing is, I’m running out of
dialog: time. I leave for Nairobi on July
dialog: 15th. I need a wife.
text: It’s now his turn to bat. Smiling, confident, he strides out
text: to the crease.
scene_heading: EXT. CRICKET PITCH - DAY 3
text: Robin prepares to face the bowler. He glances back at Diana
text: on the pavilion terrace: he’s going to make her notice him.
text: But Diana’s only half-watching. She’s bored. Tommy has
dialog: given up.
text: The ball hurtles towards Robin. He steps forward, smashes
text: the ball with a sweeping off-drive. It sails over the
text: pavilion for a glorious six. A cheer goes up.
text: Diana is chatting to a girlfriend. She didn’t even notice
text: Robin’s triumph.
dialog: Breathe - Blue Revision - 26 June 2016 3.
scene_heading: EXT. PAVILION, CRICKET FIELD - DAY 4
text: Robin with a cup of tea in his hand moving past team mates
text: and supporters, accepting congratulations as he goes. He’s
text: heading for Diana. She sits staring far away at nothing.
text: Still bored.
text: He comes to a stop beside her. She doesn’t register his
text: presence. He drinks his tea, watches her.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I know you can see me.
text: Diana turns her lazy gaze to take him in.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I’m sorry?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I don’t believe you're half as
dialog: bored as you look.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Do I look bored? I don’t mean to.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Cricket’s a lot more fun to play
dialog: than to watch.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Yes. I suppose it is.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Like life, you might say.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Might you?
text: An older friend, HARRY TENNYSON, comes up to Diana. Harry is
text: very overweight, and just walking gets him out of breath.
speaker_heading: HARRY TENNYSON

scene_heading: INT. LONDON BALLROOM - NIGHT
text: MOVING POV - Through the throng of guests at the ball:
text: glimpses of Diana, stunning in a formal gown. On her lovely
text: face the same air of not seeing the bustle round her; of
dialog: living in some other private world.
text: Robin, smart in his formal evening clothes, tracks her with
text: his eyes. He moves steadily towards her. She turns, catches
text: his gaze. Holds the look for a moment, then turns away.
text: He reaches her. She shows no sign of noticing him.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I could ask you to dance. You
dialog: could say you don’t feel like
dialog: dancing right now. I could say,
dialog: Next time, maybe. And I could
text: saunter away.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: You could saunter away.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Or I could just not ask.
text: That’s unexpected. She looks at him, unsure what he means.
text: He takes her hand and pulls her onto the dance floor.
text: She’s too taken by surprise to resist. Before she knows
dialog: what’s happening they’re dancing.
text: He dances very well. She lets him lead her, looking at him
text: with an amused quizzical look. She likes dancing with him.

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: So where are we going?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I thought Maidenhead. I know a
text: rather jolly pub by the river.
text: The car turns off into a lane that winds up a hill between

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: This doesn’t look like a jolly

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No. We seem to have missed our

speaker_heading: DIANA

speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Lucky I packed a bottle of wine

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Good Lord, is that the time?

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: How do you open the door?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You don’t.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: But I want to get out.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: No you don’t.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: Don’t I?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: You want to kiss me.
speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: What makes you think I want to -
text: He pulls her towards him and kisses her. No aggression, but
text: nor does he give her any choice in the matter.
dialog: Breathe - Blue Revision - 26 June 2016 6.
text: For a moment she accepts the kiss passively. Then she

scene_heading: EXT. GARDEN, BLACKER HOUSE - DAY 9
text: The grounds of Diana’s family home. Diana sits on a swing

dialog: Has he got any money at all?
speaker_heading: BLOGGS

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: We have an appointment with Dr

text: IN HALLWAY - Diana wheels Robin down a hallway and into a

dialog: Robin says to Diana -

speaker_heading: PADDY
dialog: Robin!... You jammy little beggar!

speaker_heading: DR KHAN
dialog: This is really quite something!

speaker_heading: DR ENTWISTLE
dialog: Did you give permission for this

speaker_heading: DR ENTWISTLE
dialog: It’s hard enough for our patients

dialog: that can only leave them more

speaker_heading: DR LANGDORF
dialog: I’m sorry. He must leave.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: Of course he must. How stupid of

speaker_heading: DR LANGDORF
dialog: Please understand we are a

speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN

speaker_heading: DR LANGDORF
dialog: I believe so.
text: Dr Langdorf doesn’t hear him, staring anxiously at Robin as

speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: Thank you so much, Dr Langdorf. I

text: Clement Aitken is at the podium, the conference Chairman to
dialog: one side.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: May I begin by noting an
dialog: interesting fact. At this
dialog: conference on managing the lives of
dialog: the severely disabled, there are no
dialog: disabled people present.
scene_heading: CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
dialog: Dr Aitken, forgive me. The severely
dialog: disabled are on life support
dialog: machines. How can they be present?
text: Clement Aitken beckons into the wings. Robin rolls onto the
text: stage, pushed by Diana. A gasp from the delegates.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: Allow me to introduce - Mr Robin
dialog: Cavendish.
text: He places a microphone for Robin.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Good afternoon.
text: The chairman and the delegates gape in amazement.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: Robin, tell the conference how long
dialog: you've been paralysed.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Fifteen years.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: You're kept alive by a mechanical
dialog: respirator?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: And you live at home?
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: Breathe - Blue Revision - 26 June 2016 84a.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: You have a question to ask our
dialog: hosts.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Yes... Why do you keep your
dialog: disabled people in prisons?
dialog: Breathe - Blue Revision - 26 June 2016
scene_heading: CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
dialog: In prisons? No, no. We maintain
dialog: some of the best facilities in the
dialog: world for the severely disabled.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Run by prison officers.
scene_heading: CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
dialog: Not at all -
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: Kept out of sight... No part of
dialog: healthy society...
text: Uproar in the hall. The delegates are appalled.
scene_heading: CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN
dialog: I must ask you to withdraw that.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: Mr Cavendish doesn’t mean to cause
dialog: offence. He merely suggests that
dialog: the severely disabled can be better
dialog: integrated into society.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: I’m sure you care for your disabled
dialog: people... But when you look at me,
dialog: what do you see?... A creature
dialog: that’s barely alive... What do you
dialog: think?... Let’s put him in the
dialog: waiting room for death... But I, as
dialog: you see, have escaped... I have a
text: machine under my seat that breathes
dialog: for me... The battery lasts for
dialog: about six hours... At home I have a
dialog: respirator by my bed... I can do
dialog: nothing for myself... Yet here I
dialog: am.
text: Silence. He’s got to them.
speaker_heading: ROBIN
dialog: When I was first paralysed I wanted
dialog: to die... My wife wouldn’t let
dialog: me... She told me I had to live, to
dialog: see our son grow up... So I’ve gone
dialog: on living... because of her... and
dialog: with her... and for her.

speaker_heading: DIANA
dialog: I don’t know what that was, but

text: Clement finishes and replaces the breathing tube. Robin
text: breathes again.
speaker_heading: CLEMENT AITKEN
dialog: I'm afraid this is what happens
dialog: after a number of years on a
text: respirator. The lining of the
dialog: lungs becomes irritated. You get

speaker_heading: DIANA
