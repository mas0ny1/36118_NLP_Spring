speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: There are no problems, Joy. Only

speaker_heading: JOY
text: The sky-cam on the traffic copter

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay, that's a problem.
dialog: (thinking, then...)

speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: ABBY

dialog: decision.
speaker_heading: LARRY (O.S.)
dialog: Abby!
text: LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to
text: them. He wears a makeup bib.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Morning, Larry.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby,
dialog: but I don't think I can work with
dialog: her anymore. It's bad enough I
dialog: have to take her criticism at home.
dialog: I can't do it on air, too. A man
dialog: can only take so much.
text: Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done
dialog: this before.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You're not a man, Larry...
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: You're a newsman. A newsman isn't
dialog: defined by the easy times, Larry,
dialog: he's defined by the difficult ones.
dialog: Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris
dialog: Hansen or Anderson Cooper having
dialog: their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no,
dialog: because they couldn't handle it.
dialog: But you can. You've got balls the
dialog: size of Volkswagens. Don't think I

scene_heading: 4 INT. KPHX - ABBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 4
text: ...walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry
text: news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer.
speaker_heading: DORI
dialog: Josh, nobody in Sacramento gives a *

dialog: (to the room)
dialog: Does anyone see this? Is this a

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It looks like syphilis to me.

speaker_heading: GEORGIA
dialog: I have to tell you, Bruce. This is
dialog: the best Chicken Kiev I've ever
dialog: tasted.
speaker_heading: GUEST CHEF
dialog: Actually it's Duck Kiev. Duck makes

speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Have you seen the ratings for
dialog: yesterday? We got beat by all the
dialog: network shows, plus a rerun of
dialog: "Who's the Boss". The one where

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It's a temporary setback. This week
dialog: we'll do better.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: The guy with the cable access show
dialog: on Channel 83 does better. If we

text: Abby looks worried.
speaker_heading: ABBY

dialog: We're not a family-run station
dialog: anymore, Abby. You're good at what
dialog: you do, but you've got to get me
dialog: some numbers. I've got two
dialog: daughters in college and a son in
dialog: beauty school. I don't know how

speaker_heading: ABBY (cont'd) *

speaker_heading: JOY

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You printed his profile?
speaker_heading: JOY
dialog: What? I'm married. I live

dialog: your checklist.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well, technically eight and a half.
dialog: He said he could cook, but when I

speaker_heading: JIM (O.S.)
dialog: Technically, I'm 5'9 and 3/4.

scene_heading: 11 INT. RESTAURANT DINING AREA - NIGHT 11
text: Abby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You know what? This is not the best
dialog: angle. We should get the table over
text: there. Then we both get a view,
dialog: instead of one of us looking at the
dialog: busboy station.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I'm fine here.
speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: JIM

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You know, they've done studies that

dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: You printed out my profile?
speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I printed out some talking points
dialog: for us just in case this happened.
speaker_heading: JIM
dialog: I take it it's happened before?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: No, but since you have nine out of

speaker_heading: JIM

dialog: FYI, be sure to eat this by

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Rule number one. Never criticize.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Even if it's constructive?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Never. Men are incapable of growth,

dialog: improvement ends at toilet-
dialog: training. Rule number two. Laugh at
dialog: whatever he says.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What if what he's saying isn't
dialog: funny?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is
text: like a fake orgasm.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: And a fake orgasm is good?
speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Some men care.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: No. Some men pretend to care. When

speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: MIKE

dialog: the case.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Really? Colin's penis? That's what

dialog: (doing Jay)
dialog: So, tell me Mike. How did "The Ugly

speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Well, Jay, I had a sales job where
dialog: I drove around a lot, listening to
dialog: talk radio. I started calling in
dialog: and lo and behold, people liked
dialog: what I had to say. Then I decided
dialog: what the hell, I need my own show.

speaker_heading: ABBY
