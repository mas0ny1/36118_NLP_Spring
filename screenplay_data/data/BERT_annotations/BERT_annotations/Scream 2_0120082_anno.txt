text: Everyone is having fun.
dialog: 
text: Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere.
text: Lights burn from within.
dialog: 
text: Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is
text: taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Now why does she have to be naked?
dialog: How does that serve the plot?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Sssshhh.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower

scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
dialog: 
text: Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small

scene_heading: INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER
dialog:

text: bathroom door CREAKS open. Maureen listens. FOOTSTEPS
text: are heard. Loud and heavy.
dialog: 
text: Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is
text: visible. Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. The footsteps
dialog: stop.
dialog: 
text: Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the
text: stall door open and rushes out to find...
dialog: 
text: THE BATHROOM EMPTY.
dialog: 
text: The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the
text: door. She rips the door open as a FIGURE rushes her...
dialog: 
text: A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and
text: loud. They hurl past Maureen, LAUGHING and carrying on.

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: I get scared really easy, okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: MAUREEN

dialog: 
text: Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns,

dialog: 
text: GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps
text: back, surprised. Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots
text: forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick
text: and silent. He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape
text: strikes again. Phil goes down without a scream.

speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to

dialog: etc.
dialog: 
text: Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits
dialog: down next to...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: 
text: Who sits with the mask on. The reflection from the
text: movie bouncing against it in the darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Give it up.
dialog: 
text: She sits down, with the popcorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: How many stabs did I miss?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN

text: Maureen offers Phil popcorn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST
text: MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through
text: the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting
text: away, running...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: This is so tired.
dialog: 
text: She turns her attention to Phil.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Hey, you... pasty face...
dialog: 
text: Phil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness
text: putting her hand on his knee. She inches it up. The
text: Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Whatsa the matter? Can't I get your
dialog: ghost?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The young girl is running through the yard. The Ghost
text: Killer is right behind her, chasing her... she
text: SCREAMS...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand
text: continues to move between Phil's legs. She stares
text: ahead, WINCING at what's about to happen to the girl on
dialog: screen.
dialog: 
text: She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting
text: knife from inside his coat jacket. Maureen's hand moves
text: up Phil's jacket... something stops her. She feels
text: something on her fingers... something wet. She pulls
text: her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody
dialog: fingers.
dialog: 
text: Maureen stares at her hand...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her,
text: pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife.
text: The young girl is helpless...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: Maureen looks at Phil, confused... as if seeing for the
text: first time... IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the
text: Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other
text: one clutching the hunting knife.
dialog: 
text: Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD
text: SCREAM that is matched by the entire audience as they
text: SCREAM at the screen.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREAM
dialog: 
text: The young girl is stabbed in the heart.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: Maureen is helpless. The knife comes fast and furious,
text: striking her in the stomach. She falls forward, into
dialog: the aisle as...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The young girl, clutching her bloody chest... drags
text: herself, crawling across wet grass... the killer behind
text: her... raising his knife again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle,
text: clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable
text: to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to
text: see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle.
dialog: 
text: Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several
text: PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see
text: the Ghost Face coming at her again... knife raised.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The young girl is slashed again.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: The knife slices into Maureen again... then again. The
text: theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost
text: keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A
text: horrifying, sickening sight.
dialog: 
text: Maureen stumbles forward, her bloody body moving down
text: to the front of the theater. Suddenly, the entire
text: audience begins...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: APPLAUD AND CHEER
dialog: 
text: Maureen, swaying from side to side, turns to the crowd
text: and emits a HORRENDOUS BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM as...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
dialog: 
text: The young girl lets out an enormous EAR SCREECHING
text: SCREAM that mirrors Maureen's as the killer attacks one
text: last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE THEATER
dialog: 
text: The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce.
text: Maureen falls back against the movie screen... very

speaker_heading: GALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, what was the name of that

speaker_heading: RANDY

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL OF FILM - LATER

dialog: Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school
text: building. Through open doorways, film equipment is
dialog: glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film
dialog: Department.
dialog: 
text: She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room,
text: a class is in progress. She slips in quietly.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - SAME
dialog: 
text: Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful

text: discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a
text: whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a
dialog: point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY
dialog: Sequels are too handicapped. By
dialog: definition alone, they're inferior
dialog: films.
dialog: 
text: Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Bullshit generalization. Many
dialog: sequels have surpassed their
dialog: original.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY
dialog: Name one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: ALIENS Far better than the
dialog: original.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANOTHER GUY
dialog: Subjective.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOME GIRL
dialog: Life's subjective. I much prefer
dialog: Ridley Scott.
dialog: 
text: The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making
text: their point about ALIENS VS. ALIEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away
dialog: from her - you bitch."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY
dialog: I'll give you that one. Name
dialog: another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: T2.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOME GIRL
dialog: You've got a hard-on for Cameron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY
dialog: A bigger budget does not make a

speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY

speaker_heading: DEREK
text: EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY
text: Case in point. The entire horror
dialog: genre was destroyed by sequels.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ARTSY TEACHER
dialog: Really? And why do you think that
dialog: is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY
dialog: Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes
dialog: about: money and no one's
dialog: interested in quality.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: It's more than that. Horror films
dialog: are only as good as their villains.
dialog: How can Freddie and Jason possibly
dialog: be scary after they've been diluted
dialog: through five or six sequels.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: What's the solution? If you were
dialog: making a sequel today what would
dialog: you do differently?
dialog: 
text: The class stews on this. Derek turns, spotting Sidney
text: in the back of the room. She gives a half wave. He
text: starts for her, excusing himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNOTTY GUY
dialog: The point is - I made my point.
dialog: Sequels suck.

dialog: I called as soon as I heard...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I skipped. Too many "That's her"
dialog: looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Don't ask what you can do. No
text: coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
dialog: 
text: He looks at her with bedroom eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I can do that. And I can also do
dialog: this.
dialog: 
text: He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing
text: her passionately. She breaks away, laughing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No PDA.
dialog: 
text: But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and

scene_heading: EXT. STUDENT UNION - LATE AFTERNOON

dialog: 
text: CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is

speaker_heading: DEAN FISHER
dialog: (reading from a

dialog: "... and we feel this unfortunate

dialog: 
text: Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Gale? Can I have a second?
dialog: 
text: Gale spins around to find DEBBIE SALT, the flashy

dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Look, I'm sorry about the face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer -
dialog: NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Fair enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: What are you doing here? I thought
dialog: you had retired from field
dialog: reporting?
dialog: 
text: The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive.
text: TWO OTHER REPORTERS have taken notice. Suddenly,
text: CAMERAS are on Gale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Well, you know I'm dear to the
dialog: subject matter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
text: And much richer as a result.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Do I know you? You look familiar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: I took your vulture seminar seminar
dialog: at Berkeley last year.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Good for you.
dialog: 
text: And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale
text: Weathers is beseiged by REPORTERS. The questions spew
dialog: forth. "Why are you here?" "Is this the work of a
dialog: copycat killer?" "Have you talked to Sidney?" etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (ever smooth)
dialog: Guys, you're missing the show.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
dialog: 
text: The LOCAL SHERIFF, a smart looking guy in his 50's is

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHERIFF

speaker_heading: ON THE LAWN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: But what are they doing? He's
dialog: talking but he's not saying
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Sounds like they don't know
dialog: anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Do you think they'll cancel Hell

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: You're getting nailed - you're not

dialog: 
text: From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls,
text: LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK
text: BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on
text: Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: This has nothing to do with me,
dialog: Joel. There's an estimated 270
dialog: serial killers currently active in
dialog: the US at any given time. I can't
dialog: control that. Who's hungry?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: I have rehearsal.

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Yes, sister Lois. Very much so.

speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Good. We need your help, pledges.

dialog: 
text: The pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois

speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Ne ask that you sell individual

speaker_heading: MURPHY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Come on, guys. Uncool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MURPHY
dialog: Am I getting fraternity
dialog: interference, Mickey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It's okay. I can peddle toilet
dialog: paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Sid, you don't have to.
dialog: 
text: Sidney takes her toilet paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No special treatment. I can do

dialog: 
text: She throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I see you read the book.

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Yes, I do retain reading skills.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the

dialog: explained yourself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: No, what you are is a money hungry,

dialog: for saying - mediocre writer who
dialog: has a cold storage shed where her

dialog: 
text: This stings Gale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE

speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with
dialog: inexperience."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I never meant to imply...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: How do you know my dim-witted
dialog: inexperience isn't merely a subtle
dialog: form of manipulation used to lower
dialog: people's expectations thereby
dialog: enhancing my ability to effectively
dialog: maneuver within any given
dialog: situation?
dialog: 
text: Gale is at a loss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I'm sorry. I don't know what else
dialog: to say except I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: No, I'm the one who's sorry. I

dialog: Yeah, well... you are the

speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: My morn was a Delta.
dialog: 
text: Beat. People have begun to notice the two of them

dialog: 
text: Sid spins around, surprised to see him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Randy? What are you doing here?
dialog:

speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Cotton...
dialog: 
text: He moves to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: Hello, Sidney.
dialog: 
text: Gale motions to Randy. He maneuvers, getting the two of
text: them in frame. A long moment, Sidney just stares at
text: him. Completely off guard. She looks to Randy who aims
text: the camera directly at her... filming her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her,
text: realizing she's been set up. She looks back to Cotton.

text: Eyes aflame.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You BITCH!
dialog:

speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: This was a mistake. I shouldn't be

speaker_heading: RANDY

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - SAME

speaker_heading: RINGS.

scene_heading: SLIDING GLASS DOOR

speaker_heading: SIDNEY

scene_heading: INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE

speaker_heading: DEREK

scene_heading: IN THE LIVING ROOM

scene_heading: INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: You're a hard one to figure out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: It's that complex yet shallow

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I think you're all an act.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And deep down I'm a good person?
dialog: Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I know that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I also know that you're an aging TV
dialog: reporter slash writer who, despite
dialog: huge tabloid success, has some self
dialog: worth issues regarding your
dialog: personal life which directly
dialog: effects your professional life in a
dialog: non-positive manner. A coupla

dialog: late at night, when you're all
text: alone a sadness seeps to the
text: surface and in a moment of clarity
dialog: you know that all you really want
dialog: is to be touched and held and
text: fondled.
dialog: 
text: Gale stares at him, stunned. A moment as the tension
text: swirls about them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And where did you gain all of your
dialog: Gale Weather's insight?
dialog: 
text: Dewey approaches her. Gale has never been more taken
text: with him. They stand incredibly close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: After my spinal cord was damaged I
dialog: was laid up for over a year. A lot
dialog: can happen when you're on your
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: They're nearly touching now. Just then, Randy
text: approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What'd I miss?
dialog:

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I'm not here.

speaker_heading: RANDY

text: grabs Dewey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: C'mon.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: So... what's your favorite scary

speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE

speaker_heading: RANDY

scene_heading: BACK ON RANDY
dialog: 
text: He goes on a tirade pacing back and forth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: So what's your deal? Can we talk
dialog: openly for a second? How does one
dialog: become a serial killer? Huh? Are
dialog: you psychopathic or merely
dialog: psychotic? And what is the
dialog: distinguishing feature'? Were you
dialog: slapped around as a child? Is it
dialog: hereditary? Did your Mom take test
dialog: drugs? You know, have you tried
dialog: getting laid? It's done wonders for
dialog: my homicidal tendencies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: Do you want to die?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Gee, let me think. "Do you want
dialog: to... " Is that the best you can
dialog: do? Some tired hand me down rehash?
dialog: Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a

dialog: Nothing. I've been through this

dialog: in history. Now you'll always be

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN TYLER

speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Did you do it?

text: as Dewey and Gale slip in and close the door behind
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (checking door)
dialog: You broke the lock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: You broke my heart.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What are we looking for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: A bloody knife. A ghost mask.
dialog: Something like that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Can we turn the light on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: That's not the way it's done.
dialog: 
text: Dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the
text: room. He sifts through drawers and a closet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: And it's sexier in the dark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Dewey, you and I would never make
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Maybe not. But think about the sex.
dialog: As frustrated as I am...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: ... and as lonely as I am...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: We'd break some furniture.
dialog: 
text: Gale LAUGHS at this. She reaches over and pats his
text: buttock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Tell you what. We get through this
dialog: one. And we'll take out a hotel
text: room. Over here with the light.
dialog: 
text: Dewey points the light to a framed picture. It's of
text: Joel and Derek - a buddy pose. She sifts through some
text: text books on the desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: They're roomates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: And Joel's pre-med.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: The sorority girl was gutted with
text: autopsy precision.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Shit! It's both of them. The first
dialog: murders were to throw us - using
dialog: the same names as Woodsboro. But
dialog: they've moved on - they're getting
dialog: closer to Sidney. They're not
dialog: looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to
dialog: kill. They're looking for the new
dialog: Tatum.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Hallie?
dialog: 
text: A moment. Then in a splash, they're outta there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: A squad car makes it's way down the quiet campus
dialog: street.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SQUAD CAR - SAME
dialog: 
text: Sidney sits in the backseat. The two police officers
text: ride in front.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Where are you taking me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE GUARD #1
dialog: Actually, I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE GUARD #2
dialog: We're meeting another car that will
dialog: transport you the rest of the way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE GUARD #1
dialog: Safety precautions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I feel like Eddie Murphy.
dialog: 
text: The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE GUARD #1
dialog: We feel like Kevin Costner.
dialog: 
text: Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on
text: the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank
text: Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but
text: it's cut short.
dialog: 
text: Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel
text: struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a
text: Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
text: towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too
text: late. The Ghost has the door open.
dialog: 
text: A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is
dialog: slit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN THE BACK SEAT
dialog: 
text: Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the
text: car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN THE FRONT SEAT
dialog: 
text: The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then
text: gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the
text: car in drive and takes off down the road.
dialog: 
text: Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay
text: sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the
text: door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic,
text: and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME
dialog: 
text: The car makes its way down the deserted street
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN THE BACKSEAT
dialog: 
text: Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through
text: the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape.
text: Through the window, she sees approaching headlights.
text: She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes
dialog: by.
dialog: 
text: Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
text: campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each
text: side of a thin, road.
dialog: 
text: She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The
text: white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The
text: Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
dialog: 
text: Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.
text: She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She
text: pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow
text: No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal
text: grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck
dialog: is right up against it.
dialog: 
text: Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
text: Ghost's head, ready to attack.
dialog: 
text: Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,
text: into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost
text: falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for
text: a moment.
dialog: 
text: The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.
text: The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to
text: bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post
text: that stands directly in the car's path.
dialog: 
text: The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
text: SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
text: lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
dialog: 
text: Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
text: rumbling.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE CAR
dialog: 
text: All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
text: floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
text: figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
dialog: 
text: Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
text: sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
text: won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
text: car. It's flush against the building.
dialog: 
text: Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
text: pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
text: pulling on it, bending it backwards...
dialog: 
dialog: CREAK!
dialog: 
text: Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
text: eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
text: an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
text: lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRONT SEAT
dialog: 
text: Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
text: the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
text: passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
text: BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
text: body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
dialog: 
text: The only way out is through the driver's door.
dialog: 
text: After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
text: with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
text: She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
text: his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
text: Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
text: the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
dialog: through.
dialog: 
text: She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
text: leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
text: against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
text: for the door knob.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HONK!
dialog: 
text: Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
text: a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
text: doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
text: car door open and starts to slide completely over the
text: Ghost when she stops.
dialog: 
text: She looks to the Ghost.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HER FACE
dialog: 
text: As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
text: determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
text: finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
dialog: when...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
dialog: 
text: Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
text: the car door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE THE CAR
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BAM!
dialog: 
text: Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
text: her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
dialog: 
text: The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
text: the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
text: hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
text: Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
text: knocking him backwards.
dialog: 
text: Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the
dialog: pavement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FILM SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: The film school sits in the still darkness.

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - SAME
dialog:

text: THUMP! They stop cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Ssshh! What was that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Let's find out.
dialog: 
text: Dewey keeps moving.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: This is all too familiar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Over here.
dialog: 
text: Dewey has lead her to a door marked "LECTURE HALL".
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME
dialog: 
text: The same room seen earlier. A large, rounded room with
text: three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the
text: ceiling. A podium stands center. Video monitors hang
text: from the ceiling in different places around the room.
dialog: 
text: Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS
dialog: that hang over the exit doors, the room would be
text: completely dark.
dialog: 
text: They move down the first level of chairs to the
dialog: lecturn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Maybe they never got here. He could
dialog: have taken her anywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: C'mon. Let's go.
dialog: 
text: CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their
text: attention. They looks up as a video monitor comes to
text: life. Images appear.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON MONITOR
dialog: 
text: Home-made video footage fills the screen. A movie
text: theatre, people standing in line. The home camera ZOOMS
text: in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into view.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON DEWEY AND GALE
dialog: 
text: Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room,
dialog: searching for it's source.
dialog: 
text: CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot
text: video footage. This time of a big house. A closer look
text: reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young
text: girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable
dialog: phone. It's Cici.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON GALE AND DEWEY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Jesus Christ!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: He filmed his victims.
dialog: 
text: CLICK! ANOTHER MONITOR TURNS ON.
dialog: 
text: It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the
text: cellular phone to his ear.
dialog: 
text: CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and
text: woman back to the camera. The couple move in frame. It
text: becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they
text: stand in the room - live. They're being taped.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
text: Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer
dialog: carries.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Dammit!
dialog: 
text: He looks around the room, up to the two levels above
text: them. He spots a small light on the second level. He
text: squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: No, wait here.
dialog: 
text: Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
text: stair rise that leads to the upper level.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: No, Dewey, let's call for backup.
dialog: 
text: But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the
text: monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ON THE UPPER LEVEL
dialog: 
text: Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge.
text: He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
text: the shining light.
dialog: 
text: He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod.
text: It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the
text: second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.
dialog: 
text: Dewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks
text: up to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Dewey?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: There's nothing. I'm coming down.
dialog: 
text: Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that
text: hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is
text: in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.
text: She takes a step forward, moving out of frame,
dialog: revealing
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GHOST
dialog: 
text: Who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see
text: the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch out!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
dialog: 
text: Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's
text: knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults,
text: just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle
dialog: of seats.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UP ABOVE
dialog: 
text: Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his
dialog: handicapped leg will allow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWN BELOW
dialog: 
text: Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind
dialog: her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AT THE LECTURN
dialog: 
text: Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Gale!
dialog: 
text: He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for
dialog: it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
dialog: 
text: Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door.
text: She tears it open, disappearing into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SOUND STAGE - SAME
dialog: 
text: Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands
text: in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage.
text: Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.
dialog: 
text: Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room.
text: Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening
text: as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are
text: heard, making their way towards her.
dialog: 
text: Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a
text: sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GHOST FIGURE
dialog: 
text: That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.
text: She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the
text: control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,
text: plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost
text: moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears
text: out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying
text: to secure it. There's no lock.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: AT THE MAIN DOOR
dialog: 
text: Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be
text: quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he
text: immediately spots Gale.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She
text: drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Dewey moves to the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Gale! Gale!
dialog: 
text: She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS
text: against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
dialog: 
text: Gale shoves everything she can find against the door,
text: not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
text: sound proof barrier behind her.
dialog: 
text: She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind
text: Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE
dialog: 
text: Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is
text: terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see
text: Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
text: into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is
text: splattered against the glass.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN THE CONTROL BOOTH
dialog: 
text: Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off
text: guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.
text: Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios
text: as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: IN THE DUBBING STAGE
dialog: 
text: Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.
dialog: 
text: Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed
text: against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves
text: to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment
text: as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes
dialog: reveal it.
dialog: 
text: Gale BEATS against the glass window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: (through tears)
speaker_heading: NOOOOOOO!
dialog: 
text: Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is
text: mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made
text: his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.
text: She races to the door, throws the things away.
dialog: 
text: She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
text: through. And she's off and running.
dialog: 
text: Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only
text: long enough to lock it.
dialog: 
text: BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
text: holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a
text: storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through
dialog: it and out into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Gale shoots down it.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATER
dialog: 
text: Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in

text: passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out
dialog: onto...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAME
dialog: 
text: The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta

dialog: Sid goes for it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAME
dialog: 
text: Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
scene_heading: SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!
dialog: 
text: Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound
text: porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody
text: is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A
text: WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,
text: strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
dialog: 
text: Sid runs to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh God, help me. We have to call
dialog: the police.
dialog: 
text: Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open
text: and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has
dialog: no comprehension skills at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have keys? I need to get
dialog: inside.
dialog: 
text: Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
text: Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves
text: them, moving down off the porch and around to the back
text: of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's
dialog: locked too.
dialog: 
text: Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots
dialog: a big tree with a...
dialog: 
text: BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She
text: moves toward it.
dialog: 
text: As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He
text: lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still
text: chained to the tree.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mickey? Mickey?
dialog: 
text: A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there
text: very much dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh God, no, Mickey...
dialog: 
text: She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,
text: rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried
text: funk, his eyes wide.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've
dialog: been here all night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Listen to me. We've got to get
dialog: help. The Killer's here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: He's after me.
dialog: 
text: Mickey pulls on his chained arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Shit! You've got to cut me down,
dialog: Sid.
dialog: 
text: Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I'll be right back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Where you going?
dialog: 
text: Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.
text: Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid
text: settles on a shovel.
dialog: 
text: Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's
text: pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Watch out.
dialog: 
text: Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on
text: the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Do it again.
dialog: 
text: CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around
text: peering into the night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Don't panic.
dialog: 
text: Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings
text: it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Watch out.
dialog: 
text: Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't
text: see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the
text: tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and
text: gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.
dialog: 
text: Mickey looks up, just in time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
text: SIDNEYWATCHOUT!
dialog: 
text: Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.
text: Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,
text: catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
dialog: 
text: Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,
text: twists, squirms... anything to free himself.
dialog: 
text: The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Hey.
dialog: 
text: Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost
text: following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting
text: across the yard, running smack into...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE GHOST MASKED KILLER
dialog: 
text: But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each
text: side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two
text: Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but
text: they counter, keeping her surrounded.
dialog: 
text: Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.
text: She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.
text: They close in on her, ready to strike.
dialog: 
text: She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the
text: Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MICKEY
dialog: Run, Sid...
dialog: 
text: Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards
text: the front of the yard.
dialog: 
text: Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.
text: He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't
text: know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.
dialog: 
text: Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...
text: she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around
dialog: just in time to see...
dialog: 
text: Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're
text: knives strike at the same time. One through the
text: stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw
text: their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily
text: hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
text: Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off
text: running, along the side of the house, through a row of
dialog: shrub that take her to...

scene_heading: EXT. STREET - SAME
dialog: 
text: Sid is back on the campus street, running down the
text: middle of it.
dialog: 
text: She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.
text: KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and
text: SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet
text: pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the
text: car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.
dialog: 
text: She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The
text: theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone
text: entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Hallie?
dialog: 
text: But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an
text: emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She
dialog: goes for it.
dialog: 
text: Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL
dialog: button.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from phone)
dialog: What is your emergency please?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Someone's trying to kill me. I need
dialog: the police.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Are you in danger now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Yes, goddammit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Where is your attacker?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Stay under the safety light. Help
text: is on its way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: The safety what? Fuck that!
dialog: 
text: Just then, Gale hears a NOISE. A door opening. She
text: looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side
dialog: theatre door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
speaker_heading: SIDNEY!
dialog: 
text: But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells
text: into the phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuckin' hurry.
dialog: 
text: Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE SAME
dialog: 
text: The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge
text: proscenium stage.
dialog: 
text: Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on
text: it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way
text: down the aisle toward the orchestra section.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the
text: furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from
text: the stage wings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hallie?
dialog: 
text: Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that
text: extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and
text: moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either
text: side of her.
dialog: 
text: Complete darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: DRIP! DRIP!
dialog: 
text: Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She
text: wipes it from her face when...
dialog: 
text: CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the
text: house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at
text: this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in
text: crimson. Then out to the house... the light is
dialog: blinding.
dialog: 
text: CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid
text: looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She
text: leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.
dialog: 
text: The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back
text: wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
dialog: antique weapons and...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: 
text: Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
text: much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
text: bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
text: in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
text: She breaks into tears. And then...
dialog: 
text: Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
text: another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
text: trapping her. She looks in shock at...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: 
text: Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
text: turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
text: third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
text: set of DEATHTRAP.
dialog: 
text: Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
text: everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
dialog: 
dialog: CLAPPING!
dialog: 
text: A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
text: applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
text: down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
dialog: 
text: Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
text: Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
dialog: find...
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
dialog: 
text: Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
text: And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
text: arms and legs bound by electric tape.
dialog: 
text: Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
text: now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
text: light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
text: Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
text: pleading eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: Quick, untie me.
dialog: 
text: Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans
text: down to untie him but stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (from behind video
dialog: camera)
dialog: You've seen this movie before,
dialog: haven't you?
dialog: 
text: Sidney looks to the voice. The camera is pulled away to
dialog: reveal...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: 
text: He smiles at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Smile for the camera.
dialog: 
text: Sidney remains silent.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: Sid, c'mon.
dialog: 
text: Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either
text: one of them. Derek watches her, amused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Go on, untie him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No. This is a set up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: That's quick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: Please, Sidney, he's going to kill
dialog: us.
dialog: 
text: Derek begins filming again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You must be dealing with some
dialog: serious trust issues right about
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall
text: where Hallie hangs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK (CONT'D)
dialog: Sidney, you can't keep your back to
dialog: the audience like that. Could you
dialog: cheat a little forward for me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: Please, Sidney.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You're really stumped, aren't you?
dialog: You know there's two killers but
dialog: you don't know who they are. I'm a
dialog: given. The boyfriend. Way obvious.
dialog: But now you're torn. Everyone else
text: appears to be dead. Except for
dialog: Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching
text: out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find
text: Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much
dialog: alive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The
dialog: story of your life, Sid.
dialog: 
text: Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself
text: down from the wall with a big hunting knife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Need some help, honey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: I got it..
dialog: 
text: Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You should really see your face
dialog: right now, Sid. It's doing some
dialog: freaky shit.
dialog: 
text: Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Yeah, you look quizzical yet
text: pensive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Yeah, how can we help? Do you have
dialog: any questions regarding the sequel
dialog: of your life?
dialog: 
text: Sidney stares them down. She's been here before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Good question. You took the bait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS?
dialog: Well, Derek and I have this whole
dialog: Mickey/Mallory-Woody
dialog: Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing
text: going on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I really don't like that
dialog: comparison, honey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: (to Sid)
dialog: He hates Oliver Stone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I find his work overwrought.
dialog: 
text: Sid is waning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've
dialog: been planning this baby for a year.
dialog: Humor us.
dialog: 
text: Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to
text: untie him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Nope. You had your chance.
dialog: 
text: Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs
dialog: off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THEATRE SAME
dialog: 
text: Gale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it.
text: It's locked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: She moves down along the theatre to another door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE A MINUTE LATER
dialog: 
text: Hallie and Derek move around Sid, taking turns filming
text: her with the camera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: We met on the internet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: He sent me the cutest e-mail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: I read her postings on the horror
dialog: movie chat boards and fell
dialog: hopelessly. Hook, line...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: We have our own website now. We
dialog: dedicated a whole page to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You'd me amazed at how many of us
dialog: there are out there. It's a whole
dialog: world, Sid. You're really popular
text: amongst the demented.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: You're the one who got away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Until now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: You guys are fucked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Actually Cotton, and I think
dialog: critics would agree, it's the other
dialog: way around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Poor Cotton, could life be a little
dialog: more cruel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You're not going to get away with
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Of course not. Who wants to? What's
dialog: the point if we don't get caught?
dialog: Where's the glamour in that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: The way I see it. We'll be
dialog: arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on
dialog: the home footage. Secure a book
dialog: deal. If all goes as planned, our
dialog: trial should coincide with the
text: release of STAB II.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: A verdict and premiere all on the
dialog: same day. I love it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: We're hoping for the death penalty.
dialog: I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING
text: swan song exit planned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: And now, drum roll please...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one
dialog: last surprise for you.
dialog: 
text: Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had
text: loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: A twist ending if you will.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Yeah, we really had our work cut
dialog: out for us. It really is the curse
dialog: of the sequel. The Billy/Stu
dialog: thing's been done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: ... so we had to be different but
dialog: yet the same because if you venture
dialog: to far away from your orginal story
dialog: you completely alienate the
dialog: audience...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: And we didn't want to do that, Sid.
dialog: We wanted to give you your money's
dialog: worth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: So we found a compromise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Or it found us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: We have a surprise guest star
text: waiting in the wings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Just for you, Sid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to
dialog: flip.
dialog: 
text: Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Oh yeah.
dialog: (to Sid)
dialog: We figure the one of us that
dialog: actually kills you will get a
dialog: little more press. It's been an
dialog: ongoing discussion.
dialog: (to Hallie)
dialog: Heads or tails?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Tails.
dialog: 
text: He flips the coin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Shit! You win.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE AUDITORIUM
dialog: 
text: Gale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She
text: eyes the proceedings on stage. She sees Sidney standing
text: over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on either
text: side... knives in hand. She races down the aisle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Sidney!
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
dialog: 
text: They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy
dialog: to see her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Gale!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE AUDITORIUM
dialog: 
text: Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
dialog: 
text: Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE CURTAIN DROPS
dialog: 
text: Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the
text: curtain separates them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON STAGE
dialog: 
text: Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her
dialog: throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: It's about time she showed up.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE AUDITORIUM
dialog: 
text: Gale moves to the exit door and into the...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIR WELL SAME
dialog: 
text: Gale eyes a door that's marked "STAGE DOOR". She opens
text: it and steps in coming face to face with a...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER
dialog: 
text: Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
text: standing, lips pursed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for
dialog: you.
dialog: 
text: Gale's face is a mass of confusion.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAGE SAME
dialog: 
text: Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her
text: knees, next to Cotton.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Okay, look, you guys - I applaud
dialog: your methodical expertise but I
dialog: have a question. What's going to
dialog: happen after I die? I thought the
dialog: heroine is supposed to live.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Not this time.
dialog: 
text: Hallie moves in on her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Yeah, we're trying to send a
dialog: message to Hollywood. I'm really
dialog: getting tired of all the happy
dialog: endings. It's just not reality. In
dialog: the real world the good guys die,
dialog: the innocent are punished, and the
text: murderers inherit the earth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: But nobody wants to see that. It'll
dialog: never go. They'll rewrite you. You
dialog: don't want that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.
dialog: I guess fearing death makes one
text: anxious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You fucking freaked out movie nut
dialog: psychos...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (off camera)
dialog: Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies
dialog: don't create pyschos.
dialog: 
text: Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her
text: very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all
text: turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in
text: hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He
dialog: doesn't want to miss a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Don't you know that by now? It's
text: about family. It all starts at
text: home. It starts with the father...
dialog: and the mother.
dialog: 
text: Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to
text: Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Mrs. Loomis?
dialog: 
text: Gale stops cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Oh my God.
dialog: 
text: Gale turns to Debbie Salt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Jesus. It can't be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Told you we had a guest star.
dialog: Didn't see that coming, did you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Everything's taken on a hyper-
dialog: reality, hasn't it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: You're Billy's mother?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: I couldn't believe you didn't
dialog: recognize me. You even interviewed
dialog: me for your book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: You're all in this together?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: We had to have financing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: Tuition's expensive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Why Mrs. Loomis?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Where should we start? Your mother
dialog: ruined my marriage by sleeping with
dialog: my husband. You ruined my family by
dialog: killing my son. Gale aired it to
dialog: the world. Should I go on... isn't
dialog: that enough?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Jesus, you're just as whacked as
dialog: your son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Where do you think he got it?
dialog: Mental illness is heriditary. Who
dialog: do you think incouraged him to kill
dialog: your mother? He was a smart kid but
dialog: children need parental guidance.
dialog: 
text: Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in
dialog: total disbelief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We
dialog: never would have been able to it
text: without her.
dialog: 
text: Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie,
text: smiling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: And I couldn't have done it without
dialog: you two. Now who won the coin toss?
dialog: 
text: Hallie raises her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HALLIE
dialog: I did.
dialog: 
text: Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and
text: FIRES. Sid and Gale SCREAM as a bullet through the
text: forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat
text: wall. Her body drops to the floor. Dead.
dialog: 
text: Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks
dialog: to Debbie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: What are you...
dialog: 
text: Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves,
text: the bullet catches him in the stomach. He drops to his
text: knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet.
text: This time dropping. Very dead. His body falls near
text: Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this
text: ordeal. He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his
dialog: wrists.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SIDNEY AND GALE
dialog: 
text: Turn to Debbie in complete horror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Nice kids but a little out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: What are you going to do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Finish what my son started.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: But you'll never get away with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Enter Cotton Weary.
dialog: 
text: Cotton looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)
dialog: Think about it. An innocent man
dialog: wrongly accused. Spends time in
text: prison where he justs sits with his
text: righteous anger, waiting, planning
dialog: his revenge. His life so
text: incomprehensively ruined he's
dialog: forced to take revenge on the
dialog: people responsible. It's perfect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: No... not again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were
dialog: just meant to be a killer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You'll never get away with this.
dialog: 
text: Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE SALT
dialog: Who would you like to shoot first,
dialog: Cotton?
dialog: 
text: Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings.
text: With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It
text: strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back.
text: Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She
text: goes down. Dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Thank God.
dialog: 
text: Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She
text: helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks
text: about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She
text: takes a deep breath. Relieved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE (CONT'D)
dialog: God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm
dialog: so sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
text: Gale gives him a hug.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALE
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: 
text: He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife
text: behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal
text: move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she
text: goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.
dialog: 
text: Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's
text: body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing
text: Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: NOOO!
dialog: 
text: Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera
text: lay, he pulls the tape from it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: It's perfect, Sidney. No one will
dialog: ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm
dialog: the victim.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Please, Cotton, don't do this.
dialog: 
text: He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: I get my revenge and make some fast
dialog: cash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: It's over, Cotton.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COTTON
dialog: Not until you're dead.
dialog: 
text: Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through
dialog: the set door to...
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BACKSTAGE
dialog: 
text: Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the
text: narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back
text: wail. She races down it.
dialog: 
text: She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE
speaker_heading: SCRIM!
dialog: 
text: Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage
text: door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder
text: that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk
dialog: above.
dialog: 
text: Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with
dialog: lightning speed.
dialog: 
text: Cotton, up and running, is close behind.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CATWALK SAME
dialog: 
text: The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
text: and a large chandelier are stored in the air.
dialog: 
text: Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
dialog: ending.
dialog: 
text: AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
dialog: 
text: WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE
text: CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY
text: RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND
scene_heading: STABS COTTON.
dialog: 
text: HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH
text: OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT
text: TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY
speaker_heading: CLOSE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END (FOR NOW)
