scene_heading: TITLE AND CREDITS
dialog: 
text: A piercing high note is sustained on the soundtrack as the
text: main title, "CRYSTAL JAPAN" speeds straight at the audience
text: in 3-D and seems to jump right out at them.
dialog: 
text: The opening credits follow. Ominous theme music fills the
text: soundtrack, growing darker and more dissonant.
dialog: 
text: The theme music slowly dissolves into the sound of a radio
text: news broadcast, as the credits continue to unfold.
dialog:

dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Crystal Lake in Pinehurst County,
text: the scene of several unsolved
dialog: deaths years ago, is tragically
dialog: back in the top of the news this
dialog: morning. Police have uncovered
dialog: the remains of eight, as yet,
text: unidentified persons in a gruesome
dialog: and baffling story of mass
dialog: murder...
dialog: 
dialog: End credits.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROADSIDE MARKET - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Shooting over a line of ruffled bushes with leaves just
text: turning towards a rural, time-worn country market. A wide
text: gravel parking area makes it accessible to the highway
text: running past it, otherwise, this Mom & Pop store seems almost
text: like a vision of times gone by.
dialog: 
text: The bushes and overgrown grass, unrestrained by any human
dialog: care, strengthen the sense of isolation. The dying sun
text: shoots its last rays through the trees behind the market.
dialog: 
text: The market has a battered second-story: the living quarters
text: of the people running it. A truck roars by. Then silence,
text: and then again the sound of the radio news report:
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
dialog: ...Judging from the sheer
dialog: brutality of the murders, police
dialog: theorize that they must have been
dialog: committed by at least four
dialog: persons...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE HOUSE / STORE - ANOTHER ANGLE
dialog: 
text: Sagging clotheslines cluttered with drying laundry run across
text: a narrow backyard, all the way to a rickety old shed. The
text: clotheslines are supported by one solitary pole. Linen and
text: garments billow in the rising evening breeze.
dialog: 
text: Cold, foreboding music accompanies the camera as it moves
text: toward a pair of flapping khaki pants and an olive green
text: workshirt hanging side by side on the line.
dialog: 
text: The radio news report grows louder as the clothing snaps
text: directly into the lens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
dialog: ...The sole survivor of the
dialog: massacre has been taken under
dialog: heavy sedation to County Hospital
dialog: in Linfield for observation.
dialog: She's been unable to provide
dialog: police with any clues and is being
dialog: kept under round the clock guard...
dialog: 
scene_heading: HEAVY FOOTSTEPS
dialog: 
text: And then a man parts two shrouds of wet laundry, making his
text: way back towards the house. This is HAROLD: 40ish, paunchy,
text: unshaven and so clumsy that he hits the clothesline pole and
text: knocks it down, burying himself under a heap of linen. A
text: transistor radio pops out of the pocket of his threadbare
text: shirt, still broadcasting the news. One of the upstairs
text: windows opens with a creak, and
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: 
text: Harold's wife, sticks her head out and looks into the
dialog: backyard:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (loud, harsh)
dialog: Goddamnit Harold! I spent all day
dialog: yesterday washing your clothes and
dialog: look what you're doing to 'em.
dialog: Shows how much you care about me.
text: Harold watches her from under the pile of laundry. Then he
text: grabs the radio, staggers up, increasing the radio's volume
text: as he does so, to drown out the voice of his wife.
dialog: 
text: Above him, Edna raves on for a moment (we can't make out what
text: she is saying), then furiously slams the window shut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING ROOM - EVENING
dialog: 
text: The room is musty and cluttered like an old attic. Edna
text: stomps away from the window and turns her attention to the
text: partially functional, old clunker of a black and white TV.
text: She plops herself down onto the lumpy couch and picks up two
text: knitting needles and returns to work on a sweater. A news
text: report about the mass murders is being broadcast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSERT - TV
dialog: 
scene_heading: TELEVISION REPORTER
text: ...A police spokesman tells
dialog: Eyewitness News that authorities
dialog: have been combing the area since
text: just before dawn. Reports of
text: cannibalism and sexual mutilation
dialog: are still unconfirmed...
dialog: Nevertheless, these murders are
dialog: already being called the most
dialog: brutal in local history.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: 
text: Leans in to adjust the long rabbit-ear antenna, spreading the
text: ears apart for a better picture. She listens intently.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TELEVISION REPORTER
text: The motive behind the grisly
dialog: murders remains a mystery at this
dialog: hour as does the identity of the
dialog: killer or killers. The search
text: continues for more bodies.

dialog: ...Residents of the Lake region
dialog: are being urged to take extra
dialog: precaution when approaching
dialog: strangers and to report anything
dialog: unusual to police, immediately.
dialog: We'll be back with the weather
dialog: forecast after this important
dialog: message.
dialog: 
text: Visibly upset, Edna rises to her feet. She goes over to the
text: door leading downstairs to the market, opens it and call out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Harold, what're you doing down
dialog: there?
dialog: 
text: No response. She rushes to the window, jerks it open and
text: sticks her head out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Harold... I want to talk to you.
dialog: 
dialog: No answer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - EDNA'S POV
dialog: 
text: of the backyard. The laundry quietly swells in the wind.
text: For an instant, a human form is visible between layers of
text: drying clothes. From this distance, Edna can't make out who
dialog: it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Harold?
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Unnerved by the continuing noise of the TV, Edna goes back to
text: shut it off. She quickly returns to the window and looks out
dialog: again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA'S POV
dialog: 
text: No sign of anyone, but there is an empty span of clothesline
text: where several articles of clothes were hung, only a second
dialog: before.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE
dialog: 
text: Edna runs for the apartment door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARKET - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Edna flies down the stairs and enters the store from the
text: back. The market is dark, save does shafts of dying sunlight
text: through the grimy front windows.
text: She scans the few aisles back and forth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Harold?
dialog: 
text: A big rabbit appears from behind an arrangement of Campbell's
text: soup cans, and stands on its hind legs on the aisle, trying
text: to guess Edna's next move. Still calling Harold, she turns;
text: starts at the sight of the rabbit; she grabs a tomato from
text: the produce display, throw it at the animal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: God Damn pest, what are you
dialog: staring at?
dialog: 
text: She misses, grabs more vegetables and hurls them at the
text: rabbit. The rabbit dodges them, and scurries away.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING
dialog: 
text: The sunlight is almost gone, stretching the shadows even
text: more. In her nightgown, Edna pushed open the creaky screen
text: door and steps out into the backyard.
dialog: 
text: Shooting towards her through the laundry flapping on the
text: clothesline. As she touches a set of pajamas and finds out
text: that they are still wet.
dialog: 
text: A shoulder suddenly enters the flame, and someone's
text: silhouette blocks the screen just for a couple of seconds,
text: before the intruder slips behind another curtain of drying
text: clothes, revealing Edna again: she's still checking the
text: clothes and hasn't noticed anything.
dialog: 
text: She comes to where the trousers and workshirt were, and no
text: longer. That's a shock, but she's not quite sure that they
text: were here in the first place, so she goes on, and starts
text: talking to herself to fortify her ailing courage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Christ All Mighty, Harold, you
dialog: just take what's yours and leave
dialog: the rest for me to do. Very
dialog: considerate!
dialog: (collecting the dry
dialog: laundry and putting
dialog: it in a basket)
dialog: You could at least finished the
dialog: job. Do I have to do everything
dialog: around here?
dialog: 
text: Edna hears a noise and whips around. Her imagination is
dialog: working overtime.
text: A bedsheet is swelling slowly in the breeze, taking the shape
text: of a human body. Is anyone behind it? Ominous music...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (swallowing hard)
dialog: Harold... I swear, sometimes
dialog: you're such a child...
dialog: 
text: She charges forward. She rips the sheet off the line and
text: falls in a heap with it. There is no one behind it.
dialog: 
text: She turns over and lays on her back. Above her, there's only
text: the dark evening sky and the branches of a tree, rustling
dialog: back and forth.
dialog: 
text: Edna gets up and quickly pulls the remaining laundry off the
text: lines, tossing it into the basket. As she does, she passes
text: near the wooden shed at the back of the store.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. YARD
dialog: 
text: The shed door creak open. Edna turns around. Suddenly,
text: there's a crashing noise from inside. That's enough for
text: Edna... she hauls up the basket and rushes back inside the
dialog: store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARKET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The white rabbit that gave Edna such a scare is now hopping
text: across a row of canned goods. A man's hand enters frame and
text: grabs the rabbit by the nape of its neck and lifts it off the
text: shelf, into his arms.
dialog: 
text: It's Harold. He places the rabbit on his shoulder and grabs
text: a jar of peanuts from the shelf. He twists open the vacuum-
text: sealed jar and wolfs down a handful of its contents. With
text: another handful, he feeds the rabbit, who sniffs and partakes.
dialog: 
text: Harold rescrews the lid and places it back on the shelf. He
text: turns on the radio in his breast pocket. Music blares.
dialog: 
text: He grabs his broom and starts sweeping down the aisle, the
text: rabbit remaining contentedly on his shoulder.
dialog: 
text: Harold stops at the dairy case and grabs a half-gallon jug of
text: milk. He breaks the seal and pulls off the cap. He first
text: offers the rabbit a taste, then gulps down a swig himself.
text: IN THE BACKGROUND
dialog: 
text: An unidentified face, in soft focus, peers in through the
text: storefront window then disappears almost as quickly. Harold
text: is unaware.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: 
text: screws the cap back on and replaces the jug in the case.
dialog: 
text: The sound of crunching and munching.
dialog: 
text: Harold turns around. The the produce section, the cellophane
text: packages of carrots on display are moving slightly.
dialog: 
text: He reaches in and pushes off the top few packages to reveal,
text: underneath, another rabbit, a grey one this time, nibbling on
text: a carrot.
dialog: 
text: He lifts the rabbit out of the case and places it on his
text: opposite shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (looking from one
dialog: rabbit to the other)
dialog: Sorry guys, it's back to the
text: slammer before Edna make a fur
dialog: coat out of ya.
dialog: 
text: On his way to the back door, Harold passes a rack of cakes
text: and pies. He stops long enough to open a box of six
text: chocolate-covered donuts. He takes one out and shoves it
text: into his mouth.
dialog: 
text: Unbeknownst to Harold, a human form in shadow appears at the
text: back door. The door is quietly pushed open. Someone is
text: watching him.
dialog: 
text: The camera as stalker enters the store and moves slowly
text: towards Harold, his back to us. Ominous music accompanies
text: the approach.
dialog: 
text: Checks filled to capacity. Harold closes the package and
text: puts it back in place on the rack, hiding it under several
text: unopened packages.
dialog: 
text: Harold turns. The stalker is right behind him, completely
text: startled, he jumps back and chokes on the doughnuts. The
text: rabbits hop off his shoulders.
dialog: 
text: Unexpectedly, Harold find himself face to face... with his
dialog: wife, Edna.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Didn't I feed you enough for
dialog: breakfast?
dialog: 
text: Harold doesn't answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The doctor said you had to lose
dialog: weight, didn't he? I try to help
dialog: you but you sneak food behind my
dialog: back. What am I gonna do with you?
dialog: 
text: Without a word, Harold bends down to retrieve the rabbits.
text: He scoops them up in his arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: And put those filthy animals back
dialog: where they belong, please!
dialog: 
text: Harold exits by way of the back door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Harold puts the grey rabbit on his shoulder, the white rabbit
text: remains wrapped in his arms. He swallows the rest of the
text: doughnut in his mouth as he flips a flashlight out of his
text: back pocket and ambles across the yard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHED - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Light filters through the cracked walls partially
text: illuminating a variety of tools, old barrels, various odds &
text: ends - and a rabbit hutch.
dialog: 
text: Harold flicks on the flashlight as he enters. The rabbit
text: atop his shoulder jumps off and scurries away. The rabbit in
text: his arms squirms and squeals. The animals sense that
dialog: something is wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (stroking the white
dialog: rabbit)
dialog: What're you little guys so nervous
dialog: about?
dialog: 
text: He scans the shed with the flashlight to locate the runaway
text: as he tries to contain the jittery ball of fur in his arms.
text: The flashlight searches each corner, until the beam finally
dialog: stops on:
dialog: 
text: THE RABBIT HUTCH
dialog: 
text: Music pounds hard on the soundtrack, as through the hutch
text: grillwork we can see a mass of dead rabbits, lying one next
text: to the other, staring up with glinting, glass eyes.
dialog: 
text: Harold stands immobilized, in a state of shock. He looks
text: down upon the limp bodies of his beloved pets, his face
text: turned into a sad mask of outrage. He holds onto the white
text: rabbit even tighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Who would do this...?
dialog: 
text: Trembling, Harold reaches to lift the lid of the hutch. The
text: music throbs...
dialog: 
text: A big timber rattlesnake springs out of the hutch, mouth wide
text: and open, twin poisonous fangs shining in the beam of the
dialog: flashlight.
dialog: 
text: The music drops out as the snake's loud kiss dominates. The
text: muscles of its dark, lean body push the deadly mouth ahead,
text: into the lens of the camera.
dialog: 
text: Instinctively, Harold slams the hutch down, dropping his
text: flashlight and the white rabbit. The snake hisses and spits
text: at the camera through the wife mesh.
dialog: 
text: Literally scared shitless, Harold races out of the shed,
text: holding his stomach with both hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Harold dashes through the back door, and up the stairs like
text: a charging bull.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Harold bursts through the door, crashing into his
text: unsuspecting wife. Edna is knocked off balance and tries to
text: hold onto him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: What happened? What's the matter?
text: Harold can't talk. He rubs his stomach and heads straight
text: for the bathroom, vanishing inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: It's all the crap you've been
dialog: stuffing yourself with.
dialog: 
text: Edna turns up the volume on the TV and plunks herself down on
dialog: the couch.
dialog: 
text: She reaches for her knitting bag and empties its contents.
text: One of her two, long, thin knitting needles is missing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (rummaging all around
dialog: her)
dialog: Now where could that other needle
dialog: have gone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STOREROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The room is a combination: storing place mostly, there are
text: two ample cupboards facing each other, each leaning against
text: a wall, a mess of crates and boxes lying on top of each other
text: behind a dusty curtain... and a toilet bowl, left from the
dialog: days when this was just an oversized bathroom. The toilet
text: bowl is against the fourth wall, at an angle behind the door.
dialog: 
text: The sound of the TV filters through the door as Harold,
text: trousers down to his knees, sits on the toilet, sighing with
text: relief as the first bout of diarrhea is over.
dialog: 
text: He loosens his collar, wipes some sweat from his brow,
text: reaches behind the toilet tank, and produces a hidden bottle
dialog: of Whiskey.
dialog: 
text: He unscrews the cap and takes a hardy swig. He leans back
text: and shut his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Those poor little creatures...
dialog: 
text: Another swig. Some of the liquor spills over his chin and he
text: wipes it with his sleeve. His eyes wander around aimlessly,
dialog: then focus on...
scene_heading: THE DUSTY CURTAIN
dialog: 
text: partially masking the mess of boxes and crates. It seems to
text: ripple subtly, moved by an ever so slight movement of air,
dialog: perhaps someone's breath?
dialog: 
text: Harold waits. The curtains seem still. Harold is about to
text: relax when a brief, hollow noise is heard.
dialog: 
text: Harold tries to locate the noise, but it's over before he can
text: tell its source. Pants around his ankles, he rises, shuffles
text: to one of the closets. It takes some courage to yank the
text: door open, and the camera moves fast into a...
dialog: 
text: FLAT CLOSEUP of empty shelves - nothing has touched them in
text: a long time, except dust.
dialog: 
text: Breathing relief, Harold pulls up his pants again, just
text: enough to be able to hobble grotesquely to the dusty curtain.
text: He rips it apart, stares at the odd assortment of boxes and
text: crates - empty, lifeless, and uncannily menacing because of
text: their lifelessness.
dialog: 
text: Reassured, Harold gives the other closet a glance, almost
text: decides against checking it - and then changes his mind, and
text: stumbles, pants still around his ankles, towards it.
dialog: 
text: Looks like this one hasn't been opened at all for a long
text: time. Harold tugs at the door - a creak, followed instantly
text: by a musical stinger as a huge hand holding a meat cleaver
text: rips into the shot, strikes Harold, imbedding the cleaver in
text: his chest.
dialog: 
text: Harold manages a half-scream that mixes incongruously with
text: the laughter from the TV in the living room. As the hand
text: twists the cleaver, the scream becomes a raspy cough.
dialog: 
text: Harold stumbles backwards and crashes to the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Edna hears the crash. She turns off the television.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: Harold?
dialog: 
text: No answer. She gets up from the couch and goes to the
text: bathroom door. She listens and hears the noise of the toilet
text: flushing and flushing, as if someone's hand never released
dialog: the lever.
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (rattling the door
dialog: knob)
dialog: Harold... what's taking you so
dialog: long in there? You all right?
dialog: 
text: She pushes against the door. It doesn't budge. She looks
text: down and notices some kind of liquid seeping out from
text: underneath the bathroom door. She dips her fingers in it and
text: sniffs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Whiskey, I thought so.
dialog: 
text: She goes over to a desk, opens a small drawer and finds a
dialog: skeleton key.
dialog: 
text: She hurries back to the bathroom/storeroom door, ready to
text: insert the key. To her shock, the door is now open a crack!
dialog: 
text: For a moment, Edna is nonplussed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EDNA
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Harold!
dialog: 
text: She pushes the door - it swings open, revealing the open
text: closets, the boxes and crates...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Edna steps inside and inadvertently kicks the half-empty
text: bottle of Whiskey. She picks up the bottle while the
text: flushing noise persists maddeningly.
dialog: 
text: She turns toward the toilet, which is behind the door and
text: screams at the sight of Harold sitting there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: 
text: pants down, like a grotesque dummy, blood drooling out of the
text: corners of his mouth, the meat cleaver sticking out of his
text: chest and one elbow stuck against the flushing handle.
dialog: 
text: The Whiskey bottle falls from Edna's hand, hits the floor and
text: shatters.
dialog: 
text: Edna screams uncontrollably.
dialog: 
text: From behind her a huge hand enters the flame and pierces the
text: back of her head with the previously missing knitting needle.
text: The needle is pushed out through her mouth, right at the
dialog: camera.
text: she gags on her own blood and slums out of frame.

dialog: 
text: A group ethnic children are playing stickball in the street,
text: weatherworn two and three-family houses on either side of
dialog: them.
dialog: 
text: A red passenger van screeches around the corner and heads
text: down the block, slowing down as it advances on the oblivious

dialog: 
text: The van continues for a few yards then parallel parks in the
dialog: first available space.
dialog: 
text: The driver Chris...19, blond, attractive but intense...steps

speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: No!
dialog:

dialog: 
text: CAMERA TRACKS in front of the three friends. A rotund,

dialog: 
text: As they walk, Andy and Debbie are locked in each other's arms
text: and they begin to kiss. Chris looks at them and shakes her
dialog: head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sex, sex, sex. You guys are

dialog: don't embarrass me. When you meet
dialog: this woman, just relax and be
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Would you be yourself...
dialog: (ripping off mask)
dialog: ...if you looked this this?
dialog: 
text: Shelly puts on a pair of unflattering prescription glasses.
text: Although he has a pleasant face, Shelly is overweight, greasy-
text: haired and unkempt.
dialog: 
text: Chris and Debbie lead the way for Andy and Shelly up the
text: porch steps, to the front door of a shabby, two-family house.
dialog: 
text: Chris rings the bell. Shelly takes a few steps back. He
text: mats down his unruly hair, tucks in his shirt and takes off
text: his glasses. He's ready.
dialog: 
text: The door opens and a middle-aged Hispanic woman stands behind
text: the outer screen door.

speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (Spanish accent)
dialog: Yes?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: Hi, Mrs. Sanchez. I'm Chris.
dialog: We've come to pick up Vera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: (bruskly)
dialog: She's not going.
dialog: 
text: She shuts the door in Chris' face. The group stands there
text: not knowing what to do next. V.O.'s from inside the house
text: they can hear Vera and her mother arguing in Spanish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What are they saying?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: I don't know. I flunked Spanish.
dialog: 
text: They all turn to leave when suddenly the front door swings
text: open. This time Vera, knapsack over her shoulder, ready to
text: go, comes out onto the porch. She's a knockout...20, exotic,
text: raven-haired beauty...in tight jeans. They turn and stare at
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (forcing a smile)
dialog: Hi everybody, what're you looking
dialog: at. Let's go.
text: Shelly, intimidated by Vera's sexy good looks, steps behind
text: Andy and slips the mask back over his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (to Vera)
dialog: Is everything okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: You know, just your basic old
dialog: fashioned mother problems.
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: So, where's my date?
dialog: 
text: Shelly comes out from behind Andy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (letting her
dialog: disappointment show)
dialog: You're Shelly?

speaker_heading: SHELLY

dialog: Hey! The van's on fire!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VAN
dialog: 
text: White smoke billows out of the van windows, engulfing the
text: vehicle and the luggage tied to the top.
dialog: 
text: The whole group rushes off the porch and races to the van.
text: The first one there, Andy, opens the passenger side door and
text: jumps in. Chris runs around to the driver's side and does
dialog: the same.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VAN
dialog: 
text: Through thick, acrid smoke, Chili and her boyfriend, Chuck...
text: Cheech and Chong lookalies...can be seen sitting in the back
text: on the floor, each puffing away like crazy on a bong filled
text: with Marijuana. Each wears a stereo headset that is plugged
text: into their own Sony Walkman portable cassette players.

dialog: have known."

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: How much farther to the cottage?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS

scene_heading: REAR OF THE VAN
dialog: 
text: Chili and Chuck are sprawled out on the floor, taking

dialog: 
text: Shelly sits cross-legged near the very back of the van,
text: opposite Vera, who sits with her legs open. Daydreaming, she
text: gazes upward at the sky and treetops through the back window.
dialog: 
text: Shelly can't stop staring at Vera, admiring her sexy body.
text: Vera senses that Shelly is undressing her with his eyes and
text: quickly turns her head around and catches him looking at her
text: breasts. Shelly averts his eyes in embarrassment and looks
text: over at Chuck who lights up a joint, inhales and hands it
dialog: Chili.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Is that all you two are gonna do
dialog: this weekend...smoke dope?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Why not, man? Is there a law
dialog: against it?

speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: (persisting)

speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Like what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: (inhaling)
dialog: I can't think of anything.
dialog:

dialog: it to Vera.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Sure, why not.
dialog: 
text: Vera comes forward on her hands and knees, reaching out for
text: the joint. As she does, she inadvertently thrusts her

text: attempt to retreat from it. Actually he rather enjoys it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (as she draws on the
dialog: joint)
dialog: Is this stuff any good?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Home grown, man! Of course it's

speaker_heading: CHILI

dialog: 
text: Vera passes the joint to him and sits back down across from

speaker_heading: SHELLY

dialog: 
text: Abel nods "hello" to one and all. They nod back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: (in an eloquent
dialog: soothing voice)
dialog: You are, all of you, very kind and
dialog: generous young people to lend a
text: helping hand to a tired, old man.
dialog: Thank you very much. Perhaps I
dialog: can repay the kindness.
dialog: 
text: The civilized speaking-manner of the shabby-looking stranger

speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: Drop me off? How do you mean?

dialog: 
text: Abel reaches into his dusty dufflebag and pulls out a very
text: small bundle wrapped in a scrap of cloth.
dialog: 
text: Chris watches via the rearview mirror. Her expression is
dialog: wary.

speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: That's an eyeball! Oh, God!
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: "He" wanted me to warn you.
dialog: (evangelical)
dialog: Look at this, all of you!
dialog: 
text: He holds the eyeball out for each to view. They shrink back

speaker_heading: DEBBIE

dialog: 
text: The motorcycles head straight for them. In a panic, the

scene_heading: EXT. LAKESIDE COTTAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: An overgrown driveway meanders among oak trees towards a

dialog: 
text: The house has an elevated porch and curtained windows. It is
text: in relatively decent condition though weatherbeaten and
text: creates from the start an impression of family history.
dialog: 
text: There is ample parking space before the house. On the left
text: side of the driveway as one approaches, some thirty yards
text: diagonally across from the house, there is a tall red barn

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE

dialog: 
text: No response. Just the distant SOUND of FEET RUNNING and
scene_heading: LAUGHTER.
dialog:

dialog: door.
dialog: 
text: It has been a while since she has last visited the family
dialog: country home and she is actually pleased to have this moment
dialog: to herself.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
text: The SOUND of the others thrashing about in the lake can be
text: heard as Chris reaches for the handle and whisks the door
text: aside. Instinctively, she braces herself, but nothing jumps
text: out at her. Annoyed with herself for being so suspicious and
text: jumpy, Chris just leans in and grabs for the first bag she

dialog: 
text: A HAND springs INTO FRAME and wraps around Chris' wrist. She

speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: There's nothin' to be afraid of.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: The basement is overrun with cobwebs and spiderwebs. Rusted

speaker_heading: CHILI

text: As Chuck zips down his pants, Chili turns on the dryer.
text: Annoyingly, the dryer RATTLES and SHAKES.

speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Uh, Chris... I don't mean to be

dialog:

speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: 
text: Fox scans the premises. Her face lights up with the smile of
text: a child in a toy store trying to decide which area to explore
dialog: first.
dialog: 
dialog: This is your typical barn with a variety of heavy duty tools,
text: some rusting; saw horses; wooden benches and ladders; a horse
text: stall; haybins, haystacks and a second floor hayloft; and,
text: several storage rooms.
dialog: 
text: With the fascination of a street kid who has probably never
text: seen the inside of a barn, Fox wanders through the rustic
text: interior. In her high-heeled boots, she has trouble
text: maneuvering around on the muddy, hay covered floor.
dialog: 
text: As she approaches the toolshed, one of her heels sticks deep
text: into a sticky patch of mud and she falls forward off-balance.
text: To stop her fall, Fox reaches out for the toolshed handle.
text: She grabs it but the rotting old door tears off its hinges
text: and she topples to the ground -- her face landing inches away
text: from a pitchfork's prongs aiming upwards at her.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes focus on the sharp teeth of the pitchfork. Alarmed
text: by the close call, Fox tosses the implement away, gets up and
text: dusts herself off.
dialog: 
text: Looking skyward to the loft area, Fox moves over to its
text: ladder and starts up. The ladder quivers as she ascends,
text: apparently dislodging a bale of hay at the top and sending it
text: crashing towards her. (Or, was it Jason?) Fox swings her
text: body out of the way just in time. The bale whizzes by her

dialog:

speaker_heading: DEREK

speaker_heading: SHELLY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: When you dropped me off at the
dialog: house, it was very late. My
dialog: parents were waiting up for me.
dialog: As soon as I got in the door, they
text: starting yelling and cursing at
dialog: me. I was so upset... I told them
dialog: I slept with you. My mothers
dialog: slapped me. That was the first
dialog: time she'd ever hit me. I
dialog: couldn't believe it. I ran out of
text: the house and into the woods as
dialog: fast and as far as I could run.
dialog: I was crying. They had destroyed
dialog: the most beautiful night of my
dialog: life and I wanted to punish them
dialog: for that. I decided to hide out
dialog: all night. They'd be so worried
dialog: that they'd be sorry for what they
dialog: did to me. The woods were cold and
dialog: damp from the rain. I found a dry
dialog: spot under a rotted oak tree and I
dialog: guess I fell asleep.
dialog: (takes a deep breath)
dialog: All I can remember next is being
text: startled out of sleep by the sound
dialog: of footsteps. I thought it was my
dialog: father so I hid behind the tree.
text: But the footsteps just stopped.
dialog: The woods were dark. I couldn't
dialog: see anything.
dialog: (intensifying)
text: I heard a cracking noise behind
dialog: me. I turned around and... and...
dialog: oh, God... there was this hideous
text: looking man. So grotesque he was
text: almost inhuman. He had a knife
text: and he started to slash away at
dialog: me, again and again. I was so
dialog: hysterical and I don't know how I
dialog: was able to get away. I ran and
text: ran, but he kept coming. He was
text: big but so fast. He caught me and
dialog: pulled me down to the ground and
dialog: he... he... ripped my blouse off.
dialog: I was screaming, but who could
dialog: hear me? Then... oh, God... he
dialog: dragged me by the hair along the
dialog: ground. I was kicking and
text: yelling. He dragged me deeper and
dialog: deeper into the woods. Oh,
dialog: please... please...

speaker_heading: DEREK

dialog: 
text: Only the flowing water can be heard as a darkened,
text: indistinguishable FIGURE ENTERS FRAME -- directly in front of
text: CAMERA -- and lowers himself all the way into the lake by the
dialog: waterfall.
dialog: 
text: Vera rolls her pant legs up to her knees. She dangles her
text: long legs over the dock. Her toes break the surface of the
text: water, SWOOSHING it back and forth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAKE
dialog: 
text: Air bubbles rise to the top. Vera does not see the darkened
text: figure as he swims beneath the surface of the water.
dialog:

speaker_heading: UNDERWATER POV
dialog: 
text: of Vera. She leans back, her arms bent behind her, her face

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA'S FEET
dialog: 
text: kick back and forth SPLASHING the water. Air bubbles mark

dialog: 
text: Vera breathes in. The sensuous serenity deeply relaxes her.
text: She begins to softly sing a song form her childhood in
dialog: Spanish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER POV
dialog: 
text: Vera's feet are an arms length away, kicking towards the
text: CAMERA LENS. She finishes her song and lays back...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MUSICAL STINGER!
dialog: 
text: The figure jumps out of the water and grabs Vera's leg and
text: pulls her. Vera SCREAMS and lurches forward, almost sliding
text: off the dock. She reaches out and clings to the side.
dialog: 
text: The figure holds her calves and tugs harder. Vera's grasp is
text: slipping. She tries to kick him off.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the figure releases her limbs and submerges
dialog: underwater.
dialog: 
text: Vera pulls herself back up onto the dock.
dialog: 
text: Clad in a black scuba suit and white faceless mask, the
text: rotund figure rises out of the water onto the shore. In one
text: hand he holds a small spear-gun. With the other, he removes
dialog: his mask. It's Shelly!
dialog: 
text: Vera glares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: You've just learned a valuable
dialog: lesson. A beautiful girl like you
dialog: should never go out in the dark
dialog: alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: Damn you, Shelly!
dialog: 
text: Vera stomps off the dock towards him. Shelly retracts.

speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: I have to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: You don't "have to."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: I just want you to like me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I do like you. But not when you
dialog: act like a jerk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: Being a jerk is better than being
dialog: nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: I never said you were "nothing".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: You don't to say it. I can tell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: You're wrong.
dialog: 
text: Shelly hangs his head and says nothing further. He just
text: walks off towards the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (sympathetic)
dialog: Hey... I'll be in, in a little
dialog: while. We can talk some more.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Shelly trudges up the front walk to the porch and plops
text: himself down on the porch swing, still clutching the mask and
text: spear-gun.
dialog: 
text: In a contemplative mood, he slowly swings back and forth.
text: The taut metal chains that support the swing, vibrate and
text: CREAK in a steady rhythm.
dialog: 
text: Shelly looks down at the lake.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SHELLY'S SWINGING POV
dialog: 
text: Vera sits back down on the dock, facing away from the house.
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: 
text: is alerted to what sounds like the cry of a wounded animal
text: emanating from the barn. He looks over and sees a shadow
text: cross in front of one of the windows. The cry continues.
dialog: 
text: Shelly jumps off the swing and heads for the barn with his
text: mask and spear-gun at his side.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Shelly comes up to the window and looks in. It's too dark to
dialog: see anything.

speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: (rapping on the
dialog: window)
dialog: Chuck? Chili? What're you guys
dialog: doing in there?
dialog: 
text: He hears RUMBLING inside, but no response. He moves to the
text: front doors and pries them open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BARN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Shelly comes in and fumbles for the light switch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHELLY
dialog: You guys doin' somethin' I
dialog: shouldn't see?
dialog: 
text: He finds the switch and FLICKS on the light. The very moment
text: the light goes on, an OWL swoops down and aims straight for
text: his head (and CAMERA). Shelly drops the spear-gun and the
text: mask to thwart off the bird with his hands. The owl flies
text: out of the partially open barn doors. Shelly quickly closes
dialog: them.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: VERA'S POV
dialog: 
text: Floating by is a woman's bra (probably, Debbie's).
dialog: 
text: Vera smirks as she lies prone on the boards and reaches with
text: her hand, grabbing the undergarment and rescuing it from the
dialog: lake.
text: She leans back into a kneeling position and rings out the
text: soggy bra. Her heels dig into the rear pocket of her jeans,
text: pushing a wallet out of the pocket onto the dock. Vera
text: reaches behind her and picks it up. It's Shelly's wallet --
text: the one he gave her at the liquor store.
dialog: 
text: Leafing through the contents, Vera finds his driver's license
text: and a photograph of Shelly and his mother.
dialog: 
text: She looks around. Shelly is nowhere in sight. Assuming he
text: has returned to the house, she gets up to look for him -- as
text: she rises, her hand knocks against the dock. The wallet
text: slips out her her grasp and bounces into the lake.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (watching the wallet
dialog: sink)
dialog: That's just great!
dialog: 
text: After a moment of deliberation, she takes off her shoe and
text: plunges into the water, diving after the billfold.
dialog: 
text: She swims around underneath the surface, searching with her
text: hands. She rises for air periodically.
dialog: 
text: She submerges deeper than the previous attempts. Air bubbles
text: rising to the surface, establish her whereabouts -- a good
text: distance from the shore.
dialog: 
text: She comes up for air once more, empty-handed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA'S POV
dialog: 
text: the dock. A dark figure, wearing Shelly's white mask and
text: holding the spear-gun, kneels at the edge of the pier.

text: From the water, at this distance, Vera easily mistakes the
dialog: figure (Jason) for Shelly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA
dialog: (waving to the
dialog: figure, shouting)
dialog: Hey... I dropped your wallet! I'm
dialog: sorry!
dialog:

dialog: 
text: OMINOUS MUSIC throbs on the SOUNDTRACK...
dialog: 
text: Jason raises the spear-gun to eye level.
dialog: 
text: Vera swims unknowingly toward her demise. A few yards from
text: the dock, she glides right into Shelly's floating wallet.
text: Jason aims the spear-gun.
dialog: 
text: Vera, grabbing the wallet, she treads water and raises it
text: triumphantly over her head for "Shelly" to see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VERA

dialog: What're you doing? Who are you?!

scene_heading: MUSICAL STINGER!

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I'm seasick. Get in or get out of

dialog: 
text: Distorted through the plastic curtain, the door opens.

text: hears a BANGING NOISE. Her eyes are closed due to the soap
dialog: and shower spray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEBBIE
dialog: Andy?
dialog: 
text: No response. Concerned, Debbie turns off the water and wipes
text: the soap from her eyes.
dialog: 
text: Looking up, she sees a shadowy figure poised in front of the
text: curtain. Quickly, she reaches out and rips the curtain
dialog: aside...
dialog: 
text: Staring her in the face is a pair of men's feet and jean-

dialog: 
scene_heading: MUSICAL STINGER!

dialog: Andy! Answer me! I hate when you

dialog: 
text: She SLAMS the door shut! Peeved at Andy, she picks up a book
text: (Stephen King's newest novel) from a table and rolls into the
text: hammock top of the covers which hang all the way to the floor.
dialog: 
text: She settles in. The hammock sways slightly. She finds her

text: her to the pillow.

dialog: 
text: A flashlight beam sprays directly into the CAMERA LENS
text: bleaching out the FRAME.
dialog: 
text: Derek and Chris silently walk along the dirt road leading
text: back to the house. Derek holds the flashlight.
dialog: 
text: Their footsteps add to the cacophony of night sounds. Chris'
text: eyes dart about; she's becoming quite uneasy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Could we move a little faster?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Sure, just watch where you're
dialog: going.
dialog: 
text: They start to job. The beam from their flashlight bounces
text: all over the road as they run.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly and unwittingly, Derek strides into a pothole, twist
text: his ankle and falls forward. The flashlight falls from his
text: hand. Derek lands in the arms of a dark figure standing on
text: the side of the road. Derek gasps as the man clutches him.
dialog: 
text: Chris grabs the flashlight from the ground and shines the
text: light into the man's face...
dialog: 
text: It's Abel, the aged hitchhiker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What're you doing out here?
dialog: 
text: Derek gets back on his feet. The ankle is tender.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sort of.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: I'm one of the Flock as are you my

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: (looking askance)
dialog: Yeah... sure...
dialog: (to Chris)
dialog: I think we should be going.
dialog: 
text: They start to leave, but Abel blocks their path.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: I can't let you go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Look old man, we don't want any
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABEL
text: Then turn around and walk away
dialog: from trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEREK
dialog: Come on, Chris...
dialog: 
text: Derek hobbles past Abel. Chris follows a moment later. Abel
text: looks after them as they go then up at the sky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ABEL
dialog: I have done by best. I can do no

dialog: 
text: Chuck stands at the stove, shaking a pot of popcorn over a

text: lifts the cover off the pot, revealing the white fluffy

text: to catch them with his mouth. He captures a few though more

dialog: 
text: Chili comes in from outside with a flashlight in hand.
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: I can't find the bong anywhere.
dialog: Can't you remember where you
dialog: dropped it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I can't even remember what day it
dialog: is, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
text: It's Friday the 13th.
dialog: 
text: All the lights go out -- complete darkness except for the

dialog: the popping corn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: What's the matter?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: Nothin'. I was just foolin'
dialog: around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Don't do that to me!
dialog: 
text: Chili flicks on the flashlight and hands it to Chuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: Here. Go down the cellar and
dialog: check the fusebox.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Will you come with me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: Be a man, man.
dialog: 
text: Chili takes a kerosene lamp down from the window sill as
text: Chuck reluctantly opens the cellar door and starts down the
dialog: stairs.
dialog: 
text: Chili ignites the lamp's wick, illuminating the kitchen with

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. CELLAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Barefoot, Chuck tiptoes down into the dark, musty basement.
text: The flashlight beam preceeds his every step as he slowly
dialog: advances.
dialog: 
text: To calm his anxieties, he talks to himself, outloud.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
text: (his eyes roving all
dialog: around)
dialog: There's nothin' to be scared of,
dialog: man. Just go over to the fusebox
dialog: and check it out. You can do
dialog: that. Yeah, sure.
dialog: 
text: His bare feet SLOSH in the line of the water puddles on the
text: cellar floor as he nears the fusebox. He raises the
text: flashlight at the open box -- the fuses and electrical wiring
text: exposed. The main switch is in the "OFF" position.
dialog: 
text: Chuck lifts the switch into the "ON" position. The naked
text: basement bulb glimmers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (turning to go)
dialog: Whew... that's better.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MUSICAL STINGER!
dialog: 
text: Backlit and silhouetted by the bulb is Jason -- a threatening
dialog: sight.
dialog: 
text: Chuck is startled and scared. Before he can speak, Jason
text: grabs his face with both hands, lifts him off the ground and
text: throws him into the open fusebox.
dialog: 
text: Chuck's feet land in a pool of water as his hands make
text: contact with the exposed electrical wires. Electricity zaps
text: through his entire body, electrocuting him. The lights blink
text: on and off.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Chili is standing at the stove shaking a second pot of
text: popcorn kernels. The blinking lights are an annoyance,
text: causing her to squint. Then, the blinking stops and the
text: lights go completely dead. The lantern remains the only
dialog: light source.
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: What's goin' on, Chuck?!
dialog: 
text: There's no answer. Then abruptly, something heavy bashes
text: against the kitchen door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's goin' on around here?
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
text: She picks up the lantern and goes to the door. She hesitates
text: then pulls it open.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MUSICAL STINGER!
dialog: 
text: Shelly's corpse -- his skull split open, his face and chest
text: bloodied -- falls into the kitchen at Chili's feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: Get up, Shelly. Stop foolin'
dialog: around.
dialog: 
text: She believes this to be another of Shelly's ruses. Stepping
text: over his body, she goes to the basement stairs and calls down
dialog: to Chuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What're you doin' down there, man?

scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT
dialog: 
text: Holding the kerosene lamp in front of her, Chili starts down
text: the stairs. FOREBODING MUSIC drones on the SOUNDTRACK,
text: accompanying her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: Chuck?
dialog: 
text: No answer. She stops at the bottom of the stairs and pans
text: the lamp from side to side.
dialog: 
scene_heading: MUSICAL STINGER!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, as though suspended from the ceiling, Chuck's head
text: and shoulders flop down in front of her, his arms outstretched
text: and his face stark white.
speaker_heading: CHILI
dialog: (trembling)
dialog: Oh, my God...
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Help!!!
dialog: 
text: She turns and runs up the stairs, the kerosene lamp shaking
text: wildly in her hand.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: She bolts out of the basement and stumbles over Shelly's
text: body, falling to the floor. She looks back at Shelly and
text: realizes that this is not a joke and that he is, indeed, dead.
dialog: 
text: She gags and, SCREAMING, grabs the still lit kerosene lamp
text: and scrambles to her feet. She runs into the living room.

dialog: Andy! Debbie! Somebody help me!
dialog: 
dialog: Of course, no answer.

speaker_heading: FIREPLACE
dialog: 
text: Unseen by Chili, Jason's hand reaches for a sizzling poker
text: left in the fire and pulls out the red-hot iron.
dialog: 
text: Chili swings open the front door. The CAMERA MOVES in on her
text: from behind. Crying, she SCREAMS out into the darkness.
