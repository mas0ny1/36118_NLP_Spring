speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Right. Thanks. Do you want to

speaker_heading: NOEL
dialog: David, you’re supposed to water

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: KATE (ON PHONE)

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: KATE (ON PHONE)

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: This is the second time he’s tried

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Ed Pegram still has mine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That’s because he’s a thief.
speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who's Ed Pegram?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Guy I knew back in Hawthorne.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: When did he borrow it?
speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: KATE

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: WOODY
text: Talk to Ma and Ross. They seem to

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I‘1l get her runnin’.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: He still thinks he’s going to
dialog: Lincoln to get his money.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Gotta get there by the 5th.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Hey Dad, how come you didn’t think
dialog: of fixing the truck first or take a
dialog: bus? Why’d you just start walking?
text: Woody looks up a moment, thinks about that, then gets back to
text: work. David leads his brother out of the garage.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don’t pull his chain like that.
dialog: The poor guy doesn’t know what’s
text: going on half the time.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I cut the solenoid wire and stuck
text: it back in. That’1l slow him down.
dialog: And Mom’s right -- it’s time to
dialog: think about a home. She can’t
dialog: handle him anymore. It’s not fair
dialog: to her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He doesn’t need a nursing home. He
dialog: just...the guy just needs something
dialog: to live for. That’s all this is
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Yeah, and it’s pathetic. Seems
dialog: like drinking always gave him more
dialog: than enough to live for until now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Go easy on the man, okay? He'll
dialog: probably forget all about this ina
dialog: day or two.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: And then it’1l be some other
dialog: demented crap, like the infomercial
dialog: stuff last year. Mom and I are
dialog: looking at reality, and you'd
dialog: better start too.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: ROSS (CONT'D)
dialog: A home would be in his best
dialog: interest -- which, let’s face it --
dialog: is more than he ever thought about
dialog: with us. He never gave a shit
dialog: about you or me.
text: They peek inside the garage. Woody remains focused.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I saw you anchoring the other

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: First time in the chair, right?
speaker_heading: ROSS

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tom Brokaw. The new Tom Brokaw of

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: I don’t know about Tom Brokaw

speaker_heading: BERNIE BOWEN

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dad, here’s the bus.
speaker_heading: BERNIE BOWEN
dialog: Okay, well, good seein’ you there,

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You both look like hell.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Like hell you are. You look like

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I haven't been drinking.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That’s what you said on our first
dialog: date.
dialog: (to David)
dialog: And you, have you gone bananas?
dialog: Almost getting your father killed
text: over some cockamamie pot of gold.
text: As the bus departs, David takes his mother’s elbow and leads
text: her a few steps away from Woody.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Listen, go easy, okay? You and I
dialog: both know it’s not about the money.
dialog: It’s about...you know, how much
dialog: longer is he going to be around --
dialog: at least semi-coherently? What’s
dialog: the harm in letting him have his
dialog: little fantasy for a couple more
dialog: days?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You and Ross always fretting over
dialog: your father. What about me? How
dialog: about taking me out to see my

dialog: (turning)
dialog: Do you, Woody?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Do I what?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Know what’s going on around you.
text: Woody’s unsure how to answer -- he looks at her, looks around

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to David)
dialog: You watch it, or that’s what you’re
dialog: going to turn into. Now take me to

scene_heading: 47 EXT. HAWTHORNE CEMETERY - DAY 47
text: Flowers in hand, Kate offers a running commentary as she
text: leads Woody and David slowly past the headstones.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That’s Woody’s mother Sara. She
dialog: hated me because she wanted him to
dialog: marry someone who’d milk the cows,
dialog: but I said I ain’t fiddlin’ with no
dialog: cow titties. I’m a city girl.
dialog: The good lord did not do Sara any
text: favors in the looks department.
text: More a man’s face than a woman's,
dialog: really. I was pretty, so she
dialog: resented me. You knew your mother
dialog: was ugly, right, Woody?
text: Woody looks at Kate, then stares at his mother’s grave.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How did she die?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Saw herself in the mirror one day!
dialog: No, cancer.
dialog: (moving on)
dialog: And there’s the old Swede Tolf. A
dialog: good man, your grandpa. Never said
dialog: much. That farm just ruined him.
dialog: (to Woody)
dialog: You're lucky I took you away from
dialog: there.
text: Woody nods slightly as he looks at his father’s leaf-covered
dialog: grave.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s Woody’s brother David. You
dialog: were named after him. He died of
dialog: scarlet fever when he was only two.
text: Woody slept in the same bed with
dialog: him but never got it.
text: David contemplates the sight of his own name on a headstone.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mom, come on.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m just telling the truth. She
dialog: was screwing guys in back of the

dialog: ...fifteen.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where’s your family?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: They’re over at the Catholic

dialog: Catholics wouldn’t be caught dead

text: Now there’s Delmer, Woody’s cousin.
dialog: He was a drunk. One time we were
dialog: wrastlin’ and he felt me up.
text: Grabbed a handful of boob, and
dialog: Woody was right there and didn’t
dialog: have a clue, did you, Woody?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus, Mom.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: My goodness, I didn’t know Keith
dialog: White was here. When did he die?
dialog: Keith White. He wanted in my pants
dialog: too, but oh, he was so boring.
text: Hearing enough, Woody and David head toward the car. Kate

speaker_heading: BART
dialog: What’s the engine?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It’s, uh, a four-cylinder.
speaker_heading: BART

speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m David Grant, Woody’s son.
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Well, I’m very pleased to meet you.
dialog: Your father is certainly quite the
dialog: celebrity around here. Did Parker
dialog: show up to take his picture?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That’s what I came to tell you
dialog: about. Dad didn’t win any lottery
dialog: or sweepstakes or anything. He’s a
dialog: little confused about something he
dialog: got in the mail, and it’s gotten
text: way out of hand.
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: So he didn’t win a million dollars?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, ma’am.
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Just goes to show you some things
dialog: never change. He was always a
text: little confused.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know my dad?
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: It’s all ancient history, of
dialog: course, and I don’t want to speak
dialog: out of turn, but Woody and I used
dialog: to go together.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You were his girlfriend?
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Your mother is what happened. How
dialog: is Kate?
dialog: 46.
dialog: Blue (10-12-2012) 46a.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fine. She’s here too.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: You tell her Peg Bender says hello.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She won't slap me, will she?
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Why would she? She won.
text: David looks at her. She smiles wistfully.
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY (CONT'D)
dialog: Water under the bridge. Don’t get
dialog: me wrong, I married a wonderful man
dialog: -- we ran this paper together until
dialog: he died -- had three children,
dialog: eight grandchildren. I’ve got no
dialog: complaints.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Was he drinking back then?
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Of course he was. It happens early
dialog: around here. There isn’t much else
dialog: to do. Nowadays, of course, it’s
dialog: not just booze but all that other
dialog: stuff. For Woody it got bad after
dialog: Korea. He had a hard time over
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I thought he was just a mechanic.
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Oh, he was, for the army planes.
dialog: But he was shot down while being

speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: Your dad was never much of a
dialog: talker, and when he came back he
dialog: hardly said a word. But always
dialog: very kind. People took advantage
dialog: of him. He couldn’t turn down a
dialog: favor.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, now that everyone thinks he’s
dialog: a millionaire, he’s a big hero
dialog: around here.
speaker_heading: PEG NAGY
dialog: I’m sorry I can’t print that he is,
dialog: but I won’t print that he isn’t

speaker_heading: DAVID

text: They look over and see Ed. He’s not great, but not bad.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Maybe we should go ask for the
dialog: compressor.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He’1ll give it back.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He always had a nice voice. It was

speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: He’s all right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: All right? Did you know he was

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: Oh, you were always such a

dialog: beautiful boy. Why, when you were
dialog: a baby, people used to stop me on
dialog: the street and tell me how
dialog: beautiful you were. A lot of them
dialog: thought you were a girl. Isn’t

speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM
dialog: Hey, everybody, we've got a

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Dad, stand up. It’s for you.

speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM
dialog: I want you to know I think the
dialog: world of Woody. Always a good man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM
dialog: Heart of gold. No secret, though,
dialog: Woody drank quite a bit when we had
dialog: the garage. Messed up a lot of
dialog: jobs and let a lot of money walk.
dialog: He was older than me, kind of like
dialog: a big brother, Korea vet, the whole
dialog: nine yards. I wanted to show him
dialog: some respect, and I loaned him a
dialog: ton of dough I never saw again. So
dialog: seeing as how he’s come into some
dialog: cash lately, some no-foolin’-around
dialog: cash he didn’t even have to work
dialog: for, seems to me it'd only be fair
dialog: to settle up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You want your $800 back?
speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM

dialog: 56
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: You can understand that.
speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM
dialog: Right, so you’re all headed to
dialog: Lincoln to visit the roller-skating

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Lawyer? What’s the statute of

text: Ed lays an arm on David's shoulder.
speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM
dialog: I’m a man with a real strong sense

dialog: make it right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you threatening my family?
text: Ed withdraws his arm and grins.
speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM
dialog: Threatening? No, that would be
dialog: wrong. Hey, I’m the victim here.

speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: You think he still has it?
speaker_heading: AUNT MARTHA

speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Thanks, Aunt Betty. Great to see
dialog: you too.
speaker_heading: AUNT BETTY
dialog: You know, there’s something that’s
dialog: hard to bring up, but we think it
dialog: deserves mentioning.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What’s that?
text: Aunt Betty seems uncomfortable, so Randy takes the lead.
speaker_heading: COUSIN RANDY
dialog: You may not know it, but Uncle
dialog: Woody used to have a lot of money
dialog: problems, and family members would
dialog: help him out from time to time. So
dialog: in light of his good fortune, well,
dialog: we thought your family might want
dialog: to make things right.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (glancing at Ross)
dialog: I’ve been hearing that a lot
dialog: lately.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You know, Cole’s and my folks
dialog: wouldn’t never say nothin’ if it
dialog: was just for them. But they’re
dialog: gonna need in on this deal too.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Are you saying you want money from
dialog: us?
speaker_heading: COUSIN RANDY
dialog: We just figured that seein’ how the
dialog: family helped Woody out and all,
dialog: kind of kept him on his feet...
dialog: Blue (10-12-2012) 64.
speaker_heading: AUNT BETTY
dialog: Verne and I loaned Woody quite a
dialog: bit, and it wasn’t like we was
dialog: rich. But he was my brother-in-
dialog: law, and we couldn’t bear to see
dialog: your family suffer.
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: Aunt Betty, guys, look. Honestly,
dialog: for real. Woody didn’t win
dialog: anything. It’s a total sham.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: You’re a damn liar!
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Don’t feed us any of your bullshit,

speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: You wanna go?
speaker_heading: COLE

dialog: TV.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (rushing over)

dialog: lost your minds?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Aunt Betty and her henchmen here

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: ROSS
dialog: They’re after Dad’s “winnings.”
dialog: They say he owes them money.
speaker_heading: BART
dialog: See? There is money.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Owes them money? What on Earth are
dialog: you talking about, Betty?
speaker_heading: AUNT BETTY
dialog: Now, Kate, you know we used to help
dialog: you and Woody out when he was
dialog: drinking up everything he earned.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You know as well as I do it was the
dialog: other way around. You were always
dialog: having him work on your cars for
dialog: free, getting free gas --
speaker_heading: COUSIN RANDY
dialog: Aunt Kate, we’re not asking for
dialog: much. Just a token.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I kept records. The money you gave
dialog: him didn’t come close to what you
dialog: owed. He couldn’t say no to
dialog: anybody, and it ruined him.
speaker_heading: AUNT BETTY
dialog: I think you’re having a senior
dialog: moment here, Kate. Where do you
dialog: think all that money come from when
dialog: you got a bee in your bonnet to
dialog: move to Billings and open a salon?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: From my folks when they croaked,
dialog: that’s where! I can’t believe the
dialog: nerve of you people. Usually a

speaker_heading: COUSIN RANDY
dialog: Calm down, Aunt Katie. We didn’t

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How could he get away with that?
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: Oh, they was all cheap, lyin’
dialog: bastards. So when we started back,

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: When was this?
speaker_heading: ED PEGRAM

speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why do you need a truck so bad?
speaker_heading: WOODY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What about the rest of the money?
dialog: You don’t need a million dollars

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I wouldn’t lie to you.
speaker_heading: WOODY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The only reason I agreed to take
