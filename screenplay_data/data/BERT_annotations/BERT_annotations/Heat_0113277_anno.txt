scene_heading: EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY
text: A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
text: Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
text: a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
text: Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
text: At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
dialog: years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
dialog: hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
text: spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
dialog: is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
text: good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
dialog: line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
dialog: to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
dialog: fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
dialog: too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
dialog: problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
text: no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
dialog: it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
dialog: flat.
speaker_heading: ANGLE
text: Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white

scene_heading: EXT. R &amp; C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY
text: CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
text: with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat
text: over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
text: sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
text: Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction
text: worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.
dialog: He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline
dialog: pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
text: Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley
dialog: were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to
dialog: 1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and
dialog: spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and

scene_heading: INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY
text: MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.
text: He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian
dialog: from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and
dialog: Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his
dialog: natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
dialog: and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else
dialog: for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest
dialog: guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his
dialog: way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked
dialog: him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
dialog: were talking about.
