dialog: So you be careful out there tonight
dialog: - cause when the sun goes down...
dialog: It’s the Season of the Witch.
text: A plucky GUITAR RIFF begins. It’s coupled with a BLUESY BASS

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What the hell are you doing?

text: pops open another beer and stares at a TV that isn’t on.
text: Stella mournfully glances from the threshold of the bathroom,
text: fresh out of the shower and wrapped in a towel. She shuts the
text: door. Her father pays no attention.
text: IN MICHAELS BATHROOM
text: A drawer is opened. Stella’s hand digs through the clutter to
text: expose -- a STRAIGHT RAZOR gleans under a mishmash of MAKEUP.
text: Stella stares into the mirror. Her body is gaunt, almost
text: skeletal. A sadness in her eyes.
speaker_heading: DONOVAN
dialog: “That it's strange... So strange.”
text: She lifts her chin, then -- slits her throat, WITH A LINE OF
text: BLACK FACE PAINT. The beginnings of a Halloween costume.

scene_heading: IN MORALES LIVING ROOM

speaker_heading: CHUCK (0.C.)
dialog: I said Spiderman. Not a spider man.

scene_heading: MRS. STEINBERG
dialog: Spiders have eight legs-
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: He doesn’t- I gave you the comic

text: Chuck spots a clown tapping outside the kitchen window.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Aren't you too ugly to be going on

dialog: “You've got to pick up every

text: Stella puts the finishing touches on her face paint and steps
dialog: back to inspect her work --
speaker_heading: DONOVAN (CONT'D)
dialog: “Must be the Season of the Witch.”
text: Stella is unrecognizable. A near photo-realistic skull covers
text: her face. Her exquisite paint job is a labor of love.
text: Confident -- she puts on her glasses and turns off the light.
scene_heading: SCARY STORIES
text: TO TELL IN THE DARK
text: As “Season of the Witch” fades out... darkness persists... An

dialog: spider man should have eight arms,

dialog: Dell’arte, idiot stick.
text: Stella sees porch lights beginning to turn off.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: He’s not gonna show.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: He'll show. Dick Breath does it
dialog: every year and this time it’1ll be
dialog: his last.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Well if he doesn’t, maybe next year
dialog: you can carry the bag of shit.
text: Chuck empties the last of his Good N’ Plentys into his mouth.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Do you even know what’s in those?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What are you now, The Man?
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: The same toxic chemicals that’s
dialog: giving our troops Hodgkin's
text: lymphoma and curdling the breast
dialog: milk of the South Vietnamese.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You’re crazy.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Not crazy. Conscious.
dialog: (passes joint to Stella)
dialog: You sure you don’t want any? Cause
dialog: you're creeping us out with this
dialog: whole skeleton thing.
text: She waves it off.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Yeah, pretty tragic considering
dialog: it’s the anniversary your mom's
dialog: death.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: (annoyed at Chuck)
dialog: Dude.
text: Chuck realizes his poor choice of words and backpedals --
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I’m... sorry. I didn’t --
text: Stella goes solemn, but shirks it off.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: It’s fine. Gimme that --
text: Stella grabs the joint. Before she takes a drag -- OS engine
dialog: of a ‘68 Bonneville.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Shit! It’s Kurt --
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: (lowers clown mask)
dialog: Cover your face, stupid. And hold
text: out the bait.
text: Chuck dons his disguise, acting as if this were some kind of
dialog: heist.
scene_heading: INSIDE ‘68 BONNEVILLE
text: Kurt laughs with his kind, throwing beer cans out the window.
text: IN THE BACKSEAT -- Alice is all done up for her date, wedged
text: between two Lettermans. She swats their unwanted advances.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: (to Kurt, annoyed)
dialog: You said we would have dinner.
text: Kurt’s eyes narrow as he spots the backs of some trick-or-
dialog: treaters all alone.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: How ‘bout dessert?
text: He hits the gas. His FLATTOP buddy cackles and leans out the
text: passenger window, prepping to snare the candy bag --
text: As they blow past, he RIPS the bag from Chuck’s hand. They
text: all laugh. Flattop opens the pillowcase only to find --
speaker_heading: FLATTOP
dialog: It’s full of old man undies!
text: Enraged, Kurt slams on the brakes.
scene_heading: ON STELLA AND FRIENDS
text: They unload a SLEW OF EGGS and TOILET PAPER, pelting the car.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Trick or treat, mother fuckers!
scene_heading: ON ‘68 BONNEVILLE
text: As the Bonneville takes on a barrage of egg yolk and teepee,
text: Kurt angrily shifts the car into reverse, full speed.
scene_heading: ON STELLA AND FRIENDS
text: They hold their ground, not afraid to exhaust every bit of
text: their stash. Payback for years of being picked on.
text: Chuck proudly lights his BROWN PAPER BAG OF SHIT on fire.
speaker_heading: CHUCK (CONT'D)
dialog: And now for the Poup D’etat...
text: As the Bonneville returns for a second pass, Chuck TOSSES it -
text: - throwing it right into their window.
scene_heading: INSIDE ‘68 BONNEVILLE
text: The bag EXPLODES on Kurt’s lap. Alice SHRIEKS. He frantically
text: swats the flames and manure, forgetting to hit the brakes.
text: The Bonneville surges backward, out of control --
speaker_heading: FLATTOP
dialog: The brakes! The brakes!
scene_heading: ON STELLA AND FRIENDS
text: They beam in victory --
text: -- Only to see the Bonneville CRASH into a tree. Their smiles
text: drop, suddenly concerned by the inevitable fallout.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Ah shit!
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Let’s cheese it!
text: As they are running away --
scene_heading: ON CRASHED ‘68 BONNEVILLE

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Chucky? Is that you?!
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: That’s your brother?! I’m gonna
dialog: murder them!!
dialog: 10.

scene_heading: ON STELLA AND HER FRIENDS, RUNNING
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Your sister went out with that
dialog: dickhead?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: So much for our cover. Let’s split
dialog: up. Better odds only one of us
dialog: dying.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Meet up at The Gorge.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Catch ‘ya later.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Not if you catch a disease first.
text: They splinter off, cutting through backyards.
text: Kurt and the Lettermans stay as a pack, targeting Chuck.
speaker_heading: ON CHUCK
text: Chuck sees the heat is on him and silently curses, all four
text: arms pumping in stride. He heads for the woods.
scene_heading: ON KURT AND LETTERMANS
text: Run into the woods, searching in all directions.
text: Flattop finds -- The SPIDER MAN COSTUME. They fan out.
scene_heading: OUTSKIRTS OF SUBURBS
text: Shivering, Chuck exits the woods in his tightey-whiteys. He
text: catches his breath, then spots off in the distance --
speaker_heading: THE GORGE CINEMA
text: A DRIVE-IN nestled in a natural basin on the waterfront. A
text: line of 60-era cars waiting to get inside.
speaker_heading: AT LINE OF CARS
text: Chuck meets Stella and Auggie, ducking behind cars, trying to
text: stay undetected by the Lettermans scanning the area.
dialog: 11.
text: They hide behind a CORVAIR MONZA, blaring “Little Green
dialog: Apples”
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: You're in your underwear.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: I’m still not a clown.
text: Stella shushes them. Then is surprised to see the trunk of
text: the CORVAIR pop open. A voice from the driver --
speaker_heading: RAMON (0.C.)
dialog: You're acting like it’s your first
dialog: time.
text: She spots Ramon, vaguely recognizing him. Chuck and Auggie
text: act first, hopping inside. Stella follows in after.
text: Ramén pulls into the Drive-In, past a marquee that reads:
text: “BORIS KARLOFF’S BLACK SABBATH”. Pays his ticket for one.
text: Kurt and the Lettermans lose the scent and move on.
scene_heading: INT. THE GORGE DRIVE-IN -- LATER
text: THE STARING, GRINNING FACE of a dead woman!! In gory
dialog: technicolor.
text: A smattering of cars idly face a towering outdoor screen
text: showing the horror flick. Pipe organ swells through every
text: hanging CAR WINDOW SPEAKER, as the small audience scarf
text: popcorn or take part in the usual immoral behavior.
scene_heading: IN THE CORVAIR MONZA
text: As Ramén watches the movie -- Chuck climbs out of the
text: retractable back seat, putting on an oversized military tee.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Mind if I borrow these fatigues I
dialog: found in your trunk? I saw they
text: were in a box marked for Goodwill.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Have at it.
text: Stella and Auggie pull themselves out, adrenaline still
text: pumping through their veins.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: That was amazing.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Did’ju see the look on their faces?
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: All I saw were your sister’s tits.
text: Ramén looks at Auggie in his rear-view mirror, unsure of what
text: exactly he is looking at.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: «.. I’m a Pierrot.
text: Stella pulls herself into the passenger seat. Wiping her face
dialog: paint off.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Thanks. We owe you.
dialog: (re: movie)
dialog: Black Sabbath... a good one. Mario
dialog: Bava- he’s real good-
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Mario, what?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Bava. Italian. He’s done great
dialog: movies- Black Sunday-
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Should've been here last week when
dialog: they played The Conqueror Worm.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (Vincent Price impression)
dialog: “Men sometimes have strange motives
dialog: for the things they do.”
text: Ram6én smiles upon meeting a kindred spirit.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Ramén.
text: Stella blushes, then turns her attention to the movie,
text: pushing up her glasses to see better. Ramén feels dissed.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Her name is Stella. I’m Chuck, and
dialog: this is Auggie.
text: Stella sees the name ‘Morales’ on Chuck’s military attire.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Hey, isn’t your dad that war hero
dialog: who just moved in?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: People say he jumped on a grenade
dialog: and lived.
dialog: (morbidly fascinated)
dialog: Does he like, still have his
dialog: fingers and toes and stuff?
text: Ramén is taken aback by her bluntness.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Not all of them...
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Forgive her. She’s strange.
text: Chuck sees something out the window and ducks -
speaker_heading: CHUCK
text: Dick Breath alert. He’s coming in.
scene_heading: AT CONCESSION STAND
text: The banged-up Bonneville pulls into the drive-in. Kurt gets
text: out and talks to a few Lettermans, motioning to the vicinity.
text: Alice is offered a bucket of popcorn, but from her crossed
text: arms, she clearly doesn’t want anything to do with this.
text: They spread out to widen the search, peeking into cars.
scene_heading: IN CORVAIR MONZA
text: As Kurt and the Lettermans get closer --
speaker_heading: RAMON
text: Back in the trunk.
text: Stella and Chuck are quick to take refuge but Auggie revolts.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: No way that’s a trunk, at best it’s
text: a large glove box.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (handing over blanket)
dialog: It’s your hide.
text: Auggie hides under a blanket as the others go into the trunk.
speaker_heading: STELLA (0.S.) CHUCK (0.S.)
dialog: Get your hand off my butt. I can’t control them.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Ssh.
dialog: 14.
text: They quiet down and Ramén plays it cool. As they wait for
dialog: Kurt to search the neighboring cars --
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: (discrete to Auggie)
dialog: What’s up with weirdo bird?
text: Auggie peeks out from under the blanket, keeping his voice
text: low and his sentences short.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Who, Stella?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Her family moved here about ten
dialog: years ago. Not long after, her mom
dialog: was killed. She doesn’t like to
dialog: talk about it, but everyone pretty
dialog: much knows it was her dad that did
dialog: it-
text: Ramén looks shocked. Auggie back peddles --
speaker_heading: AUGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: He didn’t kill her- Not on like
text: purpose. He was drunk. And driving.
text: He swears it was someone else but
dialog: no one really buys it. Not even
dialog: Stell.
text: This sits with Ramén. He looks at the trunk through the rear-
text: view mirror, suddenly empathetic.
text: -- A RAP on the window startles them. Auggie hides.
text: Ramén cranks down his window to see Kurt leering in.
speaker_heading: RAMON
text: Soda and popcorn. Extra butter.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: (sneers, then)
dialog: You wouldn’t happen to have seen a
dialog: spider, a clown, or a skinny bitch?
text: Auggie sees his clown shoes are peeking out. He tries to
text: cover them but the blanket is too short.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Now that you mention it... no. But
dialog: you'll be the first to know.
text: Kurt checks out Ramén’s car and laughs, knowing full well
text: he’s being played. Behind him --
dialog: 15.
text: Lettermans gather, ready at his beckon call. Kurt motions for
dialog: them to hold off - he can handle it.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You got a smart mouth, Amigo. I’1l
dialog: let that slide. Besides --
dialog: (cutting to the bone)
dialog: I feel bad for any war hero who has
text: a hood for a son.
text: Ramén grips the wheel, restraining his better instinct.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT’D)
dialog: (spots clown shoes)
dialog: I see you, shit stain! Get outta
dialog: the car! I bet that drunk’s girl is
dialog: in there too!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Mind keeping it down? Everyone's
text: trying to watch a movie.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: So you won’t get outta the car. See
dialog: that, fellas? Mexicans aren't
dialog: brown, they're yellow.
text: Ram6én glances to see what he’s up against. It must be 5 to l.
text: He stays seated, knowing the smart play.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: I said - get out of the car. Spic.
text: Ramén bolts out of the car, angrily pressing his forehead
text: against Kurt’s, daring him to throw the first punch.
text: Just as the Lettermans are about to pounce --
text: The flashing lights from a SHERIFF’S CRUISER.
text: SHERIFF MILNER (50s), a once-strong lawman who’s grown weary
text: from the trade, steps out. He doesn’t suffer fools gladly.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: Leave it alone, Kurt.
text: Kurt backs away with his hands up, staring daggers at Ramdén.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Sorry dad, we were just leaving.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (returning to car)
dialog: We are too, Sheriff.
dialog: 16.
text: The slight admission doesn’t go unnoticed by Kurt.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: You're all dead.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: Enough.
text: Ram6én drives off. Chuck pops up in the rear windshield,
text: flicking them off.
text: Kurt looks to his father, like a sniveling tattle-tale. His
text: father only returns a look of disappointment.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER (CONT’D)
dialog: Go home. You smell like shit.
dialog: Off Kurt’s disdain --
scene_heading: INT. CORVAIR MONZA - LATER
text: Ramén pulls out of the Drive-In. Stella and her friends get
text: settled into their seats.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Sorry you had to miss the movie.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: I’m sorry I missed whatever you did
dialog: to piss off that ape.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You may wanna hold off going home.
dialog: I take it he knows where you live?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Maybe we can crash at your place?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: I helped enough.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: We can lay low in the motel just
dialog: outside of town?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: And pay for it with what -- Abba
dialog: Zaba and lollipops?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You know...
dialog: (mischievous)
text: The Bellows House is empty.
dialog: 17.
text: Auggie and Chuck share a cautious look --
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Yeah. They’re tearing it down to
dialog: make way for the freeway later this
dialog: week. No one’1l look for us there.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: No way. We all know what happens to
text: kids who go into the Bellows House.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: What happens to the kids?
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: (giddy )
dialog: He doesn’t know.
text: Ramén looks to Stella, hoping she will clear it up.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Ever wanted to check out a haunted
dialog: house?... Hang a left.
text: Off Ramén’s growing curiosity, he takes the next turn.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLOWS ESTATE - NIGHT - LATER
text: The Corvair Monza parks on a secluded dirt road. The grass
text: has grown long. Years of neglect, or perhaps avoidance.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (gazes out window)
dialog: You really weren’t kidding...
text: They step out of the car to see --
text: An unbuilt portion of a RAISED FREEWAY. A fractured monolith
text: of jagged rebar and cement. The two sides nearly touching.
text: Between the divide, on a hill...
text: An imposing PURITAN MANOR on a sprawling, timeworn estate.
text: Black rotted wood. A pair of prodigious MASONRY CHIMNEYS. The
text: brittle facade is painted with shadows, consumed by rot, and
text: strangled by overgrown foliage.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: What better place to spend a
dialog: Halloween Night. Muhahaha.
text: Chuck cackles as he passes through a wrought-iron gate and
text: crosses a cobblestone bridge over a dry creek bed.
dialog: 18.
text: Stella and Auggie slowly make their way. Ramén lingers.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You coming?
text: Intrigued, Ramén shuts his door and follows their lead.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: So who are the Bellows?
speaker_heading: STELLA

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Lemme guess - something horrible

text: with the moonlight. They take in the surroundings with
dialog: reserved wonderment and caution --
dialog: What once was a luxurious mansion has now been picked clean
text: of any valuables and defaced over time: Torn, water-stained
text: wallpaper. Missing floorboards. Broken and strewn articles
text: litter a floor already covered in layers of dust.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: So what happened to the Bellows?
text: Stella runs her fingers down the wallpaper as she passes down
text: the halls, transfixed. Ramén hangs on her every word.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: They had a young daughter they

dialog: As the story goes, they never
dialog: allowed pictures of her either.
text: Ram6én passes a PHOTOGRAPH of the BELLOWS FAMILY still hung on

speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: People say she was... different.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: How so?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Like, she didn’t look right. Had
dialog: scoliosis and gigantism- or
text: something. She was long and tall
dialog: and sort of not right. But she had

speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Chuck?... Chuck?
text: He finds a tear in the wallpaper, then takes pleasure in

text: Disgusted, he delicately tucks the wallpaper back.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know what you’re trying to do,

text: Auggie cautiously moves ahead, swallowing his fear.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - BELLOWS ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stella peruses bare bookshelves. A few moth-eaten tomes, but
text: nothing worth salvaging. As Ramén takes in the dreary room,
dialog: she continues the Bellows story --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: But Sarah was lonely. So she would
dialog: write these scary stories. And kids
dialog: would come from all around just to
dialog: hear her read. To make them extra
dialog: scary, she would write their names

speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: But then the children started to go

dialog: (beat)
dialog: When they couldn’t find them, they

dialog: when the police came to question
dialog: Sarah - she disappeared. Never to

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: What happened to her?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: No one knows. But a year later, in
dialog: 1921, every member of her family
text: died from bizarre and unexplained
dialog: deaths.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Some think it was the ghosts of the

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: What do you think?
text: Stella takes a moment to choose her words carefully...
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I think she just wanted to be like

speaker_heading: AUGGIE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: «+. Chuck?
text: Chuck seals himself into the darkness, trying not to laugh.
text: The sound of Auggie’s footsteps come back.
text: Creak - Chuck cracks open the door again, only to see --
text: The entire bedroom is now vivid in color and texture.
text: Exquisite antiquities adorn the walls and cover the room. As

dialog: 
text: In startled awe, Chuck opens the armoire further to witness --
text: A GAUNT MATRIARCH with a wide GREEN RIBBON around her neck,
text: lies sick in bed, ominously staring back.
text: Chuck GASPS and seals the armoire doors. Unable to catch his
text: breath. Heart pounding. Did he see what he thought he saw? He
dialog: goes to peek again, when--
text: Auggie THROWS open the doors and YELLS! Scaring Chuck white.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I totally got you back!
text: Chuck holds his beating heart, regaining his wits as he sees
text: the master bedroom HAS RETURNED TO ITS DECREPIT STATE.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: The room -- It was new -- And there

speaker_heading: AUGGIE

speaker_heading: RAMON
text: It doesn’t look like it’s ever been
dialog: opened.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Maybe where they buried the bodies.
text: Stella stares at the hatch - only one way to find out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: opens. Moonlight floods in, revealing AN OLD STAIRCASE and
text: the four teens framed within the hatch opening in wonderment.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Ramén is brave enough to lead them down. He finds an OIL
text: LAMP, lights a match to ignite it. A warm glow reveals --
text: A YOUNG GIRL’S BEDROOM kept preserved like a time capsule.
text: Fine, deco furnishings. A vanity sink and mirror. A quilted
text: bed covered in worn dolls and dust.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: It’s Sarah’s bedroom...
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: What kind of family would lock up
dialog: their own daughter?
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: This room's for a little kid. I

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: She was... But her body was the
dialog: size of an adult -- larger even...
text: Auggie picks up an antique EFFANBEE DOLL.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Her mind was simple -- maybe too
dialog: simple.
text: Stella sits behind the vanity, trying to imagine being in her

speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a real person. This isn’t

speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Yeah. Let’s get outta here.

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Someone locked us in!
speaker_heading: CHUCK

speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: I can’t open it!
text: But then - familiar LAUGHTER can be heard, coming from --
speaker_heading: IN THE LIBRARY
text: It's Dick Breath, holding a baseball bat, drunk and savoring.

speaker_heading: ALICE

speaker_heading: CHUCK

speaker_heading: TEENS

speaker_heading: IN THE LIBRARY
text: Alice shivers, not liking this place one bit.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Joke's over. If you don’t open it,
dialog: I’m going to tell your father.
text: Kurt’s sadistic laughter fades.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Now why would you do that?
text: Alice is caught in his uncomfortable gaze.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: It’s my little brother.
text: Kurt takes a pull from a flask.
speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Fine. Go ahead.
text: Seeing he won’t help, Alice heaves open the hatch. But --
text: Kurt KICKS her down onto the others, then LOCKS the hatch.
speaker_heading: KURT (CONT'D)
dialog: If you’re not putting out, you’re

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I worked so hard on this.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: It’s a nice dress. I mean, it still

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You're a Pierrot, right?
dialog: 27.
text: Auggie has a permanent grin. Life won’t get better than this.
text: As the others search for a way out... Stella feels something
text: under the mattress and pulls out --
text: THE BELLOWS BOOK. Considerable and weighty. Her fingers touch
text: warped leather, edges frayed. Smudges of dirt, faded blood.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s that?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I don’t know.
text: She opens the tome, some frail pages stick together. She
text: scans a few hand-written stories, enraptured.
text: The others suspend their efforts to come see, intrigued.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s Sarah's book of scary stories.
dialog: The one she’d read to the kids.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: That’s just town gossip--
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: Or maybe they’re stories about how
dialog: she murdered those kids?
text: Stella flips through the pages, some covered with dark
text: illustrations. She rests on a story called THE GREEN RIBBON.
text: Before she can make sense of it --
text: A FAINT THUMPING is heard. Then an ominous GROANING. Growing
text: LOUDER. Stella closes the book and puts it aside.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Kurt? Is that you?
text: Within the walls, more CREAKING. Everyone eyes the ceiling
text: and walls. Dust wafts. It’s as if the house is possessed.
speaker_heading: CHUCK
dialog: We disturbed the disturbed! Now
dialog: we're gonna die!
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: (not buying it)
dialog: It’s an old house - just built up

speaker_heading: AUGGIE (CONT'D)
text: AAHH! THE CURSE OF SARAH BELLOWS!
text: Auggie freaks out and charges up the stairs at full speed,

speaker_heading: IN THE LIBRARY
text: He EXPLODES out of the hatch! They SCREAM, storming through

text: A PIPE EXPLODES out of the wall - pouring out grey water.
text: They run out SCREAMING!
text: IN THE BASEMENT
text: Stella’s the last one out. Feeling watched, she turns to see -
text: IN THE MIRROR'S REFLECTION -- A pale, gaunt, eerily elongated
text: SARAH BELLOWS (16) sits on the bed wearing a soiled hazel
text: gown. She has spindly limbs, a curved spine, and a simple-
text: sweet smile. Her bony fingers hold up her book.
speaker_heading: SARAH BELLOWS
dialog: Youuu maaay beee theee neeext...
text: Grey water pours out of her mouth.
text: Stella clasps her mouth and turns, stifling a scream -- BUT

speaker_heading: IN LIBRARY
text: Stella surges out from the hatch with her pillowcase in hand.
text: She fumbles to put on her glasses -- staring at the

text: ... She follows her friends out.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLOWS ESTATE —- CONTINUOUS

text: Kurt perks up. Thinking it was nothing, he returns to feeding
dialog: the chickens when he sees --
text: A FIGURE standing between the barn doors. Kurt squints to see

text: Harold REACHES for Kurt, who CRIES OUT while violently

text: He falls as straw grows from every part of him. He reaches

speaker_heading: AUGGIE

speaker_heading: ALICE

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: There was a new story.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: What story?!
text: Auggie isn’t sure if he should show her, but Alice rips it

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I tried to warn him... but every
dialog: thing I said only made it worse.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: The ending never told us what

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I heard her. She knows our names.
speaker_heading: RAMON
text: Four stories left. Four of us.

dialog: Do what?! We’ve already burned it!
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: I don’t know but I sure as hell
dialog: ain’t gonna sit around and wait for

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: She's not a witch. It’s a curse!
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Forgive me! A cursed witch --
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: So what? We wait around to see
dialog: which of our names come next?
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: (mind races)
dialog: What about the titles. To our

speaker_heading: STELLA
text: The next story is ‘The Red Spot’...
dialog: Does that mean anything to anyone?

speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Red Spot? That could be anything.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: What about the rest of them?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: The next ones are “The Dream", “Me

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: .-- And the last chapter, “The

scene_heading: EXT. BELLOWS ESTATE - LATER
text: The Corvair Monza parks in front of the gate leading to the

text: Surprised, they quickly race up the long driveway --
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: No no no no noooo!
scene_heading: EXT. BELLOWS ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stella, Ramén, Auggie and Alice stand before what's left of

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: There goes the answers.
text: Bulldozers plow debris, while a FOREMAN wears a hard hat,
text: directing a digger and crane raising a dug up COFFIN.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: Careful... careful...
text: He unshackles it. Then gives the hand signal for the crane

speaker_heading: FOREMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You shouldn't be here. This is no
dialog: place for kids.
text: Stella is mesmerized by the crew raising another casket. As
text: it pans over heads, the worm-eaten coffin crumbles, prying
dialog: loose from its binds --
speaker_heading: DEMOLITION CREW (0.C.)
text: WATCH OUT! SHE'S COMING APART --
text: The coffin falls. A Worker dives out of the way just as the
text: casket shatters to pieces on the ground, releasing -
text: A CORPSE, dressed in a rotten white gown and a wide GREEN
text: RIBBON around her neck. The skull rolls off, detaching from
text: the body. It was the ribbon holding it on. Alice screams.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: The green ribbon -- the woman Chuck
dialog: saw.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: How? She’s been dead over 40 years.
speaker_heading: FOREMAN
dialog: You gotta get outta here. This is
dialog: no place for kids.
text: The Foreman returns to his crew as they solemnly head back
text: down the long driveway.
speaker_heading: HOLD ON
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Is there another Haunted House? Why
dialog: would the last chapter say ‘Haunted
dialog: House’ if it’s gone?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: You said Sarah vanished. To where?
dialog: (mind racing)
dialog: Maybe if we find her remains, we
dialog: can lay them to rest... give her a
dialog: proper burial.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: This isn’t a movie, dork.
text: A glint of something OS catches Stella’s eye. Then the
text: TINKERING of a familiar childlike-melody.
speaker_heading: RAMON (0.S.)
dialog: I didn’t say it was.
text: Stella lowers to some construction debris where sits the
text: MUSIC BOX that was destroyed, rebuilt in perfect order.
text: Stella picks it up, intrigued.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Then let’s start digging. How ‘bout
dialog: this? I’ll take these 100 acres.
dialog: You got those 100 acres. I’m sure
text: Alice is good with a shovel.
speaker_heading: RAMON (0.S.)
dialog: You don’t need to be a dick about
dialog: it. I’m just trying to help.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE (0.S.)
dialog: Help? I’m trying to live.
text: She studies the Music Box. Stella turns it over and finds it
text: is engraved with the name -- “ELOISE W”.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You say they died 40 years ago?
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Yeah. Why?
speaker_heading: STELLA

scene_heading: EXT. SUNNYHAVEN NURSING HOME - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: AUGGIE (0.C.)

dialog: Sunnyhaven.
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.C.)
dialog: The caretaker told me they didn’t

scene_heading: CANTANKEROUS BED MATE #2
dialog: What do you see?
speaker_heading: CHEERFUL MAN
dialog: The flowers have bloomed. Oh, and

text: A CARETAKER guides Stella and her friends past their room,

text: George gives them a dead stare and a hollow smile, hoping
dialog: they will keep his secret. They move on into --

speaker_heading: THE SUN ROOM
text: Frail elderly are hunched over in wheelchairs parked along

speaker_heading: CARETAKER
dialog: That’s LouLou. Don’t expect to get

text: They approach LOULOU and see her milky cataract eyes staring
dialog: at nothing in particular.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Eloise Walker?
text: She only trembles, crippled by late-stage Parkinson's.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: LouLou Walker? Can you hear us?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Why are we wasting time --
text: Stella winds the Music Box and lets it play. The child-like
text: melody puts a sweet smile on LouLou --
speaker_heading: LOULOU
dialog: ... You May Be the Next.
text: Stella and Ramén share a look, recognizing those words.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Why did you say that?
speaker_heading: LOULOU
dialog: It’s a song, sweetheart.
dialog: (murmurs song)
dialog: ‘The worms crawl in, the worms

speaker_heading: STELLA

speaker_heading: LOULOU

dialog: (fondly recollects)
dialog: She had a gift... to fix things.
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: LOULOU (CONT'D)
dialog: Even helped me see for a bit. They

text: They share a look, mystified. But Alice loses her patience --
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Then why is she torturing us? What
dialog: did we ever do to her--
text: Stella calms Alice, then takes a gentler approach.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: We have her book. And she’s still
dialog: writing stories. Why?
speaker_heading: LOULOU
dialog: Stories hurt. Stories heal. If all
dialog: you know is hatred, it can make you

dialog: (singing)
dialog: ‘They'll eat your ears, they'll eat

speaker_heading: LOULOU

speaker_heading: STELLA

scene_heading: INT. MILL VALLEY PUBLIC LIBRARY - SEQUENCE OF SHOTS

speaker_heading: MALE CALLER (V.O.)
dialog: Isn’t it obvious? It’s a prank.
dialog: Just some kids, making trouble.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.O.)
dialog: We all have our opinions. But to
dialog: change the mood, here’s The Dock of

text: The song starts- giving place to a montage--

text: --“Registry of Historic Places,” etc. Auggie drops them off
dialog: for --

text: older than ten. “Children continue to vanish. Parents demand
text: blood,” is the headline.
text: She starts scribbling each child’s name onto a note pad.
speaker_heading: FEMALE CALLER (V.O.)
dialog: Our children are paying for our
dialog: sins. All of this free love. This
dialog: race mixing. We need an American
dialog: Independent, like George Wallace --
text: A venerable LIBRARIAN sorts books back onto shelves, keeping
text: a judgmental eye on Ramon, fervently reading in the aisle.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.O.)
dialog: This is still the real world, is it
dialog: not? All I know is this is a time
dialog: to come together, not apart.
text: Ram6én studies a county map. He traces the Yamhill River with
text: his finger, until it intersects with the Bellows Rail Yard.
text: Further downstream is the heart of Mill Valley.
text: Ram6én catches the Librarian’s stare, then stares back. She

scene_heading: STUDY SEQUENCE OVER
dialog: 56.
text: Stella cross references names as Ramén reads the Bellows
text: Book, while Auggie looks for more research material.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: The name in the Green Ribbon is...

text: Stella looks up, knowing the answer already.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Dolores.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (seeing name, then)
dialog: How did you --
speaker_heading: STELLA
text: Sarah's mother. The woman with the
text: green ribbon around her neck.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Every member of her family, they
dialog: are all in this book.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Even weirder, anyone that spent
dialog: considerable time with them died of
dialog: either a strange accident or
dialog: unnatural causes...
dialog: (holds up obituary)
text: The detective who searched inside
dialog: their house? Died of a heart attack
dialog: in his apartment three years ago...
text: found eaten by his cats, including
dialog: his beloved Martin.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Nothing unnatural about that.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: And all the deaths are in like,
dialog: chronological order. Except the
dialog: kids she murdered, who should be in
text: the front of the book...
dialog: (looking through notes)
dialog: They aren’t in any of the chapters.
text: Their names don’t appear anywhere.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (struggling to track)
dialog: Wait. If everyone died who went in
dialog: that house, how did LouLou survive?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I don’t know. You heard her, Sarah
dialog: loved her.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Maybe the kids died before she
dialog: became a cursed witch --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Or maybe she never murdered them in
dialog: the first place.
text: Ramén raises an eyebrow - that is quite the allegation.
text: Auggie unloads another stack of periodicals.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: If it’s my name, don’t tell me. I,
dialog: for one, don’t wanna know how I go.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Look what I found.
text: Stella sees a rare photo of SARAH BELLOWS in a hazel hospital
text: gown, surrounded by a team of doctors, unsmiling. She is
text: simple with a wide smile and unnatural curved spine
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: It’s her.
text: Ramén reads the lab coats insignia.
speaker_heading: RAMON
speaker_heading: “RLP.H. oe
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I know those letters. Riverwell

speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Get this- This photo was taken the
dialog: year before her whole family died.
text: As Stella and Auggie extrapolate --
text: Ramén flips to an illustration in Sarah’s book that grabs his
text: attention. It’s entitled ‘HIGH BEAMS’ with an image of a
text: scared woman behind the wheel and headlights following her.
speaker_heading: STELLA (0.C.)
dialog: So she didn’t disappear, she was
text: locked away.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE (0.C.)
dialog: Can you imagine being committed
dialog: into a nut house at our age?
text: Ramén looks up from the Book.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: What was your mom’s name?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Dinah, why?
text: Ramén shakes off his presumption and flips to the next page.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: No reason.
text: Stella can tell he knows something, but is afraid to ask.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Where’s Alice? She should be here
dialog: by now.
text: Ramén turns to the next unwritten chapter - ‘The Red Spot’.
text: The story still blank.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: As long as there isn’t a new story,
dialog: she’s probably all right.
text: Alice shuffles into the library, nerves on high. Her head is
text: down and half of her face is covered by her hair.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Sorry I’m late. Do you know how
dialog: terrible it was to keep my mouth
dialog: shut?
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: It's okay. We weren’t worried.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I uh, I'll just be a minute. I need
dialog: to freshen up.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: You look fresh to me...
text: Alice beelines out, ignoring him. Auggie studies her illusive
dialog: Manner. Something is not right.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Maybe you should hold off on
dialog: telling her how you feel. It’s not
dialog: like we're under any unusual
dialog: stress, or curse or anything.
text: Stella cracks a rare smile. Auggie isn’t laughing.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: (to Ramén)
dialog: I hope you're next.
text: As they return to their research --
text: CLOSE ON: A small BEAD OF BLOOD drops onto the blank chapter
dialog: page of ‘The Red Spot’, creating...
text: A RED SPOT.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Ramén. Your nose.
text: Ramén wipes his bloody nose, confused.
text: He notices the RED SPOT on the blank page, then pushes
text: himself away from the Bellows Book, panicked.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: OH SHIT! The red spot. The red
dialog: spot! I AM next!
text: The Librarian SHUSHES them.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: The first sentence to ‘THE RED SPOT’ APPEARS before their

speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: Ohhhh god... ohgodohgodohgod.
text: BLACK INK seeps up through the page, bleeding into creepy

speaker_heading: ALICE

speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN ASSISTANT

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “,.. it was there in the washroom

dialog: red spot..." It’s ALICE!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: It’s Alice? Thank god!
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: The washroom!
text: Auggie bolts up from the table and races out. Stella throws a
dialog: look to Ramén - how selfish of you.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: What?! I thought I was gonna die.
text: She grabs the book and runs after. Ramdén chases.
dialog: 61.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
text: The three skid on the linoleum, looking for the washroom!
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: ALICE?!!
scene_heading: INT. WASHROOM - LIBRARY - SAME TIME
text: Alice enters the washroom alone. She goes to the mirror to
dialog: inspect the largest zit ever seen in the history of cinema.
text: Red and raw. She touches the pimple, but it hurts so bad.
dialog: It must be popped.
text: She turns on the hot water, steaming. Then wets a paper towel
text: to gently compress it.
text: When she leans back down to soak her towel...
text: SARAH BELLOWS is in the mirror’s reflection. Wet and smiling,
text: with the crazed, simple face of a child.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY —- LIBRARY - SAME TIME
text: Stella, Ramén and Auggie charge down the hallway toward a

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Upstairs!
text: They follow Auggie up the stairs, two steps at a time.
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: INT. WASHROOM - LIBRARY - SAME TIME
text: Alice gets a closer look at the pimple when - it almost looks
text: like SOMETHING moved inside it.
text: Her heart stops. She wipes the mirror and inspects it closer.
text: Again, something moves just under the skin...
text: Suddenly, an ingrown BLACK HAIR pokes out... Ugh gross...
scene_heading: INT. WOMEN’S WASHROOM - SECOND FLOOR - SAME TIME
text: Stella, Ramén and Auggie explode into the second floor

speaker_heading: STELLA

text: Auggie eyes a STAFF NAME TAG on the custodian, then urgently:
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: IS THERE A STAFF WASHROOM?!
dialog: Before he can answer --
scene_heading: INT. STAFF WASHROOM - LIBRARY - SAME TIME
text: Disgusted, Alice inspects the short black hair sticking out
text: of her boil. She delicately tugs on it - trying to remove the
dialog: ingrown hair, only for -
text: The hair TWITCHES, as if alive. That’s no hair, it’s a leg.
text: Alice SCREAMS and places her hand over the pimple, just as -
text: A SWARM OF BABY SPIDERS escape through her fingers, spreading
text: across her face!!! SHE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER!
text: Alice takes her hand off her face. An endless stream of tiny
text: spiders crawl out of her pimple. The more she claws away, the
text: faster they come out.
text: The Librarian enters to see Alice bristled with creepy
text: crawlies. Alice reaches out for help amidst her thrashing,
text: but the scared librarian only runs away.
speaker_heading: ALICE

scene_heading: INT. STAFF WASHROOM - LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: They enter to find --
text: A LARGE BLACK MASS WRITHING and SCREAMING in the corner. A

text: Auggie and Stella instantly take off their jackets and swat
dialog: them away. But there’s too many.
text: Ram6én RUNS OUT into the HALLWAY -- and sees a bucket of mop
text: water. Thinking quick, he picks it up and RACES BACK INTO THE
speaker_heading: BATHROOM --—
text: He drenches Alice, washing the remaining spiders away.
text: Stella can only watch as Auggie drops to the floor to cradle
text: Alice, left catatonic. Her skin pock-marked with bites.
text: Stunned patrons crowd the door, staring. Alice twitches in
text: Auggie’s arms, unable to cope. She’s alive, but not well.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
text: HELP! SOMEONE GET HELP!
text: The crowd doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: CALL AN AMBULANCE!!!
text: A concerned patron runs off.

text: She mutters, unaware of her surroundings.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: ... They're all over me. Get them
dialog: off. Get them off...
speaker_heading: AUGGIE

speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS (CONT’D)

text: Deputy Hobbs eyes the Corvair Monza, knowing Ramén has to
dialog: return for it eventually.
text: A FEW BLOCKS AWAY
text: Ramén nervously lights a cigarette as Auggie watches from

speaker_heading: STELLA
text: Alice dies at the end of her story.
dialog: (desperate to others)
dialog: But she’s not dead. We saved her.
dialog: We saved her, right?
speaker_heading: AUGGIE

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck it. I’m turning myself in.
speaker_heading: STELLA/AUGGIE
dialog: What? / Why?!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: To tell them you’ve got nothing to

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Neither do you. What good will that

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Look, I’m not that thick. I know

dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: And what happens when you’re locked

dialog: you? What help can we be then?
text: Ram6n can’t stomach conceding the point. Furious, he throws

speaker_heading: AUGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s been a long day. We can’t
dialog: think. We need sleep.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: The next story is called ‘The

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: RAMON

dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: They were arguing that night. All I
dialog: can remember is... she couldn’t
dialog: take it anymore and drove off.

speaker_heading: BACK ON

speaker_heading: RAMON

scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - MILL VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stella and Auggie pile into the Principals’ bronze boat of a

scene_heading: INT. FRONT DESK - RIVERWELL PSYCHIATRIC - MOMENTS LATER
text: Within an institutional corridor, a rigid RECEPTION NURSE

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: We need to see the records of a

speaker_heading: RECEPTION NURSE

speaker_heading: STELLA

speaker_heading: RECEPTION NURSE
dialog: Gene, where are we storing the

speaker_heading: ORDERLY GENE
text: In the red room of the old

speaker_heading: RECEPTION NURSE

dialog: (amused by their anguish)
dialog: Need a pen?
speaker_heading: RAMON

scene_heading: EXT. RIVERWELL PSYCHIATRIC - MOMENTS LATER
text: They walk behind the renovated hospital to discover --

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AUGGIE

scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR - RIVERWELL PSYCHIATRIC - LATER

speaker_heading: PASSING NURSE

scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - RIVERWELL PSYCHIATRIC - SAME TIME

speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: I think you want the fifth floor.
text: Brown gown, fifth floor.
text: He hits the 5th floor button for them. They smile.

dialog: Ding.
scene_heading: INT. FIFTH FLOOR - RIVERWELL PSYCHIATRIC - MOMENTS LATER
text: The doors open to the sound of strange moaning and erratic

speaker_heading: ORDERLY

text: Auggie frantically looks around, ultra-sensitive to his

speaker_heading: AUGGIE
text: At least there’s no red.
text: With the coast clear, they wheel Auggie further into the
text: restricted portion of the hospital.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Don’t worry. We’ll make this quick.
text: They duck down a hallway, keeping out of the orderlies sight.
dialog: 78.

scene_heading: MENTAL PATIENT #1

scene_heading: MENTAL PATIENT #2

scene_heading: INT. PATIENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The patients are too doped up to notice as the three go to a

speaker_heading: AUGGIE
dialog: I'll keep watch.
text: Auggie guards the open doorway, on the lookout.
text: Stella and Ramén open the large window, judging the distance.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: A little high. If the book doesn’t
dialog: kill us, the jump might.
text: Quick thinking, Stella pulls a stained SPRING MATTRESS off an

speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Good thinking.
text: They throw the mattress over the divide. It drops down until
text: landing in a plume of dust on the roof, two stories below.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: You think we can make it?
text: Ramén judges the distance, then carefully throws the Book
text: down in a test run... It misses the mattress, by a lot.
dialog: Stella throws Ramén a look - seriously?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Ladies first?
speaker_heading: STELLA

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Catch ya later.
speaker_heading: AUGGIE

speaker_heading: ON ROOFTOP

text: BACK IN THE ROOM
dialog: 80.
text: Deputy Hobbs and the staff look into the bemoaning patients

speaker_heading: AUGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oof.
scene_heading: INT. OLD SANITARIUM - SAME TIME
text: Stella and Ramén writhe on their mattress on a hallway floor,

speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: We make a great team.
text: Stella rolls her eyes and rises. The two find themselves --
text: In a dark, decomposing corridor to a place long forgotten.
text: Sunlight from narrow, inescapable windows accentuate the

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: There’s nothing on her. It’s like

speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: (mind races)
dialog: «.. Just like her Book.

text: Instead of scary stories, they are filled with dated patient
dialog: reviews, x-rays, photos --
text: Stella looks at the file in his hand: Autopsy reports for a
text: group of children - the ones Sarah allegedly had murdered.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: These are medical charts... for the

speaker_heading: STELLA

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: That can’t be, that doesn’t make

speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RAMON

speaker_heading: ORDERLY (0.S.)
dialog: THERE YOU ARE!

text: He comes upon an ENDLESS CORRIDOR THAT STRETCHES OUT TO

scene_heading: INT. DREAM CORRIDORS - RIVERWELL PSYCHIATRIC - SAME TIME

dialog: fails to notice -

speaker_heading: AUGGIE

scene_heading: MAZE OF HALLWAYS
text: Auggie turns and tries to escape. Panting. As he runs, he

text: The BELLOWS FAMILY sitting around their lavish dinner table
text: in their house. They turn to stare with gaunt faces. Instead

dialog: Sure it is.
text: While Ramén fights for his life, Stella slumps in a corner.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: At least give us the book before
dialog: it’s too late! If we could save
dialog: Alice, we can save ourselves!
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: You didn’t hear? Alice died_on the
text: way to the hospital.
text: Ramén pales. Stella scoffs - despondent.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatever you guys are into, I'd
dialog: start telling the truth. Cause
dialog: someone’s gotta pay.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: We ARE telling the truth!
text: Deputy Hobbs leaves as their pleas fall on deaf ears, taking
text: the Book with him. Ramén falls to the ground. Defeated.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (numb )
dialog: They don’t believe us... just like
dialog: they didn’t believe Sarah. Alice
dialog: died... just like the story said.
dialog: Whatever’s written, comes true.
speaker_heading: RAMON
text: So the son of a war hero, dies a
text: two-bit hood.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I don’t think--
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: It doesn’t matter what you think.
dialog: It’s the stories you leave behind.
dialog: What people believe... It’s all
dialog: stories... They come up with the
dialog: right lies and we go to war -- they
dialog: say the freeway will bring progress
dialog: and it kills the town.
text: He hits his head against the wall, remembering something he
text: can’t get out of his head.
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: When my father returned from war,
dialog: when I was a kid, I remembered the
text: ticker tape that would fall out of
text: his clothes. They couldn’t look at
dialog: him, but they loved him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I hated him. When I caught up
dialog: enough courage, I finally asked
dialog: him. ‘What kind of father would
text: jump on a grenade, knowing he had a
dialog: kid back at home.’ Y’know what he
dialog: said?
dialog: (to Stella)
dialog: ‘What sort of father would I be if
dialog: I hadn't?’
dialog: 91.
text: Stella sees Ramén in a new light. He makes himself laugh,
text: perhaps to prevent his tears.
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn’t understand it at the time.
dialog: But after all of this shit... If I
dialog: get outta here, I’d do the same.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: My father will never know. If I
dialog: could to talk to him -- tell him I
dialog: believe him now.
dialog: (hopeless)
dialog: We’re gonna die. But I wanna live.
dialog: (resolute)
dialog: I want to live.
text: Ram6én grabs her hand between the bars, trying to comfort her.
text: But they both know their fate is all but sealed.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN OFFICE - POLICE STATION - SAME
text: Deputy Hobbs sits at his desk, awaiting Sheriff Milner. He
text: reads the Bellows Book, with TRIGGER laying at his feet.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: (to Trigger)
dialog: Can you believe what the kids these
dialog: days are reading?
text: He turns a page to a new chapter “Me Tie Dough-ty Walker”. We
text: notice it’s no longer blank, but covered in writing.
text: As he reads, his brows narrow. Eyes locked in. Could it be?
scene_heading: INT. DETENTION CELLS - CONTINUOUS
text: Stella and Ramén rise as Deputy Hobbs forcefully enters. A
text: palpable tension in the air. The man looks unhinged.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: How’d you get my name in that book?
text: They share a look of distress, unsure how to answer.
text: Hobbs opens the cylinder to his revolver and inserts bullets.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: It writes itself. But your name
dialog: shouldn’t be in it. You never went
dialog: into the hou--
dialog: 92.
text: He closes the cylinder and points his gun at Ramén. He fires -
text: BANG! The bullet SPARKS off a cell bar. Stella screams.
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: JESUS! ARE YOU INSANE?!!
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: Shut your mouth, wetback.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now I have questions and one of you
dialog: will give me answers.
text: Hobbs keeps the gun pointed at Ramdén as he talks to Stella.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s one sick story you wrote,
dialog: but how did you know you’d be
dialog: locked up in here?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Please. It’s like he said. It
dialog: wasn’t us, it was the--
text: BANG! Another fire RINGS out! This time making contact with
text: the brick wall over Ramén’s head! They SCREAM.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: Did he bring you into this?
dialog: Handsome, older boy, invites you
dialog: into some trouble?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: We went into the Bellows house...
dialog: And found that Book... Kurt
dialog: followed us in...
text: Hobbs aims his anger and his gun at the cowering Ramén, he’s
text: sure not to miss this time. Stella talks twice as fast.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sarah Bellows, she murdered our
dialog: friends, and Kurt, and my mom.
dialog: Please - you have to believe us-
dialog: It’s the truth...
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: THAT AIN'T THE TRUTH!
text: Hobbs points the gun at Stella, a fed up man.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Don’t -- !
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (through sobs)
dialog: You have to tell my dad... I know
dialog: it wasn’t him... It was Sarah in
dialog: the car... Just tell my dad... We
dialog: didn’t write the stories --
text: As Stella weeps, Hobbs keeps his gun trained on her. Then --
text: Trigger casually saunters in as the tension hits its climax.
text: All three eye the dog as it sits and curiously stares at the
text: fireplace, as if awaiting something.
text: The dog yelps and whines at the hearth, as if trying to speak
dialog: actual words - ‘Wee rai rowly rawer’.
text: Hobbs lowers his revolver, even more perturbed.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: That was in the story. How’d you
dialog: make my dog do that?
text: Stella and Ramén share a startled look, realizing...
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Who else’s name is in the story?
text: Trigger wags his tail, staring off at something unseen. He
text: whimpers. All three look at the chimney, alarmed.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: You okay, boy?
text: He tries to comfort his dog, only it won’t break its stare
text: from the fireplace. He yelps louder, ‘WEE RAI ROWLY RAWER!'
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s wrong with him?
text: They stare at the mutt, trying to decipher the strange dog-
text: like moaning. Almost like words. It dawns on Stella first --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: ‘Me Tie Dough-Ty Walker’.
text: Trigger, louder: ‘WEE RAI ROWLY RAWER! WEE RAI ROWLY RAWER!'
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Who’s name is in the story?!
text: They back away in their cells - hope fleeting.
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: What’d you do to my dog?!
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: PLEASE! You have to let us out of
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: One of us is gonna die next. Who’s
dialog: name is in the story?!
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: (fed up, to Ramén)
dialog: Yours, okay? It’s you.
text: Stella looks to Ramén - his heart skips a beat. Trigger
text: skitters, barking at the fireplace.
text: Something HARD AND FLESHY bounces down the chimney, then -
text: The BLOODY HEAD of SARAH BELLOWS rolls across the floor and
dialog: comes to a stop!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SARAH BELLOWS HEAD
dialog: ...-Youuu maaay beee theee neeext...
text: Deputy Hobbs’s eyes bulge.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: What the f--
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Listen to me. If we don’t get out
dialog: of here, Ramén is going to die.
text: Deputy Hobbs snaps out of it and grabs his key ring but --
text: Trigger TURNS ON his master with a low and guttural growl.
speaker_heading: DEPUTY HOBBS
dialog: Boy, it’s me...
text: The dog snaps and starts BARKING. Drool foams from his mouth.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Don’t just stand there, GET ME
dialog: OUTTA HERE!
text: TWO ROTTED FEET tumble from out of the hearth next.
text: Deputy Hobbs isn’t sure what to do, but finally moves to
dialog: unlock the teens, when --
dialog: 95.
text: Trigger CHOMPS onto his arm! He SCREAMS in pain as he drops
text: his keys just short of Stella’s cell.
text: Trigger thrashes as Deputy Hobbs HOWLS.
text: Ramén can do nothing but watch the horror unfold.
text: Stella reaches for the keys, but they are just out of grasp.
text: TWO ROTTED LEGS topple from the fireplace and then attach
text: themselves to the feet.
text: FLESHY BODY PARTS spasm on the ground like suffocating fish.
text: A TORSO and CHEST CAVITY wriggle up to the legs, rising
text: before them. Then chunks of shoulder meat... a pair of
text: forearms, rotted hands... and finally a smiling head...
text: SARAH'S DISJOINTED AND ROTTED BODY rises. She lurches toward
text: the wailing Sheriff -- held down by Trigger, further sinking
text: his teeth into his master’s arm.
text: Deputy Hobbs looks up in horror at the smiling face of Sarah.
text: She looks him deep in the eye -- then SNAPS his neck!
text: The Deputy’s body lands with a THUD! Stella and Ramén react --
text: all hope of their escape now dead on the ground.
text: Rotted Sarah rears her neck -- staring at Ramén. Sarah starts
text: to lurch toward his cell.
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Open it! Open it!
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: I can’t reach the keys!
text: Ramén backs away as Sarah hobbles outside his cell, her arms
text: reaching through the bars.
text: Sarah begins to SQUEEZE her rotten head through the bars. Her
text: skull crunches and indents, allowing her head THROUGH.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: GET THE KEYS!
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: My arm isn’t long enough!!
text: Sarah dislocates her shoulder, pushing one arm through, then
text: CRUNCHES her chest cavity through. She’s inside!
text: Rotted Sarah grasps for Ramén, when -
text: Stella REACHES through the bars and GRABS Sarah!
dialog: 96.
text: The mere touch of her causes Stella’s eyes to turn white as
text: she begins to CHOKE -- water pours out of Stella’s mouth --
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Stella!
text: --Stella’s deadening eyes look up -- The bright lamps above
text: BLINDING... ANGLE RACES INTO THE LIGHT, AND--
scene_heading: UNDERWATER —- TIME UNKNOWN
text: Stella is suddenly SUBMERGED underwater. A hand tight around
text: her neck. But as she tries to make out what is on the other
dialog: side of the water’s surface --
text: -- it isn’t Sarah. But Sarah’s Father, ARNOLD BELLOWS. Three
text: sons surround the patriarch, watching Stella drown. A cold
text: matriarch holding an infant watches on without intervention.
text: She tries to scream, but can’t get any air out of her lungs.
text: She fixates on something over the faceless men -- A PAIR OF
text: MASONRY CHIMNEYS that belong to THE BELLOWS MANSION.
text: Just as Stella’s eyes drift closed and her body goes limp --
scene_heading: INT. DETENTION CELLS - RETURN TO PRESENT DAY
text: Ramén sees their struggle has kicked the keys closer to him.
text: He reaches out and stretches for the keys. He snares them!
text: After unlocking himself, he sees Stella holding Sarah back.
text: Drowning from the water pouring out of her mouth...
text: Ramén grabs the revolver off the floor and --
text: BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Bullets STRIKE the corpse of Sarah,
text: TORQUING her body free from Stella! CLICK! CLICK! CLICK!...
text: Stella falls to the floor in a heap, gagging and coughing.
text: Ram6n opens her cell and helps Stella to her feet. She
text: struggles to catch her breath.
text: Still alive, Rotted Sarah LUNGES for Ramén again --
text: --only for him to SLAM the cell door closed on her!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Come on!
text: Ram6én grabs Stella’s hand --
dialog: 97.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN OFFICE - POLICE STATION - SAME
text: Before they race out of the main office -- Stella breaks her
text: grip with Ramon... to retrieve the Bellows Book.
scene_heading: EXT. MILL VALLEY POLICE STATION - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
text: Ramén opens the squad car, but it’s locked. Stella anxious.
text: TRIGGER jumps on the hood of the car, SNARLING. They YELL!
text: The SARAH BELLOWS’ CORPSE stumbles her way towards them!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a POLICE CRUISER barrels into Sarah! She EXPLODES
text: and rains down in body parts. A window lowers, revealing -
text: SHERIFF MILNER. Looking spooked.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: Get in!
text: Stella and Ramén dive into the car, closing the door just as
text: Trigger attacks, clawing at the window.
text: Milner can’t take his eyes off the body parts on the street
text: ahead, flopping on the pavement. Some begin to rejoin, slowly
text: rebuilding back into a rotted Sarah.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON
text: Her head rolls to a stop, SCREECHING a deafening SCREAM! The
text: cruiser’s wheels kick up dirt and peel off.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF CRUISER - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: As Sheriff Milner drives, Stella and Ramén gasp in relief.
text: They know they were saved from an inch of their lives.
text: Ram6n clings to the mesh screen dividing them.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: What the hell was that?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: You saw it too? Thank GOD you saw
dialog: it! You finally believe us.
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: That’s what killed your son. And
dialog: will kill us too unless we get as
dialog: far away from here as possible...
text: Stella starts to read the rest of ‘Me Tie Dough-ty Walker’.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: The stories. There’s no way to stop
dialog: them once they’ve been written.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: That was Sarah Bellows?
dialog: Ramén has never heard sweeter words.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: You even know her name?! I love
dialog: you, man. I love the law! Just
dialog: drive, man. Open her up.
dialog: (to Stella)
dialog: How do I die in the end?
text: Stella finishes reading to herself, then mournfully looks up.
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s okay... I can handle it. I'd
dialog: rather know.
text: She catches the Sheriff's cold glance in the rearview mirror.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: He shoots you.
text: Milner drives coolly, never taking his eyes off the road.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: What? You’ve got to be kidding me.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: His father... he was the doctor in
dialog: charge at the hospital. He helped
text: the Bellows cover it up.
text: The CB radio sparks up. An out of jurisdiction DISPATCHER.
speaker_heading: DISPATCHER (0.S.)
dialog: Sheriff, we're getting an unusual
dialog: amount of calls. Are you picking up
dialog: the phone--
text: The Sheriff clicks off his CB. They drive in eerie silence.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: You just had to go into that damn
dialog: house.
text: They try to force their doors open, to no avail.
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE CRUISER
text: As the cruiser drives down a deserted highway...
text: Stella and Ramén claw at the doors and window -- kicking and
text: screaming -- but their muffled cries for help go unnoticed.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLOWS ESTATE - NIGHT - LATER
text: The Sheriff's cruiser passes through the property gates and
text: crosses a small bridge over a dry riverbed, winding up the
text: hill to where the Bellows mansion once stood.
text: The entire estate has been razed down to dirt and debris,
text: except for the brittle remains of the dual chimney stacks.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLOWS DAM - NIGHT - LATER
text: The cruiser has parked beside a dry riverbed and a small
text: MASONRY ARCH-WALL DAM. Beyond it, the remains of a river
text: along with rusty iron frames, chloridized leeching tanks, and
text: drain boxes make up the derelict rail yard.
text: Headlights illuminate the dam, where Sheriff Milner has a
text: shovel, pick axe and some bags of cement.
text: IN THE BACK OF THE CRUISER
text: Stella and Ramén struggle, both of their hands now cuffed
text: behind their back.
text: She spots the dual chimney stacks and wanes as she recognizes
text: it as the location from her vision.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: This is where they took her. This
text: is where her family murdered her.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Misery loves company.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: (struck)
text: They buried the bodies in the dam.
speaker_heading: ON MILNER
dialog: 100.
text: Stacks of cobblestone are piled aside as Milner digs a shovel
text: into fresh earth. A hole big enough for two graves.
text: He sweats with each burrow into the ground. His voice raised--
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: I was told I only needed to keep
dialog: the secret -- But then your mother
dialog: had gone into that house -- Now
dialog: ‘cause of you, my son is dead - And
dialog: once you’re dead and buried,
dialog: everything will settle down -- Just
dialog: as it always does.
text: His shovel scrapes dirt aside, incidentally exposing the
text: skeletal remains of an ABNORMALLY ENLARGED SKULL.
text: Milner keeps digging, paying no mind.
text: IN THE BACK OF THE CRUISER
text: Stella writhes as they try to escape. She presses her face
text: against Ramén’s in what appears to be a passionate gesture.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: (shared passion)
dialog: If this is it, may as well --
text: Ramén attempts to meet her lips, but it isn’t reciprocated.
text: Stella scrunches to get her arms under her rear, bringing the
text: cuffs in front of her. It finally dons on Ramén--
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh good. You can do that.
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Now help me out.
text: Stella ignores Ramén in favor of grabbing the Bellows Book.
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
text: With her hands cinched, she opens to the last chapter. The
text: story of ‘The Haunted House’ is still unwritten.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Whatever is written, comes true.
dialog: (searching)
dialog: Pen... pen... pen...
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: What?
dialog: 101.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: We have to write her story. It’s
dialog: the only way for her to hear the
dialog: truth.
text: Ram6n catches on. He turns his pelvis to her.
speaker_heading: RAMON
text: Front pocket.
text: Stella grabs Auggie’s old broken pen.
text: Ramén keeps one eye on Milner as Stella begins writing. Her
text: words escape her lips as if in a fever dream.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: “Sarah Bellows was a sweet, young-
dialog: lonely girl whose parents never let
dialog: her out of the house...”
text: Ramén looks out the window and goes in awe at something OS.
scene_heading: ON SHERIFF MILNER
text: He finishes mixing some wet cement in a wheelbarrow. He rises
text: and wipes his brow. The wind howls and sweeps past him.
text: Feeling watched, he slowly turns, his frame moving aside -
text: Revealing THE BELLOW’S HOUSE fully rebuilt in the distance.
dialog: 
text: Milner can’t believe his eyes. He looks to the cruiser and
text: his eyes narrow on Stella writing in stride.
text: He stabs his shovel into the earth.
text: IN THE BACK OF THE CRUISER
text: Stella now sees the house on the hill, gobsmacked.
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: Write, Stella. Hurry!
text: She returns to scribbling out words, almost illegible, when --
text: Stella's door rips open and she is YANKED out of the car. The
text: Book goes flying along with her glasses.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING!
text: Stella hits the dirt hard. She struggles to see, but spots
text: her glasses behind her, and the Book between her and Milner.
text: Fuck the glasses. She crawls toward the Book.
dialog: 102.
text: Milner approaches, taking his revolver out of the holster.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t you see, darling? If they
dialog: found out the water was spoiled,
dialog: there would be no Mill Valley...
text: Ramén sees this as his chance. He gathers his courage --
text: From out of the cruiser comes a warrior’s cry. Ramén LAUNCHES
text: himself out of the back and TACKLES Milner to the ground.
text: Stella grabs the Book but is vexed - she knows Ramdén will
text: never win this fight with his hands cuffed behind his back.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: No, your story --
speaker_heading: RAMON
text: RUN, STELLA, WRITE!
text: As Ramén and Milner wrestle, Stella takes the Book and darts
text: towards the Bellow’s House, tripping over the tall grass.
text: Milner tries to get to his gun, but Ramén does everything in
text: his power to stop him. He’s thrown back --
text: Ramén’s face hits the dirt, in plain view of --
text: Headlights illuminate an upright pick axe dissecting the
text: printed words on a box of “MEATIER SAND” and “DOUGHTY WALKER
text: CEMENT” to reveal the words “ME TIE DOUGHTY WALKER”.
text: Ram6n smirks as it gravely dons on him --
speaker_heading: RAMON (CONT'D)
dialog: So that’s why it’s called that.
scene_heading: ON STELLA - RUNNING
text: As she approaches the Bellow’s House, a deafening GUN SHOT
text: rings out into the night. She stutters, fearing Ramén’s fate.
text: But she continues on, never looking back.
speaker_heading: BEHIND HER
text: Milner rises out of the tall grass.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF MILNER
dialog: Come back here, Stella!
text: ON STELLA AT BELLOWS HOUSE
dialog: 103.
text: Another gunshot rings out and the bullet whizzes by. Heart
text: racing, she enters the house.
scene_heading: INT. BELLOWS ESTATE - YESTERYEAR
text: Stella bursts through the front door, confused and alone...
text: only the place isn’t cold and crumbling, but warm and lavish.
text: The fixtures cast the elegant interiors in a ghostly light.
text: Confused, she returns to writing in the Book, reciting:
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: “Sarah felt alone, so she wrote
dialog: scary stories for the children. And
dialog: they would come visit from all
dialog: around for they loved to hear her
dialog: read...”
text: The sounds of CHILDREN LAUGHING. Little feet PITTER-PATTER
text: across wood floors, gathering someplace.
text: Stella peers into the grand library, where it’s now lined
text: with books. A YOUNG SARAH sits in a rocking chair with a
text: large GROUP OF CHILDREN seated around her. She smiles as she
text: finishes reading a story she’s written in a child-like voice:
speaker_heading: YOUNG SARAH
dialog: ..."He’s not a hairless”, the Vet
dialog: said, “He’s not even a dog.”
speaker_heading: CHILD
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: YOUNG SARAH
dialog: It was a sewer rat with rabies!
text: The kids squeal with laughter and scares, while Sarah giggles
text: and enjoys telling the spooky tale. It’s as if the ghostly
text: inhabitants of yesteryear are pre-recorded memories.
text: Stella has a bewildered look - Is this really happening?
text: Suddenly, the front door to the manor SLAMS OPEN, revealing -
scene_heading: SHERIFF MILNER.
text: He reloads, but his bullets slip out of his hand as he is
text: awestruck by the sudden transformation of the house.
text: He gathers himself, then returns to the hunt.
dialog: 104.
text: A CHILD who Young Sarah is reading to turns his head to look
text: straight at him, breaking the fourth wall. His skin is pale
text: and sickly. River water starts pouring from his mouth.
text: Milner fires at the apparition, to no effect. Realizing
text: they’re no threat, the Sheriff continues after Stella.
scene_heading: IN THE KITCHEN
text: Stella tries to find safe refuge to write. She hides between
text: an oven and wall, continuing to write --
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: “One day, the children started to
dialog: get sick. And Sarah knew it was the
dialog: water. The water was being poisoned
dialog: by her family's rail yard...”
text: The pipes in the walls rattle. Household items tremble. The
text: kitchen faucet BURSTS dirty water. It bleeds through cracks
text: in the wall, seeping out of ceilings and floors. All around,
text: pools of river water gather. As if the house was weeping.
text: IN A DINING ROOM
text: Milner is startled by the water pressure building and moaning
text: in the walls. He eyes the stairway where massive amounts of
text: river water waterfalls down.
text: He spots movement in the kitchen and FIRES.
scene_heading: IN THE KITCHEN
text: Stella SCREAMS as the bullet ricochets nearby. She breaks
text: from her writing and races to the next room, getting wet.
speaker_heading: IN THE LIBRARY
text: Stella enters the giant library where river water drains down
text: from above. She looks for a place to hide, then spots -
text: The Alcaraz Rug covering the cellar hatch in the floor. She
text: moves the rug aside and hides down in Sarah’s hidden bedroom.
speaker_heading: A MOMENT LATER
text: Milner steps in. He uses his ears as much as his eyes. He
text: studies the library. Shelves filled with a myriad of books.
scene_heading: IN SARAH'S BEDROOM
text: Stella holds her breath below the hatch. Hoping it will work.
speaker_heading: IN LIBRARY
dialog: 105.
text: Milner’s boots step onto the Alcaraz rug, left askew. His
text: boot takes another step. The hidden hatch creaks.
scene_heading: IN SARAH'S BEDROOM
text: Stella closes her eyes. Silently praying. All goes quiet.
speaker_heading: IN LIBRARY
text: Milner’s foot casually pushes aside a corner of the rug to
text: reveal the cellar hatch. He knows this is where she’s hiding.
scene_heading: IN SARAH’S BEDROOM
text: Stella holds her breath in fear, unable to write a word.
text: Water seeps and drains into the basement room, pooling.
speaker_heading: IN LIBRARY
text: Milner lowers down to lift the hatch door, when the wall of
text: books behind him MOVE. Some JUT OUT, others RETRACT --
text: creating the IMPRESSION OF SARAH’S FACE.
text: When he slowly turns to witness it, Sarah’s impression opens
text: its mouth, inhaling books into a DARK, WIND TUNNEL ABYSS.
text: Milner EMPTIES his gun, hitting nothing but books and
text: parchment. The impression SCREAMS as the wind flurries.
text: Milner’s hat is sucked off into the void. He digs his heels
text: in to try to reload, but the gust takes his gun too.
text: A look of fear washes over him as he is pulled toward the
text: bookshelf. Heels scraping. He covers his face and then --
text: He SCREAMS as he is SUCKED into the abyss. The tremendous
text: wind dies down as loose book pages flutter to the floor.
scene_heading: IN SARAH’S BEDROOM
text: Stella’s breath quickens. Unsure of what happened. She holds
text: onto the hatch, questioning whether it’s safe to come out.
speaker_heading: IN THE LIBRARY
text: A PAIR OF FEET step out from the void in the book shelf...
text: ROTTED SARAH limps into the library in her hazel gown.
text: Crooked, elongated limbs. A damaged, child-like mind. Her
text: mouth is agape with river water pouring out.
text: Sarah lurches her mangled body towards the cellar hatch.
scene_heading: IN SARAH’S BEDROOM
dialog: 106.
text: Stella decides it’s time to open the hatch, but --
text: SARAH’S MANGLED FACE IS RIGHT THERE!
text: Stella SCREAMS. The hatch door CRASHES DOWN as she falls
text: deeper into the cellar, splashing into the water now up to
text: her waist.
text: A BANGING on the hatch door. She’s trying to get in.
text: Stella looks for a way out, but there is none. She reclaims
text: the Book... only now the pages are all wet.
text: Regardless, she writes. The ink bleeding on the page.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: “When the children started dying,
dialog: Sarah confronted her family..."
text: The BANGING intensifies. Stella writes on --
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: “But her family wouldn't listen to
dialog: Young Sarah. And to protect the
dialog: family name, they murdered the
dialog: children and hid their bodies in
dialog: the dam. And then told everyone
dialog: that she was the monster.”
text: MORE VIOLENT BANGING. It’s deafening... Then silence.
scene_heading: EXT. MILL VALLEY STREETS —- NIGHT
text: Driving his pickup, Oren overhears on the radio:
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (RADIO)
dialog: I really don’t know what to make of
dialog: it, but this is the third caller
dialog: who’s called in to say something
text: odd is going on over by the Bellows
dialog: property. Don’t ask me what --
text: Oren yanks the steering, accelerating towards the property.
scene_heading: INT. SARAH’S BASEMENT BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Stella shivers, the rising water up to her chest. Her
text: trembling hand struggles to write clearly.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: “,.. Her family locked her away in
dialog: Riverwell, where they made her
dialog: forget the truth, so that she would
dialog: believe her family's lies...”
text: Behind Stella, Rotted Sarah’s cockeyed face slowly rises up
text: from out of the water, inside the room.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: “And when she tried to fix what was
dialog: broken, they murdered her -- with
dialog: their bare hands... Sarah hated her
dialog: family for their betrayal... So she
dialog: cursed them and everyone who went
dialog: into their house.”
text: Rotted Sarah releases a banshee-like SCREAM!
text: Stella drops the book into the dark water. She swims back and
text: pushes floating articles to create distance.
text: She chokes on a mouthful of water as she searches the room,
text: looking for the book. But now Rotted Sarah is gone too.
text: Stella’s head cranks, trying to cover every direction.
text: Something touches her back -- she spins to find -- the Book.
text: Stella's feet find some footing standing on a dresser. She
text: puts her pen back to paper, only it’s not writing anymore.
text: The parchment is completely waterlogged.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no, no. Come on. Please --
text: UNDERWATER POV: Stella’s vulnerable body. Her voice muffled.
text: Stella finds a quietness that comes over the room. The
text: ripples calm...
text: Without warning, Stella’s violently YANKED underwater.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
text: Stella thrashes and tries to kick free from Sarah's grasp.
text: The Book floats away from Stella’s grasp, sinking.
text: Stella struggles for air, and to break free. The Book too far
text: from her grasp. She SCREAMS, releasing an explosion of
text: bubbles, desperate to reach the surface.
text: She's drowning and slowly losing consciousness. And then a
text: distant voice. Almost dreamy.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: DINAH MICHAELS (V.O.)
dialog: Don’t you want to know how the
dialog: story ends?... I’1ll help you.
text: Her mother’s voice stirs Stella awake from the sinking
text: slumber. She KICKS her leg free from Sarah’s grasp...
text: And explodes out of the water, filling her lungs with life.
text: She ignores the Book and clears her throat. Confident.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: We're not all at fault. We didn’t
dialog: do this to you, Sarah. My friends,
dialog: Me... my mother...
dialog: (infinite sadness)
dialog: ... Her name was Dinah Beatrix
dialog: Michaels.
text: Rotted Sarah's curdled face slowly rises just a breath from
text: Stella’s. A newfound curiosity about what she is saying.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: But she wasn’t always a Michaels...
dialog: At first, she was a Bellows.
text: Trembling, Stella continues, with her deepest confession.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: She was your daughter you carried
dialog: at Riverwell, wasn’t she? Do you
dialog: remember? They ripped her out of
dialog: your arms before they murdered you.
text: Rotted Sarah is lost in a flood of painful memories. Stella
text: holds strong, never taking her eyes off of Sarah.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You cursed your family and so you
dialog: cursed mine. But you aren’t the
dialog: monster, Sarah. They are. You don’t
dialog: want to hurt anyone, because this
dialog: isn’t you. You forgot who you are.
text: Sarah's eyes fix onto Stella’s. A fleeting moment of clarity.
text: The water level quickly continuing to rise.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a sweet girl, Sarah. And
dialog: this is your story.
text: Stella takes her last gulp of air as the water rises over
text: their heads, submerging them both.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER
dialog: 109.
text: Sarah no longer looks ‘rotted’ - Stella sees the real SARAH
text: BELLOWS for the first time.
text: Sarah sweetly smiles and gently moves back a floating wisp of
text: hair from Stella’s face. Just like LouLou described, she is a
text: sight. A soul that has been set free from the lies that have
text: been holding her hostage.
text: The two women float in the center of the water-filled room,
text: furnishings drifting about. If Stella could hold her breath
dialog: forever, she would stay to look at her grandmother’s face...
text: CLOSE ON: The Bellows Book floats by to the last pages of “Me
text: Tie Dough-ty Walker” that describe Ramén’s death. The ink
text: from the freshly written letters drift off the page...
text: Stella is hypnotized by Sarah. She may never come up for air.
text: The last bit of breath escaping her lips. And then --
text: The hatch opens above the surface, letting in light. An ARM
text: PLUNGES into the water, pulling Stella up.
speaker_heading: IN THE LIBRARY
text: Stella is yanked onto the library floor, GASPING for air,
text: coughing. She is shocked to see --
text: Ramén, clutches his bloody gut from a near fatal bullet
text: wound. Stella wraps her arms around him as he winces.
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're alive!
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: You changed the ending. You saved
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: We saved her.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW BELLOWS ESTATE - CONTINUOUS
text: Oren pulls to a stop at the Bellows Estate where some
text: onlookers have gathered, sharing hushed whispers.
text: His jaw drops seeing the newly restored BELLOWS HOUSE. The
text: front door opens, with Stella and Ramén exiting.
text: Overcome with emotion, Oren pushes through the crowd to be
dialog: with his daughter.
speaker_heading: OREN
dialog: STELL? !
dialog: 110.
text: Stella turns to see her father. His presence is far more
text: spectacular than anything that has happened to her.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: DAD!
text: She runs to him. They meet in a long embrace. He holds her,
dialog: never wanting to let go. Through tears --
speaker_heading: STELLA (CONT'D)
dialog: It wasn’t you... I know it wasn’t
dialog: you. I know the truth.
speaker_heading: OREN
dialog: The truth doesn’t matter, Stella.
dialog: Only you do. I was so worried.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What happened to you?
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Stories hurt. Stories heal.
text: He breaks the embrace to look her in the eyes, as if to
dialog: convince himself she really is okay...
text: Stella beams, tears of joy in her eyes. A brightness exudes.
text: Oren embraces her again. Their relationship made whole. He
text: knows this isn’t his sad daughter anymore. Stella is reborn.
text: Stella closes her eyes, taking in the moment.
text: Ramén is overjoyed at the sight, partly wishing his father
text: was there too. But then he sees something horrific --
text: The front door to the house kicks open to a wind-ravaged
text: SHERIFF MILNER! He looks like he’s crawled out of the sludge
text: from hell. He raises his gun, when -
text: The ground beneath the Bellows House gives way, and a portion
text: of the estate collapses into a sinkhole.
text: The startled crowd gasps.
text: Sheriff Milner looks up at the house, unsure if the rest of
dialog: it is going to fall on him. Then --
text: THE BASE OF THE LOOMING ON-RAMP sinks into the ground. The
text: soaked foundation of earth grows unstable, causing rebar to
text: bend and groan, chunks of concrete to crumble from above...
text: Before the Sheriff can run away, the entire crowd watches the
text: on-ramp all come CRASHING DOWN. He SCREAMS as -
dialog: 111.
text: CRAAAAASH! - a mountain of concrete and iron PLUMMETS down,
text: DESTROYING the Bellows House and Sheriff Milner with it.
text: As the dust settles, all that remains is a MOUNTAIN OF
text: DEBRIS. Stella and Ramén eye the pile of rubble, unsure if
dialog: it’s really over.
speaker_heading: OREN
dialog: What just happened?
speaker_heading: RAMON
dialog: I think she fixed things.
text: Oren looks confused, but Stella knows he’s right.
text: SLOWLY PAN UP on the three as the crowd behind them marvels
text: at the destruction of the Bellows House.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Happy Thanksgiving, Mill Valley, or
dialog: should I say the new era of Dick.
dialog: Richard Nixon can’t save us now.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MILL VALLEY - WEEKS LATER
text: The last remaining Autumn leaves cling to frigid trees. A
text: slight frost on people’s lawns. Winter at the doorstep.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.O.)
dialog: Let me tell ya, folks... As much as
dialog: this crazy world is filled with
dialog: lies and hypocrisy, I like to
dialog: believe there are still some
dialog: stories out there worth a damn. And
dialog: I’ve never found it more evident
dialog: than right here in our backyard.
text: A bundled Paper Boy slings NEWSPAPERS on his route. On the
text: front page, a picture of the Bellows Family, Sarah, and the
dialog: murdered young children.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.0O.)
dialog: She didn’t do it. Plain and simple.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why did we believe then? Cause we
dialog: are afraid of what we don’t know.
dialog: We're afraid of what’s in the dark.
dialog: But when we turn on the lights...
dialog: most of the time, it’s us.
speaker_heading: AT THE DAM
dialog: 112.
text: City Workers and Detectives continue their arduous work at
text: slowly breaking up the dam, removing skeletal remains.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.0O.)
dialog: Wake up, people. Our forefathers...
dialog: are cocksucking murderers.
text: They've laid the pieces of bone on a tarp like a puzzle. It’s
text: the making of nine children, and one young adult.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.0O.)
dialog: And because our city is built on
dialog: their evil deeds... The state did
dialog: some soil tests, and wouldn’t you
dialog: know, our land is foundationally
text: unsound to build a freeway on.
scene_heading: INT. MORALES’S HOME - NIGHT
text: Ramén spoon feeds food into his father’s mouth as they watch
text: TV in the family room. The distance that once divided them is
text: now gone.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.0O.)
dialog: Our town lives again... for now.
text: ON TV: Officials stand before a board, posting birthdates in
text: ascending order. Seated corespondent ROGER MUDD informs:
speaker_heading: ROGER MUDD
dialog: Tonight for the first time in 27
dialog: years the United States has again
dialog: started a draft lottery, and the
dialog: famous first pick tonight is...
text: Ramén hears something that gives him pause, the spoon lingers
text: in the air, frozen in time. It may as well be his birthday.
text: His mother’s hand comforts him. He looks to his father, fear
text: in his eyes. They meet in their fragility.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Stella lays a bouquet of yellow flowers at Dinah’s grave.
text: Behind her stands Ramén, clean-shaven and in an army uniform.
text: They walk past a few other gravestones that have been left
text: similar yellow bouquets... Auggie Hilderbrandt, Charles and
dialog: Alice Steinberg, even Kurt Milner.
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.0O.)
dialog: So let’s be nice to each other,
dialog: because eventually, we all have to
dialog: move on.
text: They meet at Oren’s pickup, its bed packed with moving boxes.
text: Before Stella goes, she gives Ramén a lasting embrace. As if
dialog: they both know there may never be one again.
text: For a moment, it looks like they may kiss, but they pull away
dialog: - knowing it’1ll only make it harder to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: DISK JOCKEY (V.0O.)
dialog: And wouldn’t you like to leave this
dialog: world a little better than how you
dialog: left it? I knows what I want to be
dialog: played at my funeral. This is ‘Hey
dialog: Jude’...
text: The Beatles “Hey Jude” plays as Stella gets into her father’s
text: truck and drives away.
scene_heading: EXT. BELLOWS PROPERTY - LATER
text: Oren waits in his idling truck, ready to leave town for good.
text: Stella walks up the long driveway that leads to what is left
text: of the Bellows Estate, holding one last bouquet for Sarah.
text: Wild flowers and tall grass have already started to grow in
text: the crevices of the ruined estate.
text: Stella climbs to the top of the rubble, where a small tree
text: has strangely already begun to sprout. She takes a moment for
dialog: herself.
text: And gently lays the bouquet down. And then rests on the grass-—
text: looking up to the clear, blue sky.
speaker_heading: STELLA
dialog: Lies- stories and lies... Now
dialog: everybody knows. That you were not
dialog: evil. That you were in pain. There
dialog: was no darkness in your heart --
text: She looks up -- a black cloud crosses the sun --
text: -- then the sound of a faint music box.
dialog: The playful melody -- You May Be the Next.
dialog: 114.
text: Concerned, Stella turns to see -- Her pretty yellow flowers
text: brown and wilt before her eyes. They sour until they are
text: nothing but crippled stalks. Even the Beatles rendition slows
text: and warps... like a broken record player underwater.
text: Stella turns to her father, fearful of what may come next --
text: SARAH'S ROTTED ARMS erupt from the earth, CLUTCHING her!
text: Stella SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER, as the arms pulls her down,
dialog: into the earth --
text: Screaming.
speaker_heading: THE END
