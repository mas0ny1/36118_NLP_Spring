speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie
dialog: Lee? One day I'm a hot young
dialog: movie star, and the next day I'm a
text: hideous mutant freak, covered with
text: festering lesions.
dialog: 
text: Oddly, REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: Sounds like my wife when she misses
dialog: a mudpack!
dialog: 
text: The audience CRACKS UP. Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis.

speaker_heading: KATHIE LEE
dialog: Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha-
dialog: ha!

speaker_heading: EARNEST)
dialog: Ricky, once you were the all-
dialog: American boy next door, star of the
dialog: beloved Hey Dude films. Now the
dialog: very mention of your name makes
dialog: children scream in terror. We've
dialog: all read about your disturbing
dialog: story. But the people want to hear
dialog: it from you, Ricky Coogan.
dialog: (SFX: children scream)
dialog: Won't you tell us your story?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, it's kinda long, but okay.
dialog: It all started when I signed a deal

text: reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to
text: camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff
text: movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES
text: photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind
text: Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his
text: entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRIT
text: GUIDE.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Further off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD
text: CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed
dialog: expressions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (through a clenched smile)
dialog: So, what kind of crap do you
dialog: scumbags want me to peddle?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Everything. Everything except
dialog: shoes, of course. Hah hah...
dialog: 
text: He laughs pathetically. Rick doesn't respond. Hertz nods to
text: a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
text: Meaty Twig Beef Sticks.
dialog: 
text: Rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. Smiles.
dialog: Flash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Helmet Head hair spray.
dialog: 
text: He takes the hair spray and holds it up. Smile. Flash.
dialog: 
text: The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal
text: container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.
text: Hertz gives it to Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro-
dialog: fertilizer.
dialog: 
text: Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not
dialog: do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a
dialog: star, got it, Hertz?
dialog: (to his aide)
dialog: Rico, give these misguided clowns
dialog: Tony Danza's phone number, and
dialog: let's get the hell out of here.
dialog: 
text: He gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly
text: takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls
text: after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up
dialog: to the radicals trying to keep
dialog: Noxon from the struggling farmers
dialog: whose very future depends on it.
dialog: 3.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (HESITATES)
dialog: Noxon? Wasn't that just banned?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Only in the U.S....and Europe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: But I heard that shit's lethal.
dialog: 
text: Hertz lets out a big laugh. He shakes his head at Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Rick, Rick, Rick... You want
dialog: proof? Fine. Just take a seat.
dialog: Please.
dialog: 
text: Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table,
text: across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a
text: placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an
text: aide, who scurries off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
speaker_heading: (TO RICK)
dialog: Meet the head of our South American
dialog: research facility, Juan Valdez.
dialog: 
text: The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a
text: natty three-piece suit and a sombrero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: My name is George Ramirez.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Whatever. He's worked with Noxon
dialog: 24 every day for five years, and
dialog: he's in fine shape. Aren't you,
dialog: Juan?
dialog: 
text: George glares at Hertz bitterly. Hertz stares him down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes. I am fine. Me and my team in
dialog: Santa Flan have--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Santa "Flan?" What kind of shitty
dialog: name for a country is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It is named for the patron saint of
dialog: creamy desserts... As I was
dialog: saying, we've worked very closely
dialog: with Noxon...
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rick nods. We cut back to George, but he isn't George
text: anymore. He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the
text: same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I personally supervised its
dialog: development...
dialog: 
text: Rick furrows his brow. He's a little suspicious of George's
text: transformation, but just a little.
dialog: 
text: Now George is even shorter, even swarthier. Yet another
dialog: actor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: I performed rigorous scientific
dialog: tests. No potential danger was
dialog: left uninvestigated...
dialog: 
text: Rick's suspicion is increasing. He looks over to Hertz, who
text: feigns total innocence.
dialog: 
text: George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His
text: clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down
text: over his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: The environmentalists are
dialog: crackpots, all of them.
dialog: 
text: Rick looks at his entourage. Their mouths hang open in
dialog: astonishment.
dialog: 
text: George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions. The
text: sombrero completely covers his head. When he takes it off,
text: we see he's now played by LINDA HUNT!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It's ridiculous, I tell you.
dialog: Totally ridiculous!
dialog: 
text: Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Thank you, Valdez. That will be
dialog: all.
dialog: 
text: George nods and heads back to his seat. As he passes behind
text: Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and
text: making a face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Wait a second--
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Ricky, this is important. We're
dialog: talking about a major threat to the
dialog: EES image. How does 2 million
dialog: dollars plus expenses sound?
dialog: 
text: The aide reveals a new placard on the easel. It reads "$2
dialog: MILLION."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Look, it sounds great, but--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: I hear you. Make it five million--
dialog: (a new placard: 5 MILLION)
dialog: that is, if the board agrees ...
dialog: 
text: Hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. The old
text: geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were
text: being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Good, it's unanimous. Well, what
dialog: do you say, Ricky? Are you EES's
dialog: "Man in Santa Flan?"
dialog: 
text: Rick looks at his advisors--they look over at Linda Hunt,
text: then emphatically shake their heads "NO." Rick looks at
text: Hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. Rick breaks
text: into a big smile and gives Hertz his trademark thumbs up
dialog: sign.

dialog: 
scene_heading: X-RAY CHECKER
dialog: My kids just loved you in "Hey Dude
dialog: Three: The Final Countdown." We
dialog: need more wholesome role models

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Where the fuck is Ernie?
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We hear WOMEN'S SCREAMS. They turn towards the noise and see
text: a bunch of STEWARDESSES scattering from a trendy young cad
text: with a fake hand sticking out of his fly. This is ERNIE,
text: Rick's buddy and resident court jester.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Ladies! All I wanted was a
dialog: manicure! Yah-ha-ha!
dialog: (he sees Rick)
dialog: IT'S THE COOG!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
text: IT'S THE ERNIE! WOOF! WOOF!
speaker_heading: WOOF!
dialog: 
text: Rick pumps Ernie's third "hand." The miffed X-ray checker
text: points to Rick's large carry-on bag as it emerges from the X-

scene_heading: X-RAY CHECKER
speaker_heading: (TO RICK)
dialog: Mister Coogan, is this your bag?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah, why?
dialog: 
scene_heading: X-RAY CHECKER
dialog: Is this your kid?
dialog: 
text: He indicates the X-ray monitor, where we see the skeleton
text: outline of a BUCKTOOTHED, BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID curled
text: up in Rick's bag. The kid waves. Rick and Ernie look at
text: each other in horror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK/ERNIE
dialog: Stuey Gluck!
dialog: 
text: The bag bursts open, and out pops STUEY GLUCK, an obsessive
text: young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and
dialog: memorabilia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare
dialog: still from your high school
dialog: production of The Glass Menagerie!
dialog: Could you sign it for me?
dialog: Please?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: NO!
speaker_heading: (TO ERNIE)
dialog: Let's get the hell out of here!
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run
text: away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8
dialog: by 10 photo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: Rick! Wait up!
dialog: 
scene_heading: FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Rick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: Rick! Remember the speech you gave
dialog: at the Actors Forum for Social
dialog: Justice!?
dialog: 
text: He holds up a cassette player and hits play. It's Rick's old
dialog: speech.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE)

dialog: Leave me alone, troll!
speaker_heading: (TO ERNIE)
dialog: That was before I got an
dialog: entertainment lawyer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Quick, down here.
dialog: 
text: Ernie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway.
dialog: 
text: IN THE HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: It's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives
text: Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the
text: hallway. He holds up a Time magazine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's
dialog: dangerous. Why are you lending
dialog: your name to it? What's happened
dialog: to you, Rick? You used to be
dialog: good! And now... I just don't
dialog: know...
dialog: 
text: Stuey starts to cry. Rick looks guilty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BAM! A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full
text: speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody
dialog: murder.

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: ALRIGHT!

scene_heading: INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: A SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The
text: anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks
text: suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not
text: interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy
dialog: confidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
text: In the bag.
dialog: 
text: The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of
text: his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another
text: STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead
text: compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear
text: the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (V.0.)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your
text: captain speaking. To the right of
dialog: the aircraft, you can see a great

dialog: 
text: All the passengers crane their necks to the right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (V.0.)
text: And to the left you can see a panic-
text: stricken little troll.
dialog: 
text: Rick turns to his window and flings open the shade to
dialog: reveal...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: 
text: on the wing, pressing his face up against the glass. He's
text: holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something
dialog: we can't hear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHH!
dialog: 
text: Stuey loses his grip and is whisked off the wing. Rick

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Standing just outside the airport. A porter follows with
dialog: their bags.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sure glad that wasn't our plane.
dialog: 
text: Ernie nods. They're distracted by the sound of chanting.
text: They squint into the distance, where they see a group of
text: chanting PROTESTERS--young "Save the Earth" types, latter-day
dialog: hippies, kids, seniors, etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PROTESTERS
dialog: EES mustn't stay! Take your toxic
dialog: crap away! EES mustn't stay!

dialog: 
dialog: Some of their signs read--"Say No to Noxon!", "Coogan Go
dialog: Home", "EES is killing our Earth!", "Ricky Coogan Sucks Shit"
text: (this one held by a nice LITTLE GIRL), "I Like Ike" (held by
text: a confused OLD MAN, shuffling around aimlessly), "Drink
dialog: Pepsi" and finally...
dialog: 
text: "Free Nelson Mandela"--we WIDEN to reveal the subheading:
text: "Inside specially marked boxes." We keep WIDENING to reveal
text: that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal
text: some GUY is eating as he watches the protest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Jesus! We better find the limo
dialog: before these whale kissers chop us
dialog: up and sell us for parts.
dialog: (he spots the limo)
dialog: There it is.
dialog: 
text: Off to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo
text: with tinted windows (and plates that say NOT EES) awaits.
text: KEVIN, an EES exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly
text: at Ricky. The stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras
text: out the back window invitingly.
dialog: 
text: Ernie tries to grab Ricky by the arm, but he resists. He's
text: looking at the protesters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Wait a second...
dialog: 
dialog: His POV...
dialog: 
text: A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: 
text: standing in the center of the crowd of protesters, holding a
text: MEGAPHONE to her mouth and chanting. She puts down the
text: megaphone to rest, and we can see that she's powerfully
dialog: beautiful, in a no-nonsense feminist kind of way. This is
text: JULIE. Rick is smitten.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Forget them. I got a better idea.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Coog, those hippies'll tear us
dialog: apart.
dialog: 
text: Rick spots a HEAVILY BANDAGED MAN limping out of the airport
text: on crutches. Rick approaches him, waving a roll of bills.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hey, how'd you like to make a quick
dialog: hundred bucks?
dialog: 
text: The man mutters something weakly. Ernie puts his ear up
text: close to hear him better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: He says the pants don't usually
dialog: come off for less than two-fifty,
dialog: but since you're so cute, he'll
dialog: make an exception.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLIP TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 
text: buried beneath rolls and rolls of bandages, making his way
text: through the protesters on crutches. Ernie helps him along,
text: nervously. As Rick spots Julie from behind, he hands the
text: crutches over to Ernie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Here.
dialog: 
text: Ernie takes the crutches. Rick waves his arms dramatically,
text: clutches his bandaged legs, and winces in pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Help! Ow! Give me back my
dialog: crutches! You monster! Oh, the
dialog: pain! The agony!
dialog: 
text: He falls theatrically at Julie's feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Are you okay? Let me help you!
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Thanks. Don't worry about me.
dialog: What's one man's pain weighed
dialog: against the global injustice of
dialog: corporate tyrants like EES? Go.
dialog: The fight must continue.
dialog: 
text: Julie's buying it big time. She gazes deep into Rick's eyes.

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: 
text: Ernie sticks a hand out, grinning sarcastically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you.

text: grabs the crutches from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Ow! Hey!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Give me those, ape. Help him up.
dialog:

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Us? You're with him?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Sure.

speaker_heading: ERNIE

dialog: idea man myself. Like, let's say
dialog: there's a nuclear war, and the only
dialog: two people left are you and the
dialog: Pope... Would you pork him?
dialog: 
text: Disgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging

speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: But one thing's for sure. That

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: JULIE

text: SLATER CAN KISS MY ASS! YOU HEAR
dialog: ME?
dialog: 
text: Enraged, Rick rips the bandages off his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You think Slater could improv like
dialog: this? Make you believe he was an

speaker_heading: (DISTRACTED)
dialog: Human worm...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Right. A human worm. I mean,
dialog: that's just stupid. The point is--
dialog: 
text: Rick sees another billboard for the freak show. This one
text: features a half-man/half-dog creature and says "See the
dialog: Aztownding Dawg Boy!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Dog boy...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yeah, or a dog boy. That's absurd.
speaker_heading: BUT--
dialog: 
text: Another billboard. This one features the "Hidyous Frawg
dialog: Man."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
text: Hideous frog man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Okay, okay. Now you're just being
dialog: silly. Human suffering's just a
dialog: big joke to you, huh? You are
dialog: sick, Coogan!
dialog: 
text: She turns away from him in a huff and looks out her window.
text: She sees a billboard that reads "See The Hole Amazing Famly
text: of Freekz at Elijah C. Skuggs Famus Freek Land and Mutent
dialog: Emporeum!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Cool! A freak show! Let's check
dialog: it out!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Kind of like a family reunion for
dialog: you, huh?
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Lighten up, Coog, could be a goof.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. JUNGLE ROADWAY
dialog: 
text: The car turns into a driveway near a crude, hand painted sign
text: that says "FreekzTM--Thiss waey" with a messy arrow...
dialog: 
text: We ZOOM IN to the hand painted "small print" on the bottom of
dialog: the sign, which reads--"Freekz is a registered trademark of
dialog: Elijah C. Skuggs Enterprises. Any unauthorized reproduction
dialog: is strictly prohibited without prior written consent."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FREEKZ COMPOUND
dialog: 
text: The car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just
text: past a sizzling electric fence. Rick, Julie, and Ernie get
text: out and look around. It's eerily quiet.
dialog: 
text: There is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted
text: ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with
text: an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy
text: broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant
text: molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly
text: rotates on a creaky base.
dialog: 
text: Ernie looks hard at the big eyes. He turns away for a
text: second, then spins around again. The EYES are looking in a
text: different direction. Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a
dialog: chocolate bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Isn't it great? It's so "real"...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Real stupid.
speaker_heading: (TO ERNIE)
dialog: Let's go. This place is dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Yeah. Where are all the weirdos?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: There are no weirdos here.
dialog: 
text: Startled, they turn to see ELIJAH C. SKUGGS, a twisted,
text: haggard old man. He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone
text: which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino
text: cherry on top. Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary
text: eyes. We now realize the giant head is molded in his image.
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares,
dialog: definitely. Children of Hell and
text: twisted masses of living, breathing
dialog: tormented flesh, certainly. But as
dialog: for weirdos... not a one. Unless
dialog: of course you count me! Ha ha ha!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nah, you seem like a regular
dialog: dumbshit old redneck to me.
dialog: 
text: Elijah ignores him. Julie shoots him a look and smiles at
dialog: Elijah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: I'm Julie. And you are...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor
dialog: of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and
dialog: Mutant Emporium. But you knew
dialog: that. After all, you've ventured
text: miles away from civilization,
dialog: hospitals, telephones,
speaker_heading: (TO RICK)
dialog: police... How may I help-you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Drop dead.
dialog: 
text: Elijah smiles, unfazed. Julie glares at Rick. She smiles
text: apologetically at Elijah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: We'd like to see your freak show.
dialog: You see, only by appreciating the
dialog: variety and innovation of nature
dialog: can we come to respect the fragile
dialog: complexity of our global eco-
dialog: system.
dialog: 
text: Elijah nudges Ernie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: And you come to me looking for
dialog: weirdos?
dialog: 
text: Ernie shrugs. He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate
text: bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Hey! What the--
dialog: 
text: He looks behind him, and there--about ten feet away--is...
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A HULKING BALD MAN
dialog: 
text: warts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily.
dialog: This is TOAD.
dialog: 
text: Julie and Rick turn and see him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: (REPULSED)
dialog: Eeuuuwww...
dialog: (composes herself and
speaker_heading: WAVES)
dialog: Ahem. Hello.
dialog: 
text: Toad doesn't respond to her waves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As
dialog: for the show, I'm afraid the next
dialog: parade of deformity isn't until
dialog: tomorrow night...
dialog: 
text: Rick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed. They turn to
text: leave. Julie's sincerely upset.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh, just our luck...
dialog: 
text: Elijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: However! I do have a private
dialog: exhibit in my shed you might enjoy.
dialog: I don't usually share it with the
dialog: general public...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: We're deeply honored. But no
dialog: thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Yeah. We really must be--
dialog: 
text: He raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! He turns
text: to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily.
text: Hmmm. Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: The sideshow tradition has been
dialog: misrepresented by the media. You
dialog: don't traffic in human misery. You
dialog: show society the part of itself it
dialog: doesn't want to look at.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Yes... Yesm I see...
dialog: 
text: He looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says
dialog: "Where'd you find this nutty chick?"
dialog: 
text: Rick shrugs and follows, taking Ernie with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: What the heck. We'll see some
dialog: pickled dog brains, maybe some
dialog: pictures of women with, you know,
dialog: added equipment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And to think we could be in the
dialog: limo with those stewardesses.
dialog: 
text: Elijah holds the shed door open for them. It's pitch black
text: inside. Julie enters. Rick and Ernie follow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: What the hell, Coog, these people
dialog: are weird, but they seem nice
dialog: enough.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A CUTE BUNNY
dialog: 
text: sits outside the shed. THWAP! Toad lashes out with his ten
text: foot tongue, and sucks the bunny into his mouth. He shuffles
text: into the shed, crunching contentedly.
dialog: 
text: Elijah closes the shed doors in our face, grinning. we hear
text: a lonq peal of EVIL LAUGHTER from inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
scene_heading: AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! HE-HE-HE! HA-
scene_heading: HAHA! HE-HO-HE-HE-HA-HA! AH-HA-HA-

speaker_heading: HE-HE!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SHED
dialog: 
text: It's dark and spooky. Elijah stands in a pool of light,
text: reading a Family Circus cartoon in the funny pages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
text: HA-HE-HE-HE! God I love the Family
dialog: Circus! How do they do it day
dialog: after day? It's amazing.
dialog: 
text: He turns to...
dialog: 
scene_heading: RICK, JULIE, AND.ERNIE
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: as Toad finishes strapping them onto massive Frankenstein-
text: style operating tables. They struggle desperately against
speaker_heading: THE STRAPS
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (TO ELIJAH)
dialog: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Well, I guess they do use the same
dialog: joke over and over. I'm just a
dialog: sucker for that little moffet's
dialog: shenanigans, that's all.
dialog: (he tosses the funnies
speaker_heading: ASIDE)
dialog: But perhaps I should tell you a
dialog: little more about what I do. You
dialog: see, I not only exhibit freaks, I
dialog: make them. Just like Michelangelo
dialog: saw the angel in the stone, I look
text: at a guy like Kevin Costner and see
text: a giant peach grub who can fart the
dialog: Blue Danube!
dialog: (mops brow, asks
speaker_heading: OFFHANDEDLY)
dialog: Am I crazy or is it hot in here?
dialog: 
text: Rick, Julie, and Ernie shoot him a look that pretty well
text: answers his question. Elijah shrugs and goes back to his
dialog: spiel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Behold! The Tasty Freekz machine!
dialog: 
text: He pulls a tarp off a huge complicated machine. Several
text: drums and vats of various chemicals feed through a crude
text: network of pipes, gadgets and computers into an old Tasty
text: Freeze soft serve ice cream machine (The logo has been
text: changed to "Tasty Freekz"). The biggest vat reads "NOXON
dialog: 24."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: My God! He's using Noxon Twenty-
dialog: Four!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hey! You're not supposed to have
dialog: that stuff!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Oh? Well, I guess I'm not supposed
dialog: to have these either!
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He holds up a matching towel and washcloth embroidered with
text: the "Ramada Inn" logo. Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp. He
text: tosses the towels.
dialog: 
text: As Elijah gets worked up into a frenzy, the ambience in the
text: room becomes more and more horrific: the sunlight is replaced
text: by an eerie green glow, a thunderstorm rumbles to life, a
text: raven perches on the windowsill, a rat scurries across the
text: floor, one of those plastic "Bony Banks" reaches out and
dialog: grabs a quarter...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: I need only punch a few buttons on
dialog: this magnificent device, and it
dialog: gives me an easy-to-apply ointment
dialog: that will mutate a perfect young
text: body, bubble its skin, warp its
text: bones and twist its guts into AN
scene_heading: UNSPEAKABLY REPULSIVE, STOMACH-
text: TURNING FREAK OF MY OWN DESIGN!
dialog: 
text: Elijah's hair is now standing on end. He's foaming at the
text: mouth. A bolt of lightning and THUNDERCLAP cap the
dialog: monologue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Wait a minute. Does this mean
dialog: we're not going to see a show?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
speaker_heading: (IGNORES HER)
dialog: Toad, fire up that machine, and
dialog: let's turn these hapless asswipes
dialog: into monstrosities!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK, JULIE, ERNIE
speaker_heading: (TOGETHER)
text: AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Now let's see. Who wants to get
dialog: freaked first?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: (points at Julie)
dialog: Ladies first!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Go screw yourself!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: If I were you, I would!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Hmmmm.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Toad is adjusting some knobs on the machine. Elijah steps
text: past him to a jerry-rigged computer console. He punches some
text: keys and some rotating DNA models appear on the monitor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: (mumbling to himself)
dialog: It's like Yin and Yang... AC/DC...
dialog: two birds with one stone... Yeah,
dialog: it's pretty darn good, really...
dialog: 
text: He presses "enter" and the computer beeps. He smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Let 'er rip, Toad!
dialog: 
text: Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life.
text: Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish
text: with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes,
text: exposing their sides, and pushes them close together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Wait a second. You're really gonna
dialog: smear that stuff on us and mutate
dialog: our body parts!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Correct.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Well... then could you give me a
dialog: really big rodney?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: I'm a mad scientist pal, not a
dialog: miracle worker.
dialog: 
text: Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their
text: skin begins to bubble and undulate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE/ERNIE
dialog: Oh God!... No!... Holy shit!
speaker_heading: (ETC)
dialog: 
text: A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another
text: on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized
text: dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and
text: melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin
text: continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up under
speaker_heading: THE SKIN:
dialog: 
text: Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore...
dialog: 
text: The Pepsi logo--"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation"...
text: Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which
dialog: then takes the form of...
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Demon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY. Gumby's
text: got his back to camera. He's grabbing his crotch and
text: flipping everyone off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Gumby! Put that thing away!
dialog: 
text: Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE/ERNIE
dialog: 
text: joined side to side, their two heads on a single body which
text: is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah
text: wheels a large mirror in front of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Feast your eyes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: NOOOOO!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Well, at least I'll never have to
dialog: go far for a piece of tail.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Pig!
dialog: 
text: She SMACKS him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Ouch! I was just trying to keep
dialog: things light. Oh God! Why me!?
dialog: 
text: He starts blubbering uncontrollably. Toad drags them towards
text: the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Mother always said there'd be days
dialog: like this. And I thought she was
dialog: nuts!
dialog: 
text: They exit. Elijah turns to Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: (gestures to Julie/Ernie)
dialog: A mere party trick. But you,
dialog: you're gonna be special.
dialog: 
text: Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching
dialog: keys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (GETS TOUGH)
dialog: Let me go, Skuggs, or else!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: I got some RICK(cont'd)
dialog: friends that'll come
dialog: down here and mess you up bad,
dialog: homey!
text: (Elijah chuckles. Rick
dialog: tries a different
speaker_heading: APPROACH)
dialog: I got some other friends who can
dialog: score you box seats at the
dialog: Superbowl, no problem.
speaker_heading: (ANOTHER FAILURE)
dialog: YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF,
dialog: YOU FUCKIN' APE?!
dialog: (switches gears again)
dialog: You ever had a hot fudge bath with
dialog: Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna]
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
scene_heading: (LOOKS UP--INTERESTED)
dialog: You know her?
dialog: 
text: Rick nods hopefully. Elijah considers it for a moment, then
text: frowns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Ah, screw it. I'd never get
dialog: anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP
text: THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE!
dialog: 
text: Toad starts the machine. Elijah pulls the lever and
text: dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment. He carries it
text: towards Rick, leering maniacally.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: For years I've strived to create
dialog: the ultimate monster. The first of
dialog: a whole new generation of
dialog: superfreaks! Now I've finally got
dialog: you, the perfect subject--a real
speaker_heading: asshole! HA-HA-
text: (he pauses and looks
dialog: closer at Rick)
dialog: Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy
dialog: from "Hey Dude Three-The
dialog: Beguiling?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah, that's me!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: You were great in that picture! Oh
dialog: well, I guess for the next one
dialog: they'll have to get Christian
scene_heading: Slater! HA-HA-HA!
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Elijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE LAB - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big

dialog: 
text: Extreme close-up of Rick's eye as it opens, and searches the
text: room frantically. Close-up of Rick's hand--a normal hand--
text: straining at the bonds.
dialog: 
text: RICK's POV groggily searches the lab, and picks up the
text: blurred image of Elijah in the distance. He's on the phone,
text: speaking in hushed tones.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: This is Red Swan. May I speak to
dialog: the Laughing Man?... Yes, I'll
dialog: hold.
dialog: 
text: For a moment, Elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune
text: of "Freak Out," by Chic. A man's laughing voice comes on the
text: other end of the line. It laughs throughout the
dialog: "conversation".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Laughing Man? Red Swan. I've done
dialog: it! I found the perfect subject--
dialog: huge ego, shallow personality,
dialog: almost no moral values... A
dialog: lawyer? No, better. An actor.
dialog: Yeah, the guy from those hilarious
dialog: "Hey Dude" movies! Hahahaha--
dialog: 
text: Laughing man has stopped laughing. Elijah dummies up.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
speaker_heading: (SHEEPISHLY)
dialog: Well, I liked 'em.
dialog: 
text: Laughing man resumes laughing. Elijah listens intently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Right... Yes... Yes, I see...
dialog: But that's just it. He's not
dialog: quite, uh, finished. I need more
dialog: Noxon so I can--
dialog: 
text: Laughing Man laughs so loudly Elijah has to hold the phone
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
speaker_heading: (ASIDE)
dialog: Geez, what a grouch.
dialog: 
text: Over on the slab, Rick groans. He's waking up. Elijah
dialog: notices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: (to Laughing man)
dialog: Laughing Man? I have to go. What
dialog: about the Noxon? Two days? Great,
dialog: you can see everything then...
dialog: Yeah, you take it easy too.
dialog: 
text: Elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
text: Wakey, wakey. Time to meet and
dialog: greet the new you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
text: He flips the slab right-side up, and holds up a mirror.
text: Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new
text: form. Rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous,
dialog: bug-eyed monster!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LAB - MORNING
dialog: 
text: BANG! The doors fly open. Elijah drags Rick out.
text: Horrified, Rick clutches the monster side of his face.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh God! This was my good side!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Still is if you ask me! Hell, even
dialog: half-done, you'll be the star of
dialog: the show tonight.
dialog: 
text: Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Welcome to your spacious
dialog: accommodations.
dialog: 
text: He unlocks the door and drags Rick in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OUTHOUSE
dialog: 
text: Oddly, the interior is a vast barracks, fifty feet long and
text: thirty feet high. Rick looks around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (IMPRESSED)
dialog: Great use of the space.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: I learned it all from Bob Vila.
dialog: 
text: BOB VILA walks up next to Elijah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: You know you could expose those
text: rustic beams and put in a skylight
dialog: over one weekend, Elijah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Give it a rest, Bob!
dialog: 
text: He pushes Bob away into the freak house, gives Rick a goodbye
text: wink and walks out the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OUTHOUSE
dialog: 
text: Elijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: One of these days I gotta put a
dialog: shitter in there.
dialog: 
text: Bob Vila steps out of nowhere again, holding a Time-Life
dialog: book.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOB
dialog: No problem. It's all here in my
dialog: Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah.
dialog: And you pay nothing for thirt--
dialog: 
text: BONK! Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer
text: from his tool belt.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FREAK HOUSE
dialog: 
text: It takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim
text: light. There's nobody in sight. The walls are lined with
text: dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like
text: prison cells. Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ernie? Julie?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Over here, Coog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Are you alright?
dialog: 
text: Rick sees the vague outline of JulieErnie a few yards away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: I know that voice. That's the
dialog: voice that said,
speaker_heading: (MIMICS)
dialog: "Cool, a freak show. Let's check
dialog: it out!"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: What!? Oh sure, blame the woman.
dialog: Typical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (MIMICS)
dialog: "It's so real." Is this real
dialog: enough for you? I'm friggin'
dialog: Quasimodo!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Chill out, Coog. You're talking to
dialog: the original tag team of ugly
text: pukes. Step into the light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Okay, here I come.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Rick steps forward into a pool of light. Julie and Ernie are
text: caught by surprise. Julie struggles to keep her composure.
text: Ernie's repulsed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: ULP!
dialog: 
text: Ernie turns away and pukes on the floor. Julie soldiers on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh geez... It's not so (GULP)
dialog: revolting. After all, physical
dialog: beauty is just a socially-enforced
dialog: myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI
dialog: 
text: Julie turns away and pukes on the floor.

speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (OFFENDED)
dialog: Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas
dialog: yourself. You're lucky I've got a
dialog: strong stomach!

speaker_heading: VOICE (O.C.)
dialog: And you're lucky I don't BITE you!
dialog: Heh heh heh heh ...
dialog: 
text: Rick wheels around to see JUAN THE DOG BOY, snickering behind

dialog: I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of
dialog: the freaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (walks up to them)
dialog: Kind of the "top dog."
dialog: 
text: Juan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake?
dialog: 
text: He extends a hand to Rick. Rick doesn't take it. He hears a
text: slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles, and
text: turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House.
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No thanks. I don't plan on staying
dialog: long. How many of you are there in
dialog: here anyway?
dialog: 
text: Juan shrugs mischievously and sticks his snout in Rick's
dialog: face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: First, I have a question for you,
dialog: Ricardo. Who starred in the film
dialog: "International Velvet?"
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Well, perhaps we should ask the
dialog: Worm!
dialog: 
text: The top right cubicle lights up, revealing the WORM. He is a
text: man with no arms and legs, and the wrinkly, slimy body of a
text: worm. His face is learned-looking, with spectacles, a small
text: goatee, and a pipe which he puffs on pompously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Tell us, Worm, who starred in
dialog: "International Velvet?"
dialog: 
text: He puffs pensively on his pipe for a second.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE WORM
dialog: Yes, yes ... very interesting...
dialog: International Velvet... The
dialog: perfectly appalling sequel to
dialog: National Velvet, I believe. No
dialog: dramatic verisimilitude whatsoever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Yes, Worm. But who was the star?
dialog: 
text: The worm takes a long, thoughtful drag on his pipe...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: Olivia DeHavilland.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Olivia DeHavilland... Rick, do you
dialog: agree or disagree?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: This is nuts. This is crazy...
dialog: Besides, it was Tatum O'Neill.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Very good. It was Tatum O'Neill,
dialog: now married to tennis star John
text: McEnroe. Circle gets the square.
dialog: 
text: The lights come on in 9 of the center cubicles, silhouetting
text: 9 freaks in a full size HOLLYWOOD SQUARES 3 x 3 layout. The
text: FREAKS applaud Rick's success. He's incredulous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OTHER FREAKS
dialog: Yayyy!
dialog: 
text: Worm nudges an "0" into place in his cubicle, with some
text: difficulty. He's not happy about being proved wrong.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: Blast. O'Neill ... No talent
dialog: ragamuffin...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: okay, JulieErnie, your turn. Who's
dialog: it going to be?
dialog: 
text: As Juan names the freaks one by one, their square is
text: highlighted, and they wave at Rick cheerily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nosey the Nose Man!
dialog: 
text: NOSEY is a man whose massive nose dominates his head. He
text: blows into a huge hanky, and waves it wearily at Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN (CONTD)
dialog: Cowboy!
dialog: 
text: COWBOY is a young boy with cow-like features, a cowboy hat,
text: cowboy clothes, and a full set of udders.

speaker_heading: JUAN (CONT-D)
dialog: The Bearded Lady!
dialog: 
text: The BEARDED LADY is a big, tough, bearded man--in a blouse.

speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Rosie the Pinhead!
dialog:

text: jammed into a sexy dress. She smokes a cigarette demurely,
text: and waves a small, arrogant big-star wave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: The hideous Frog Man!
dialog: 
text: Frogman is just a guy in a scuba outfit. He strikes a
text: threatening "monster" pose, then gives a friendly wave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: And of course, in the center
dialog: square, Mr. Paul Lynde!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the lighting changes to flashing red horror lights
text: with plenty of dark shadows. There's a horrific MUSIC STING
text: and we ZOOM IN to a DECOMPOSING SKELETON in the center
text: cubicle. Its eyeball drips out of the socket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Well JulieErnie, who will it be?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go
dialog: with Paul Lynde.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Don't be an idiot.
dialog: 
text: They argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3
text: Stooges style. Juan turns to Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: You see, Rick? Just because we're
dialog: freaks doesn't mean we can't have
dialog: some fun, huh?
dialog: 
text: Rick is overwhelmed by it all. He backs away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Get away from me. Get away! I'm
dialog: not like you. You hear me? I'm
dialog: Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK!

scene_heading: ANOTHER AREA OF THE FREAK HOUSE--A LITTLE LATER
dialog: 
text: Rick sits in a corner, pondering his fate. Oddly, there's a
text: shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak
text: House. JulieErnie approach him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Okay Coog, so I get twenty four
dialog: hour access to T `n' A, and you
text: look like a plate of rancid
dialog: giblets. We're still pals, right?
dialog: 
text: Rick shoots him a look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: All the freaks have gone through
dialog: this anguish, Rick. At first, I
dialog: was blinded by my anger. I admit
dialog: it. I wanted to break your neck
dialog: for getting me into this. But I
dialog: got over it. Juan taught me to
dialog: channel my anger for the common
dialog: good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: It was your fault, anyway. You
dialog: wanted to see the freak show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: (FURIOUS)
dialog: I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP!
dialog: 
text: She tries to wring his neck. Ernie helps. Rick glares at
dialog: Ernie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ernie!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second
dialog: there, I was a total man-hater.
dialog: Weird.
dialog: 
text: Julie regains her cool. She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles
text: something on it, and hands it to Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Here. Take it.
dialog: 
text: Rick examines the cover. He reads it aloud.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: "So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak--
dialog: Now What?"
dialog: 
text: There's an "8" scribbled on the pamphlet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: we're in cubicle eight. Maybe
dialog: later you'll be ready to talk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Forget it. Not me. I'm not like
dialog: those other god-forsaken animals.
dialog: 
text: He throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm,
text: Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach. They sit down in a
text: circle around him. The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and
text: puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: You're mistaken, Rick. You are
dialog: exactly like us. We were all
dialog: normal healthy folk before we made
dialog: the fateful mistake of visiting

speaker_heading: WORM (V.O.)
dialog: I was a professor of lacrophylogy--
dialog: er, the study of worms, of course.
dialog: I came in search of the
dialog: Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman
dialog: terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr.
dialog: Skuggs said he had just such a worm
dialog: in his shed. How could I have
dialog: surmised that the specimen and I
dialog: would ultimately prove to be one
dialog: and the same?
dialog: 
text: We see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the

dialog: At first, the transformation was
dialog: fabulous. I truly understood the
dialog: worm's ethos like never before.
dialog: But those early days of fascination
dialog: are over. Now, in retrospect, I
dialog: think the whole thing is a fucking
dialog: headache. I'd sell my soul just to

scene_heading: INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY
dialog:

dialog: Darkness.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. FREAKLAND - THEN

scene_heading: INT. FREAK HOUSE - NOW
dialog: 
text: Everyone looks at the hammer sympathetically. Rick turns

speaker_heading: WORM

dialog: Whether you admit it or not. It's
dialog: irrefutable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yeah. Says you.

dialog: 
text: He spots the pamphlet on the ground, picks it up, dusts it

dialog: It's Fun Being Ugly!"...
dialog: 
text: Rick closes the pamphlet, looks at the number "8" Julie

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: not Ernie's. It's Juan.
dialog: 
text: Rick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juan's belly. He
text: licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight. Ernie
text: is reading "The Woman's Room," trying not to notice all of
dialog: this.
dialog:

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well that EES guy should rescue me

speaker_heading: STUEY GLUCK (V.O.)

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: AHH! A phantom troll!
dialog: 
text: He swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps

speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: Sounds to me like you've developed
dialog: a telepathic bond. Don't mean yer

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, let's see. I've been

dialog: freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A.,
dialog: and this dialogue makes "Hey Dude

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM

dialog: 
text: Rosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEARDED LADY
dialog: If your coloring is in the autumn

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: He's got a hand under there!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOMEONE ELSE
dialog: It's a hoax!
dialog:

speaker_heading: ONSTAGE

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Now is the winter of our

dialog: looking glass,
dialog: I, that am curtailed of this fair
dialog: proportion,
text: Cheated of feature by dissembling
dialog: nature,
dialog: 
text: The audience is riveted. Even Spanish-speaking peasants are
text: mouthing the words. Elijah, however, thumbs through his
text: script, totally confused. The freaks watch through the bars
text: from the wings--completely engrossed, especially Julie. Juan
text: notices this and pulls her closer to him, but she pushes him

scene_heading: {BECAUSE I'M UGLY}

dialog: romantic potential. NOTE: We will insert an almost
text: subliminal one-frame shot of the Pepsi logo at this

dialog: 
text: Kevin, the EES executive from the airport scene, walks into
text: the tent. Rick sees him and gasps with joy. He leaps off

speaker_heading: KEVIN
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLES SNIDELY)
dialog: I'm saying you're ugly enough to

dialog: laughter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISTAIR COOKE
scene_heading: AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ!
dialog: 
text: Rick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering

dialog: 
scene_heading: RICK'S MONSTER EYE
dialog: 
text: springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage.
text: His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body
text: with violent intensity. He grabs Kevin's head and screams in
text: a new, monstrous voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: EAT SHIT!
dialog: 
text: POP! He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft.
text: The head stares down at Rick in disbelief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KEVIN'S HEAD
dialog: Now you're just being childish.
dialog: 
text: Rick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits.

speaker_heading: CROWD

speaker_heading: HERE!
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. FREAK HOUSE - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Rick awakens with a start and gets up. He approaches
text: JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly
text: playing a game of "Wheel of Fortune." The cubicles contain
text: large blank blocks, like the "letters" on the game show. So

speaker_heading: NOSEY
dialog: I'd like to buy a vowel.
dialog:

dialog: Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?
dialog: 
text: Juan advances towards Rick, sneering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: So. Now you don't mind mixing with
dialog: us--how did you say it--sorry
dialog: mutants?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Look! I'm sorry for what happened
dialog: at the show. Can't you just forget
dialog: it?
dialog: 
text: He shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a
text: human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off,
text: embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the
dialog: silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about
dialog: your big escape plan?
dialog: 
text: Juan gives Ernie a nasty "shut up" look. He growls at him.

speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Well, excuse me for living.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
text: Juan's plan is really ingenious

speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: I figured out that our escape does
dialog: not include the Beast Boy. No one
dialog: may discuss the plan with him,
dialog: understand?
dialog: 
text: Juan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble
dialog: agreement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What's the matter with all of you?
dialog: You trust your lives to a guy just

speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Rick, wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked.
dialog: Believe me, it ain't all it's
dialog: cracked up to be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: This isn't one of your dumb movies,
dialog: Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a
dialog: smart dog. I'll talk to him.
dialog: Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't
dialog: do it without us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Forget it! I don't need you, EES,

dialog: here all by myself, you... you.,.
dialog: crud sucking pus monkeys!
dialog: 
text: DING DING DING! The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board
text: light up, and ROSIE turns them over to reveal "Crud Sucking
text: Pus Monkeys" as the secret phrase. Everyone claps despite
text: themselves. Juan stares them down. They stop.
dialog: 
text: Rick storms off in a huff. Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes
text: deep into her eyes. He kisses her passionately. Julie is
text: watching Rick leave. Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her
text: attention. She scratches Juan behind his ear. His leg
text: instinctively kicks the air. Ernie looks worried.

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk
dialog: the world's biggest breasted woman

speaker_heading: RICK
text: (in a lusty womanish
speaker_heading: VOICE)

dialog: Geez. I don't care if Elijah did

dialog: Hey, what the--
dialog:

text: complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
text: He looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling
text: casually. He notices something. It's ...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE GIANT ELIJAH HEAD
dialog: 
text: Its big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter

text: "YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY: PEPSI") Rick gets to the truck
text: and tries the door. It's locked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: He looks over at the giant head. The eyes are still staring
text: at him--they seem to have shifted. Rick shrugs it off and
text: looks around. He walks over to Elijah's car. It's locked
text: too. He checks the big eyes. They've moved again.
dialog: 
text: Rick's getting a bit desperate. He sees something else and
text: runs towards it. It's a dry-docked motorboat. It's locked
text: too. The eyes have followed Rick again. He sees something
text: else and runs over to it. It's a bag of golf clubs leaning
text: against Elijah's porch. They're locked too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Damn! This guy doesn't trust
dialog: anybody!
dialog: 
text: He looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only

dialog: 
scene_heading: TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS
dialog:

speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Uh-huh. And then they told two

speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for

speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Bye-bye. And remember, try another
dialog: escape, and I'll feed your balls to
dialog: Toad.
dialog: 
text: As he walks towards the Freak House, Rick pulls out the note
text: he pocketed. A gust of wind blows it away from him. He
text: chases it behind the carnival tent where...
dialog: 
text: KKCCLIINNK! He runs into ELEVEN PHONY MILKMEN, backing their
text: way around the corner, each carrying their own six-pack of
text: milkbottles. Startled, they turn around. Why, it's the
dialog: freaks! And they're all dressed as milkmen! Cowboy carries
text: the hammer, who's dressed in a little milkman suit as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEARDED LADY
dialog: Hey Rick, I thought you were gonna
dialog: come up with your own escape plan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (TO JUAN)
dialog: This is your big plan? A dozen
dialog: milkmen? Isn't that a little
dialog: unusual?
dialog: 
text: Juan hadn't thought of this. He pushes himself forward and
text: confronts Rick viciously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Twelve milkmen is theoretically
dialog: possible. Thirteen is silly.
dialog: Looks like one milkman too many,
dialog: Coogan.
dialog: 
text: He pushes Rick aside. The freaks continue past him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Fine then. Go ahead. Hope you
dialog: like reggae, ya flea bitten
dialog: bastard.
dialog: 
text: Rick watches as the Freaks approach the open courtyard, where
text: he knows the Eyeballs will spot them.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
text: Julie glances at him a second, then looks away. His mind
text: made up, Rick takes a deep breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ah, shit.
dialog: 
text: He runs over to the Freaks. He stands in Juan's way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Look, you'll all be killed. You
dialog: don't know about Elijah's giant
text: Rasta eyeballs with machine guns...
dialog: (they think he's nuts)
dialog: It's suicide! I can't let you do
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: And I can't let you stop us.
dialog: 
text: This is it. Rick and Juan square off. Juan growls and bares
text: his teeth. Rick's MONSTER EYE starts to glow and pulse
text: dimly. They circle each other. The others are transfixed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH'S POV
dialog: 
text: He peers through a side window, and sees the pack of milkmen
text: cheering two of their coworkers, locked in mortal combat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: That's a lot of milkmen on the same
dialog: route. No wonder they fight.
dialog: 
text: Juan rears back, about to lunge, when suddenly he freezes and
text: looks off into the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A SQUIRREL
dialog: 
text: is sitting innocently a few yards off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Squirrel!
dialog: 
text: He zooms off after the squirrel. The Eyes pop out of the
text: giant head and follow after him, Uzis FIRING. Juan dodges
text: their bullets and disappears after his prey.
dialog: 
text: The freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after a
text: pesky rodent. They turn to Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOSEY
dialog: Wow, giant Rasta eyeballs, just
dialog: like Rick said.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SOCKHEAD

dialog: 
text: Julie's hurt. She doesn't even smack Ernie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You know how men are. Besides, it
dialog: was a pretty good looking squirrel.
dialog: 
text: Julie looks at Rick. She sees he's trying to be helpful, not
dialog: sarcastic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Come on. You heard the Beast Boy.
text: Back to the Freak House, now.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes meet Rick's. She manages a smile, and Rick smiles

text: head back to the Freak House.

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: (TO EVERYONE)

speaker_heading: NOSEY

text: Sockhead nods again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: If we can get into Elijah's lab,
dialog: maybe we can--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: Of course! Design a super freak of
dialog: our own and manipulate the genetic
dialog: code to make him destroy Elijah
dialog: instead of us! Brilliant!

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh. Well--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BEARDED LADY
dialog: But how do we get to the lab?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Um, maybe--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: Right! The worm could dig a
dialog: tunnel!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: By God, it's so crazy it might just
dialog: work!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: But you need Noxon 24 to make the
dialog: freaking sludge, and Elijah told us
text: himself he's run out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I
dialog: was going to say was--
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Yes! Exactly! If they've been
dialog: using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer
dialog: here, the entire ecosystem must be
dialog: soaked with it! All we need is a
dialog: way to extract it from the
text: vegetation, ideally into a liquid
dialog: form.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Right. Well, what about--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: Golly! So that's why my milk comes

dialog: think of such a plan?
dialog: 
text: Rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for Sea
dialog: Monkeys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, actually, I was going to
dialog: suggest we send away for sea
dialog: monkeys, train them to fire guns,
dialog: and make a break for it. But if

text: The Worm rushes over to the container of glop below the
text: spigot, and without hesitation, plunges his face into it!
text: Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror!
dialog: 
text: The WORM lifts his glop-smeared face out of the bowl, and
text: smacks his lips in delight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: Ah! You don't need Noxon to make
dialog: Butterscotch pudding. I just
dialog: wanted to test the machine's
dialog: capabilities. Mmmm! Glorious! So
dialog: creamy! Yum!
dialog: 
text: The Worm is lost in his pudding-induced reverie. They ignore

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Hang on, Rick. Do you really think
dialog: we should put this toxic glop on
dialog: you? What if it doesn't work?
dialog: What if something goes wrong? What
dialog: IF--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: If it does work, do you think
dialog: there'll be enough left over to
dialog: give me a monster size rodney?
dialog: 
text: Julie goes to doink Ernie in the eyes, but he uses the
text: classic "Three Stooges" handblock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (TO ERNIE)
dialog: Here, hold this.
dialog: 
text: Rick hands the container of Noxon to Ernie. Julie gives him

dialog: the Noxon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: (TO ERNIE)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (to Julie, heroically)
dialog: Look, I've been a freak all my

speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE

speaker_heading: WORM

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Hey! In case you haven't noticed,
dialog: I'm about to commit a noble and

dialog: 
text: Rick pounds the table, sending a glass beaker flying. It

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELIJAH'S DEN
dialog: 
text: Elijah's in his robe, watching the opening of "Crooked Cops"

scene_heading: INT. LAB
dialog:

text: innocently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oops.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Okay. Let's do what we came to do,
dialog: and this time, no more screw ups.
dialog:

text: of those desktop paper pins. He SCREAMS in agony.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELIJAH'S DEN
dialog: 
text: Elijah's watching an old war movie--a soldier is running

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LAB
dialog: 
text: Julie has her hand over Rick's mouth, silencing his scream.
text: He calms down. He gingerly slides the pin out of his hand,
text: grimacing but not making a sound. He sighs with relief. The
text: coast seems clear. Then, in SLOW MOTION, his hand knocks a
text: styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground.
dialog: 75.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ELIJAH'S DEN
dialog:

text: Suddenly, his ears perk up, and his head swivels around
text: towards the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Styrofoam cup?
dialog: 
text: He puts on his "smiley face" robe and bunny slippers and
text: heads out the door.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No. Here goes.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Somebody's comin'! Hurry.

speaker_heading: RICK

scene_heading: INT. LAB

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Here it comes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE LAB DOORKNOB

speaker_heading: ELIJAH

speaker_heading: IN THE LAB
dialog:

speaker_heading: IN THE LAB

speaker_heading: WORM

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You go ahead. I'll catch up.

speaker_heading: JULIE
speaker_heading: BUT--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Go!
dialog: 77.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
dialog: 
text: Elijah is still having trouble with his grip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE LAB
dialog: 
text: Rick pops the plastic lid onto the Pepsi cup, and climbs into
text: the hole. He rests the cup on the floor and lifts the floor
text: board over his head. The RUMBLING gets louder as the tunnel
text: walls start to crumble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Rick! Come on!
dialog: 
text: Rick is losing his balance as the ground shifts beneath him.
text: He sways, and knocks the Pepsi cup of sludge rolling. He
text: watches, helpless, as it rolls across the floor and comes to
text: a stop across the room. For a second, he contemplates making
dialog: a dash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OUTSIDE
dialog: 
text: Elijah has wrapped his shirt tails around the knob, and
text: finally has a good grip. He twists the knob...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INSIDE
dialog: 
text: Rick sees the door opening. He dives down into the hole.
text: The floor board falls into place just as Elijah walks in.
dialog: 
text: Elijah scans the room. He goes over towards the Tasty Freekz
text: machine and finds the styrofoam cup.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Bad for the environment.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FREAK COMPOUND
dialog: 
text: The "antfarm view" again. We see the freaks running back
text: through the tunnel as it caves in behind them. Toad sits on

text: and spits up a propeller.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FREAK HOUSE
dialog: 
text: The freaks wait by the mouth of the tunnel. We hear the

speaker_heading: WORM

speaker_heading: RICK

speaker_heading: NOSEY

text: The freaks are horrified.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOSEY
dialog: 
text: turns to them guiltily in SLOW-MOTION. His voice is slowed

speaker_heading: NOSEY
dialog: I... buried... Paul.
dialog: 
text: Back to normal speed.

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: This is no time to lament over a

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: But we left it in the lab.

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: But wait! I found some macaroons!

text: helicopter... He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: RICK'S POV. EXT. FREAKLAND - DAY
dialog: 
text: An EES corporate helicopter touches down. A few gun-toting
text: SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out. They
text: check that the coast is clear, then give the signal. Out
text: steps Richard Hertz. He mutters something to one of the
text: security guys, and walks towards the Freak House.
dialog: 
text: IN THE FREAK HOUSE
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: I don't believe it. What's Hertz
dialog: doin' here?
dialog: 
text: The door to the Freak House opens. Hertz enters, unzips his
text: fly. Finding no toilet, he shrugs and relieves himself on
text: the floor. Rick steps out of the shadows towards him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
text: So EES is in bed with Elijah C.
dialog: Skuggs, eh? Figures.
dialog: 
text: Hertz is momentarily startled by Rick. He collects himself.

speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Rick! Thank God I got to you in

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Cut the crap, Hertz.
dialog: 
text: Hertz relieves himself as he talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Ricky, you have no idea how your
dialog: misfortune has touched our hearts.
dialog: When you disappeared we almost gave
dialog: up hope. But we'd heard reports of
dialog: Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon,
dialog: and when the story broke in the
dialog: tabloids, I decided to personally
dialog: come down and get to the bottom of
dialog: things.
dialog:

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
scene_heading: AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE
scene_heading: HO HO HO HA HA HA HA!
dialog: 
text: The cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as
text: he realizes... Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out
text: the door. Rick looks after him, stunned.
dialog: 
text: We hear a nearby SNORE cut off, and the Human Torch stands up
text: from the spot where Hertz relieved himself. He's dripping
text: wet and no longer on fire. He sniffs his soaked, smoldering
dialog: clothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TORCH
dialog: Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That
dialog: really pisses me off!
dialog: 
text: POOF! He catches fire again and walks off. Rick is doing a
text: slow burn, still looking after Hertz. He erupts and his
text: monster eye glows briefly. He screams in anguish.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: AAARRGGGGHH!
dialog: 
text: Dejected, Rick leans against the wall. JulieErnie walk up
text: behind him. Julie puts a hand on Rick's shoulder to comfort
text: him. As they look into each other's eyes, a loud CRASH
text: distracts them. Rick peers through the crack.
dialog: 81.

speaker_heading: RICK'S POV
dialog:

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Holy shit.
dialog: 
text: A forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks,

text: prop him up and push him back into place.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. LAB - DAY
dialog: 
text: Elijah switches on the lights, and turns to face his

speaker_heading: ELIJAH

speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: No need to use codenames, Elijah.
dialog: We're all friends here. And just
dialog: to prove it, I brought you a little
dialog: present.
dialog: 
text: Hertz snaps his fingers and nods to a security guy, who

speaker_heading: ELIJAH

speaker_heading: RICK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: So, where were we?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Gentlemen, I'm not going to
dialog: bullshit you. I know my setup here
text: at Freakland looks like small

text: He pulls the cover off a small scale model of Freakland,
text: about ten inches high. It shows the stage, lab, outhouse,
dialog: the head, everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: But thanks to your Noxon and my
dialog: genius, tonight I will turn Ricky
dialog: Coogan into a freak so hideous,
dialog: it'll be enough to turn your

dialog: (the EES men shift
speaker_heading: UNCOMFORTABLY)
text: It's the dawning of a new age for
dialog: us all. Behold, Super Mega Freak

scene_heading: INT. LAB
dialog:

dialog: 
text: BILL BLAZER, a slick and dashing EES marketing executive,

text: him, not even noticing he's there.
dialog: 
text: Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and
text: replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit
text: Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a
dialog: little hurt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: What does today's businessman want?
dialog: How about a receptionist with six

dialog: figure? That'd sure speed things
dialog: up, wouldn't it?
dialog: 
text: With a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi-
text: limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different
text: phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once.
dialog: 
text: Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the
text: back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,

speaker_heading: (HE CHUCKLES)
dialog: Sure! It's what we all dream of!
dialog: 
text: The EES guys all nod along. Except for the workmen, who

dialog: of it all.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and

speaker_heading: BILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon

speaker_heading: HERTZ

speaker_heading: ELIJAH

speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Take the tape off your mouth,
dialog: idiot! They didn't tie your hands!
dialog: 
text: Stuey realizes this is true, and pulls the tape off his
dialog: mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: I got the cup, Rick!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Great! There's no time to waste.
dialog: Are you being followed?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: Yeah. But if I don't move, they
dialog: won't see me.
dialog: 
text: Two big EES security guys are standing watching Stuey's odd
text: behavior. They pick him up and carry him away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: Riiiick!
dialog: 
text: Rick sees this all in his holographic image. It fades.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What a geek.
dialog: 
text: He turns to the other freaks, who've woken up and are
text: gathered around on the floor. Rick shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Stuey got caught. There's no way
dialog: to get the ointment before the
dialog: show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: So, that's it then? We're all to
dialog: die... And by your hand no less.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No. It won't be me. It's some
dialog: inhuman monster Elijah used me to
dialog: create. As for me, the real me,
dialog: I'll always be your friend. Before
dialog: I have to rip your heads off, I'd
dialog: like to say goodbye to each of you.
dialog: (He turns to Worm.)
dialog: Worm... I'll miss your brains, the
dialog: smell of your pipe, and the funny
dialog: way you always go on talking until
dialog: everyone wants to strangle you.
dialog: 
text: He pats the Worm on the head tenderly, and turns to Cowboy.
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: Hi, Rick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Cowboy, I'll miss your good humor,
dialog: your down-home wisdom, and of
dialog: course, the frothy milkshakes were
dialog: udderly delicious, heh-heh...
dialog: 
text: He smiles and playfully tugs Cowboy's udder. He turns to the
dialog: Bearded Lady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Bearded... Lady... I dunno.
dialog: We'll always have Paris...
dialog: 
text: Bearded lady is kind of confused, Rick shrugs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nosey, I never really liked you.
dialog: 
text: He moves on to Frog Man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Frog Man, I think death is probably
dialog: the best thing for you now.
dialog: 
text: Frog Man nods in agreement. Rick rpaches JulieErnie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Ernie... Julie... I have mixed
dialog: feelings.
dialog: (He turns to Ernie)
dialog: On one hand, I'll remember you as
dialog: the best friend a jerk like me ever
dialog: had, and a low down repulsive
text: slimeball.
dialog: 
text: He turns to Julie. ROMANTIC MUSIC swells up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK (CONT'D)
dialog: On the other hand, I really respect
dialog: you, and more than that, I, uh,
dialog: well, I wish we'd had the chance to
dialog: boink.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh, Rick...
dialog: 
text: They embrace. Rick calls out to the assembled group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Today I make the proudest boast a
dialog: man can utter: "Ich bien ein
dialog: Freak!"
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They're all ready to cheer, but they're confused by his bad
text: German. Rick has to explain himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Uh, I'm a freak.
dialog: 
text: Oh. They all get it. Beat. Then they cheer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT..CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A huge banner reads "NEW IMPROVED BEAST BOY SLAUGHTERS HIS
scene_heading: LOVED ONES! SPECIAL GUEST: FUNNYMAN DOM IRERRA! TONIGHT
text: ONLY!". We can hear the sound of the crowd inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INSIDE THE TENT
dialog: 
text: There's a typically smallish crowd in addition to the EES
text: executives who occupy the front seats. The security goons
text: are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of
text: them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row. Elijah
text: is onstage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: And now the moment you've all been
dialog: waiting for. Ladies and gentlemen,
dialog: meet the lucky young man who's
text: about to be become the monster with
dialog: the mostest! Here he is, the Beast
dialog: Boy!
dialog: 
text: Toad pulls a rope and the curtain opens, revealing Rick
text: strapped to an operating table. On stage left there's a
text: large cage containing all the other freaks. Including the
text: unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the
text: freak house. The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic,
text: grabs the bars of the cage, and screams--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILK MAN
text: AAHHHH! WE'RE IN A ZOO!
dialog: 
text: Rick searches the cheering audience for Stuey, who waves the
text: Pepsi cup full of glop in the air. Rick hears Stuey's voice
text: echo in his head telepathically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY (V.0.)
dialog: Rick! Over here!
dialog: 
text: Stuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed
text: BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds
text: up a beaker of ointment.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: With this remarkable ointment of my
dialog: own design, I will now turn this
text: half-finished ghoul into the
dialog: ultimate super freak, dedicated to
dialog: evil!
dialog: 
text: Elijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick,
text: who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey.
text: He calls out telepathically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK (V.0.)
dialog: Stuey! Where are you?!
dialog: 
text: Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally
text: blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY (V.0.)
dialog: Here I am, Rick!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIKER
speaker_heading: (TO STUEY)
dialog: Goddammit, kid! Would you sit
dialog: down!?
dialog: 
text: The biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The
text: "good ointment" runs down all over Stuey's body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
text: AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
dialog: 
text: All eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto
text: the floor screaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Oh no!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: What the hell!?
dialog: 
text: Suddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to
text: its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a
text: switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade
text: crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He
text: drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He
text: leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY MONSTER
dialog: YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS!
dialog: 
text: Rick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE
dialog: AND EYE! KILL HIM!
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Eye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EYE AND EYE
speaker_heading: RASTAFARI!
dialog: 
text: The bullets bounce off Stuey's hide. He doinks them with his
text: big monster fingers and sends them flying through...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE TENT ROOF
dialog: 
text: across the compound, and THWOPP! Into the Giant Head's eye
text: sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed.
text: CRASH! The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over
dialog: backwards.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARNIVAL TENT
dialog: 
text: Elijah calls out to Toad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: TOAD!
dialog: 
text: Stuey Monster roars at Toad. Toad smiles weakly.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE TENT ROOF
dialog: 
text: Toad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye
text: across the compound and CRASH! Lands head first into the
text: neck of the Giant Head. He gets up with the Giant Head stuck
text: on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed
text: caricatures. He runs blindly across the yard and into...
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE ELECTRIC FENCE
dialog: 
text: ZZZAAAAPPP! BOINNGG! Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets,
text: and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's
dialog: mouth. It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: 
text: looks worried. He scoops up some "evil ointment".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Looks like it's time to roll out
text: the big gun.
speaker_heading: (TO RICK)
dialog: Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words?
dialog: 
text: Rick considers it. He can't think of anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Nahh.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Suit yourself.
dialog: 
text: He raises the ointment over Rick. Rick has an idea for a
dialog: last word.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Wait! Wait!
dialog: (Elijah pauses. Rick
speaker_heading: RECONSIDERS)
dialog: Nahh.
dialog: 
text: Elijah glops Rick. His skin starts to smoke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
speaker_heading: AHHHHRRRGGG!
dialog: 
text: Stuey Monster stalks Elijah onstage. Rick is smoking and
text: shaking violently on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: 
text: turns to his EES cronies in the audience. He looks bored.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: What a waste of twelve bucks.
dialog: Let's get the machine and go.
dialog: 
text: The other executives nod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: 
text: starts to transform. FWOOP! His ears spring out into huge
text: monster ears, kinda like in Pinocchio. FWAAP! His mouth
text: grows into a massive, Big Daddy Roth style monster mouth.
text: FWEEP! His upper head does the same.
dialog: 
text: His body follows suit. He bursts' out of the straps and
text: grows into a drooling TEN FOOT TALL RICK MONSTER. He snarls
text: at Stuey Monster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK MONSTER
text: TIME TO DIE, TROLL!
dialog: 
text: The crowd and the other freaks look on, tense. Stuey Monster
text: instinctively whips out a Ricky Coogan publicity photo and a
dialog: pen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY MONSTER
dialog: Rick! Rick! Could you sign
dialog: this!?
dialog: 
text: Rick Monster snarls and bashes Stuey Monster in the face.
text: Stuey Monster jams the pen through the photo and snarls back.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE CROWD
text: FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
dialog: 
text: Even Julie is screaming "Fight! Fight," beside herself with
text: bloodthirsty glee. Ernie smacks her.
dialog: 
text: The crowd goes nuts as the monsters trade a series of cliche
text: pro-wrestling moves. Stuey bashes Rick. Rick bashes Stuey,
dialog: etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Give him the skull cracker, ya big
dialog: goon!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: No way! The skull cracker is an
dialog: illegal move!
dialog: 
text: Stuey grabs Rick's hair and marches him around the stage.
text: The crowd is taking sides, screaming out advice, and foaming
text: at their mouths.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Let's get this over with. Hey
dialog: Hertz, tell your goons to
text: (he turns to Hertz and is
speaker_heading: STUNNED)
dialog: What the hell-!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: 
text: stands in front of the a group of EES HARDHATS who are using
text: forklifts to move the Tasty Freekz Machine towards the exit.
text: He notices Elijah and taps his executive ASSISTANT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
speaker_heading: (TO ELIJAH)
dialog: Ahem. At this point in time we at
dialog: EES regret that we must leave this
text: performance prematurely.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: What are you saying!?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: What we're saying is... get
text: stuffed, yokel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: I figured I couldn't trust you
dialog: corporate greaseballs!
dialog: 
text: Elijah turns to an alarm box on the wall which reads "BREAK
text: GLASS IN CASE OF DOUBLECROSSING CORPORATE GREASEBALLS." He
text: breaks the glass and pulls the lever inside.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
text: A trapdoor on the stage opens and a large chemical tank rises
text: out of it. Elijah jumps into the seat of the gun turret
text: nozzle atop the tank. He aims the nozzle at the EES group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Let me proudly introduce the latest
dialog: in our product line, Noxon 25--now
dialog: available in a convenient pump!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HERTZ
dialog: Bullshit! The Everything Except
dialog: Shoes corporation releases no new
dialog: products unless I give the order!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: I think it's time EES branched out
dialog: a little.
dialog: 
text: He presses the plunger and the nozzle spews a torrent of
text: yellow glop on the EES people. They scream in agony as their
text: bodies melt together into one big mutating blob.
dialog: 
text: Alistair Cooke stands up in the audience--he's got a head
text: bandage and a crutch from being trampled at the last show.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALISTAIR COOKE
dialog: Ahhh! Head for the hills before he
dialog: gets all of us!
dialog: 
text: The crowd goes berserk and rushes the exits, trampling poor
text: Cooke like a roach.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK MONSTER
dialog: 
text: flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him.
text: Stuey is knocked out cold. Rick leaves him on the floor and
text: stalks the freak cage murderously.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK MONSTER
text: NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMIE
dialog: No! We're your friends!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK MONSTER
text: Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES!
dialog: 
text: He rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear
text: JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs
text: his leg and trips him. Stuey summons all his remaining
text: energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from
text: slaughtering the freaks.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, Elijah is watching as
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE EES BLOB
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: solidifies into... A GIANT SHOE made of living flesh. It's
dialog: got eyeballs where the eyes should be, a tongue where the
text: tongue should be, but it's helpless and immobile.
dialog: 
text: Elijah looks at it with pride. He does his best Ed Sullivan
speaker_heading: IMPRESSION:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Now that's a really, really big
dialog: shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think
dialog: I'd like a pair of those!
dialog: 
text: He swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks
text: and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey,
text: blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage. Rick raises
text: the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through
text: his chest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: (to Rick monster)
dialog: Would you hurry up and waste the
dialog: troll, please!? I got a lonely
dialog: shoe over here!
dialog: 
text: Rick Monster nods and drives the spear down when we...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. REGIS &amp; KATHIE LEE SHOW SET
dialog: 
text: Rick's silhouette (which matches his ten foot monster
text: incarnation) is immersed in the story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: And then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHIE LEE
dialog: Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've
dialog: been talking for almost ninety
dialog: minutes, and we've just got to go
text: to a commercial.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: We'll be right back after this,
dialog: folks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PRODUCT SHOT
dialog: 
text: A fine array of different kinds of cheese on a chopping
dialog: block.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TOUGH VOICED ANNCR
dialog: You like cheese. You like being a
dialog: man. That's why you like..
dialog: 
text: A BURLY HAND swipes all the cheese off the block and slams
text: down an aluminum can labeled "MACHEESMO."
dialog: 
scene_heading: TOUGH VOICED ANNCR
dialog: Macheesemo. Real cheese for real
dialog: men. Now in a handy aluminum
dialog: dispenser.
dialog: 
text: The hand crushes the can and gooey yellow cheese squirts out
dialog: the top.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. REGIS &amp; KATHIE LEE SHOW SET
dialog: 
text: We hear a music bite from "Le Freak."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHIE LEE
dialog: And now back to the exciting
dialog: conclusion of Ricky Coogan's
dialog: incredible story.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Well, let's see, the other freaks
text: were lined up in Elijah's sights,
dialog: and I was about to shove a pipe
text: through Stuey's skull, when all of
dialog: a sudden, I heard a voice...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Rick stops the spear inches from Stuey's chest. Their eyes
dialog: meet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Kill him! Kill him!
dialog: 
text: Elijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and Cowboy's voice
text: reverberates in Rick's head.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COWBOY (V.O.)
dialog: I reckon that troll could help you
dialog: if you just let him into your
dialog: heart... your heart... your
dialog: heart...
dialog: 
text: The voice keeps echoing. A tear wells up in Rick Monster's
text: eye. He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to
text: him from the cage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: Your heart... your heart... your
dialog: heart...
dialog: 
text: Rick Monster loses his murderous glare. He breaks into a
text: warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up.
text: They hug. The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Atta' boy Coog!
speaker_heading: (NUDGES WORM)
dialog: Hey, ain't that somethin'?
dialog: 
text: The Worm is gushing sentimentally. He tries to hide his
dialog: tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: Tosh. (Sniff) Sentimental claptrap
dialog: (Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa!
dialog: 
text: He can't hold it in anymore. He bawls like a baby.
text: Meanwhile, Elijah is hopping mad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and
dialog: start mutilating each other!
dialog: 
text: He aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button. The
text: Glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the
text: tip, Rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to
dialog: face Elijah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Raarrrrrrgh!
dialog: 
text: Elijah manages to duck just in time. A stream of yellow
text: Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the DUNK
text: TANK full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the
dialog: tent.
dialog: 
text: The acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly.
dialog: 
text: Elijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off
dialog: against Rick Monster.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from
text: the cage. They watch the confrontation from a distance.
dialog: 
text: Elijah rolls up his sleeves. Rick growls and advances
dialog: slowly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: You think I made you strong? HA!
dialog: I've cranked my DNA up so high, you
dialog: won't know what hit you. I'm a
dialog: wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa!
dialog: 
text: He rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid
text: section. They have absolutely no effect. Rick brings one
text: heavy fist slamming down on Elijah's head, stopping him cold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
speaker_heading: (WEAKLY)
dialog: Ow! I think you crushed my spinal
dialog: cord. I can't feel anything in my
dialog: fingers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Maybe you'll feel this ...
dialog: 
text: Rick rears back to kick him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Qait--if you kill me, you'll never
dialog: find the antidote.
dialog: 
text: The freaks all perk up. Rick's skeptical.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What antidote?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: A time release serum--I baked it
text: into a delicious batch of
dialog: macaroons.
dialog: 
text: A slow smile grows on the Freaks' faces, especially Rick's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: If you ask me, you skimped on the
dialog: coconut!
dialog: 
text: THWAK! Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him
text: flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over
text: the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye
text: target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of
text: bravado, Elijah makes a last stand.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
dialog: Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You
dialog: haven't got the guts to kill me!
dialog: Go on! I dare ya'!
dialog: 
text: Rick ponders for a second. He looks over to Julie. Then...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCRAPPY
dialog: Yap! Yap!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Scrappy!
dialog: 
text: Scrappy the dog rushes in. He leaps up and presses the
text: bullseye, dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJAH
text: AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH!
dialog: 
text: Elijah struggles in agony. His body bubbles and mutates in
text: the thick toxic soup. He sinks lower and lower into the
text: gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good.
dialog: 
text: Scrappy leaps into Rick's arms and licks his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCRAPPY
dialog: Yap!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Atta boy, Scrap!
dialog: 
text: BLAM! BLAM! The tent flaps fly open and a half dozen FBI
text: AGENTS rush in with guns drawn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI CHIEF
dialog: Freeze, FBI!
dialog: 
text: Another FBI GUY investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat
text: floating on top of the bubbling ooze.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER FBI GUY
dialog: Looks like they took care of
dialog: Skuggs, chief.
dialog: 
text: The chief nods. They put away their guns, and approach Rick
text: and the rest of the jubilant freaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a
dialog: medal from the Vice President for
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Great. But how did you--
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHIEF
dialog: We've been following Skuggs for
dialog: years. Scrappy just filled in some
dialog: of the details.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCRAPPY
dialog: Yap!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI CHIEF
dialog: Thank heavens you brought him to
dialog: justice, Rick. God only knows how
dialog: far his sick plans would've gone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER FBI GUY
dialog: Hey chief, look at this!
dialog: 
text: The FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine,
text: revealing that it's actually a Coke machine! The chief is
text: sickened to the core.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI CHIEF
dialog: Is nothing sacred?
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream.
text: They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI CHIEF
dialog: Oh, my Lord!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: No! It can't be!
dialog: 
text: We SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of
text: the dunk tank. The blob separates into two distinct entities
text: with their backs to us. They turn around and...my God
dialog: it's... it's....
dialog: 
dialog: REGIS AND KATHIE LEE!
dialog: 
dialog: Or at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them. Call
text: him/them ELIJUS and ELLY LEE. They both have glowing red
text: demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJUS
dialog: Thought you killed me, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLY LEE
dialog: What the hell are you looking at?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FBI CHIEF
dialog: Two pieces of deadmeat!
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The FBI guys open fire. We show only
text: the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. REGIS AND KATHIE LEE SET
dialog:

speaker_heading: KATHIE LEE
speaker_heading: (YAWN)

speaker_heading: CREW GUY(O.S.)
dialog: Okay! We got light!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: It's fixed? Well, it's about time!
dialog: 
text: The lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks
text: perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was
text: caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile
text: behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: That's better.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: I'll say.
speaker_heading: (TO AUDIENCE)
dialog: How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it
dialog: for Ricky Coogan!
dialog: 
text: The audience applauds and hoots wildly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHIE LEE
dialog: Can we bring out the other freaks
dialog: now?
dialog: 
text: The audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from
text: the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience.
text: They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with
dialog: their former identities printed on them. "I was NOSEY," "I
text: was COWBOY," "I was the BEARDED LADY" etc. Except the Worm,
text: who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, "I'm Still THE WORM".
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WORM
dialog: Ridiculous... Just because a man
dialog: doesn't like macaroons...
dialog: Nonsense.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He
text: pounces and catches the furry little bugger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Gotcha! Damn, it's about time!
dialog: 
scene_heading: ALL THE EX-FREAKS
dialog: (happy to see him)
speaker_heading: JUAN!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUAN
dialog: Hey guys! Jeez! You look great!
dialog: 
text: They all hug.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REGIS
dialog: That's just great. What a story.
dialog: And what an ending! Elijah
dialog: transformed by the goop!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHIE LEE
dialog: And he really looked like--?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Exactly like you two, I swear.
dialog: Same faces, same outfits, except
dialog: they had these really big, hideous
dialog: feet...
dialog: 
text: He looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big,
text: hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red--
text: It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELIJUS
dialog: Show's over, Ricky!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLY LEE
dialog: I'm gonna drink your blood!
dialog: 
text: Elly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on
dialog: Rick's throat when...
dialog: 
text: BANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny.
text: They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the
text: audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie
text: stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick.
text: They embrace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Rick! It's finally over!
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Yes... Yes it is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY(O.C.)
dialog: Rick! Rick!
dialog: 
text: Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall
text: monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag
text: dripping blood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Stuey!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: Look! I found the real Regis and
dialog: Kathie Lee!
dialog: 
text: Rick and Julie look at the bag, mortified. Stuey chuckles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, this is just my lunch!
dialog: 
text: Rick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar
text: leaking bag and holds it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STUEY
dialog: (matter of fact)
dialog: This is Regis and Kathie Lee.
dialog: 
text: Rick and Julie nod casually--"Oh."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AUDIENCE
dialog: Awwww!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch,
text: bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and
dialog: Julie when...
dialog: 
text: BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out
text: and they fall dead--again.
dialog: 
text: Ernie stands off to the side with a smoking gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Oh, like that wasn't totally
dialog: predictable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Well, now it really is over.
dialog: 
text: Sappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Thank God. You know, this
dialog: adventure has taught me something.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: RICK(CONT'D)
text: When man starts impinging on the
dialog: subtle perfection of the earth's
dialog: natural order, the only thing he'll
dialog: create is havoc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Right, Coog. I learned somethin'
dialog: too. That men and women truly are
dialog: equals. That the human spirit
dialog: transcends gender and physical
dialog: appearance, and thus it is immune
dialog: to the petty degradations men may
dialog: devise. I believe it was Moliere
speaker_heading: WHO SAID--
dialog: 
text: Julie's had enough. She socks Ernie square on the jaw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JULIE
dialog: Oh, shut up.
dialog: (She turns to Rick)
dialog: Let's go fuck.
dialog: 
text: Rick gives her the thumbs up. They turn to the audience.
dialog: 
scene_heading: RICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTER
dialog: Good night, everybody!
dialog: 
text: The audience cheers. The HIT SINGLE from the soundtrack
dialog: album kicks in as we...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROLL CREDITS
dialog: 
text: As the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and
text: wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack
text: again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.
text: Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they
text: attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
text: to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and
text: Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely
text: stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts
text: the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand
text: gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has
text: to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down
text: to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,
dialog: charging everyone five bucks per blow.
dialog: 
text: As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing,
text: kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite
dialog: morning show hosts.
dialog: 
dialog: THE END?!
dialog:
