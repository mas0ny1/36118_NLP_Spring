scene_heading: 1 EXT. EASTERN SEABOARD - AERIALS - DAY 1
text: High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the
text: earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with
dialog: clouds.
text: As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color. We
text: are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.
text: Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of
text: a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling
text: building. Computer type quickly bleeps on:

scene_heading: 2 INT. CIA - HALLWAY - DAY 2
text: We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of
text: someone walking down the well polished hallway.
scene_heading: 3 INT. PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY 3
text: We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind
text: his desk. A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer
dialog: DeBakey Smith.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Ozzie. Sit down.
text: Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped
text: shirt and bow tie.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Palmer. What's up.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: You know Peck, and Olson.
text: The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at
text: Osbourne, who is surprised to see them.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by
dialog: reputation. Hi, Osbourne Cox.
speaker_heading: OLSON
dialog: Yeah, hiyah.
dialog: 2.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Aren't you with...aren't you,
dialog: uh...
dialog: Palmer jumps in:
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Yeah, that's right. Oz, look.
dialog: There's no easy way to say this.
dialog: We're taking you off the Balkans desk.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: You're----what? Why?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: In fact we're moving you out of Sigint
dialog: entirely.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: ...What? No discussion, just----you're
dialog: out?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Well, we're having the discussion now
dialog: Oz. This doesn't have to be
dialog: unpleasant.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Palmer, with all due respect----what the
dialog: fuck are you talking about?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... And why is Olson here?
text: Another uncomfortable beat.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: ... Look, Ozzie----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: What the fuck is this?! Is it my----I
dialog: know it's not my work.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Ozzie----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I'm a great fucking analyst! Is it----
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Oz, things are not going well. As you
dialog: know.
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: PECK
dialog: You have a drinking problem.
text: Stunned silence. Ozzie turns to look at Peck.
dialog: At length:
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I have a drinking problem.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: This doesn't have to be unpleasant.
dialog: We found you something in State. It's
dialog: a, uh...
text: He gropes, uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: PALMER (CONT'D)
dialog: ... It's a lower clearance level.
dialog: Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're
dialog: not terminating you.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: (quietly)
text: This is an assault.
speaker_heading: PECK
dialog: Come on, Ozzie.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: This is an assault. I have a drinking
dialog: problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a
dialog: Mormon!
speaker_heading: PECK
dialog: Ozzie----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Next to you we all have a drinking
dialog: problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass
dialog: didn't I kiss? Let's be honest!
text: Palmer nods at Olson.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Okay, Olson----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Let's be fucking honest...
text: Osbourne gets to his feet, agitated.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... This is a crucifixion! This is
dialog: political! Don't tell me it's not!
text: He storms out the door.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I have a drinking problem!
text: The door slams. Palmer Smith looks at Olson. Olson arches
text: an eyebrow.
scene_heading: 4 INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY 4
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
text: Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter.
text: His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear
text: the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray.
text: Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an
text: attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of
text: the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You're home.
text: Osbourne continues making himself a drink.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Hang on to your hat, honey. I have
dialog: some news. I----
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Did you pick up the cheeses?
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Were they ready? I didn't know you
dialog: were coming home this early.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: (blank)
dialog: The cheeses.
text: Katie rolls her eyes.
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I left a message for you to stop at
dialog: Todaro's. The Magruders and the
text: Pfarrers are coming over.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: The Pfarrers? Ugh. I----what did
dialog: Kathleen say?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: When you left the message?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: She said. She would give you. The
dialog: message.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Well she, I don't know, I guess we had
dialog: bigger news today. My day didn't
dialog: revolve arou----
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: So you didn't get the cheeses.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Well, since I didn't get the message,
dialog: no, I didn't get the cheeses. But
dialog: hang on to your hat, I----
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I
dialog: have to go out again? All right,
dialog: well, you better get dressed.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Honey, we have to talk.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Not right now. They'll be here in,
dialog: what, less than an hour.
scene_heading: 5 INT. COX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 5
text: A hand hovers, hesitates.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Is this a, uh, goat cheese?
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (OFF)
dialog: Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese.
dialog: Pink Revision 8/14/07 6.
text: Wider shows the cocktail party, meagerly attended but in full
text: swing. Besides Osbourne and Katie there is Harry Pfarrer
text: (who has just inquired about the cheese), bearded, forties,
text: rugged; his wife Sandy; and a shiny-faced young couple, Doug
dialog: and Tina Magruder.
text: Osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Because I have lactose reflux. But I
dialog: can----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: You're lactose intolerant?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yes, but I can----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Or you have acid reflux? They're two
dialog: different things.
text: Harry looks at him coldly.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I know what they are.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Then you misspoke yourself. So I----
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Thank you for correcting me.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You should try the chevre, Harry.
dialog: It's very good.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah. I can eat goat cheese.
text: He eats a piece, cupping one hand under his mouth.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I was just explaining to your
dialog: husband here, I have a condition----
text: Katie tries to separate the two men by including Doug
dialog: Magruder.
speaker_heading: KATIE

speaker_heading: HARRY *
dialog: Used to work for Treasury, but I *
dialog: didn't go over to Homeland Security. *
dialog: I'm with the Marshalls. *
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: If you want he'll show you his great
dialog: big gun.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Very amusing. The gun is actually no
dialog: big deal. Twenty years in the
dialog: marshall's service and I've never
dialog: discharged my weapon.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Sounds like something you should be
dialog: telling your psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What? I don't have a psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: DOUG MAGRUDER
dialog: Boy, I guess my job is pretty
dialog: undramatic. I'm on the legislative
dialog: side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do
dialog: you also carry a gun?
text: Harry laughs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Sandy writes children's books.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I write children's books----
speaker_heading: HARRY

speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)

dialog: me.
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Those are wonderful! My nieces and
dialog: nephews----
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Yeah, it's a beloved series. You
dialog: wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh.
dialog: Are you sure this is goat cheese?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Why don't you let your wife tell them
dialog: about her own books, Harry?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I'm sorry----was I----
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Here, come in the kitchen, help me
dialog: with the crudités.
scene_heading: 6 INT. COX KITCHEN - NIGHT 6
text: They enter.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Goddamnit. He knows, doesn't he.
text: He looks down at the floor. He stamps.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Nice floors.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Knows what?
text: Harry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures.
dialog: Absently:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: About us, he knows about us. Little
dialog: prick.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a
dialog: thing.
text: Harry is staring down at the linoleum again.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What is that, forbo?
scene_heading: A6 EXT. STREET - NIGHT A6
text: A car drives by.
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: 7 INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT 7
text: Harry driving, his wife next to him.
text: A long beat.
dialog: Finally:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What a horse's ass.
speaker_heading: SANDY
dialog: I don't know why we see them.
text: Harry shrugs.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well, she's all right.
speaker_heading: SANDY
text: She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.
text: Harry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't.
dialog: They drive.
scene_heading: 8 INT. COX MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 8
speaker_heading: KATIE
text: She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold
text: cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You quit?!
text: Osbourne is buttoning a pajama top.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Well----Thank you for letting me know!
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I tried to tell you this afternoon.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You tried? You tried? And then----
dialog: what, the aphasia kicked in?
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Our guests came. We----
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Why?! For fuck's sake, Ozzie!
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I'm just----I don't know. I got so
dialog: tired.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You're tired.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
text: Tired of swimming against the current.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Uh-huh.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Independent thought is not only not
dialog: valued there, they resist it, they
dialog: fight it, the bureaucracy is
dialog: positively----
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Did you get a pension, or severance or
dialog: something, or----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I didn't retire you know, I, I quit.
dialog: I don't want their benefits.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: But I suppose my benefits are all
dialog: right, I suppose you can live with
dialog: those, is that the idea?
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: It's not like that's the only way to
dialog: make money.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Yes? Yes? What're you gonna do?
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I'll do some consulting.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Consulting.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Yes, to help while I----I've always
dialog: wanted to write.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Write. Write what.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: I've been thinking about it. A book,
dialog: a sort of, sort of memoir.
text: Katie stares at him in the mirror.
text: A beat.
text: She bursts into laughter.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. YACHT/AT SEA - DAY 9
speaker_heading: THE BRIDGE
text: A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in
text: his face, as the boat sails under motor power.
text: After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.
text: An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the
text: wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a
text: tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: You okay there, Dad?
text: The old man remains silent, staring. Osbourne sits next to
text: him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the
text: man's knees.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Dad, I left my job at the
dialog: Agency...
text: The old man stares out into the wind.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad,
dialog: government service is not what it was
dialog: when you were in State. Things are
dialog: different now. I don't know, maybe
dialog: it's... it's... the Cold War ending;
dialog: now it seems like it's all bureaucracy
dialog: and no mission...
text: The old man stares out into the wind.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I'm writing a memoir. I think
dialog: it's going to be pretty explosive.
dialog: But I don't think you'll disapprove.
dialog: I don't think you'll disapprove.
text: Katie has had trouble accepting it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: But... sometimes there's a higher
dialog: patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes,
dialog: change is hard. It's hard on Katie.
dialog: But we'll be okay. We'll be okay.
dialog: Life is change. This is good. We
dialog: were all blocked up, Katie and me.
dialog: This is, this is a blessing in
dialog: disguise. I'll go into training, you
dialog: know. Lay off the sauce. Like you
dialog: did. You managed to do it. Finally.
dialog: And then I can concentrate on, you
dialog: know. New beginning. And this'll all
dialog: have been for the best. Don't you
dialog: think Dad?
text: The old man stares out into the wind.
text: Osbourne sniffles.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Cold.
text: He taps the old man on the knee and rises.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I guess we should head back.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. PIER - DAY 10
text: LONG SHOT THRU THE WINDSHIELD OF A CAR
text: The sailboat docked at the end of a marina. Osbourne is
text: pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from
dialog: the boat.
speaker_heading: A MAN'S VOICE
dialog: We've seen this...
scene_heading: 11 INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 11
speaker_heading: THE MAN
text: White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law-
text: book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit,
text: suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is
dialog: Bogus Terikhian.
speaker_heading: TERIKHIAN
dialog: ... I know this kind of man. We've
dialog: seen this.
dialog: 13.
text: Wider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the
text: table, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an
dialog: assistant.
speaker_heading: TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man
dialog: take advantage of you. And he will.
dialog: He will.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Yes. This is my fear. He's trying----
text: he says----he's trying to pull himself
dialog: together, but...
speaker_heading: TERIKHIAN
dialog: Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you
dialog: you should try to salvage things. And
dialog: you should. People turn themselves
dialog: around. Not unheard-of. But. You----
dialog: you haven't broached the possibility
dialog: of divorce yet?
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TERIKHIAN
dialog: Well that's good. Because first you
dialog: should get all his financials. Before
dialog: he's forewarned. Because here's a
dialog: man, here's a man, practiced in
dialog: deceit, this is almost, you could say
dialog: it's his job, practiced at hiding
dialog: things, and there is no reason, it is
dialog: not improper, there is no reason for
dialog: you not to get a picture of the
dialog: household finances. Paper files,
dialog: computer files, whatever----this is your
dialog: prerogative. You can be a spy too,
dialog: madam. Do this before you put him on
text: alert. Before the turtle can draw in
dialog: his head and his, uh...
text: He waggles his hands, groping for the word.
speaker_heading: TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Feet.
text: He shrugs.
speaker_heading: TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... And hopefully everything will work
dialog: out. He will reform. But! If not:
text: forewarned is forearmed.
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: 12 INT. COX HOUSE - DAY 12
text: Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over
text: pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out-
text: flung, like Marat in his bathtub.
text: A long still beat. A clock ticks.
text: Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a
text: microcassette recorder.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: We were young and committed and there
dialog: was nothing we couldn't do. We
dialog: thought of the Agency less as... less
dialog: as...
text: The thought, such as it was, peters out. Osbourne rises and
text: wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.
text: He suddenly raises the microcassette again.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... The principles of George Kennan----a
dialog: personal hero of mine----were what
dialog: animated us. In fact they were what
dialog: had originally inspired me to enter
dialog: government service. Like the State
dialog: Department's China Hands of yore, or,
text: in a different forum, in a different
dialog: venue, in a different medium, in,
dialog: um... "Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in
dialog: a different----
text: He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening.
text: Faintly, a ringing phone.
scene_heading: 13 INT. COX BASEMENT STAIRWAY - DAY 13
text: At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted
text: stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that
text: juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.
text: The phone is louder here.
scene_heading: 14 INT. COX BASEMENT - DAY 14
text: A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low
text: dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The
text: ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The
text: answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: MACHINE
dialog: You have reached The Cox Group...
text: Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered
text: feet toward the phone.
speaker_heading: MACHINE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... We can't answer your call right
dialog: now. Please leave a----
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: (heavy breathing)
dialog: Hello.
text: He eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone. A
dialog: listening beat.
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her
dialog: number... No, upstairs...No she's not,
text: but leave it on her machine.
scene_heading: 15 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER 15
text: We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his
text: robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime
dialog: game show.
text: A few beats of the show.
text: Roaring laughter from the studio audience. Mild chuckle from
text: Osbourne in the foreground.
scene_heading: 16 INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER 16
text: Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette
text: recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and
text: then stops, and looks off.
text: The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate
dialog: clock face Two or three minutes to five.
text: Osbourne stares for a long beat.
scene_heading: 17 INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY 17
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
text: Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray.
text: He pours coke sizzling onto the ice.
dialog: 16.
text: He pauses for a long beat.
text: He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet.
text: He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass.
text: He looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark. He
text: conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring:
speaker_heading: OSBOURNE
dialog: Single...
text: He dumps the shot into the Coke.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. SAILBOAT - DUSK 18
text: As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is
text: seen in long shot through the windshield of a car.
text: Closer on the boat. As water laps against pilings and the
text: boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of
text: a couple having sex. When it builds to climax we cut:
scene_heading: 19 INT. SAILBOAT - DUSK 19
text: Minutes later. We hold on a door for a quiet beat, then we
text: hear the gurgle of water, and then the door opens. Harry
text: Pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom, buckling his belt.
text: In the bedroom which he emerges into Katie Cox is just
text: finishing dressing.
text: Harry looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I should try to get a run in.
scene_heading: 20 INT. COX HOUSE - DUSK 20
text: Katie is letting herself in.
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Ozzie!
dialog: Quiet.
scene_heading: 21 INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 21
text: Katie enters and sees a note on the counter paperweighted by
dialog: a plate of used lime wedges:
dialog: 17.
dialog: Honey,
dialog: At Fenninger's. Reunion committee
dialog: dinner.
dialog: See you later.
scene_heading: 22 EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DUSK 22
text: Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is
text: jogging in his Treasury sweats.
text: Closer on him. Brow furrows. He spins, jogs backwards,
dialog: looking.
dialog: His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no
text: pedestrians particularly close.
text: Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops. He turns again.
text: Point-of-view up the bridge: empty.
text: Harry starts jogging again.
scene_heading: 23 INT. COX BASEMENT - NIGHT 23
text: We are tracking toward the desk in the corner, at which Katie
text: sits. She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into
text: Osbourne's computer. A suspense drone builds as we track in.
text: Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops. She holds still,
text: listening for noises in the house. Nothing. She resumes
dialog: typing.
text: We hear male voices beginning to swell in song. The voices
text: continue after the suspense drone snaps off, at the cut to:
scene_heading: 24 INT. FENNINGER'S - NIGHT 24
text: A musty steakhouse. On the walls are hunting-scene prints
text: and steel engravings of English country houses.
text: A placard resting on a chair outside the Georgian Room:
scene_heading: CLOSED FOR PRIVATE PARTY.
text: From inside the room, male voices:
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Tune every heart and every voice...
dialog: 18.
scene_heading: 25 INT. FENNINGER'S - GEORGIAN ROOM - NIGHT 25
text: A dozen middle-aged men around a long table, each holding
text: high a glass.
speaker_heading: MEN
dialog: ... Bid every care withdraw. Let all
dialog: with one accord rejoice...
text: The men are sweaty, tie-loosened, dinner-stuffed and boozy.
speaker_heading: MEN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... In praise of Old Nassau...
text: Close on Osbourne as a rotund middle-aged classmate fills his
text: glass to brimming. The two sway unsteadily with the music..
speaker_heading: MEN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... In praise of Old Nassau my boys,
dialog: Hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah!
text: All swing their glasses side-to-side in rhythm:
speaker_heading: MEN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Her sons... shall give... while
dialog: they... shall live...
text: Glasses are thrust high with a ringing finish:
speaker_heading: MEN (CONT'D)
dialog: ... In praise of Old Nassau!
scene_heading: 26 INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY 26
speaker_heading: A WOMAN'S ASS
text: Bare. Pale. Middle-aged.
text: Someone with a marker is drawing on the flesh to illustrate:
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (OFF)
dialog: We take all the chicken fat off your
dialog: buttocks, here... and here... And the
dialog: upper arms. And a little off your
dialog: tummy...
text: The camera is arcing around a standing, naked, middle-aged
text: woman, to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the
text: examining room, facing her. He reaches forward again with
dialog: the marker.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...And we do breast augmentation with
dialog: a tiny incision here... and here.
speaker_heading: PATIENT (OFF)
dialog: Uh-huh. And what about the thigh
dialog: area?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Well we can do liposuction there as
dialog: well, but that area will respond to
text: exercise. Buttocks and upper arms
dialog: begin to store more fat when you get
text: up around forty, the body just tells
dialog: it to go there, but the thighs will
dialog: respond to toning exercises.
speaker_heading: PATIENT
dialog: Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my
dialog: arms til the cows come home, but...
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Uh-huh. And of course there are also
dialog: genetic factors.
speaker_heading: PATIENT
dialog: The Litzkes are big.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: And what about the face, you know, the

speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Very well put. Well
dialog: your eyes are one of your best

text: about the incipient crow's feet.
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: Baby crow's feet. Little chickling's
dialog: feet. I mean chicks. Chickie chickie
dialog: chickie.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Ha-ha, yes, again, well put. You have
dialog: a way with words. We cut here...
text: He marks.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR (CONT'D)
dialog: ... And we pull the skin tight, like
text: stretching the skin over a drum. Not
dialog: too tight, though. We don't want that
dialog: "worked-on" look. You need sufficient
dialog: slack for the face to remain
dialog: expressive.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Yeah, I don't wanna look like Boris
dialog: Karloff.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Uh-huh! Heh-heh, so you don't want a

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Yeah, I don't want to get anything
dialog: burned off.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: And why should you. With that lovely

dialog: augmentation. Now we can also do
dialog: something about the vaccine scar----I
dialog: don't know if you wear sleeveless
dialog: dresses much----
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Not with these ham hocks!
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Yes, well once they're nice and
dialog: svelte, post-op, you----
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Well I don't know. Is the vaccine
dialog: thing----can you counsel me on this? I
dialog: don't know, is it unsightly? I see it
dialog: a lot, a bunch of people have it.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Absolutely! Some women don't mind it

speaker_heading: LINDA (CONT'D)
dialog: ...No, those are four different

dialog: twenties. A kid. We were kids.
dialog: Twenties. You think it's forever.
dialog: Then, you know, you're older----you
dialog: begin to feel your mortality, you
dialog: start to think, well, there's no more
dialog: time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You
dialog: go, I'm not that person. The choices
dialog: you made, you can't, just through
dialog: inertia----
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.
text: Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction. After

dialog: So if I were divorced----
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well yes, if you were uh, you know,

speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Scary stuff. You're a brave lady.

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Well that's... a little----
speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: You and I should sort things out.
dialog: I've told you that this is not just

speaker_heading: CHAD

speaker_heading: LINDA

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I'm just saying, to the layman----
speaker_heading: CHAD

speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Omygod, why?
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Because he's gonna wanna know that his

dialog: relieved he gives us a reward----I would
dialog: be very fucking surprised if he did
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: LINDA

speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: You're the fucker!

scene_heading: 73 INT. LINDA'S CAR - DAY 73
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: That'll give him something to think

text: Linda sets the diskette on the table and slides it across.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: ... This is just a taste.
text: After a beat of looking at the proffered diskette, Krapotkin

speaker_heading: KRAPOTKIN
dialog: May I ask the source of this...
text: Linda slowly shakes her head, eyes locked on Krapotkin.

dialog: No you may not.
speaker_heading: CHAD
text: Very high up.
speaker_heading: LINDA

scene_heading: 106 INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 106
text: Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the
text: way shut. The footsteps mount the stairs. Chad peeks out.
text: His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled. In the middle of the
text: bed, a wedge-cushion.
dialog: 77.
text: Beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and
text: stairs. Harry arrives at the top of the stairs. He nudges
text: back a drape on the window at the top of the steps. He looks
text: down one way, then the other. He lets the drape fall back
text: and seems to relax.
text: Harry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps
text: out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master
text: bedroom. He leaves the door open.
text: Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but
text: stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the
text: curtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He
text: rinses off, humming "Born Free," and walks into the
text: foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress
text: pants that was draped across a bureau.
text: Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches. Harry
text: stops, just outside the cracked door.
text: Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt.
text: Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room
text: and bends to pick something off the floor.
text: Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again
text: as Harry approaches.
text: Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown
text: pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.
text: The closet door is thrown open.
speaker_heading: CHAD
dialog: Nuhhh!
speaker_heading: HARRY
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHHHHH!
text: Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder
text: holster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.
text: The gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming,
text: Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and
text: drops the weapon.
text: He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles
text: off on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down
dialog: the stairs.
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: 107 INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY 107
text: He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting. He looks back
text: up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that
dialog: he can listen.
text: A long silence.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ... Hello?
dialog: No answer.
text: He looks around.
scene_heading: 108 INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 108
text: Harry enters. He opens a drawer, closes it, opens another.
scene_heading: 109 INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY 109
text: Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the
text: stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: ... Hello?
scene_heading: 110 INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY 110
text: Harry tops the stairs. He pauses, looking at:
text: The bedroom door, ajar.
text: Inside, his gun lies on the floor.
text: Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.
text: He pauses at the cracked door. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Hungh!
text: He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops
text: it, dropping the knife.
text: He stands and spins, panting.
text: His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude
text: into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his
text: back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.
dialog: 79.
text: Harry walks cautiously over. With a bare foot he
text: experimentally waggles one of Chad's feet. Limp.
text: Harry nudges the door.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Hello?
text: It creaks fully open.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Omygod. Omygod.
text: Chad's face is a powder-burned, chewed-up mess.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Omygod who are you. You fucker.
dialog: Omygod.
text: He gingerly crouches down.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... You fucker...
text: He tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit
dialog: pockets.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Omygod, my god... Ungh...
text: He comes away with a wallet and hastily stands.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Omygod...
text: Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards,
dialog: driver's license; empty.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... What the fuck...
text: He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason
text: feeling obliged to return the wallet.
text: As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside
dialog: pocket he notices:
text: The suit label has been cut away. He fingers the raveled
dialog: fringe.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Oh my fuck...
text: He straightens up again.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... I killed a fucking spook. You
dialog: fucker...
text: He gazes down at the body.
speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... What are you doing here, you
dialog: fucker.

scene_heading: 112 INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY 112

scene_heading: 115 INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DOOR/CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY 115

speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Palmer. What's up.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Not quite certain, sir, but it's...

text: identifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb.
text: Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing.
speaker_heading: PALMER (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have
text: computer files from an ex-analyst of

speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB

speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Our man in the Russian Embassy.

dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: PALMER

dialog: who----
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: The Russians?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Yeah. It was brought in by Linda

speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: The Russians.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Who's Pfarrer?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Treasury agent who's been, um,
dialog: screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they
dialog: got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows
text: about it, they all seem to be sleeping
dialog: with each other.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: All right. Spare me.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's
dialog: gotten... complicated. He just shot
text: somebody in Ozzie's house.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Shot----your analyst?
text: Palmer shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Ozzie wasn't there. Our man surveying
text: hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy
text: wrestle something into his car,
text: follows him; he dumps a body in the
dialog: Chesapeake Bay.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Well----what'd he do that for?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Don't know sir.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the
dialog: body out?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Mm-hm.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Russian? American?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: And this... Linda...?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Linda Litzke.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: She's Treasury?
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: No, we're----um... fuzzy on her.
text: Gardner Chubb is flipping bemusedly through the contents of

speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Well----so----we don't really know what

dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Not really, sir.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: This analyst, ex-analyst, uh...
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Cox.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Yeah. What's his clearance level.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Three.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: Okay. Okay, no biggie...
text: He reaches the folder back to Palmer.
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)
dialog: ... for now just keep an eye on
dialog: everyone, see what they do.
speaker_heading: PALMER
dialog: Right, sir. And----we'll interface with
dialog: the FBI on this, uh, dead body?
speaker_heading: GARDNER CHUBB
dialog: No! No, we don't want those idiots

speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: ... What?
dialog: Through grit teeth:
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: I've tried. To ignore it. And stay

speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: Harry: stop the foolishness.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: Stop the foolishness?
speaker_heading: KATIE

dialog: to ask, I have this manuscript,
dialog: something to do with my professional
dialog: experiences, not to go into too much
dialog: detail but I think it's pretty
dialog: explosive stuff and I think that it
dialog: could merit a fairly wide readership
dialog: handled properly and it isn't quite
dialog: finished yet but there's a situation
dialog: where I'm worried about it leaking now
dialog: and maybe excerpts being published or
dialog: on the internet, whatever, without my
dialog: permission, and a lot of the impact
dialog: being, um, blunted, so I'm actually
dialog: anxious to bring it to market sooner
dialog: than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in
dialog: fact----so I was thinking, I know you,

speaker_heading: HARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: ... Back when I was in PP there was
