speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Works if you know how to work it...

speaker_heading: CURT

speaker_heading: JULES

dialog: Tillerman Road? Do you know if it’s this

text: The attendant looks at her, the name registering. She

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: (mutters)
dialog: What a waste.
text: He starts ambling toward the pump, pulling out a ring of
text: keys and unlocking a latch.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Tillerman Road takes you up into the

speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: (to the attendant)
dialog: My cousin bought a house up there, you go
text: through a mountain tunnel, there's a
dialog: lake, would that be...
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Buckner place. Always someone looking to
dialog: sell that plot.
dialog: (bad, bad smile)
dialog: Always some fool looking to buy.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You knew the original owners?
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Not the first. But I’ve seen plenty come

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Would that have been with the blue, and
dialog: some in grey? Brother, perhaps fighting
dialog: against brother in that war?
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: You sassin’ me, boy?
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: You were rude to my friend.
text: The attendant stops for a second, not expecting this guy
text: to have come back at him. Glances at Jules, mutters:
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: That whore?
text: Curt is about to clock him but Holden puts a hand to

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: Enough to get you there. Gettin’ back’s
dialog: your own concern.
text: He pulls out the nozzle as the gang moves back in, Curt
text: contemptuously throwing a twenty at the guy’s feet.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Good luck with your business. I know the

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN TUNNEL - AFTERNOON
text: The Rambler comes up the side of a steep drop-off. We
text: see Jules in the Passenger seat smiling...
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Guys, take a look...
text: And we pan with the vehicle as it enters the mountain
text: tunnel, slowing down a bit -- it’s a tight fit. The

scene_heading: EXT. CABIN/INT.VAN - AFTERNOON
text: There’s no audio but music as the kids all crowd the
text: front of the van to look at their vacation spot. The
text: lake appears up ahead, sun rippling over the water, and
text: they look and point, talking a bit.
text: Finally the camera races through the forest and finds the
text: cabin. It squats uninvitingly, a fairly ramshackle --
text: though not overly rustic —- single story structure.
text: Windows on either side of the door, not unlike closed
dialog: eyes.
text: The van pulls up and the kids come out, more slowly than
text: they did at the gas station, taking it in. Dana's a
text: little entranced, Holden curious, Curt pumped, Jules
text: mildly excited, Marty wary.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Oh my god, it’s beautiful!

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: She enters the living room. It’s also, if you turn to
text: the right, the kitchen; the stove is a classic old wood—
text: burning Kalamazoo Wonder, the sink clearly retro-fitted.
text: The decor is sparse and antlery. A wolf’s head is
text: mounted on one wall.
text: A hall goes own the middle, with two bedrooms on either
text: side. Dana makes her way around the room as the rest of
text: the gang pours in.
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Oh, this is awesome!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It is kinda cool. You gonna kill us a

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Dibs on whichever room is -- ow!

text: tip, a little blood welling up.
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT’D)
dialog: Curt, your cousin’s house attacked me.
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: I smell lawsuit...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: When was your last tetanus shot?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Thanks, that’s very comforting.
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Jules is pre-med. she knows there’s no

dialog: (stroking her hair)
dialog: T’ll miss you, baby. I’11] miss your

text: Dana looks over at Marty, who stands in the doorway,
text: looking around warily.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Marty? Are you Planning on coming in?
text: He looks around, not ready to make his move.
scene_heading: INT. HOLDEN’S ROOM — AFTERNOON
text: Holden throws his bag on his bed, which squeaks
text: appallingly. He looks around the decrepit -- but not
text: entirely un-homey -- room, focusses on a picture opposite
dialog: the bed.
text: ANGLE: THE PICTURE is like 19th century print, but it’s
text: of a hunting Party with machetes and dogs tearing a lamb
text: to pieces and, upon close examination, is repulsive,
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah, I don’t think go.
dialog: Se es
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: He takes the picture off the wall, camera follows him as
text: he leans it on the floor, comes back up to find Dana
text: staring at him blankly through a hole in the wall. once
text: again, he jumps.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wow. I’ve heard about the walls being
dialog: thin, but --
text: She bares her teeth at him. He stops, not getting what's
text: going on at all, then as she starts picking between them,
text: he gets it. Moves forward and puts his hand to the one-
dialog: way mirror between then.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN (CONT’D)
dialog: No way...
text: He watches her for a bit, first amused, then a little
text: hypnotised. She really is kind of beautiful. She musses
text: her hair a little, gives up, grinning at her own vanity.
text: Moves to her bed and starts unbuttoning her shirt,
speaker_heading: HOLDEN (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh shit, ah no, ahh... ( 2
text: He bobs back and forth between this golden opportunity
text: and cegmnen human (yawn) decency. Moves away from the
text: hole, out of frame, Moves back,
text: Finally bangs on the wall, ducking his head just as she’s
dialog: about to take it off —-
speaker_heading: HOLDEN (CONT'D)
dialog: (calls through)
dialog: Hold up!
scene_heading: INT. HOLDEN’S ROOM/HALL/DANA’S ROOM — MOMENTS LATER
text: The gang is all in there, checking it out.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You have got to be kidding me.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: That’s just creepy.
speaker_heading: MARTY

dialog: their own interrogation rooms. Out of

dialog: Raye
dialog: 
dialog: Od,

speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: (touches the edge)
dialog: This from the... seventies, judging by
dialog: the weathering. Who did your cousin buy
dialog: this place from?
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: We should check the rest of the rooms.
dialog: Make sure this is the only one.
dialog: (to Jules)
dialog: You know Marty wants to watch us pounding
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: (wincing)
dialog: I didn’t even like hearing that.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (as they exit)
dialog: Don’t be an ape, Curt.
text: He makes ape noises off screen. Dana is still staring at
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: How about we switch?
dialog: (she turns to him)
dialog: Not that I'd... I mean I'l) put the
dialog: picture back but you might feel better if
dialog: we switched rooms.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I really would.
text: He grabs his bag and they head out as she says:
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT’D)
dialog: Thanks for... being decent.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Least I could do, since Curt and Jules
dialog: have sold you to me for marriage.
text: She makes cringe face.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: They're not subtle.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: I’m just here to relax. And so can you.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Yeah, I’m not looking for... But I’m
dialog: still grateful that you’re not a creep,
dialog: ey
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Hey, let’s not jump to any conclusions
dialog: there. I had kind of an internal debate
dialog: about showing you the mirror. Shouting
text: on both sides, blood was spilled...
text: In her (now his) room, he dumps his stuff and she grabs
dialog: hers.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: So you're bleeding internally.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Pretty bad.
speaker_heading: DANA
text: Well, Jules is the doctor-in-training.
dialog: You should probably talk to her.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Yeah.
text: Dana exits, clearly frustrated with her lame exit line.
text: She enters her new room and, dropping her luggage, moves
dialog: to put the picture back. she’s stopped hy the aight of

text: he pulls his shirt over his head. He’s in pretty good
text: shape. He pulls his bathing suit out of his bag, starts
text: unbuttoning his pants --
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Uhhh... ah! God!
text: Sheepishly, she grabs the picture and replaces it. Takes
dialog: a@ moment to look at the slaughtered lamb scene. oe
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah, I don’t think go.
text: We cut to a high and wide of her placing a little blanket
text: over the picture, and suddenly the frame is that ofa

scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM

dialog: (to the others, into it)
dialog: I think he’ll find there’s more to life

speaker_heading: MARTY

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Um, Marty... have you seen a moose

speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Whatever that mysterious beast is --
speaker_heading: CURT HOLDEN
dialog: It’s a wolf, Yeah, it’s a wolf.
speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m living in a womb of reefer, leave me
dialog: alone.

dialog: Jules, I dare you to make out with the
dialog: wolf.
text: Jules nods, takea a drink, hops to her feet.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No problem.
text: The group cheera. As Jules makes her way acrogs the
text: cabin, she drops her hips a bit, adding a sultry swagger
text: to her step.
text: WOLF’S POV: We're looking out at the cabin as Jules
text: walks right by us. And just as she’s about to exit
text: frame, she stops in her tracks. Looks over at us.
text: She glances over her shoulder. Bashful. Looks back at

speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: Who? Me?
dialog: (pretends to listen, then)
dialog: I am new in town, how did you know?
text: Everyone laughs, cheering her on. But Jules pretends

text: She blushes, twirls her hair around her finger —~

speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoops --
dialog: (looks towards the ground)
dialog: I seem to have dropped my birth control
text: pills all over the ground...
text: While the group hoots and hollers, Jules turns around,
text: bends over right in front of the wolf. Pretends like
text: she’s picking something from the ground.
text: Then, without turning around, she stands up straight, so
text: that the wolf is now directly over her shoulder. She
text: nuzzles it, cheek to cheek --
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh.. Mr. Wolf. You're so big. And bad.
dialog: (then)
dialog: No no no -- there’s no need to huff and
dialog: puff... i
text: She turns around, takes the wolf's head in her hands --
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ll let you come in.
text: And with that, Jules leans in and gives the wolf the most.
dialog: passionate kiss we've ever seen. She just goes for it --
text: full-on, tongue-to-taxidermied-wolf-tongue action.
text: The group loses their minds. Everyone leaps to their
text: feet, giving Jules a standing ovation.
text: Jules looks to the group, takes a bow even as she makes a
text: face, spitting out stuffed-wolftaste. As she walks back
text: to the group, Curt hands Jules her beer, the others keep
dialog: applauding --
speaker_heading: HOLDEN

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: No, I wouldn’t want one of those...
text: ANGLE MARTY -- he’s glancing at curt, Frowning.
dialog: Something about all this seems a little off...
text: And Dana seems to notice it too. But she’s not about to
dialog: let Curt get under her skin --
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT’D)
dialog: Okay, Jules...
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: Da:
dialog: 
text: And just then, behind her -- WH-WHAM -- the cellar door
text: blows open. Everyone screams, startled.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What the hell was that?
text: They all look back at the now-open hole in the floor, As
text: they move toward it --
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: It’s the cellar door...
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I thought it was locked.
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: The wind must have blown it open...
speaker_heading: S
dialog: What wind...?
text: They all cluster around the hole. A set of stairs leads
text: down into the foreboding darkness. The group stares down
dialog: at it, all a little spooked --
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What do you think’s down there?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Why don’t we find out?
dialog: (then)
dialog: Dana...
text: Dana glances up at her. What?
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D) iF)
dialog: I dare you to go down into the cellar.
text: And we’re CLOSE ON DANA as she tries not. to show just how
text: much that scares her. OFF HER LOOR --
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR
text: Crrreak. Dana cautiously makes her way down the old
text: wooden staircase. It’s dark; Dana's flashlight barely
text: illuminates three feet in front of her.
text: She reaches the landing. Tries to keep her voice steady
text: as she calls back to the others --
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: How long do I have to stay down here?
speaker_heading: Ct
dialog: Oh, you know, just ‘til morning...
text: She stands at the base of the stairs, trains the
text: flashlight beam around the room. Curiosity getting the
text: better of her, she steps into the darkness,
dialog: Creak...
dialog: ae
text: The flashlight beam scans the room, catching a glint of a
text: metal -- OLD RUSTY TOOLS hang from hooks along the walls.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
dialog: Creak...
text: Dana keeps moving, heart pounding in her chest. Her
text: flashlight sweeps the area, finding a dusty old RECORD
text: PLAYER... a CHILD'S TOY CHEST... a dressmaker’s
text: MANNEQUIN...
text: Dana turns, beam sweeping across the wall. As it does
dialog: so, it finds --
text: A GHOSTLY FACE.
text: Staring right at her. Dana screams, nearly jumps out of
dialog: her skin --
speaker_heading: HOLDEN (0.8. )}
dialog: Dana?
text: As footsteps ring out from above, Dana angles the light
text: back towards the face, realizes --
text: It’s a PORTRAIT. A daguerrotype, to be Precise, of a
text: young woman, roughly fifteen, dressed in turn of the
text: century garb. She stares back at Dana with sad eyes.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN (CoNT’D)
dialog: You okay?
text: Dana turns to find Holden racing down the stairs, the
text: others right behind him.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Yeah. Sorry. I just --
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I just scared myself. It was stupid.
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: You called for help. Voids the dare.
dialog: Take your top off,
text: Marty strikes a match, lights an OLD oIL LANTERN hanging
text: from the wall. As orange light spills across the room...
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Oh my god...
text: ++.they get a full view of THE CELLAR. The room is big --
dialog: much bigger than we expected -- and every dark corner
text: seems to be filled with creepy clutter.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Look at all this...
dialog: 9
dialog: ie
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Uh, guys, I’m not sure it’s awesome to be
dialog: down here.
text: But the others aren't even listening to him. They spread
text: out, each focusing on a different part of the cellar --
text: Holden looks down at a variety of CHILD’S Toys scattered
text: across the floor. He picks up an ORNATE MUSIC BOX --
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Dude, seriously -- your cousin’s into
dialog: some weird shit.
text: Curt has picked up a CONCH when he sees a WOODEN SPHERE
text: sitting behind it. He puts the conch down and hoists the
text: sphere. It almost looks like a small globe, it’s s0
text: ornately carved, but it has dusty brass rings inlaid
text: around it -- it can be turned and adjusted almost like a
text: spherical Rubik’s cube.
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Yeah, pretty sure this ain’t his. Maybe
dialog: the people who put in that window...
text: Dana can’t take her eyes off the portrait of the girl.
text: On the vanity below it, she notices a variety of personal
text: effects: an old hairbrush... a silver mirror... and a
text: leather-bound BOOK.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Some of this stuff looks really old.
text: Jules studies the dressmaker’s mannequin. AN AMULET
text: hangs around its neck. Jules touches it...
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (almost to herself)
dialog: It’s beautiful...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Maybe we should go back upstairs...
dialog: (then)
dialog: I dare you all to go upstairs?
text: But even Marty can’t help but be intrigued as he spots an
text: OLD SUPER-8 PROJECTOR. He finds a film reel, starts
dialog: unspooling it...
text: HAUNTING MUSIC fills the air as Holden starts winding the
text: crank on the music box...
text: Curt starts turning the sphere parts -- they seem to be
dialog: lining up...
speaker_heading: QO
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: Dana brushes the dust off the book, revealing the word
text: “DIARY” on the cover...
text: Jules takes the amulet off the mannequin, holds it up to
text: her neck, looks for the clasp -- as though she were about
dialog: to try it on...
text: Marty holds the film strip up to the light, frowns as he
text: tries to discern what’s on it...
text: As Holden continues to wind the crank, the music BUILDS
text: and BUILDS... He’s staring down at the box-lid -- it’s as
text: though something’s about to pop right out of it... And
text: just as the music’s about to reach crescendo --
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Guys.
text: Holden stops winding the crank. The world goes quiet.
text: Everyone looks up from what they're doing.
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT‘D)
dialog: Guys, listen to this...
text: Reluctantly, each person puts down the object of his or
text: her attention and moves towards Dana.
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT’D)

dialog: (looks up)
dialog: And there's something in Latin.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Okay, I am drawing a line in the fucking

text: A small voice seems to whisk across the top of the room,
dialog: barely audible:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Read it....

dialog: around...
dialog: The fuck..?
speaker_heading: VOICE

text: laughing, breathing hard...
text: Hadley and Sitterson stare, (looking perhaps directly
dialog: into camera to make us even less comfortable)...
text: Jules swings on top and pulls her shirt off at last. She
text: takes her time, sliding her hands up her belly to her
text: breasts, finally to the clasp in the middle of her bra...
text: She pops it open, holding it together coyly for one
text: moment before pulling the bra off, revealing her breasts,
text: a sheen of sweat (and the fact that they’re not fake)
text: making them all the more enticing. She smiles knowingly,

dialog: Eat that, Stockholm...
text: He makes a small tweak on a dial, eyes still on the

text: ANGLE: ABOVE THE LOVERS the camera comes softly down
text: towards them, the tableau romantic and sensual. He's
text: atop her and a bit to the side, one hand (out of frame)
text: working under her panties as she moans, arms out...
text: CLOSE ON: HER HAND, running along the soft moss.
text: A rusty trowel nails it to the earth.
text: Jules SCREAMS, rearing up --- hampered by the hand that
text: won't move, as Curt tumbles off her, looking up to see:
dialog: Three zombies (as they will be called from now on) are
text: attacking them.
dialog: O,
dialog: a
dialog: “sal?
dialog: 56.
text: Skinny JUDAH is crouching over Jules, pulling his trowel
text: out even as MOTHER reaches around her neck with her
text: snaggle-toothed saw. MATTHEW, the biggest, is still a
text: few feet behind, ambling towards.
text: CLOSE ON: THE MOTHER'S BELLY as three burning coals flop
text: out of a slit in it, sizzling on Jules’s hair and the
dialog: moss.
text: She starts to draw the saw along Jules’s neck and curt
text: snaps out of it. He piledrives right into Mother --
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: Fuck away from her!
text: -- knocking her back on her ass. He turns to Judah just
text: as Judah digs the trowel into his arm. Curt howls,
text: trying to pull it out as Jules holds her bleeding neck,
text: trying to rise but weak.
text: Curt pulls his arm away, bringing Judah towards him and
text: then punches Judah hard right in the nose. The nose
text: breaks easily, crumbling a bit, Judah completely unfazed
text: by it. Curt looks over towards the third zombie.
text: Matthew stands a few feet away, leaning slightly.
text: Suddenly he lets a chain slide through his fingers, all
text: the way to the ground, pulled by a broken bear-trap, just
text: a rusty metal jaw with teeth: a turn-of-the-century mace
dialog: and chain.
text: Matthew grins.
text: The trap swings with sudden speed, whacking Curt’s head
text: (luckily not with the jagged side) and knocking him back,
text: bleeding and dazed.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Curt!
text: She tries to rise and Matthew swings again, digging the
text: claw of the trap into her back. She SCREAMS, arching
text: back and flopping face-down onto the ground, digging her
text: fingers into the earth as Matthew drags her backwards.
text: Curt stumbles up -- and Father is behind him, slipping
text: the shaft of his scythe over Curt’s head and pulling it
text: back hard against Curt’s throat. Curt thrashes, unable
text: to scream, as his feet are pulled off the ground. He
dialog: sees:
text: The screaming, pleading, whimpering Jules is kept in
text: place by Matthew’s foot as he yanks out the trap.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
text: Judah pulls her hair back, holding up her head -- her
text: eyes on Curt’s -- as Mother places the broken blade once

text: Inside the control room, the men are equally silent,
text: Truman trying hard not to lose it as Jules’s pleas fill
text: the air around.
text: CLOSE ON: JULES’S PLEADING EYES as we hear the horrible
text: scrape of the saw tearing flesh.
text: No sound in the console at all save scraping and
text: shuffling. ‘Truman has his eyes closed. Hadley and

text: panels at the far end of the room.
text: He opens the first and presses an ornate brass lever
dialog: down.
text: CLOSE ON: A MECHANISM almost like an old clock, Jules
text: Verne-esque. A small hammer strikes a vial that cracks,
text: dark red blood pouring out into a brass funnel that runs
text: down a thin pipe, seemingly a very long way.
scene_heading: INT. THE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
text: The pipe ends in the ceiling of a dark room we won't
text: really see just yet. The blood pours out onto a leaning
text: slab of dark marble, right into a groove at the top. The

text: different ways, forming a primitive picture of some sort

text: Matthew is bent over Jules’s corpse, but we can't see
text: what he’s doing, thankfully.
text: As they raise their blades, curt springs into action,
text: planting his feet on both of them and pushing as hard as
text: he can, knocking them back -- and Father as well, Curt
text: rolling over him and pulling himself free.
text: Gasping for breath, Curt scrambles on hands and knees
text: back towards the cabin, almost on his feet -- and the
text: blade of Father's scythe slices through the cuff of his
text: jeans, pulling his leg and dropping him back to earth.

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: What? No! No, come on!
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Hadley, Sitterson and Truman all pause to look around as
text: they too, are shaking. Hadley is returning from the

dialog: shrug...
speaker_heading: HADLEY
text: They’re getting excited downstairs.
speaker_heading: SITTERSON
dialog: Greatest Show on Earth...
scene_heading: INT. DANA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The rumbling subsides and she turns her attention back to
text: the dresser. As she gets it in place she hears the
text: window shatter and the chest begina to rock. She shoves
text: the bed against it and goes for the door.
text: It won’t open. She pulls, kicks, but it’s locked solid.
text: She’s staring at it, confused -- it looks so flimsy --
text: when the chest goes over and a zombie starts climbing in.
text: She hits it with a lamp but it has no effect.
text: She sees a second one coming, backs up against the wall --
text: and the picture on it goes flying, glass shattering,
text: making her jump.
text: Holden knocks out the rest of the one-way mirror.
text: There’s banging in his room but no zombies in yet.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: My door’s stuck!
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Mine too!
text: He looks at her sitch -- worse than his own -- and
text: beckons her to come through.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Come on!
dialog: a!
dialog: od
text: She stands on the bed and wriggles through, with his
text: help, but not without some cuts, and they both fall to
dialog: the floor.
text: They're still rising when the furniture Holden has piled
text: up is knocked away -- By Matthew.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: The bed!
text: They up-end it and shove it at the window, holding its
text: metal frame against the pounding from without. Dana
text: looks around for something else, sees:
text: ANGLE: UNDER THE BEDSPACE is a trapdoor.
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT'D)
dialog: Holden.
text: He looks, puts his shoulder to the bed to take the weight
text: as he indicates for her to check it out. She moves to it
text: and pulls it open -- nothing but blackness below. She
text: looks back at Holden.
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT'D) 2
dialog: Better or worse?
text: He sticks his foot out and slides a lamp to her. It’s
text: been set on the floor (during the furniture pile-up) but
text: still plugged in. She lowers it into the dark space,
text: lets it hang by its plug.
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s empty...
text: Holden gives the bed one last kick in place and moves to
text: the door, calling out:
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Curt! Curt!
text: The knob starts moving.
speaker_heading: CURT
dialog: (from without )
dialog: Unlock your door!
speaker_heading: HOLDEN

text: Holden moves to the edge of the space, takes a quick look
text: in and goes in head first, holding the edge and flipping
text: himself over to land on his feet. Dana slips down into
text: his upstretched arms right after, disappearing into the
dialog: hole.
scene_heading: INT. DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: It’s strangely quiet, as though it swallowed the noise
text: from above. The only light is from the dangling lamp,
text: and it throws the whole small room into a creepy half-
text: light. And creepy seems to be the general theme.
text: It’s a torture chamber, with a chair, chains, shackles,
text: and a table with some truly appalling instruments rusting
dialog: on it. Sweeney Todd would get squeamish in here.
text: They look around a bit, unwittingly fascinated.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: This is the Dark Room.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Which?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: From the diary. This ia where he killed

speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: (she’s cracking)
dialog: I brought us here. I found the room, the
dialog: diary... you’re all gonna die because of
dialog: me.
text: He takes her firmly by her arms.
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Nobody did this. Okay, it’s bad luck.
dialog: Horrible fucking luck but I’m not gonna
dialog: die and neither are you. We just gotta

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: There isn’t one.

speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: In the wall, something. Just look.
text: She pulls herself together -- moves to the far wall,
text: grabbing something that looks like @ small crowbar,
text: running one hand along the wall for a hidden door and
text: tapping with the bar occasionally to teat the sound of
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Curt?

text: trapdoor to the other ——
speaker_heading: HOLDEN
dialog: Hidden rooms were a staple of post-civil

text: catching under his arm and digging into the back of his
text: shoulder. He SCREAMS as Matthew starta hoisting him up
dialog: through the trap-door. ( >
text: Dana runa to him and helps him struggle, finally
text: overbalancing Matthew, who falis forward, stuck upside
text: down halfway through the trap-door, still grabbing at
text: Holden on the floor.
text: Holden painfully pulls the trap from his shoulder -- but
text: Matthew gets a hold of him, his mouth wide in a hissing
dialog: scream --
speaker_heading: . DANA
dialog: You like pain?
text: Dana runs the crowbar right through Matthew's face and
text: into the wall behind, Pinning him. Screams in his face:
speaker_heading: DANA (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s that work for ya?
text: Matthew grabs the bar and pulls at it -- Holden getting
text: free -- and Dana finds a kitchen knife, stabs Matthew
text: with it several times, shaking with rage. Matthew
text: finally hangs limp. Dana stares at him, breathing hard.

text: jolts Dana’s hand.
text: As we drop back wider, it looks like she’s dropping the
text: knife ‘cause she doesn’t like holding it. She turns her
text: back on Matthew, dragging Holden up. They move to the
text: other side of the room -- and the wall behind them opens,
text: Curt reaching in to grab them.

dialog: every culture, there is a god to appease.
dialog: As long as one sleeps, they all do. But
dialog: the other rituals have all failed.
text: There is a great rumbling -- they all stagger a bit, and
text: silt sifts down from the ceiling. As it subsides...
speaker_heading: THE DIRECTOR (CONT ’D)
dialog: The sun will rise in eight minutes.
dialog: (to Marty)
dialog: If you live to see it, the world will
dialog: end.
text: Neither of them questions the truth of it. They stare at
text: him a moment.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Maybe that’s the way it ought to be.
dialog: Maybe it’s time for a change.
speaker_heading: THE DIRECTOR
dialog: We’re not talking about change. We're

speaker_heading: DANA,
dialog: I’m aorry.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: So am I.
text: A werewolf leapa at her from the stairs and tears into
text: her! The gun goes flying as she falls to the ground,
text: trying to pull the beast off her.
text: The Director and Marty both move for the gun, and
text: struggle themselves, but Marty finally gets hold of it --
text: knocking The Director to the floor -~ and without
text: hesitation puts three bullets into the werewolf, sending
text: it screeching back up the stairs.
text: Dana rolls over, eyes wild, blood everywhere. The
text: Director rises and tackles Marty. They wrestle on the
text: floor, the gun just out of reach, the edge of the abyss
dialog: by their heads.
text: As they fight, Dana breathes heavily by the stairs,
text: unable to rise. She looks over as two small feet shamble
text: by her, in old, dirty shoes, the edge of a tattered
text: gingham dress swinging above the ankles.
text: Marty gets on top of The Director and pushes his forearm
text: against his windpipe. His back is to the girl.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Marty...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Director on top of him just as Patience swings her
text: hatchet, burying it in the back of the Director's skull.
text: Another tremor and Marty kicks The Director over the edge
text: of the circle. Patience, unwilling to let go her
text: hatchet, goes over with him.
text: Marty watches them a moment, then limps over to the
dialog: stairs,
text: Another, bigger tremor makes him pause, but it subsides
text: and he slumps in the corner next to Dana. She's
text: breathing shallow, tears streaming from her eyes, but
text: she's pretty alert.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: You know... I don't think... Curt even
dialog: has a cousin.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Huh. How are you?
speaker_heading: DANA

speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: I'm so sorry I almost shot you... 1
dialog: Probably wouldn't have...
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: Hey, shh, no... I totally get it.
text: As he continues, he lights up a joint.
speaker_heading: MARTY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry I let you get attacked by a
dialog: werewolf and then ended the world.
text: He takes a drag and holds it out to her. With a shakey
text: hand, she takes it and drags on it herself.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Nahh, you were right. Humanity...
text: (blows out smoke in a cynical
dialog: 'Pfft’)
dialog: It's time to give Someone else a chance.

dialog: Giant evil gods.
speaker_heading: DANA
dialog: Wish I coulda seen ‘em.
speaker_heading: MARTY
dialog: I know! That would be a fun weekend.
text: Biggest rumble yet. The floor starts bulging, eracking,
text: as dust and debris cloud the screen.
text: Dana holds out her hand. Marty puts his in it. Squeezes
text: it. They hold a moment.
text: An explosion of debris from below obliterates the
dialog: chamber.
scene_heading: EXT. CABIN - DAWN
text: We are wide on the cabin as a gnarled hand, bigger than
