speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey Brie?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It's Luke.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Hi Luke.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Um, I'm actually putting away some
dialog: groceries I just got.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What'd you get?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Um. Are you serious, do you want
dialog: me to tell you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, I guess not. Unless it's,
dialog: like, a ton of cat food and you
dialog: don’t have a cat.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Actually I have fifteen cats.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, that's weird.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Now you know.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So, did you still want to hang out
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah, but I have to meet up with
dialog: some friends later on so do you
dialog: mind if we meet kind of early?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sure, what time were you thinking?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Do you want to meet at seven?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm just kidding, seven is fine.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Is that enough time for you to get
dialog: ready? I'm sure that bed head
dialog: takes at least thirty minutes to
dialog: get into place.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So this is how it's gonna be, is
dialog: it?
text: Brie laughs.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You scared? You want to call the
dialog: whole thing off?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, no. So I'll see you at seven
dialog: at The Scene, right?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sounds good.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Okay. See you there.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay. Bye.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Bye.

scene_heading: INT. LUKE'S CAR- 6:44 PM 3
text: LUKE PUTNAM (25) drives down Santa Monica Blvd. listening to

dialog: view mirror.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SCENE, GLENDALE- 6:58 PM 4
text: Luke drives by the bar slowly, looking out the window for any
text: sign of Brie outside. None.
scene_heading: EXT. GLENDALE BLVD.- 7:01 PM 5
text: Luke walks up to the front of the bar and looks around.
text: After a minute of looking he pulls out his phone and dials a
dialog: number.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Colin. Hey.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Hey Luke, what’s up?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Not much.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Are you on your date?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Actually, I’m waiting outside.
dialog: We're supposed to meet at seven.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just calling because I felt
dialog: like a tool just standing here
text: waiting for her.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Right. Understood. Isn’t seven a
dialog: little early?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, I thought so. She said she
dialog: wanted to get together early
dialog: because she has to meet up with her
dialog: friends later. I don’t know if
dialog: maybe she was giving herself an out
dialog: just in case or if it’s true, but I
dialog: said whatever.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
text: Definitely sounds like an out.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. Hopefully she won't use it.
text: Luke turns and looks around again.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: What’s her name again?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Brie, like the cheese. And
dialog: actually, I think I see her car.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, okay.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Wait. Just hang on the line a
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Okay.
text: Luke tries to look in the door as someone leaves.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm watching this video on YouTube
dialog: and.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Alright, I’1l talk to you later
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Okay, have fun.
text: Luke closes the flap on his phone
dialog: bouncer.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: Got your I.D.?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Luke pulls out his wallet and I.D.
dialog: Bouncer.
speaker_heading: BOUNCER

dialog: and shows it to the
text: Luke walks into the bar and sees Brie sitting at a corner
text: table with three guys. One of them is SCOTT (28), who turns
text: and looks behind him.
text: Luke points at him and his expression reads “You?”
text: Scott acknowledges and turns to Brie.
dialog: scott
dialog: This is the guy you’re waiting for?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Luke gets to the table and extends a hand to shake.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What’s up Scott?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: We worked together.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Where? At our office?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, Scott’s one of the editors.
text: One of the other guys at the table, JOSH (30) chimes in.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What’s going on?
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: Sit down, sit down.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Uh, I’m gonna get a drink. You-
text: Luke points at Brie but realizes she has a drink in front of
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: -are good. Okay. I’11 be back.
text: Luke heads over to the bar.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: That's really weird.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah, I work at the reception desk.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: Really? Which floor? I’ve never
dialog: seen you.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Look harder buddy. I’m there.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: The bartender is in the middle of telling Luke that they’re
dialog: out of the beer he wants.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: No, we don’t have it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Really? Okay, can I get a Coors
dialog: Light?
text: The bartender pours a draft while Luke looks around some
dialog: more.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: That’s four.
text: Luke hands him a debit card.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (CONT’D)
dialog: You want to start a tab?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, please.
text: Luke grabs his drink and heads off.
speaker_heading: AT THE TABLE
text: Luke makes his way over to sit next to Brie, which puts him
text: slightly and awkwardly out of the circle of conversation.
text: Scott turns to him.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: Hey sorry, this is Josh and this is
dialog: Darrell.
text: Josh and Darrell both give nods or small waves.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hey, what’s up?
text: Brie turns to Luke and finally exchanges a personal greeting.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Hi. How’s it going?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What are you drinking?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: A little whiskey.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Uh, Coors Light. The Silver
dialog: Bullet.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Fancy.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. So you don’t know these
dialog: guys?
text: Suddenly Luke notices that no one at the table has been
text: talking. It’s just him and Brie while the rest of the guys
text: sit, arms folded, small smiles on their faces.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No, I just said hello while I was
dialog: waiting for you. Isn’t that weird?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I got here a little early and I
dialog: didn’t want to do that thing where
dialog: you just get out your cell phone
dialog: and talk to someone so you don’t
dialog: look stupid so I just came in to
dialog: get a drink and said hello.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Wow.
text: Scott angles back in.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: So, Darrell here is getting
dialog: married.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Congratulations! That’s great.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Is it?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Of course it is.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: We're trying to talk him out of it.
dialog: He’s only been dating her for three
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Don’t listen to them.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Three months! It’s like, a season.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: (to Brie mostly)
dialog: You want to know why I think he’s
dialog: getting married?
text: Luke takes a sip of beer.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: It’s not true.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
text: It’s because he’s going bald.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Why would you tell them that?
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: That's why he’s wearing that cap.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: So what if he’s going bald?
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Because he’s worried that when he
dialog: goes bald he’s not going to be able
dialog: to land any other girls.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: It’s not true.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (a la “Seinfeld”)
dialog: He’s BALD!
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Take off your hat.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: No!
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: There’s plenty of bald guys that
dialog: get laid.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Not with hot girls.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I’m sure I’ve seen some bald guys
dialog: with attractive girls.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Would you date a bald guy?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Me? I don’t know.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: (answering for her)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Maybe! It depends!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Look, flowing locks is the not the
dialog: only quality I look for in a man
dialog: but I mean, I prefer hair. I can
dialog: admit that.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Everybody prefers hair.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: But true love is hair-blind.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Hair-blind?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: But you gotta get the girl to fall
dialog: in love with you first and that’s
dialog: much harder to do if you're bald.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I think you are underestimating
dialog: most girls.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Girls are stupid.
text: Brie bristles visibly.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What?
text: Brie’s stare is cold as ice. Darrell and Scott pick up on it
text: but Josh doesn’t.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Look, this is one big conversation
dialog: that doesn’t need to be happening
dialog: because I’m not going bald.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (not budging)
dialog: Why are girls stupid?
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Josh is stupid, don’t worry about
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m just saying.
text: Luke touches the sleeve of Brie’s jacket.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I like this jacket.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: Brie barely registers the compliment. Instead her whole
text: demeanor changes and she slouches back into her seat.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Dude Luke, you bailed just in time.
text: The office is getting insane.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Mark just started losing his mind
dialog: for no apparent reason and the work
dialog: load has totally doubled.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That sucks.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Have you found a new job yet?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Nope. Not really looking for one.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: Nice. Living the dream.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I was an assistant. Like an intern
text: at his office.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: (to Brie)
dialog: And you work there too?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Crazy.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Hey. Hey. I’m sorry I forgot your
dialog: name.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Brie.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Sorry. Brie, like the cheese.
dialog: I’1ll remember that.. Let me ask
dialog: you something.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Dude wait. You know who else is
dialog: named after cheese and is amazing?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Monterey Jack from Chip ‘n’ Dale
dialog: Rescue Rangers.
text: Scott laughs.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Right?! Whenever he smelled cheese
text: he would just start floating toward
text: it like a zeppelin. Amazing.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: A zeppelin?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Dude stop, I have a serious
dialog: question.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Okay. . .
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: I’m getting married in four months
dialog: and we have a date set and
dialog: everything. And so now my fiancee
dialog: wants to stop having sex from now
dialog: until the wedding so it can feel
dialog: kind of like having sex for the
dialog: first time again on the wedding
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Isn't that stupid?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s the question?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: I mean, is this a female thing? Am
dialog: I crazy or does it not make any
dialog: sense?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I don’t know. It doesn’t make
dialog: sense to me, but if she feels
dialog: strongly about it and it makes
dialog: sense to her then you should
dialog: probably just do it.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: We had sex on the first night we
dialog: met.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
text: He tells this to everyone when he
text: first meets them.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: So it’s like, what’s the point?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Like I said, I don’t know. I gave
text: a guy a handjob at an assembly in
dialog: ninth grade but some people are
dialog: just weird about sex.
text: Luke’s eyes visibly widen as he takes a big sip of beer.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: She probably just feels guilty. Is
dialog: she religious or her parents, are
dialog: they really religious?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Wait, so could other kids see you
text: giving him the handjob in the
dialog: assembly?
speaker_heading: BRIE
text: No, he put his backpack on his lap
dialog: or something. It was discreet.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Dude, tell them what happened.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: What happened what?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: When you met her parents.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: No. Stop interrupting!
text: Scott bursts out laughing. Luke and Brie are lost.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: It’s brilliant.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: No no.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Tell the fucking story!
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I'm telling it.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: God damn you guys.
text: Scott continues laughing.
text: Luke is almost done with his beer.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So Darrell went and spent the
dialog: weekend with his girlfriend's
dialog: parents last week. They live in
dialog: Michigan.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Is this an embarrassing meet the
dialog: parents story?
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Big time.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: He was in Michigan and his
dialog: girlfriend's parents took everyone
dialog: out for an engagement party kind of
dialog: deal and this guy gets hammered.
dialog: Just fucking stone cold drunk.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Everybody was buying me shots.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: So they go back to the house late
dialog: that night and him and his
text: girlfriend try to have sex.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: What? What do you mean try?
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: You said you fell asleep like three
text: minutes into it.
dialog: scott
text: Three minutes into it is two
text: minutes after it’s over.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Yeah, I fell asleep but we had sex
dialog: for a little bit first.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: Whatever, so they fall asleep naked
text: and he wakes up at like 4 am
text: feeling like he’s gonna barf.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: It was inevitable.
speaker_heading: JOSH
text: He stumbles to the bathroom, still
text: naked and pukes like six times.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: This story is fucking gross so far.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Hang on, hang on. So, he finishes
text: up and stumbles back into the
text: bedroom, climbs back into bed and
text: falls asleep. It’s not until the
dialog: next morning does anybody realize
dialog: that he had gone back into the
text: wrong room and climbed naked into
text: bed with his girlfriend’s brother.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: My future brother-in-law.
text: Brie laughs. Scott is cracking up too.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s totally fucking true.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That kind of shit doesn’t happen to
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: I wish it didn’t but it did.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Amazing.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Was he mad?
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: He took it pretty well. He was
dialog: cool. It wasn’t as damaging as it
dialog: could have been.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: I know, I know. Believe me, I
dialog: thought that stuff only happened in
dialog: John Hughes movies, but no.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: John Hughes?
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Yeah, there’s a scene like that in
dialog: Planes, Trains and Automobiles.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I haven't seen it.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: “Those aren’t pillows!”
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It’s good.
text: Luke is finished with his beer and sees a break in the
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Brie)
dialog: You want another drink?
text: Brie looks at her drink- just a few sips left.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Actually, I should probably get
dialog: going to meet my friends.
text: Luke looks a little frustrated.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: The best part of that movie is when
text: John Candy turns into the devil for
dialog: like three seconds when they are
text: stuck in between the two trucks.
dialog: Like, for no reason, he has a devil
text: costume on for three seconds and
text: he’s screaming.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: I’m gonna have a cigarette though,
dialog: do you want one?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Uh, sure.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SCENE- MINUTES LATER 7
text: Luke and Brie stand outside the bar on the corner. Brie
text: pulls a pack of American Spirits out of her purse and hands
dialog: one to Luke.
text: He twiddles it around his fingers while she pulls one out for
dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Hang on.
text: Brie approaches a SMOKER standing next to them.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Excuse me, do you have a light?
speaker_heading: SMOKER
dialog: Yeah.
text: Smoker pulls a Zippo out of his pocket and lights it for
text: Brie. She dangles her cigarette in and takes a puff.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: Brie comes back over to Luke and offers him her smoke.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thanks. How come you have
dialog: cigarettes but no lighter?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: It’s a way of trying to quit. Cut
dialog: down at least.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Does it work?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Does it look like it’s working?
text: Luke lights his cigarette with hers and hands it back.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So you gotta go huh?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah, I think so. My friends are
dialog: kind of waiting for me.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That’s cool.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I can’t believe you know those
dialog: guys.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t know all those guys, just
dialog: Scott. We just worked together.
dialog: But now we don’t.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: So, this was your first week of
dialog: unemployment, right?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, I’m on day three.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: But you’ve got a plan.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m working on a piece that I
text: pitched to the Times.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: The New York Times? Jesus. You
dialog: didn’t tell me that.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: The L.A. Times.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Oh. That’s cool too.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, they have this kind of long-
dialog: winded editorial process so I’m
text: getting bounced around a little
dialog: bit. But they’re giving me time,
dialog: which is nice.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That is nice of them. You've got
dialog: enough money to make it last?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That’s the plan. I took out a loan
dialog: from the bank.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I figure it’s like going back to
dialog: school but I get to spend the money
dialog: the way I want.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That's pretty smart. How much did
dialog: you get?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: They gave me a loan for five
dialog: thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m eating sandwiches.
text: Brie raises her eyebrows.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I would have asked for ten. If
dialog: you’re gonna go, go all the way.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well I’m just more frugal than you
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Or less daring.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I always thought it would be funny
dialog: to do a spoof show of “The
dialog: Fraggles”, you know that show?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But have it be “The Frugals”
dialog: instead and it’s just a bunch of
dialog: tight wad investors and bankers
dialog: living underground being like “You
dialog: spent how much on socks!?”
text: Brie chuckles. Luke is pleased.
text: They take a drag.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: How about you? How’ve you been?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Uh, fine. Work is boring and
dialog: stressful.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah but that building would
dialog: collapse if you weren't there.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Ha, right. And that’s the only
dialog: reason I’m still there. To hold
dialog: that building up.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, what else would you be doing?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I mean, I don’t know. I guess I
dialog: can’t complain. It’s a safe job and
dialog: I’m making money. The money’s not
dialog: the problem, you know?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, totally.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah, for Christmas last year I
dialog: bought my mom her first pair of
dialog: really expensive shoes. Not her
dialog: first pair- you know.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: How expensive?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Just- expensive. They don’t have
dialog: them where she lives. I don’t even
dialog: think she knew they existed. I
dialog: mean, she used to be this fashion
text: maven but she’s starting to lag a
dialog: bit in her old age. So, I gotta
text: pick up her slack.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I know what you mean. I won a game
dialog: show and-
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Wait, you won a game show?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You haven't heard of it.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Nobody's heard of it.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Come on, what is it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It’s called On the Cover.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What the hell is On the Cover?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It’s just. They show you a fake
dialog: magazine cover of like, People
dialog: Magazine with Denzel Washington's
dialog: picture on it and you have to name
text: who’s “on the cover”.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Sounds easy.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It is.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: And retarded.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Have you ever done it? It’s tough
dialog: getting that buzzer to work before
dialog: anyone else's.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Okay, okay. I’m sorry. But you
dialog: won, right?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: How much money?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Ten thousand bucks.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Ten thousand bucks!? For a little
dialog: game show no one has heard of?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, so that Christmas was the
dialog: first time I could ever afford to
dialog: get everyone in my family cool
dialog: presents.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Jesus Christ.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m usually the guy that gives
dialog: everyone a CD or a book, but I
dialog: actually got some cool gifts that
dialog: year.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Loans and game shows, no wonder you
dialog: don’t need a job.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Exactly.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: How much do you have left?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Why, you gonna order more expensive
dialog: drinks?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: None.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Really, none. I bought a car. Not
dialog: a new one or anything. A used one,
dialog: but I bought it straight up.
dialog: Caaash.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: So you're broke again?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Broke is a strong word. No, I got
dialog: the loan. I got some savings. And
dialog: I have a car.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I could totally win that show.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t know if it’s still on the
dialog: air.
text: They pause and smoke their cigarettes.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I’d do really well at Jeopardy.
dialog: It’s all proper names and places
dialog: and one or two-word responses and
dialog: I’m good at that stuff.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay, what's the capitol of Cyprus?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Cyprus? Greece?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Nicosia.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Look it up. I remember it because
dialog: it’s spelled close to Nicoise
text: salad. Mnemonically.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m impressed. Most people
dialog: something about Cyprus on the news
dialog: and think it’s like, a made-up
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: But Jeopardy. Or Presidents! I
dialog: know a shit-ton about presidents.
dialog: Half the stuff on Jeopardy is
dialog: presidential facts, so I wouldn't
dialog: even have to study that.
text: Luke smokes, doesn’t really inhale. Brie catches this, but
dialog: says nothing.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd win and I'd use the money to
dialog: buy my mom a house. A beach house.
dialog: Out near Rockport or somewhere
text: maybe a little less uppity.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Moms love beach houses.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: It was really nice getting a solid
dialog: gift for my mother. Even if it was
dialog: just shoes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What did your dad get?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Dad got a tie. It’s what he likes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: My mom asked me to make her a mix
dialog: last year. She wanted to know what
dialog: I was listening to. I put some
dialog: songs on a CD for her and gave it
dialog: to her. I made her a mixtape. I
dialog: put “2 Minutes to Midnight” by Iron
text: Maiden as a hidden bonus track at
dialog: the end and she wasn’t nearly as
dialog: amused about that as I was.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I don’t know that one.
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: (sings but trails off mid-
dialog: way )
dialog: “2 Minutes to Midnight!!!!"
text: Brie nods and looks around.
text: A girl clacks outside on her heels. She pulls up next to
text: Brie. Her name is STACY and she talks loudly into her cell
dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: STACY
dialog: I don’t care what he eats. It bores
dialog: me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Did she hit you? Did she hit him?
text: Brie and Luke listen as Brie finishes her cigarette.
speaker_heading: STACY (CONT'D)
dialog: It doesn’t matter that he’s from
dialog: South America. People aren’t any
text: different down there. They follow
dialog: the same rules as the rest of the
dialog: world.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There’s meat. And then there’s
dialog: grass.
dialog: 27.
text: Luke catches Brie’s eye. He makes a face. She makes one back.
speaker_heading: STACY (CONT'D)
dialog: And that’s what you’ve gotta tell
dialog: them.
dialog: (beat)
text: Hold on a second.
dialog: (turns to Brie; sotto
dialog: voce)
dialog: Can I have one of those, I’m so
dialog: sorry?
text: Brie, smiling, hands one over.
speaker_heading: STACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (back into phone)
dialog: No, I’m sorry, I was talking to
dialog: someone.
text: Brie steps her cigarette out. She notices Luke has almost
text: half of his left.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Slow smoker.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Savor it, that’s what I say.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You don’t smoke do you?
text: Luke inhales a drag and blows the smoke out confidently, as
dialog: if that answers the question.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sometimes.
text: They look around at the few other people standing outside. A
text: few feet away stand a GUY and a GIRL seemingly not very happy
dialog: with each other.
text: The guy holds his phone out and is texting away. The girl
text: looks at him with disgust.
text: After a moment and in one fell swoop she SWATS the phone out
text: of his hands and it BOUNCES on the concrete.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Luke and Brie look at each other with wide eyes.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yikes.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I think there’s gonna be a fight.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I think so too.
text: They look again but the couple have wandered off up the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you ever been in a fight?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No. Have you?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. In eighth grade. Everybody
dialog: was picking fights and it was like,
dialog: the cool thing. So I picked the
dialog: smallest, weakest guy in the class
dialog: and I made him fight me.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What a jerk!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I know. His name was Dawson Mullen
dialog: and he was from Canada.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Poor Dawson Mullen.
text: Brie gets out another cigarette to smoke.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Our high school was right next to
dialog: this movie theatre called the
dialog: Bijou. When you wanted to pick a
dialog: fight with someone, you went up to
dialog: them and said ‘Bijou parking lot.
dialog: Two Thirty.’
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That was the call out?
text: Still listening, Brie bums another light off of someone.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. The thrown gauntlet. Bijou
dialog: parking lot was where all the real
dialog: shit went down. Pot smoking. All
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I guess my friend Lauren’s house
dialog: would be our Bijou parking lot
dialog: equivalent because that’s where we
dialog: always did the bad stuff.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So. There were a bunch of kids all
text: waiting on the grassy side of this
dialog: movie theatre. And they form this
dialog: big circle and we get in the
dialog: middle. And Dawson is like “Come
dialog: on, start something. Start
dialog: something.” So I pushed him and he
text: just clocks me in the face. Out of
dialog: nowhere.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Ha!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I didn’t fall over or anything but
dialog: man, it hurt. And I guess normal
dialog: people get angry when they get
dialog: punched in the face but I just kind
dialog: of realized that fighting was dumb.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Aww, poor little pacifist.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: He sort of knocked some sense into
dialog: me. So, that was the end of the
dialog: fight.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You lost in one punch?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I forfeited.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I kind of had a fight once. This
dialog: girl was really pissing me off in
dialog: tenth grade. She thought I was
dialog: flirting with her boyfriend or
dialog: something, which I probably was.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: But she tried to start something in
dialog: the cafeteria. And she was Puerto
dialog: Rican so the whole lunch room split
dialog: into whites versus Puerto Ricans
dialog: for the fight that never actually
dialog: happened. It was like the Jets
dialog: versus the Sharks.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: West Side Story reference. Don’t
dialog: worry if you don’t get it, I’m the
dialog: nerd, not you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I was in West Side Story.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Really? Who’d you play?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Like, Jet Boy number four.
text: Brie laughs.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s hilarious.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I remember we had to give ourselves
dialog: names on these character sheets, to
dialog: make you feel like you were really
dialog: “acting.” And so I turned mine in
dialog: with the name “Davey”. But my
dialog: friends all turned in these cool
dialog: names like “Action” and “One
dialog: Punch”. And I was stuck with
dialog: “Davey”.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I had to do the same thing when I
dialog: was a pink lady in “Grease”. We
dialog: had those sheets too. You had to
dialog: fill in all this unnecessary
dialog: information like what our favorite
dialog: ice cream flavor and stuff was. So
dialog: dumb.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Can I have another one of those?
dialog: 31.
text: Brie hands Luke another cigarette and he lights it with hers.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: My high school did this
dialog: Shakespeare play called “The Merry
dialog: Wives of Windsor”. I wasn’t in it
dialog: but I saw it, and there’s a scene
text: where two guys are talking to each
dialog: other. And they’re talking about
dialog: something, but I guess they forget
dialog: their lines because there’s just
dialog: this sudden silence: like, fifteen
text: seconds of nothing. Then one guy
text: turns to the other and says “So,
dialog: how ‘bout the Bulls?”
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Swear to God. And this is during
dialog: the playoffs, so the other guy’s
dialog: like: “Repeat the three-peat!” So
dialog: they talk about the Bulls for a
dialog: good two minutes. I guess someone
dialog: was supposed to enter and they
dialog: didn’t or something, but then the
text: three-peat guy just got up and
dialog: started doing the worm.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: The audience loved it. They all
dialog: cheered when he did the worm. In
text: the middle of “The Merry Wives of
dialog: Windsor”.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s hilarious.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That’s Tennessee.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I saw a production of “West Side
dialog: Story” that was like, the traveling
dialog: Broadway production. And you know
dialog: how in the end, Chino is supposed
text: to run out on stage with the gun
dialog: and shoot Tony?
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well I guess the guy playing Chino
text: forgot the gun because he runs out
text: on the stage. Pauses for a second.
text: Then takes off his shoe and yells
text: “Poison boot!” and throws it at
dialog: Tony.
text: Luke laughs.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT’D)
text: And it hits him in the chest and he
text: just looks at it for a second and
text: then falls over.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Poison boot?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Best improv ever. But the best
dialog: part is that the scene has to
dialog: continue and Maria has to pick up
dialog: the shoe and be like “How much
dialog: poison is left in this boot, Chino?
dialog: Enough for you? Enough for me?”
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That’s worse than the worm.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Way worse.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Do you still do any theater?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No. I got over that.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, me too. My swansong was the
dialog: Head Flying Monkey in “The Wiz”.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: “The Wizard of Oz"?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, no. “The Wiz”.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Really?
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh yeah. Public school’s are all
dialog: about color blind casting. We had
dialog: white people trying to sing soul in
dialog: “The Wiz”, we did “The Sound of
text: Music” with three white and two
dialog: Filipino Von Trapp kids. And we
dialog: even had black Nazis in “The Sound
dialog: of Music”.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Jesus. I haven’t thought about
dialog: this stuff in a long time. It is
dialog: absurd.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I love it. I love High School
dialog: stuff.
text: They are finished with their cigarettes.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to go back inside?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: They turn to head back into the bar and are met at the
text: doorway by Scott, Darrell and Josh heading out.
speaker_heading: scoTtrT
dialog: Hey, we're heading to that other
dialog: bar if you guys want to come.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Umm. I think we’re gonna hang out
dialog: here a bit more.
speaker_heading: sScoTtT
dialog: Okay. Come to Saddle Ranch on
dialog: Sunset if you change your mind.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay. See you.
speaker_heading: DARRELL
dialog: Nice meeting you.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Bye.

dialog: 34.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE- MINUTES LATER 8
text: Luke stands at the bar ordering two more drinks.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES- EVENING 9
text: The sun has set and the night takes over the city. It’s a
text: cool, calm evening all across Los Angeles.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE- LATER 10
text: Brie and Luke stand by the wall of the bar, drinking and
dialog: talking.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You work with kids, right?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah, I do. I work with middle and
dialog: elementary school kids. Volunteer
dialog: work, mostly.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I didn’t know you were a teacher.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: We do mostly after school stuff and
dialog: there’s workshops that we have
dialog: during the day. Kids from all these
dialog: schools around Venice take field
dialog: trips to come see us, so they’re
dialog: usually pretty happy to be
dialog: somewhere else.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What do you work-shop with ten year-
dialog: olds?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, one of them, my favorite
dialog: actually, is a storytelling
text: workshop. They come in and the idea
dialog: is to get them to write a story as
dialog: a group. I help them through. This
dialog: is pretty fun, actually. We have a
text: computer that projects up onto the
dialog: wall so you can see what’s being
dialog: typed.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sounds like a big operation.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: It's pretty big. It’s me and five
dialog: other people. Got a typist, an
dialog: illustrator who draws on this pad
dialog: that’s connected to another
dialog: computer, but here’s the best part.
dialog: There’s a cranky editor named Mr.
text: Crabtree who lives in the attic,
dialog: and occasionally he'll come in over
dialog: this intercom. He’s like: “Where's
dialog: my stories! I'm trying to run a
dialog: publishing company here! I need
text: fifteen stories by twelve o'clock
dialog: or Brie's going to lose her job!"
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: The kids respond to pressure like
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah. It’s just another one of the
text: volunteers in the office talking in
text: a grumpy voice through a baby
text: monitor. They get a kick out of it.
dialog: They kind of freeze up, but then
dialog: after awhile, after the editor
text: comes back on and yells at them a
dialog: little bit more, they get wise.
dialog: They usually spend most of the
dialog: workshop trying to figure out which
dialog: one of us is the voice from the
dialog: attic.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And what exactly do you do?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: They come in and I ‘conduct’ them.
text: All on the floor sitting in a
dialog: circle, like fourteen or eighteen
dialog: kids. I ask them, what’s the first
dialog: thing you need to write a story?
text: Luke waits. Brie nods at him to answer the question.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, a title.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No. The title comes last. You can’t
dialog: get married to a title early on.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: A main character?
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Exactly. I ask them what their
dialog: favorite animal is, and we usually
dialog: go from there. Sometimes it’s
dialog: pirates or astronauts, but animals
dialog: always do well in a pinch.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You've gotta make sure there’s a
dialog: boy and a girl, right?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Gotta have both. If there’s more
dialog: girls in the class, the main
text: character becomes a girl squid or a
dialog: girl construction worker. Same
dialog: thing if it’s more boys.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: How long does it take.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Two hours. We all write the story
dialog: together and then the kids have to
dialog: go and finish up their specific end
text: to the story.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So you get fifteen stories with all
dialog: different endings?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: For the most part. You'd be
dialog: surprised how many of their endings
dialog: are the same. We try to push them
dialog: to be more inventive, but the kids
dialog: are of the same mind about things,
dialog: without even knowing it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: So they all end with the girl squid
text: and the boy pirate living happily
dialog: ever after?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You got a better ending?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No. I wish those two all the best.
dialog: They deserve it.
text: The conversation lulls. Different CHARACTERS from the bar
dialog: take over.

speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Delilah.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That’s a great middle name.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: I love it. I’m going to name my
dialog: daughter Delilah.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Did you grow up religious?
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Hunh? No.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You know there’s major religious
text: overtones with a name like that.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Samson and Delilah? You don’t know
dialog: that story? She’s the one who cut
dialog: off all his hair when he was
dialog: asleep.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: She did what?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Samson was the strongest man in the
text: city. And Delilah cut off his hair
text: with a pair of golden scissors. She
dialog: took his strength by cutting off
text: his hair.
speaker_heading: MARINA
dialog: What book is that from?
text: Adam is incredulous.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The bible?
scene_heading: AT ANOTHER SPOT 11

speaker_heading: CHAS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANOTHER SPOT 12

speaker_heading: LEMUEL
dialog: You got a prostate?
speaker_heading: NAN

speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: It’s not cooked.
speaker_heading: LEMUEL
dialog: What’s it like though? How big is
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Looks like...fibrous...I think it
dialog: had a tumor. It was hard.
speaker_heading: LEMUEL
dialog: You touched it?
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: One was a tumor and one wasn’t.
text: With the forceps.
speaker_heading: LEMUEL
dialog: Poke me where you think it feels
dialog: like.
text: Nan pokes his arm in a couple of places.
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Kind a like that.
text: Lemuel pokes his own arm.
dialog: 13
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: NAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Raw steak. Kind of. Maybe like a
dialog: chicken steak.
speaker_heading: LEMUEL
dialog: You're not a vegetarian, are you?
speaker_heading: NAN
dialog: Most of the time. No cows.
scene_heading: BACK AT LUKE AND BRIE- LATER 13
text: Still sitting, Brie unloads her purse onto the table. She
text: produces a phone from deep inside its guts.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: We should call Leslie.
text: Luke holds a hand over his right eye like an eye-patch.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Leslie?
text: Brie punches him.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BRIE
text: Because she’s on a first date.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah, she’s on a date with Average
dialog: Man. Have you met him?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: BRIE
text: He’s on the fifth floor. He’s a
dialog: lawyer. He’s nice and everything
dialog: but he’s totally ordinary so Leslie
dialog: and I call him Average Man.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That doesn’t sound very good.
dialog: 14
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: We should see if he becomes Above
text: Average Man on a date.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay.
text: Brie gets out her phone and dials. Luke takes a sip of his
text: beer and looks around.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Hey Leslie. . . How’s your date? .
dialog: . . Really? I assumed it was gonna
dialog: be bad since you picked up...
dialog: That's good. . . Is he buying you
dialog: average priced drinks? . . . Nice.
text: Luke stretches and works on his beer.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Is he right there? . . . Okay, I’1l
dialog: just ask yes and no questions. . .
dialog: Does he have man boobs?. . . Can
dialog: you see them?
text: Brie is amusing herself.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Has he mentioned his car more than
dialog: two times already? . . . Are you
dialog: gonna make him double bag it?
text: Brie looks at Luke but doesn’t make any indication of trying
dialog: to wrap it up.
text: Luke mimes out “I’m going to the bathroom”.
text: Brie nods.
scene_heading: INT. BAR BATHROOMS— CONTINUOUS 14

dialog: hungry?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah I could eat.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Where can we go?
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: There’s a pizza place nearby.
dialog: up the street I think.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Is it good?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: 42.
dialog: Just
dialog: Yeah. I mean, it’s pizza but it’s
dialog: good.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Pizza sounds amazing.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Let’s do it.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: O-kay.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SCENE- MINUTES LATER
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: Brie reaches over and downs the last sip of Luke’s beer.
dialog: 16
text: Luke and Brie step outside of the bar to find a small
text: gathering of people out smoking or talking.
dialog: I’m not exactly sure which way it
dialog: is.
text: Luke walks over to them.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey man, where is that place?
text: Luke looks around and sees two guys, TALON and SPENCER
text: Talon is holding a TO-GO PIZZA BOX
text: Talon looks up and realizes Luke means the pizza.
speaker_heading: TALON
text: It’s right down the street there.
dialog: Why, you want pizza?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, I think we’re gonna get a
dialog: slice.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Dude, you can have some of this, we
dialog: can’t eat it all.
dialog: 43.
text: Talon opens up the box to show a pristine Hawaiian Pizza.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh thanks but I think we’re gonna
dialog: get our own.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Seriously man, we can’t eat it all.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No thanks.
text: Spencer leans in and adds-
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Dude, we can’t eat it all.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Come on. Eat it. It’s Hawaiian.
text: Luke looks to Brie, who shrugs.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: Luke and Brie reach in and grab a slice each. Talon
text: out his free hand.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: I’m Talon. This is Spencer.
text: Everyone shakes.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Nice to meet you. I’m Brie.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Luke.
dialog: reaches
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Cool. Dig in.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You're sure you don’t mind?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Dude, we can’t eat it all.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: What do you do?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Um, nothing at the moment.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Really? Nothing?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Brie and Spencer begin their own conversation.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Where are you from Spencer?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: Virginia Beach.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Really? Is that nice?
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: I guess. Missy Elliott is from
dialog: there too.
text: While Talon talks to Luke, he tries to keep one ear on
text: Spencer and Brie’s conversation.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: That’s cool. Have you ever heard
dialog: of Fulbright & Lewis?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Is that the sofa company?
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: No, it’s a law firm. It’s the law
dialog: firm I work for.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh cool.
dialog: 17
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Yeah, they represent a lot of
dialog: celebrities, big civil cases. Like
dialog: Denzel Washington was just in our
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: They let you have that beard?
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: They let me do whatever the fuck I
dialog: want. I’m a genius.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you guys going inside?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Uh.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Come on, you guys need a drink. I’m
dialog: buying.
speaker_heading: SPENCER
dialog: (to Talon)
dialog: You owe me like, two thousand
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE- LATER 17
text: Talon continues to tell Luke about his job while Spencer and
text: Brie talk about something else.
text: Two SUPER HOT GIRLS come up with their eyes on the pizza box.
speaker_heading: SUPER HOTTIE #1
dialog: Hey. You guys have pizza?
text: Spencer and Talon immediately shift their focus to these new
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: TALON
dialog: Yeah dude, have a slice.
text: Luke looks at Brie and they silently agree to make a break
dialog: for it.
text: They slip off while the guys are distracted.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Those guys were nice.
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, you want to play pool?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I’m terrible.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Good. I’11 win then.
text: They make their way towards the pool table.
text: Luke puts some money in and racks the pool balls over the
dialog: following:
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Actually those guys remind me of
dialog: these models I used to live with.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Those guys?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah. Just the way they talked and
dialog: acted. I don’t know, the demeanor.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You lived with models?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Mmm hmm. It was what I like to
dialog: refer to as a ‘quick-change’
dialog: atmosphere. It’s like theatre,
dialog: always changing outfits. Changing
dialog: zip codes, changing drugs. Changing
dialog: the people you’re friends with.
dialog: Everything. You go out to bars in
dialog: Beverly Hills and all the drinks
dialog: are paid for. It’s an interesting
dialog: way to live your life.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Living through the kindness of
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I don’t know if ‘kindness’ is the
dialog: word I'd use.
text: Luke breaks. He pauses. Considers the table.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What do you think about that?
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: About the fact that men are
dialog: supposed to buy the drinks? Don’t
dialog: you think they’re only buying
dialog: drinks to get you drunk?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: And not for the actual enjoyment of
dialog: buying someone a drink?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
text: Brie holds up her drink.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Are you trying to get me drunk?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, but pizza guys might be.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Listen. That’s the way it is. I
dialog: don’t mind some churlish guy buying
dialog: me a couple of vodka sodas. I don’t
dialog: have to go home with him. There’s
dialog: no contract I’m aware of. There’s
dialog: no body promise.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Isn't that patronizing?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I don’t think about people
dialog: patronizing me. It’s just a social
dialog: structure. A way of doing things
dialog: that’s accepted. ‘A’ leads to ‘B.’
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So ‘A’ is the initial contact?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Sure. Then ‘B’ is the next drink
dialog: or the conversation or whatever
text: comes next.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What happens when you get to ‘C’?
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, if ‘C’ means me taking my
text: shirt off and barreling down on
dialog: some guy in the middle of the
dialog: bar...There doesn’t have to be a
dialog: ‘C’. The ball is in my court.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What if you make the initial
dialog: contact? Then by the time it gets
text: to ‘C’, the ball is in their court.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No. Wrong. When it gets to ‘C’,
dialog: the ball is never in the guy’s
dialog: court.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh really?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Never. But here’s where the theory
dialog: fails: Marriage.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Getting married...
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Wait, backtrack a second. How
dialog: often do you barrel down on some
text: guy in the middle of the bar?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Fuck off. Get your mind out of the
dialog: gutter. How would you like it if
dialog: girls were always buying you drinks
dialog: and staring at your boobs while you
dialog: tried to have a conversation with
dialog: them?
text: This startles Luke. He can’t help but glance down at Brie’s
text: boobs.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT’D)
dialog: You just looked at my boobs.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I know! You said the word “boobs”
dialog: and it just happened. Sorry.
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, see?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I apologize.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Think about every girl you know.
dialog: What if every relationship you had
dialog: with a member of the opposite sex
dialog: was based on the assumption that
dialog: they would fuck you if they got the
dialog: chance? Like, every time some guy
dialog: said he wanted to get a drink with
dialog: you or go for a walk, that that guy
dialog: is actually thinking: maybe I'll
dialog: have a chance with her tonight.
dialog: Maybe tonight will be the night she
dialog: gets drunk and wants to fuck me.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That’s pretty dire.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: It is pretty fucking dire, if you
dialog: wanna know the truth. But wait:
dialog: marriage. Have you ever heard about
dialog: the Coolidge effect?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Calvin Coolidge. Thirtieth
dialog: president of the United States.
dialog: 1923 to...
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: 1930.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Bullshit.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I told you. I’m not fucking around
dialog: with my presidential knowledge.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Jeopardy’s gonna call you any day.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: But, so. Calvin Coolidge and his
dialog: wife...Grace...are taking separate
text: tours of a farm somewhere.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
text: Mrs. Coolidge is walking along and
text: she sees all these hens hopping
text: around and pecking at things and
dialog: Mrs. Coolidge says, “Man, that’s a
dialog: lot of hens. That’s a lot of work
dialog: for one old rooster.” The tour
dialog: guide says, “He’s fine, ma’am. The
dialog: rooster works very hard.” Then
dialog: Mrs. Coolidge says, “Really? He's
dialog: working hard every day?” “Oh
dialog: sure”, says the man. “Dozens of
dialog: times a day”. “Interesting!” says
dialog: Mrs. Coolidge. “You be sure to
dialog: tell that to the President!”
text: Brie catches a breath.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT’D)
text: So later, Coolidge is walking along
dialog: with the same tour guide and he
text: passes the hens. The tour guide
dialog: tells him with Mrs. Coolidge said.
dialog: “Same hen every time?” he asks.
dialog: “Well, no”, says the guide. “It’s a
dialog: different one every time.”
text: Coolidge leans in to the guide and
dialog: smirks and says, “You tell that to
dialog: Mrs. Coolidge.”
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: There’s a moral to this story.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: There is. And it’s that men are
dialog: hard-wired to spread their seed as
dialog: often as possible with as many
dialog: different partners as possible.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, it makes sense, from an
dialog: evolutionary standpoint.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No, it’s bullshit! They do these
dialog: experiments where they put one male
text: rat in a cage with ten female rats
text: and he fucks them all like crazy.
dialog: But then he gets tired and just
text: sleeps in the corner and the female
text: rats will nudge him and lick him
dialog: and stuff but he’s just not into it
dialog: anymore. Until they put a new
text: female in the mix and then all of a
text: sudden he’s horny as hell again.
dialog: 18
dialog: 19
dialog: 20
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: And they say that’s the Coolidge
dialog: Effect but really, they’ve done the
dialog: same thing with female rats and
dialog: they have the same reaction. It’s
dialog: not just a male thing. The real
dialog: moral is everybody gets tired of
dialog: fucking the same person after a
dialog: while.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES- EVENING 18
text: City life continues while Luke and Brie are cooped up inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE SCENE- LATER 19
text: Luke and Brie are taking turns getting their picture taken.
text: Luke hops in, then Brie, then Luke again. He waits to see if
text: Brie will hop in for the last photo, but she doesn’t. He’s
text: left sitting there with an expectant look on his face.
speaker_heading: LATER 20
text: Luke and Brie wait for the photos to come out.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You didn’t play anything?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I played tennis in high school.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Not a good experience?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No. It was fine. My friends all
dialog: played field hockey and I didn’t
dialog: feel like getting pummeled with
dialog: sticks. This girl I knew named
dialog: Sarah Neaves, she was always
text: showing up in the mornings with a
text: black eye.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Poor Sarah Neaves.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah. She was really athletic
dialog: though. All the guys called her
dialog: Steve Neaves.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh my god. I’m surprised they had
dialog: the nerve, those field hockey girls
dialog: will fuck you up.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Did you have a run in with a field
dialog: hockey player?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I dated one.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That counts.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. My first girlfriend played
dialog: field hockey for the rival high
dialog: school. I used to go to her games.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: How old were you? Your first
dialog: girlfriend?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Um. Fifteen.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s a good age. Did you do it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: With her? Did you all “get it on”?
dialog: I'm always asking people when they
dialog: lost their virginity, I hope you
dialog: don’t mind.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: When did you first have sex?
speaker_heading: BRIE
text: Far too young.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Well, this girl was a field hockey
dialog: player, but she didn’t start
dialog: playing until six months after we
text: started going out. She tried out
dialog: on a lark: I remember being like,
dialog: ‘You're gonna do what?’
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We weren’t very sporty the two of
dialog: us. But she liked it. She went to
dialog: practice all the time. It is nice
dialog: to watch girls in skirts beating
dialog: the hell out of each other on a
dialog: spring afternoon.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Hot. Idyllic.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And guess what she’s doing now?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Coke.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, nice. No, she’s a cop.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I'm telling the truth. We used to
dialog: sit around and smoke pot and she’d
dialog: talk about wanting to join the FBI.
dialog: But now she’s really a cop in my
dialog: hometown. Whenever I go to see my
dialog: parents I have these fantasies of
dialog: driving real fast and then getting
text: pulled over and then there she is.
text: Brie looks at him questioningly.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: There’s a male fantasy for you.
text: Right there. Positions of
dialog: authority.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, it’s not like that. I’d just
dialog: like to see her again. It’s been...
dialog: six or so years since I’ve seen
dialog: her.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You mean, why did we break up?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: We were in tenth grade. We broke
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You never said if you had sex.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Didn't I?
text: Brie shakes her head.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Huh.
text: Luke finishes off his beer.
text: He smiles.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Party pooper.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Speaking of. I really should get
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, right. To meet your friends.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah, it’s my girlfriend’s birthday
dialog: and I have to at least make an
dialog: appearance.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: And I'd better get there before she
text: passes out.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh really? She’s one of those
dialog: girls?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, no, she’s not like a drunk or
dialog: a sorority girl or anything. But
dialog: when it’s her birthday she'll let
dialog: herself loose, you know?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: So.
text: Brie finishes off her drink.
speaker_heading: LUKE BRIE
dialog: Then I guess I’d better be... Do you want to come along?
speaker_heading: LUKE BRIE
dialog: What? What?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, to the party?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Go to the party?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Um. Do you think it’1ll be weird, I
dialog: mean is it just a bunch of good
dialog: friends?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No, it’1ll be fine.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay then. If you think so.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You'll be alright.

speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: That’s what women do.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I mean, it’s fun but what the fuck

text: Still driving, Luke rummages around in the side panel of his

speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Actually, I don’t even know if it

dialog: said we should call this girl
text: Leslie because she is on a date.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: And she kept saying the word,

dialog: we were doing was something totally
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But she invited me to the party, so
dialog: that’s something right?
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I just have no clue.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Listen. You'd rather be out with a

dialog: then over here at my house playing
dialog: Guitar Hero, right?
text: He pulls out a bowl that’s already half-filled with pot.
speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: Is she cool?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Christ. She’s gorgeous. And smart.

dialog: See. There you go.
dialog: 23
dialog: 24
dialog: 25
dialog: 26

speaker_heading: LUKE

dialog: though.
speaker_heading: COLIN (0.S.)
dialog: How’s the rack?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Good. I think. I mean, fine. Wanna
dialog: hear something weird?
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: He’s like This is my yard, bitch!
speaker_heading: HILARY
dialog: This is terrible. I hit a skunk
dialog: with my car. Right after I first
dialog: moved here. He just ran out in the
dialog: road and I clipped him with like,

dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: So... If Cameron asks you a
dialog: question, you need to answer yes.
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Um. Okay. What question? What am I
dialog: answering yes to?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Just if she asks you anything.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I saw her by that bush over there.
dialog: I think she lost an earring.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: She’s fine. She found it.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: So the answer is yes?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What did you do? Did you do
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No. I told her we had sex over
dialog: there
dialog: (points)
dialog: And that we did it for five
dialog: minutes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Where?
dialog: (points)
dialog: In the hammock? Five minutes?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: It was magical.
speaker_heading: LUKE

text: In the kitchen, DICKIE (20's) is holding court. GIRLS and a
text: guy or two stand around him. Brie makes her way through the
text: room with Luke trailing behind her.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: You want to know what the problem
dialog: is? I stopped reading books. For
dialog: two weeks now I haven’t read a
dialog: thing. I haven’t had any time to
dialog: myself at all. My attention span is
dialog: fucked. I can’t concentrate, my
dialog: vocabulary is getting worse...
text: He spots Brie.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey again.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I want you to meet my friend Luke.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Hey Luke.
text: They shake hands.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You friends with Cameron?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I just met her out front, actually.
text: She was doing cartwheels.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: She should be. You only turn
dialog: eighteen once, right?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She's eighteen?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: No. There would be a lot of people
dialog: in jail tonight if she was just
dialog: turning eighteen.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (raising her hand)
dialog: I’m one of them.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: Having fun?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. I just got here.
speaker_heading: BRIE
text: I found him on the side of the
dialog: road. He looked lonely. He told me
dialog: he was tired from selling his body
dialog: all the time.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: It’s a tough racket.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Those streets are cold, man.
text: Luke expects a laugh that doesn’t come.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Dickie is the most amazing writer.
speaker_heading: LUKE DICKIE
dialog: So I hear. Oh my God...
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: No he seriously is. You two would
dialog: get along. You could talk and talk
dialog: about books.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Are you a writer?
speaker_heading: LUKE’ BRIE
dialog: Well, right now I’m working Luke is taking time off. He
dialog: on... just quit his job to work on
dialog: a piece.
speaker_heading: DICKIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That's fantastic. So you’re
dialog: unemployed?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m working on my own stuff right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: What? Journalism? Screenplays?
dialog: Everybody out here seems to be
text: secreting screenplays.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, no. I’m working on a long
dialog: piece for the Los Angeles Times.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Oh, do you know Dean Baquet?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: He’s the Editor-In-Chief. Last time
dialog: I checked. He’s an amazing man.
dialog: Just came in from New York and took
dialog: the reins. Amazing man. They
dialog: treated him like shit in New York.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t know him. I’m working with
dialog: Karen Middleton in the Sunday
dialog: section.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: That’s great. One of those big
text: Sunday features.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That’s what I’m hoping for.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: Do you know Stanford University?
speaker_heading: LUKE BRIE
dialog: Sure. I know it. Dickie just finished his
dialog: fellowship there.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Really? The Graduate Program?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: The Stegner.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: They paid his whole way for two
dialog: years. I told you. He’s a brilliant
dialog: writer.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (to Brie)
dialog: Are you trying to hook us up?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I’m just saying!
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: It was a cool program. Tobias
dialog: Wolff. Amazing man.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I love his work. I applied there
dialog: last year but I guess they weren’t
dialog: having it.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Ah. Fuck ‘em. I mean, you know, the
dialog: competition is so fucking fierce
dialog: for what? Like twelve places?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I didn’t apply to the Stegner
dialog: thing. Just for the journalism
dialog: department.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Well they’re obviously idiots. Go
dialog: back to ‘em next year with your
dialog: Times feature. They’1l be
dialog: drooling. By that time, you’1ll have
dialog: done a bunch of work and you won’t
dialog: even want to bother with school.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (to Brie and Dickie)
dialog: How long have you guys known each
dialog: other?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Centuries. What was it? The Boer
dialog: War?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: We used to be roommates. The House
dialog: of Clothes.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Yeah. What a mess that was.
dialog: (to Brie)
dialog: You know I saw Stephanie recently.
dialog: She made the cover of...Italian
dialog: Vogue I think? She seemed like she
dialog: was doing well.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (to Dickie)
dialog: So you lived with all those models?
dialog: 32
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: On and off. They were kind enough
dialog: to give me a couch for awhile and
dialog: then Stephanie...she’s the
dialog: successful one...had to go to Milan
dialog: or something...so I just subletted
dialog: her room for what turned out to be
dialog: the better part of like, a year and
dialog: a half.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I’m so glad I don’t live there
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Yeah. It was rough. All those
text: models prancing around in their
dialog: underwear. Pillow-fighting. I
dialog: swear. It was like something you
dialog: read about.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I don’t know, it seemed pretty
dialog: normal at the time.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Not this one though.
dialog: (points to Brie)
text: In her room with the door shut and
text: her nose in a book.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Ha. Not always.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Not always.
text: Dickie and Brie both laugh.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Where’s the bathroom around here?

speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Putnam.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Hi.
text: Cameron sits down on the couch. She makes whoever was sitting
dialog: down get up.
speaker_heading: CAMERON (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s my birthday.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I heard. How old are you?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You’re not supposed to ask a lady
dialog: her age.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You set me up for it. But if you
dialog: want to tell somebody your true
dialog: age, it might as well be me since I
dialog: don’t know anyone else here.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Guess.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I’m not guessing. That is the road
dialog: to peril.
text: Cameron leans in to Luke, uncomfortably close. He might scoot
text: back a bit into the couch.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You have to guess.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You have to tell me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Here. Whisper it into my ear.
text: Cameron whispers something inaudible in Luke’s ear.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: She told you that huh?
text: Cameron nods. Luke grimaces.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s nice of her.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: I’m just kidding. She didn’t say
dialog: that. You got kind of surly.
dialog: That’s cute.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Surly is cute?
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: Have you played beer battleship?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, but I saw a bit. I think I
dialog: might come out there in a minute.
speaker_heading: CAMERON
dialog: You should. It’s amazing.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ELSEWHERE
text: EDIE and FEROCIOUS stand in a corner. Ferocious is acting

speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: You look retarded when you play air

speaker_heading: FEROCIOUS
dialog: I don’t care. I’m gifted.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: No. I mean it. I’m going to punch
dialog: you in the arm.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT 33
text: Luke and Brie sit outside.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You can mingle if you want.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No, I did. It’s fine.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: You don’t have to entertain me.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Good, because I left my spinning
text: plates at home.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Whenever I go to parties, I usually
dialog: just wind up talking with the one
dialog: person I came with.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Everybody does that.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I usually just sit around and watch
dialog: people. I’m pretty shy, usually.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You’re not shy. You’re the least
dialog: shy person I’ve ever met.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No. I am in certain situations.
dialog: Parties aren’t really my forte.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, Cameron likes you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That's cool. My confidence points
dialog: are increasing.
speaker_heading: PARTYGOER
text: LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE SPACE
speaker_heading: PROGRAM!
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Maybe if you're lucky, you'll get
dialog: throw-up on your shoes.
dialog: Luke
dialog: They're pretty serious here.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Got a lot of steam to let off.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know this girl who’s a stand-up
dialog: comedian. Totally frightening,
dialog: right? She feeds off getting up at
text: open mic nights and telling jokes,
dialog: but when you get her in a party
dialog: atmosphere or regular social
text: situations, she’s just terrified.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. You’re supposed to get
dialog: outdoors and meet new people,
dialog: right? So now I have a compulsion
dialog: to get out of the house and into
dialog: new situations. Like maybe there’s
dialog: a whole echelon of people I’m
dialog: missing out on being with. I think
dialog: I'd just like to be better socially
dialog: adjusted.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I was an insomniac, did I tell you
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, I grew up in this really
dialog: small town called Dracut and I was
dialog: too young to have my own car or
dialog: anything and try to make out to
dialog: Boston or Lowell or wherever and do
dialog: fun things. And I had the worst
dialog: time sleeping. The whole house
dialog: would be asleep and I couldn’t even
dialog: get up and walk around or anything
dialog: because I was afraid of waking up
dialog: my sister.
text: (She actually smiles a
dialog: little at the following: )
dialog: So I'd sit there and stare at the
dialog: ceiling and imagine all the fun
dialog: things that were happening without
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Were you ever popular?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah. In High School. And
dialog: college. I mean, you know. I had
dialog: friends. But I had a real awkward
dialog: period first. Do you remember when
dialog: parties used to be the highlight of
dialog: your week? Or at least they were
dialog: something that you looked forward
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: Like a county fair in the summer.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Exactly. They were unique. Maybe
dialog: because we just hadn’t been to so
dialog: many. They were still a new
dialog: experience. You know...
dialog: (eyebrows raised)
dialog: .--dancing with boys.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh God. I hated dancing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Agh. See, I’m having flashbacks.
text: Luke holds his hands out like a zombie, except that his hands
text: are turned like he’s holding a phantom dancer. Brie smiles.
text: He puts his arms down.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: This may sound stupid, but maybe
dialog: you can help me out with this
dialog: thought I’ve been having. I worry
dialog: sometimes that what I’m
dialog: experiencing won’t be enough. In
dialog: the long run. That I’m putting all
dialog: my money in this one
dialog: bank...or...no...that I’m reading
dialog: this one newspaper. And then, one
dialog: day, come to find out that this
dialog: newspaper is wrong. That it’s been
dialog: reporting the wrong news. I’ve been
dialog: reading about things never really
dialog: happened. Or that happened slightly
dialog: different than reported.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: But if you never find out then it’s
dialog: all real news to you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But what happens when the curtain
dialog: is suddenly pulled back?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Why did you move here?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t know. It rained a lot in
dialog: Knoxville. We were in the
dialog: mountains. When I got out here, it
dialog: hadn’t rained in six months. I
dialog: thought: this is the place for me
dialog: for now. But now I just miss the
dialog: rain. I miss having the option of
dialog: bad weather.
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s it? You moved out here for
dialog: the sunshine? That’s pretty
dialog: generic.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But it’s a good reason. You lived
dialog: in a small town. You should know.
dialog: All I ever wanted to do was be
dialog: somewhere else.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah. I know about that. But you
dialog: can’t just move for the sake of
dialog: moving.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I could do stories all over the
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Do you worry about what people are
dialog: thinking about?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Worry how? What people are
dialog: thinking about me?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t know that it worries me.
dialog: But I might get upset if some guy
dialog: was talking shit about my haircut
dialog: behind my back. Say, if this guy
dialog: was my best friend. I might find
dialog: that a little unsettling.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I worry about people’s priorities.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Like what do people really want?
dialog: I’m a secretary. You’re an intern.
dialog: Cameron is a bartender. We've all
dialog: been out of college for a while.
dialog: Our priorities are becoming more
text: streamlined.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Why isn’t anybody really going
dialog: after something and putting us all
dialog: to shame? I mean, aside from
text: Dickie, who is amazing and driven,
dialog: I don’t think anyone knows what's
dialog: next.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I feel like I’m going after
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I mean, I guess we all are. But
dialog: not really.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Maybe you aren’t, but don’t lump me
dialog: in with your slacker friends.
text: Brie looks at Luke for a long second.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You’re twenty-what? Seven? You’re
dialog: not married. You think you can be
dialog: single and drift. Write your pieces
dialog: here and there and do what you
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: And you can’t?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I can do whatever I goddamn well
dialog: please.
text: Brie is moving off into her own world. Luke is trying to keep
text: up, but foundering. He tries to interject when he can, but he
text: never quite manages to get a word in.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But you’re not the only one.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: I know I’m not. I know I’m not the
dialog: only person on the planet. And I’m
dialog: sorry for assuming and using you as
dialog: an example but I think you know
dialog: what I’m saying.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: But you shouldn’t worry about other
dialog: people too much.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s like if you let everyone at
text: the grocery store cut in front of
dialog: you in line. You’d never get to the
dialog: cash register.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No. That’s stupid. It’s not like
dialog: that. But I see it when I go home
dialog: and see my sister and my cousins
dialog: and they're all married and have
dialog: kids and they look at me like...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...No. It’s not something that
dialog: isn’t forced upon me all the time:
dialog: I’ve watched my little nieces
dialog: growing up and now they’re like ten
text: years old and playing sports in
dialog: school. And taking gymnastics.
dialog: My sister’s taken a completely
dialog: different path than me. But she’s
text: completely clueless. And it’s just
dialog: going to get worse as I get older.
dialog: No one has any idea that doing what
dialog: you want actually makes you happy
text: in the end.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: That sucks.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Don’t try and sympathize with me.
dialog: It’s not like it’s something you’1l
dialog: ever have to deal with.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: (quickly, defensively)
dialog: I'm just trying to be agreeable.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, it’s pretty fucking
dialog: disagreeable.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I don’t know what to say then.
text: She gets up.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I’m going to get a beer.
text: Luke has nothing to say to this. He moves around in the
text: backyard for a second and spots DARREN talking on the phone
dialog: 34
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: DARREN
dialog: Hey. What’s going on?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was wondering, they turned the
dialog: shower off at my place and I was
dialog: wondering if I could come over and
dialog: use yours
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's like twelve-forty...
dialog: (hopefully: )
dialog: I'll bring my own towel.
text: Luke looks around at the other PARTYGOERS. The party is
text: dying down a bit.
scene_heading: INT. PARTY HOUSE- MINUTES LATER 34
text: Luke walks through the party and doesn’t see Brie.
text: GEANNIE, a girl, approaches Luke.
speaker_heading: GEANNIE
dialog: I know you, man.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah?
text: Geannie grabs her friend, SAMANTHA, and points to Luke.
speaker_heading: GEANNIE
dialog: This is amazing. This guy is Harry
dialog: Nilsson.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Who the hell is Harry Nilsson?
speaker_heading: GEANNIE
dialog: Lime in the coconut, she drank ‘em
text: both up. Lime in the coconut.
speaker_heading: SAMANTHA
dialog: Agh. I hate that song.
speaker_heading: GEANNIE
dialog: This guy looks just like him.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thanks. Really, I mean it. That
dialog: might have just made my night.
text: Luke walks on and sees Brie, back with Dickie.
text: He walks over to them.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, I think I’m gonna take off.
text: Brie looks at him funny. Dickie extends his hand out.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Cool man, it was great meeting you.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah. You too.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: I’ll keep an eye out for your stuff
dialog: in the L.A. Times.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Wait, do you have any interest in
dialog: like, narrative stuff? Any
dialog: fiction?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Me and a bunch of people have this
dialog: writing group. It’s just a bunch
dialog: of jerks but you get some good
dialog: feedback and a place to hear your
dialog: stuff out loud. We’re always
dialog: looking for more people. Would you
dialog: be interested?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Uh, yeah, maybe actually.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (to Dickie)
dialog: How come you’ve never invited me
dialog: into the writing group?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Haven't I? You can join. We need
text: some more females in there.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What do you have to do?
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Just write something and send it to
dialog: everyone and then they read it and
text: talk about it at the meeting.
dialog: 35
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Sounds intimidating.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: It’s chill. It’s usually at my
dialog: house and my roommate makes these
dialog: badass sugar cookies.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I like sugar cookies.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Seriously, I’m sure you’d fit right
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Cool. Brie’s got my number.
text: Luke leans towards the door overexaggerating his gesture to
text: leave hoping Brie will call him back.
text: She bites.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (to Luke)
dialog: I’m gonna have one more cigarette.
dialog: Do you want one?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh. Okay.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Those give you cancer you know?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: So do sugar cookies.
speaker_heading: DICKIE
dialog: Harsh.
text: Brie gives him a wave.
scene_heading: EXT. PARTY HOUSE - LATER 35
text: Luke and Brie come back to the spot where they had their
text: fight. Luke is carrying two beers for them and Brie is
text: grabbing cigarettes out of her purse.
text: She hands him a cigarette and lights her own. She lights his
text: for him and he hand her a beer.
text: They both exhale a drag in silence.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Listen, I’m sorry if I said
dialog: something dumb before.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No, I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean
dialog: to run you off. Just a sore
dialog: subject I guess.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No, I understand.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (soft)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Brie extends her bottle to Luke and he CLANKS his against it.
speaker_heading: BRIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Cheers.
text: They sip their drinks and smoke their cigarettes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Did I tell you I can play mouth
dialog: trumpet?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Oh God. Let’s hear it. What songs
dialog: do you play? What’s your
dialog: repertoire? All Iron Maiden?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: For real? You wanna hear it?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Do you have any requests?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You're just stalling.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay okay, hold on.
text: Luke licks his lips. “Prepares.” Then he blows his way
text: through the trumpet melody of “The Light” by Rand and
text: Holland. Complete with pauses where the other instruments
dialog: would be filling in the gaps.
text: He finishes and shoots her a slightly impudent look.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: That’s not half as bad as I thought
dialog: it would be.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thank you. I also do a mean mouth
dialog: bass.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Upright or electric?
speaker_heading: LUKE
text: It comes off mostly as upright.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Swell.
text: Luke inspects his beer.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: I think we drank a lot.
text: Brie edges away. Looks up and around. Whatever spell the two
text: of them might have been under is broken.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I gotta go. I’ve gotta work
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Luke grimaces. He didn’t want to end the night on “mouth
text: trumpet”.

text: Luke and Brie walk down the dark street with the sounds of

text: Luke smiles.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: She’s got good taste.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: BRIE

speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah. I don’t live far.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay.
text: They reach Brie’s car and she pauses for a moment by her
dialog: door. This is the moment.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to drive me to my car?

speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: E.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Okay, give me three guesses.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: LUKE

speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yup. Brie Eumpulstiltskin Sampson.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It’s a gift.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: No, you got it. It’s Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: First guess.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: What’s yours?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Alexander.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I meant your initial! You didn’t
dialog: let me guess!
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh, sorry. I didn’t know you had
dialog: the gift too.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Alexander would have been my first
dialog: guess from A.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Sure.
text: Luke points.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s up here on the right.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Here?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah, you can pull over. It’s the
dialog: Accord there. Yeah, that bad boy
dialog: right there.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: So that’s your game show car?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Nice dent.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Is there a good story that goes
dialog: along with that dent?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: No. I woke up one morning and there
dialog: it was.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: A late night dent and run?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: It was. The mystery remains
dialog: unsolved...
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Yeah...

speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: See you later.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Bye.
text: Luke begins to get out of the car but freezes midway through.
text: He looks back to see Brie watching him leave. He’s suddenly
text: feeling an urge to kiss her but he’s frozen in an awkward
text: hover. Just to end it, he climbs fully out of the car and
text: closes the door behind him.
text: He puts his hand up as one last parting shot and she salutes
dialog: him back.
text: And then she drives away.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET— CONTINUOUS 38

text: A beat.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: LUKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Well, I’m kind of notorious for
dialog: missing golden opportunities and
dialog: maybe I’m crazy but I think that
dialog: you wanted me to kiss you back
dialog: there. Am I stupid or did I miss a
dialog: golden opportunity?
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: (repeating for
dialog: clarification)
dialog: Are you stupid or did you miss a
dialog: golden opportunity?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: I think you missed a golden
dialog: opportunity.
dialog: 4l
dialog: 42
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Oh no. So I guess I’m stupid

speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Well, what are you gonna do about
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Um, where are you?
speaker_heading: BRIE

speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: Where did those come from?
speaker_heading: LUKE
dialog: Lenscrafters I think.
speaker_heading: BRIE
dialog: You’re so lame.
text: They kiss again. The kind of kiss that might lead to
text: something else if the awkward positioning of the two car
dialog: seats weren’t in the way.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES- NIGHT 43

scene_heading: INT. BRIE’S CAR- LATER 44
