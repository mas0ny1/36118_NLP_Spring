dialog: General opinion’s starting to make out that
dialog: we live in a world of hatred and greed —

dialog: love is everywhere. Often it’s not
text: particularly dignified, or newsworthy — but
dialog: it’s always there — fathers & sons, mothers
dialog: & daughters, husbands & wives, friends &
dialog: strangers. When the planes hit the Twin
dialog: Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone
dialog: calls from the people about to die were
dialog: messages of hate and revenge - they were

dialog: But others she was pretty damn clear about.
dialog: When she first mentioned what’s about to

dialog: said “No, Danny - over mine.” And, as
dialog: usual, my darling girl, and Sam’s darling
dialog: Mum was right - 100%. So she’s going to say
