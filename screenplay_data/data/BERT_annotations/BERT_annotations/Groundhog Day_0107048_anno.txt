scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME
text: PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall
text: gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall,
text: talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME
text: CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape,
text: flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad

scene_heading: INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME
text: Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but
text: from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out

scene_heading: EXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME

scene_heading: INT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING
text: We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
text: volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers
text: from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed
dialog: memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award
text: statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
text: on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.
text: As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small
text: sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
dialog: blanket.
text: GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
text: head in the door.
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: Christ, what a pit. Phil"
text: The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley.
text: It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (SLEEPY)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: It's February first, Phil. You
dialog: know what tomorrow is?
text: Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,
text: rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but
text: clearly a guy with a lot of personality.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: Oh, no! Not again.
text: He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Forget it! I'm not going.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9
text: Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local
text: news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as
scene_heading: WPGH - Pittsburgh.
text: Phil ducks into the studio.

dialog: -3-
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
text: Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
text: corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather
text: stats up on a chart.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Get away from me. I'm working.
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: So what's the outlook? We gonna
dialog: get that blizzard?
text: Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
text: "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
text: to the title.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No way. All that moisture coming
dialog: up from the Gulf is going to miss
dialog: us completely and take a dump on
dialog: Harrisburg.
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: (with authority)
dialog: Good, 'cause you're going up to
dialog: Punxsutawney to cover the
dialog: groundhog story tomorrow morning
dialog: and I want you back here in time
dialog: to do the five.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will
dialog: you! I covered the goddamn
dialog: groundhog last year and the year
dialog: before that.
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: And you'll do it :next year and
dialog: the year after, too. When I
dialog: worked in San Diego, I covered
text: the swallows coming back to
dialog: Capistrano for ten years in a
dialog: row.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You should've killed the guy who
dialog: made you do that.
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: I wanted to do it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Then you should've killed
dialog: yourself. I don't want to get
dialog: stuck with the groundhog for the
dialog: rest of my life.
dialog: 
dialog: -4-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
text: It's a cute story. He comes out,
text: he looks around, he wrinkles up
text: his little nose, he sniffs around
text: a little, he sees his shadow, he
dialog: d oesn't see his shadow-- it's
dialog: nice. People like it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Many people are morons.
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: Just do it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What'11 you give me?
text: Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a
text: very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: (to Phil)
dialog: I'll give you Rita.
dialog: (calls her over)
dialog: Rita, could you come here for a
dialog: second? I got a little job for
dialog: you.
text: Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,
text: personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,
text: a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this
text: point to realize it.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (TEASING)
dialog: You can't send Rita out on a
dialog: story like this. She's just a
text: cub, a pup, still wet behind the
text: ears. Look at her. Her ears are
dialog: sopping wet. This needs a
dialog: Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a
dialog: big story. People need to know.
speaker_heading: RITA
speaker_heading: (INTRIGUED)
dialog: What's the story?
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: The Punxsutawney Groundhog
dialog: Festival.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Gil, if it's all right with you
dialog: I ' d rather follow-up on the
dialog: nurses' strike.
dialog: 
dialog: -5-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAWLEY
dialog: You can do the nurses when you
dialog: get back. Just take the squeaky
dialog: wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
dialog: get him back in one piece. Okay?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah, okay.
text: Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She
dialog: knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,
text: she finds him appealing in an odd way.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (PLEASANTLY)
dialog: You know, this could be extremely
dialog: interesting.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I've never done a weather story
dialog: before. What's Punxsutawney
dialog: like?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Oh, it's an enchanted place. A
dialog: magical world. It's the
dialog: Constantinople of the whole
dialog: Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
dialog: Drainage system.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Do you always joke?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: About 70 to 80% of the time.
dialog: Inside I'm actually a very shy
dialog: and sensitive person.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: A lot of people around here think
dialog: you're not very sincere.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Tell me the names of these
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'll line up a crew and
dialog: transportation. If you don't
dialog: feel like driving, we can all go
text: up in the van together.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I think I'll take my own car.
dialog: I ' m not that fond of my fellow
dialog: man.

speaker_heading: RITA
speaker_heading: (EXITING)
dialog: Nice attitude.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Nice face.

dialog: Why don't you ride up with me?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No, thanks.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATER
text: Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
text: while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
text: two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number
text: of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
text: himself on the TV monitor.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: They don't really think of me as
dialog: a weatherman around here. More
dialog: of a "personality," but with the
dialog: credibility of a first-class
dialog: broadcast journalist. Once you
dialog: look at my tape I think you'll
dialog: see what they mean.
text: Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for
text: a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about
text: this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
dialog: scary.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
speaker_heading: (BITTERLY)
dialog: I just want to know one thing:
dialog: did I do something wrong or are
dialog: you just tired of me or what? I
dialog: have to know.
text: Phil sighs.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (on the phone)
dialog: Dan, can I call you back? I've
dialog: just been handed something and I
dialog: better get on it...
dialog: (he picks up some
text: papers and rustles
dialog: them for effect)
dialog: ...Okay, thanks.
dialog: 
dialog: -7-
dialog: 
text: He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for
dialog: privacy.
speaker_heading: PHIL
speaker_heading: (KINDLY)
dialog: You didn't do anything wrong,
dialog: Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of
dialog: you. It's just that I don't have
dialog: time for a real relationship
dialog: right now. I told you that the
dialog: first time we went out.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: (getting close)
dialog: Everybody says that at the
text: beginning of a relationship.
speaker_heading: PHIL
text: (gently pushing her
speaker_heading: AWAY)
dialog: I'm different. I really meant
dialog: it! Things are really starting
dialog: to move for me now. I ' m not
dialog: going to be doing the weather for
dialog: the rest of my life. I was just
dialog: talking to the CBS guy about a
dialog: network job. I want that. This
dialog: is just the beginning for me. I
dialog: can't waste any more time.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: Are you saying our relationship
dialog: was a waste of time?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Our relationship? We went out a
dialog: total of four times! And only
dialog: twice did anything happen. It
dialog: was fun but I don't see that as
dialog: a big commitment.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: (closing in again)
dialog: I had our charts done. My
dialog: astrologer says we're extremely
dialog: compatible. There may even be
dialog: some past lives involvement here.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: See? So we've already done this.
dialog: Let's move on. Next case.
speaker_heading: STEPHANIE
dialog: You know what's wrong with you,
dialog: Phil? You're selfish. You don't
dialog: have time for anyone but
dialog: yourself.
dialog: 
dialog: -8-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: That's what I ' m trying to tell
dialog: you. You don't want to be with
dialog: me. You can do better. Look,
dialog: Stephanie, if I ever said or did
dialog: anything to mislead you I'm sorry
dialog: for that, but right now I have to
dialog: do this groundhog thing and I
dialog: don't have a handle on it yet.
text: He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
text: puts on his jacket.
speaker_heading: PHIL (CONT.)
dialog: I'll tell you what. I ' m going to
dialog: do some serious thinking while
dialog: I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?
text: He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her
text: standing there with a malevolent look on her face.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: LARRY

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's okay. I'll handle it.
text: She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another
text: call on his earphone.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What's the problem, Phil?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I hate this place. I stayed here

speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Whatever I can do within reason.
dialog: Would you like to have dinner

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: No thanks, I've seen Larry eat.

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: PHIL

text: dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For
text: a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
text: An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
text: cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this
text: sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters.

speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Prima donnas.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's just so-- inconsiderate.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: What happens to some people?
dialog: They're born nice. They grow up

dialog: bam! Prima donnas.
text: Rita spots Phil heading into the crowd.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil.
dialog: Over here!
text: Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark
text: near the rail fence.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Where've you been?
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: I got hung up with some jerk I
dialog: went to high school with. So,
dialog: did you sleep okay without me?
dialog: You tossed and turned, didn't
dialog: you?
text: Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You're incredible.
speaker_heading: PHIL

speaker_heading: RITA

dialog: (to camera)
dialog: Once a year, the eyes of the

dialog: hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch
dialog: a master at work. The master?
dialog: Punxsutawney Phil, the world's
dialog: most famous weatherman, the
dialog: groundhog, who, as legend has it,
dialog: can predict the coming of an
dialog: early spring.
text: Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good.
text: A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and
text: ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it
text: and retreats.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: And here's the big moment we've
dialog: all been waiting for. Let's just
dialog: see what Mr. Groundhog has to
dialog: say.
text: The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
text: the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about
text: as far away from the cameras as he can get.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Hey! Over here, you little
dialog: weasel!
text: Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
text: a close-up of the groundhog's back. The groundhog stands there
text: a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a
text: squeak and runs back into the hole.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Great shot, huh, folks? Well,
dialog: that was certainly worth the
dialog: trip. Now we'll be hearing from
dialog: Mr. Buster Greene, President of
dialog: the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,
dialog: the so-called Seer of Seers who
dialog: will interpret for us.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: (sarcastic, to camera)
dialog: Well, that's it. Sorry you
dialog: couldn't be here in person to
dialog: share the electric moment. This
dialog: is one event where televison
dialog: really fails to capture the
dialog: excitement of thousands of people
text: gathered to watch a large
dialog: squirrel predict the weather, and
dialog: I for one am deeply grateful to

text: The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door,

text: Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
text: prediction, recalling the previous day.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: My forecast is we're going to see
text: the groundhog peek its head out
dialog: of its hole, look around a little
dialog: bit, then he's going to come out,
dialog: scamper over to this general
text: area, look at the crowd for a
dialog: second, make a little burping

speaker_heading: RITA

dialog: That's it. I'm going to kill
dialog: him.
text: Phil looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: O k ay ? And here we go--
text: Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in.
text: The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
text: steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
text: directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body
text: casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the
text: camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
text: Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
text: brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil.
text: Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PHIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork

text: the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
dialog: sink.
text: Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
text: to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing
text: heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
text: going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
text: barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
text: head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
text: mirror with his sledgehammer.
text: Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
text: the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
text: madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
dialog: room with it.
text: As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,
text: then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
dialog: feathers.
text: Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can
text: hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
text: We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
text: the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
text: reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
text: and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil
text: sleeping on the bed.
text: He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No
text: paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy
dialog: as the day he checked in.
text: He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His
text: hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.
