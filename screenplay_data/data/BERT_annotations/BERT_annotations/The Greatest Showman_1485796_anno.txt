scene_heading: INT. CIRCUS TENT - NIGHT 4
text: Absolute darkness. Then, a single narrow spotlight goes on,
text: revealing a RINGMASTER, with top hat, his back to us, alone.
text: With his head bowed, the top hat casts his face in shadow.
text: As the MUSIC picks up, he sings in a hushed, dramatic voice:
speaker_heading: RINGMASTER
speaker_heading: [BARNUM SINGS]
speaker_heading: [BARNUM SINGS]
text: QUICK CUTS -- CLOSE UPS of the RINGMASTER, seen from behind,

speaker_heading: [BARNUM SINGS]
text: The Ringmaster (from behind) looks upward. Another spotlight

speaker_heading: RINGMASTER (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: [BARNUM SINGS]
text: The Ringmaster turns, into the light.
text: It is P.T. BARNUM. Handsome. Confident. Exuberant. At the

text: As the SONG ESCALATES, two FIRE BREATHERS step up and...
text: .--BLOW huge COLUMNS OF FIRE in the air over Barnum’s head.
text: Suddenly, all the FOOTLIGHTS go on, revealing a full-throttle
text: 3-ring Circus in full motion all around Barnum -- elephants
text: doing handstands; lion tamers cracking whips; jugglers
text: tossing rings across the room; horses dancing on two hooves.

text: SILENCE. A close-up of YOUNG BARNUM (10) silhouetted against *

speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: All you have to do is jump.
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY (0.C.)
dialog: I’m scared.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: That’s what makes it fun! *
dialog: WIDER -- Young Barnum and Young Charity (also 10), stand on
text: the limb of a giant old tree that reaches out over the water.
text: She wears a white party dress. He is in scuffed work clothes.
text: It’s a 20 foot drop to the water -- no small feat.
scene_heading: YOUNG CHARITY *
dialog: I shouldn't be doing this. *
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM *
dialog: That also makes it fun! *

speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY
dialog: I can’t do it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: Of course you can! You just have to take
dialog: that first step...
text: She half-smiles, still scared. Nods bravely -- let’s do it!
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM (CONT’D)
dialog: Ready? One, two, three...!
text: They jump. And fall, side-by-side... SPLASH! They surface.
text: She is laughing, delighted. She just became a braver person.
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY
dialog: Let's do that again! And again, and
dialog: again, and again!

speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: I saw a sea nymph underwater! *
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY
dialog: You did not!
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM

text: grounds of a massive, old-money Connecticut estate.
speaker_heading: MR. HALLETT (0.C.)
dialog: Charity!
text: They turn. MR. HALLETT, patrician and stern, steps forward,
text: glaring balefully. Behind him, a grounds-keeper with a rake,
text: PHILO BARNUM (40s), in work clothes, looks on worriedly.
text: Charity quickly bows her head -- becoming docile, obedient.
speaker_heading: MR. HALLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this how we have taught you to behave?
dialog: Like a person of no breeding? Come here! *
dialog: Look at your dress! How many times have *
dialog: I told you not to trouble the help! *
text: She walks to her father, not looking at Young Barnum.
speaker_heading: PHILO
dialog: It’s the boy’s fault, sir. I’m sorry. *
dialog: He’s a bit touched in the head, you know. *
dialog: Come on, son. There’s work to do.
speaker_heading: MR. HALLETT
dialog: You've done quite enough today, Mr.
dialog: Barnum. There’s that for your troubles.
text: He hands over a nickel. Philo bows obsequiously.
speaker_heading: PHILO
dialog: Thank you, sir. Apologies again. *
text: Mr. Hallet turns, walks back to his estate. Charity follows
text: dutifully. Barnum watches. Then she turns, and, behind her
text: father’s back, smiles at him. Young Barnum is thunderstruck.
text: This smile, a beacon of joy, will become his North Star.
text: Philo -- seeing his son’s love-struck gaze -- swats his head. *
speaker_heading: PHILO (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you crazy? Let’s get home. *
dialog: The Greatest Showman On Earth 4/20/15 Draft 6.
scene_heading: INT. BARNUM HOUSE - KITCHEN - BETHEL - DAY
text: Nothing quaint here, the austere room reflects a hardscrabble
text: Yankee life. The family sits at the table as Barnum’s four
text: younger SIBLINGS (ages 3 to 7) are served thin soup by their
text: mother IRENE. Barnum is telling them stories, and they are
text: giggling and enthralled. Philo listens in impatient silence.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: ..--And when I get to India, I shall ride
dialog: an elephant! And capture a tiger!
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: And what will you do with a tiger?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: I‘ll give my tiger as a gift to the Raj.
dialog: And everyone will want to come see it!
dialog: And the Raj will become my best friend,
dialog: and he will offer me half his kingdom...
speaker_heading: PHILO BARNUM
dialog: Phineas.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: ..-And I shall say, “No, thank you, sir!”
text: Philo SLAMS his hand on the table. Everyone jumps. Silence.
speaker_heading: PHILO BARNUM
dialog: As of Monday, you’1l join me on the farm.
speaker_heading: IRENE
dialog: What about his schooling?
speaker_heading: PHILO BARNUM
dialog: A waste of time. His place is in the
dialog: fields.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: But father...!
text: Philo silences him with a sharp look. It hurts to say:
speaker_heading: PHILO BARNUM
dialog: You can dream all you want, son. It
dialog: won’t put food on the table.
text: Barnum stares. He gets up, leaves the table, and exits.

scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - SUNSET 8
text: Young Barnum sits on a beach -- his father’s words echoing in

speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: How did you get out?
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY
dialog: I climbed out the window once father got
dialog: into his Port.
text: She sits down next to him. She is downcast as well. *
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: Were you scolded?
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY
dialog: Were you?
text: They share a look -- they both were. They turn to the sunset,
text: sad and pensive. Then Barnum picks up a piece of driftwood.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: Do you know what this is?
text: She can’t help but smile, knowing that a story is coming.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM (CONT’D)
dialog: Look carefully. You see? *
dialog: (he turns it in his hand)
dialog: It’s the fossil of a Mermaid from *
dialog: Atlantis.
text: She looks. Amazingly, the driftwood has a mermaid-like shape.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s a priceless treasure. *
text: He gives it to her. She smiles, but is suddenly teary-eyed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY
dialog: I’m going to miss you.
text: He turns to her -- what does that mean? She turns to him.
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY (CONT’D)
dialog: Father is sending me to finishing school. *
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: When will I see you again?

speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY

dialog: Father says I am to be a lady, but...
dialog: It’s all so dull when you’re not there.
text: He looks at her. He has one chance to not lose her forever.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: I can see my future. And yours too.
speaker_heading: YOUNG CHARITY
dialog: No, you can’t.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: I can. I/’11 show you...

scene_heading: EXT. MANSION - NIGHT 9
text: Barnum leads Charity up the front walk of a huge neoclassical
text: mansion that has fallen into disrepair.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
dialog: It’s okay. No one lives here anymore.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - NIGHT 10
text: It’s dark, lit only by the moon. Barnum leads Charity
text: through the rooms. As he sings about a world he envisions,
text: we see trophy animals, oriental antiques, and curiosities.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARNUM
scene_heading: I CLOSE MY EYES
speaker_heading: AND I CAN SEE
text: A WORLD THAT’S WAITING UP FOR ME THAT
dialog: I'LL CALL MY OWN
text: Barnum lights a match, suddenly illuminating a stone LION.
text: Charity gasps, then smiles at him with relief. Barnum smiles
dialog: back -- with the joy of showing someone the unexpected.
text: He lights a CANDLE. The SHADOW of the lion comes to life,
text: roaring. Around the room, SHADOWS flicker with GLIMPSES of
text: tumblers, acrobats, trapeze artists, elephants, and clowns.

text: adult now, a younger version of the man we first met.
text: As he steps onto the porch, the door is pulled open. Mr
text: Hallet stands in the doorway, scowling, blocking his way.
text: Barnum takes off his hat -- humbly dressed, but respectful.
speaker_heading: BARNUM
dialog: Mr. Hallet, I know how I look to you, but

dialog: With what?! You have no education, no

speaker_heading: MR. HALLETT (CONT'D)
dialog: Charity! If you walk out that door now,

text: He claps Barnum’s shoulder, walks off. Barnum slumps back, *
text: gut-punched. He frowns, eyes darting, thinking fiercely. *
text: Everyone else gets up and begins to filter out of the room. *
text: A HUBBUB of MURMURS. Only Barnum remains seated. *
text: He sees a pencil holder (a metal can dotted with holes) on *

dialog: Would you mind if I take this home? *
speaker_heading: BOSS *

speaker_heading: BARNUM
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Only the most famous singer in Europe.
speaker_heading: BARNUM
dialog: Another singer, huh?
text: He rolls his eyes. But as he watches everyone scurry to form
text: a crowd around Miss Lind, Barnum’s expression changes.
text: As he watches, the Queen herself (regal but plain) chats and
text: smiles with Jenny, clearly taken by her beauty and presence.
text: On Barnum, watching as the old-fashioned royalty of birth is
text: superceded by the new royalty of talent, beauty, celebrity.
text: Suddenly, it clicks for him. He takes off across the room,
text: headed for Miss Lind. Phillip, alarmed, rushes to keep up.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BARNUM
dialog: To meet Miss Lind.
speaker_heading: PHILLIP
dialog: You can’t just march up to someone like

speaker_heading: BARNUM
dialog: Why not? I’m personable, and she’s a
dialog: person.

text: SONG: An epic love song. Jenny’s voice, and the song itself,
