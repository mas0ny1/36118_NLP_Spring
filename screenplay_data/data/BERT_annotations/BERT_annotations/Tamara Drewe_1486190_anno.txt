scene_heading: 2 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 2
text: Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in
text: the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to
text: tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink
dialog: from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.
speaker_heading: TESS (V.O.)
dialog: And love slipped the bonds of
dialog: restraint...
text: At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties,
text: funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring
dialog: at Andy.
speaker_heading: TESS (V.O.)(CONT'D)
dialog: His touch was like a cosmic `yes'.
text: Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a
text: bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad,
text: writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.
speaker_heading: EUSTACIA (V.O.)
dialog: `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck
dialog: you to hell!' Scott stepped back
text: from the cell door as the gob of
dialog: spit flew.'
scene_heading: 1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A
text: Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ;
text: a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect
text: than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes,
text: books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian
dialog: - Thomas Hardy. He is writing.
speaker_heading: GLEN (V.O.)
dialog: This complex contemporary matrix is
dialog: what Hardy meant by `the ache of
dialog: modernism.'
dialog: He regards it.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Crap.
text: He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing
text: deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS (V.O.)
dialog: Inchcombe had seen it all before.
dialog: He'd seasoned it: the metallic
text: smell of blood and gunshot;
text: forensics hunched like vultures.
dialog: The dreadful mundanity of murder,
dialog: he thought.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 3
text: Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A
text: good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS (V.O.)
dialog: He approached Patel, who was
dialog: stricken. She was one for whom a
dialog: corpse was still an obscenity.
dialog: Inchcombe realised a disturbing
dialog: truth. His lack of feeling was
dialog: almost...
dialog: (He stops writing. Sighs)
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Pathological...
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PLAYGROUND. 4
text: A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody
text: Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of
text: the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid
text: best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from
dialog: a magazine.
speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: `I've been wearing the wrong size
dialog: all my life,' said Katie. `I was
dialog: always popping out. Turns out I'm a
dialog: 30GG,' she says. `Now my bras
dialog: finally fit - though Simon prefers
dialog: me without one.'
text: Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4A INT. DAY. KITCHEN. 4A
text: A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and
text: biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty,
text: she's now mumsy and countrified.
text: She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection.
text: Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Do you think I should be reminding

dialog: Can I tempt you, Glen?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Wow, thanks.
text: Glen picks up a scone.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I often take something snacky down
dialog: to Nicholas at this time of day. I
dialog: know how the brain needs feeding.
dialog: How are you settling in?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Great. The last writer's retreat I
dialog: stayed at kind of froze my balls off,

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: GLEN
text: Screeching firedoors, curried

speaker_heading: GLEN

dialog: 
scene_heading: 6 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - VILLAGE STREET. TRIANGLE. 6
text: The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter
text: near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging
text: baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's
text: shatteringly dull.
text: Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom
dialog: is epic.
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: An open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the

speaker_heading: CASEY
dialog: Frock horrors. This weeks top of

scene_heading: 8A EXT. EWEDOWN. THE STREET NEAR THE BUS STOP. 8A
text: Nadia is walking up the road from the station in her high

speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: Why not? You keep saying you want
dialog: to be with me.
text: Jody and Casey are all ears.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS

dialog: when I can.
speaker_heading: NADIA
dialog: Are you going to tell her?
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Just give me a couple of hours -
text: He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking
text: the phone back on to its holder.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Cock pie.
text: Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How's the worker?
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Good actually. Just about to embark
dialog: on forensics.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well give me your pages and I'll get
dialog: started.
text: Nicholas hands her several pages.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Reckon I might pack it in a bit
dialog: early today. Need to think about my
dialog: blood smears. Might take a drive;
dialog: have a pint. Stir the old grey
dialog: matter up.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Who were you talking to just then?
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Judy. She says the Impala contracts
dialog: should be through in a day or two.
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 5A.

dialog: 
text: Beth immediately knows he is lying. The lie pains her. She

scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Beth decides to try and call his bluff.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I could come with you.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: For a drive. I don't know when we
dialog: last went out.
dialog: Buying time by biting his scone:
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: This is absolutely yummy.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We could go into Hadditon, get a
dialog: meal.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Yes but. What about the guests?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Mary's got Casey to help.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Can I tempt you, Andy?
text: Andy takes a scone with a wide smile.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: That's Glen, our new academic. Turns

dialog: Said he might have some farming
dialog: questions.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Needs an expert yokel, does he?
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 6A.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Would you mind? And the writers are

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You OK?
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 7.

speaker_heading: BETH

text: Shooting from inside the car, we pass the sign "Ewedown".
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET. 11

speaker_heading: JODY
dialog: Fucking bingo!

dialog: 
scene_heading: 11A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 11A
text: The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe

text: The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes

speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What a dump.

dialog: 
scene_heading: 14 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 14
text: At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown,

text: kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of
dialog: recent abandonment.
text: Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over

scene_heading: 13 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 13

speaker_heading: JODY

speaker_heading: CASEY

speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms,
text: holding each other.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know why I'm like this. I
dialog: couldn't do without you.
text: Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He

text: again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on
text: the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again.
text: Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating.
text: He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Nicholas? -

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: I'm available. I do skips.
speaker_heading: DIGGORY
dialog: I... No.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Well thank you. You're very kind...
dialog: Is Andy around at all?
text: Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.
speaker_heading: BETH

text: through his typed-up manuscript; not really listening.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: She's had the writers down there
dialog: helping her all day. I hope she
dialog: realises they're here to work...
speaker_heading: POPPY
dialog: Can't believe what a difference
text: her nose makes.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Well I think it's a mistake; taken
dialog: away all her character.
speaker_heading: POPPY
dialog: Come on; she looks ten times
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And she knows it. I found those
dialog: shorts really irritating. Going
text: around with half her bum hanging
dialog: out. I mean, why?
speaker_heading: POPPY
dialog: To annoy people like you. Might get a
dialog: pair myself.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Of course you won't.
speaker_heading: POPPY
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Because you're not desperate, are

speaker_heading: GLEN

scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30A.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Changing my face is the best thing I

dialog: anyone thinks.
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Would it work for me?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Oh, you're just coming on to me...
text: Tamara laughs. She starts work again.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: In your column, you write about
dialog: yourself... Does that come easily?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No... But it feels right. My first
dialog: novel's definitely going to be
dialog: autobiographical.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Your first novel? You're going to
dialog: dash one off just like that?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Ideally, I'd like to make it into
dialog: fiction before I'm thirty.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: And then maybe a swimwear collection,
dialog: a chat show, a pasta sauce range?
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Life sure is easy for the beautiful.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: You know before I got the nose job
dialog: I had no trouble getting taken
dialog: seriously. Maybe, when they removed
dialog: that bit of cartilage, they pulled
dialog: my brain out by mistake - what do
dialog: you think?
text: Glen smiles, won over.

scene_heading: 46 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 46

scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31A.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well it's not exactly a
dialog: relationship; we just have an
dialog: occasional thing. Zoe doesn't want
dialog: to be tied down and -
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Not Zoe! Tamara... You should get
dialog: in there. Marry the girl. Then you
dialog: get to live back in your ancestral
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: No way. Not her type.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: The trouble is Andy, you think like
dialog: a loser. And I know that because

dialog: for tips. I'm the losers loser.
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANDY

dialog: I invested in a polytunnel full of
dialog: ganja.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Wow. How'd that go?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Made a tit of myself. Spent about

dialog: I'm only just getting it back
dialog: together. Besides, even if I was
dialog: the last man in the world, Tamara
dialog: Drewe wouldn't have me.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I dumped her.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Oh, you are a loser.
speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: GLEN

speaker_heading: NICHOLAS

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Because I've noticed you...
scene_heading: GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33A.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She waits, hoping for a kiss, a hug, anything. She puts out a
text: hand - almost touches him. He steps back.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS
dialog: Think it's time you went.
text: Tamara is mortified.
speaker_heading: NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: You're making yourself ridiculous.

dialog: 
scene_heading: 53 INT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 53
text: Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of

text: She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room
text: covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young

speaker_heading: TAMARA

text: Andy turns. Sees her.
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: ANDY

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: That's Boss.
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Hi Boss.
speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five
dialog: foot nothing. Used to stand up to

speaker_heading: TAMARA

speaker_heading: BEN

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy

speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: And mine's bigger than yours!
text: Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks

text: falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.
speaker_heading: GLEN
dialog: Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk
dialog: about this like grown men.
text: Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.
speaker_heading: GLEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God. Nicholas...

text: Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying
text: on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving.
text: Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of
text: Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud
text: and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident
dialog: been seen?
dialog: No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He
text: bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some
text: miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to
