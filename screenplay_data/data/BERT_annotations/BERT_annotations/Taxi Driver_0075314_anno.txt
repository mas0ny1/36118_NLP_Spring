dialog: "God's Lonely Man"
text: TRAVIS BICKLE, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. On
text: the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a
text: quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from
text: nowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile,
text: around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the
text: ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness
text: and loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land
dialog: where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants
text: seldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but
text: the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space.
text: Travis is now drifting in and out of the New York City night
text: life, a dark shadow among darker shadows. Not noticed, no
text: reason to be noticed, Travis is one with his surroundings.
text: He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt
text: and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, "King
dialog: Kong Company 1968-70".
text: He has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex,
text: lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force,
text: driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one
text: looks closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot
text: be wound continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the
text: sun, Travis Bickle moves toward violence.
text: FILM OPENS on EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE. Weather-beaten
text: sign above driveway reads, "Taxi Enter Here". Yellow cabs
text: scuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the
text: curbs, the wind is howling.
text: INSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis.
text: Echoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy
text: breath and exhaust fill the air.
text: INT. CORRIDOR of cab company offices. Lettering on ajar door
dialog: reads:

dialog: Marvis Cab Company
dialog: Blue and White Cab Co.
speaker_heading: Acme Taxi
dialog: Dependable Taxi Services
speaker_heading: JRB Cab Company
dialog: Speedo Taxi Service
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
text: SOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing.
text: PERSONAL OFFICE is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading
text: "Marvis, B&amp;W, Acme" and so forth are tacked to crumbling
text: plaster wall: It is March. Desk is cluttered with forms,
text: reports and an old upright Royal typewriter.
text: Dishelved middle-aged New Yorker looks up from the desk. We
text: CUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged
text: PERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his
dialog: desk.
text: The young man is TRAVIS BICKLE. He wears his jeans, boots
text: and Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette.
text: The PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at
text: work exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense
text: steely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out
text: of his workaday boredom.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (O.S.)
dialog: No Sir.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.)
dialog: Got your license?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (O.S.)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: So why do you want to be a taxi
dialog: driver?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I can't sleep nights.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: There's porno theatres for that.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I know. I tried that.
text: The PERSONNEL OFFICER, though officious, is mildly probing
text: and curious. TRAVIS is a cipher, cold and distant. He
text: speaks as if his mind doesn't know what his mouth is saying.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: So whatja do now?
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I ride around nights mostly.
dialog: Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd
dialog: I might as well get paid for it.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: We don't need any misfits around
dialog: here, son.
text: A thin smile cracks almost indiscernibly across TRAVIS' lips.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You kiddin? Who else would hack
dialog: through South Bronx or Harlem at
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: You want to work uptown nights?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know
dialog: I can't be choosy.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: (thinks a moment)
dialog: How's your driving record?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Clean. Real clean.
dialog: (pause, thin smile)
dialog: As clean as my conscience.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: Listen, son, you gonna get smart,
dialog: you can leave right now.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: Physical? Criminal?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Also clean.

speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Honorable discharge. May 1971.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: You moonlightin?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No, I want long shifts.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: (casually, almost to himself)
dialog: We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: So I hear.
speaker_heading: PERSONNEL OFFICER
dialog: (looks up at Travis)
dialog: Hell, we ain't that much fussy
dialog: anyway. There's always opening on
dialog: one fleet or another.
text: (rummages through his
dialog: drawer, collecting
dialog: various pink, yellow
dialog: and white forms)
dialog: Fill out these forms and give them

dialog: your phone number. You gotta phone?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS

speaker_heading: CREDITS
text: CREDITS appear over scenes from MANHATTAN NIGHTLIFE. The
text: snow has melted, it is spring.
text: A rainy, slick, wet miserable night in Manhattan's theatre
dialog: district.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
text: Cabs and umbrellas are congested everywhere; well-dressed
text: pedestrians are pushing, running, waving down taxis. The
text: high-class theatre patrons crowding out of the midtown shows
text: are shocked to find that the same rain that falls on the
text: poor and common is also falling on them.
text: The unremitting SOUNDS of HONKING and SHOUTING play against
text: the dull pitter-patter of rain. The glare of yellow, red and
text: green lights reflects off the pavements and autos.
dialog: "When it rains, the boss of the city is the taxi driver" -
text: so goes the cabbie's maxim, proven true by this particular
text: night's activity. Only the taxis seem to rise above the
text: situation: They glide effortlessly through the rain and
text: traffic, picking up whom they choose, going where they please.
text: Further uptown, the crowds are neither so frantic nor so
text: glittering. The rain also falls on the street bums and aged
text: poor. Junkies still stand around on rainy street corners,
text: hookers still prowl rainy sidewalks. And the taxis service
dialog: them too.
text: All through the CREDITS the exterior sounds are muted, as if
text: coming from a distant room or storefront around the corner.
text: The listener is at a safe but privileged distance.
text: After examining various strata of Manhattan nightlife,
text: CAMERA begins to CLOSE IN on one particular taxi, and it is
text: assumed that this taxi is being driven by TRAVIS BICKLE.
speaker_heading: END CREDITS
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Travis's yellow taxi pulls in foreground. On left rear door
text: are lettered the words "Dependable Taxi Service".
text: We are somewhere on the upper fifties on Fifth Ave. The rain
text: has not let up.
text: An ELDERLY WOMAN climbs in the right rear door, crushing her
text: umbrella. Travis waits a moment, then pulls away from the
text: curb with a start.
text: Later, we see Travis' taxi speeding down the rain-slicked
text: avenue. The action is periodically accompanied by Travis'
text: narration. He is reading from a haphazard personal diary.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: (monotone)
dialog: April 10, 1972. Thank God for the
dialog: rain which has helped wash the

text: TRAVIS' POV of sleazy midtown side street: Bums, hookers,
dialog: junkies.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: I'm working a single now, which
dialog: means stretch-shifts, six to six,
dialog: sometimes six to eight in the a.m.,
dialog: six days a week.
text: A MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT hails Travis to the curb.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
text: It's a hustle, but it keeps me busy.
dialog: I can take in three to three-fifty
text: a week, more with skims.
text: MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT, now seated in back seat, speaks up:
scene_heading: MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
dialog: (urgent)
dialog: Is Kennedy operating, cabbie? Is it
dialog: grounded?
text: On seat next to TRAVIS is half-eaten cheeseburger and order
text: of french fries. He puts his cigarette down and gulps as he
dialog: answers:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Why should it be grounded?
scene_heading: MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
dialog: Listen - I mean I just saw the
text: needle of the Empire State Building.
dialog: You can't see it for the fog!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
scene_heading: MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
dialog: The Empire State in fog means
dialog: something, don't it? Do you know,
dialog: or don't you? What is your number,
dialog: cabbie?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Have you tried the telephone?
scene_heading: MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
dialog: (hostile, impatient)
dialog: There isn't time for that. In other
dialog: words, you don't know.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
scene_heading: MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
dialog: Well, you should know, damn it, or
dialog: who else would know? Pull over
dialog: right here.
dialog: (points out window)
dialog: Why don't you stick your goddamn
dialog: head out of the goddamn window once
dialog: in a while and find out about the
dialog: goddamn fog!
text: TRAVIS pulls to the curb. The BUSINESS MAN stuffs a dollar
text: bill into the pay drawer and jumps out of the cab. He turns
text: to hail another taxi.
scene_heading: MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT
dialog: Taxi! Taxi!
text: Travis writes up his trip card and drives away.
text: It is LATER THAT NIGHT. The rain has turned to drizzle.
text: Travis drives trough another section of Manhattan.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: I work the whole city, up, down,
dialog: don't make no difference to me -
dialog: does to some.
scene_heading: STREETSIDE: TRAVIS' P.O.V. Black PROSTITUTE wearing white
text: vinyl boots, leopard-skin mini-skirt and blond wig hails
text: taxi. On her arm hangs half-drunk seedy EXECUTIVE TYPE.
text: TRAVIS pulls over.
text: PROSTITUTE and JOHN climb into back seat. TRAVIS checks out
text: the action in rear view mirror.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
dialog: Some won't take spooks - Hell,
dialog: don't make no difference tom me.
text: TRAVIS' taxi drives through Central Park.
text: GRUNTS, GROANS coming from back seat. HOOKER and JOHN going
text: at it in back seat. He's having a hard time and she's

text: TRAVIS stares blankly ahead.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TRAVIS' APARTMENT. CAMERA PANS SILENTLY across INT. room,
text: indicating this is not a new scene.
text: TRAVIS is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt,
text: jeans, boots. An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent
text: coffee can ash tray.
text: CLOSE UP of notebook. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook
text: and the words TRAVIS is writing with a stubby pencil are
text: those he is saying. The columns are straight, disciplined.
text: Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The
text: handwriting is jagged.
text: CAMERA continues to PAN, examining TRAVIS' apartment. It is
dialog: unusual, to say the least:
text: A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor
text: is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets
dialog: maps and pornography. The pornography is of the sort that
text: looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos
text: of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and
text: clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety
text: chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright
text: melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like
text: a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers
text: are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires
text: dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: They're all animals anyway. All the
dialog: animals come out at night: Whores,
dialog: skunk pussies, buggers, queens,
dialog: fairies, dopers, junkies, sick,
dialog: venal.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Someday a real rain will come and
dialog: wash all this scum off the streets.
text: It's EARLY MORNING: 6 a.m. The air is clean and fresh and
text: the streets nearly deserted.
text: EXT. of TAXI GARAGE. TRAVIS' taxi pulls into the driveway.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
dialog: Each night when I return the cab to
dialog: the garage I have to clean the come
dialog: off the back seat. Some nights I
dialog: clean off the blood.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
text: INT. of TAXI GARAGE. TRAVIS pulls his taxi into garage
text: stall. TRAVIS reaches across the cab and extracts a small
text: vial of bennies from the glove compartment.
text: TRAVIS stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and
text: tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers
text: his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends
dialog: inside.
text: He shakes a cigarette out of his pack of camels and lights it.
text: SLIGHT TIMECUT: TRAVIS books it at garage office. Old,
text: rotting slabs of wood are screwed to a grey crumbling
text: concrete wall. Each available space is covered with hand-
text: lettered signs, time schedules, check-out sheets, memos. The
dialog: signs read:
dialog: BE ALERT!!

text: AT 9 AM THE FOLLOWING MORNING AT
dialog: 43 W. 61st.
text: A half dozen haggard cabbies hang around the office. Their
text: shirts are wrinkle, their heads dropping, the mouths
text: incessantly chattering. We pick up snatches of cabbie small
dialog: talk:
speaker_heading: 1ST CABBIE
dialog: ... hadda piss like a bull steer,
text: so I pull over on 10th Ave, yank up
text: the hood and do the engine job.
dialog: (gestures as if
dialog: taking a piss into
dialog: the hood)
text: There I am with my dong in my hand
dialog: when a guy come up and asks if I
dialog: need any help. Just checking the
dialog: battery, I says, and, meanwhile...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: 1ST CABBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: (takes imaginary piss)
speaker_heading: 2ND CABBIE
dialog: If he thinks I'm going up into The
dialog: Jungle this time of night, he can
dialog: shove it.
speaker_heading: 3RD CABBIE
dialog: (talking into pay phone)
dialog: Fuck that Violets First. Fucking
dialog: saddle horse. No, no, the OTB. Fuck
dialog: them. No, it was TKR. TCR and I'da
dialog: made seven fucking grand. Fuck them
dialog: too. Alright, what about the second
dialog: race?
speaker_heading: 4TH CABBIE
dialog: Over at Love, this hooker took on
dialog: the whole garage. Blew the whole
dialog: fucking joint and they wouldn't
dialog: even let her use the drinking
dialog: fountain.
text: Travis hands his trip sheet to a CAB OFFICIAL, nods slightly,
text: turns and walks toward the door.
text: OUTSIDE, TRAVIS walks pleasantly down Broadway, his hands in
text: his jacket pockets. The sidewalks are deserted, except for
text: diligent fruit and vegetable VENDORS setting up their stalls.
text: He takes a deep breath of fresh air, pulls a white pill from
text: his pocket, pops it into his mouth.
text: Travis turns a corner, keeps walking. Ahead of him is a 24-
text: hour PORNO THEATRE. The theatre, a blaze of cheap day-glow
text: reds and yellows, is an offense to the clear, crisp morning
text: air. The permanent lettering reads, "Adam Theatre, 16mm
text: Sound Features". Underneath, today's feature are hand-
text: lettered: "Six-Day Cruise" and "Beaver Dam".
text: Travis stops at the box office, purchases a ticket, and
text: walks in.
scene_heading: INT. PORNO THEATRE
text: Travis stands in the aisle for a moment. He turns around,
text: walking back toward the concession stand.
speaker_heading: CONCESSION STAND
text: A plain dumpy-looking GIRL sits listlessly on a stool behind
text: the shabby concession stand. A plaster-of-Paris Venus de
text: Milo sits atop a piece of purple velvet cloth on the counter.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: The SOUND of the feature drones in the background.
speaker_heading: CONCESSION GIRL
dialog: Kin I help ya?
text: Travis rests his elbow on the counter, looking at the Girl.
text: He is obviously trying to be friendly - no easy task for him.
dialog: God knows he needs a friend.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What is your name? My name is Travis.
speaker_heading: CONCESSION GIRL
dialog: Awh, come off it, Pal.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No, I'm serious, really...
speaker_heading: CONCESSION GIRL
dialog: Ya want me to call da boss? Huh?
dialog: That what you want?
speaker_heading: CONCESSION GIRL
dialog: No, no, it's alright. I'll have a
dialog: big Coca-Cola - without ice - and a
text: large buttered popcorn, and...
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: ... some of them chocolate covered
dialog: malted milk balls... and ju-jukes,
text: a box. They last.
speaker_heading: CONCESSION GIRL
dialog: We don't have ju-jukes. We don't
dialog: have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal
dialog: Crown Cola.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: That's fine.
speaker_heading: CONCESSION GIRL
dialog: That's a dollar forty-seven.
text: Travis lays two dollar bills on the counter.
scene_heading: INT. THEATRE AUDITORIUM
text: Slight TIMECUT to Travis sitting in theatre, drinking his
text: Royal Crown Cola, eating his popcorn and milk balls. His
text: eyes are fixed on the screen. A MALE VOICE emanates from the
dialog: screen:
speaker_heading: MALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Come here, bitch. I'm gonna split
dialog: you in half.
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
text: Male Voice yields to Travis' monotone narration.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: Twelve hours of work and I still
text: cannot sleep. The days dwindle on
dialog: forever and do not end.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS
dialog: The Headquarters of the "New Yorkers for Charles Palantine
dialog: for President Committee", located at the corner of 50th
text: Street and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white
text: and blue banners, ribbons and signs.
text: One large sign proclaims "Palantine". Another sign reads
text: "Register for New York Primary, July 20.". The smiling
text: middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the
text: bustling pedestrians.
text: It is LATE AFTERNOON.
scene_heading: INSIDE HEADQUARTERS
text: A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor
text: through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound
text: of ringing phones.
text: Seen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them -
dialog: those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well-
text: groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields
dialog: of Massachusetts and Connecticut.
text: CAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman
text: sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several
text: stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than
text: skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen,
text: though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every
text: man who passes her desk as her mind computes his
dialog: desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional,
dialog: material. Simple pose and status do not impress her; she
dialog: seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in
dialog: other words, star-fucker of the highest order.
text: Betsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable
text: and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Tom.
text: Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special
text: qualities which interest Betsy. He gets nowhere with Betsy -
text: yet he keeps trying.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: Just another of those routine office flirtations which pass
dialog: the hours and free the fantasies.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Tom, come here a moment.
dialog: (he walks over)
dialog: I think this canvas report is about
dialog: ready to go out. Check it out with
dialog: Andy, and if he okays if, have a
dialog: copy made for the campaign
dialog: headquarters in every county.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: And don't forget to add the new
dialog: photo releases.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: The senator's white paper is almost
dialog: ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Andy usually just sends those to
dialog: the national media. The local press
dialog: doesn't know what to do with a
dialog: position paper until UPI and AP
dialog: tell them anyway.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I think we should try to get
dialog: maximum coverage for this new
dialog: mandatory welfare program. Push the
dialog: issues.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (as if instructing a child)
dialog: First push the man, then the issue.
dialog: Senator Palantine is first of all a
dialog: dynamic man, an intelligent,
dialog: interesting, fascinating man.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You forgot "sexy".
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No, I didn't forget "sexy".
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Just didn't get around to it, huh?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Oh, Tom, please.
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, for Christsakes, you sound
dialog: like you're selling... I don't know
dialog: what... cars... not issues.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Have you ever wondered why CBS News
dialog: has the highest ratings?
speaker_heading: TOM
text: More people watch it.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Alright, forget it if you're not
dialog: going to be serious,
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was
dialog: just...
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Just what?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Kidding around... you know, fun.
text: Betsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Maybe if you'd try thinking once in
dialog: a while, you'd get somewhere.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: With who?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Alright, now. You want to know why
dialog: CBS has the highest ratings? You
dialog: their news is any different from
dialog: NBC, ABC? It's all the same news.
dialog: Same stories. Same order usually.
dialog: What, you thought they had good
dialog: news for people, right? You thought
dialog: that's why people watched CBS? I'll
dialog: tell you why people watch CBS.
dialog: Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not
dialog: the news, not the issues, the man.
dialog: If Walter Cronkite told people to
dialog: eat soap, they'd do it. We are
dialog: selling cars, goddamn it.
text: Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees
text: across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out
text: across the street again.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, if Cronkite's so great, why
dialog: don't we run him instead?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: That's the last. The finish. Period.
dialog: Some pople can learn. Some people
dialog: can't. And you wonder why we never
dialog: get serious----
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sure we could run him. You realize
dialog: he's already of his block
dialog: association.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (looks across street again)
dialog: Have you been noticing anything
dialog: strange?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Why's that taxi driver across the
dialog: street been staring at us?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What taxi driver?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: That taxi driver. The one that's
dialog: been sitting here.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How long has he been there?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I don't know - but it feels like a
dialog: long time.
text: Travis' cold piercingly eyes Stare out from his cab parked
text: across the street from Palantine Headquarters. He is like a
text: lone wolf watching the warm campfires of civilization from a
text: distance. A thin red dot glows from his cigarette.
text: Tom exchanges Travis' gaze.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (determined)
dialog: Well, I'll go out and ask him.
text: As Tom walks toward front door Betsy's eyes alternate
text: between him and the position where Travis sits.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
scene_heading: EXT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
text: Tom strides out the front door and walks briskly across the
text: street toward Travis' taxi.
text: Travis spots Tom walking toward him and quickly stares up
text: his cab, then squeals off in a burst of billowing exhaust.
text: Tom watches the speeding taxi quizzically.
text: Travis' taxi continues down Broadway.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT
text: He lies on his mattress at the ceiling. He is fully clothed
text: and appears deep in thought.
text: Near his mattress rest several medications: A large bottle
text: of vitamin pills, two smaller bottles of pills, a bottle of
text: peach-flavored brandy.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: All my life needed was a sense of
dialog: direction, a sense of someplace to

dialog: I first saw her at Palantine
dialog: Campaign Headquarters at 58th and
text: Broadway. She was wearing a yellow
text: dress, answering the phone at her
dialog: desk.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
text: Suddenly: Cut of the congested human mass, IN SLOWING
text: MOTION, appears the slender figure of BETSY in a stylish
text: yellow dress. The crowd parts like the Red Sea, and there
text: she is: Walking all alone, untouched by the crowd, suspended
dialog: in space and time.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
text: She appeared like an angel out of
dialog: this open sewer. Out of this filthy
dialog: mass. She is alone: They cannot
text: touch her.
scene_heading: INT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT
text: He is at the table, writing in his diary.
text: CLOSEUP - His stubby pencil rests on the word "her".
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: It is 3:30 IN THE MORNING in a bacon-shaped all night WEST
text: SIDE REATAURANT. The thick smell hangs in the air - fried
text: grease, smoke, sweat, regurgitated wine.
text: Whatever doesn't flush away in New York at night turns up in
text: places like this. A burly grease-stained COOK stands over
text: the grill. A JUNKIE shuffles from one side of the door to
text: another. Slouched over the small four-person formica tables
text: are several WELL-DRESSED BLACKS (too well-dressed for this
text: time and place), a cluster of STREET PEOPLE and a lost OLD
text: COOT who hangs onto his cup of coffee as if it were his last
dialog: possession.
text: The restaurant, brightly lit, perfectly conveys the image
text: urban plasticity - without the slightest hint of an
dialog: accompanying cleanliness.
text: Toward the rear of the restaurant sit three cabbies: WIZARD,
text: a worn man about fifty, DOUGH-BOY, younger family man,
text: CHARLIE T., fourtyish Black.
text: Wizard is telling Dough-Boy a story. Charlie T., his elbows
text: popped against table top, is not listening. He stares
text: silently down at a plate of cold scrambled eggs and a Racing
text: Forum. His eyes may not be open.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: First she did her make-up. You
dialog: know, I hate it when they do that.
dialog: I mean she does the whole works,
dialog: the mascara, the eye-shadow, the
dialog: lipstick, the rouge...
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
text: The kind with a brush.
text: Travis appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNKIES
dialog: to enter without making physical contact - something Travis
dialog: would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people and
dialog: this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his
text: feelings rise to the surface.
text: Wizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Travis.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Hey Wizard.
text: Travis straddles a seat at the table. Dough-Boy gives Travis
text: something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying:
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses
dialog: it,
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (ironic)
dialog: Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
text: Travis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Well, whatever the fuck it is, she
dialog: used it. And then the spray perfume.
dialog: You know, the real sweat kind -
dialog: and, on top of that, get this,
dialog: right when we're crossing the Tri-
dialog: boro bridge - she changes her
dialog: pantyhose!
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: No.
text: Travis turns his head. He appears not to be interested, but
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Could you see anything?
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Well, she was trying to keep her
dialog: skirt down, sort of, you know. But
dialog: it was pretty obvious what she was
dialog: doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush
dialog: hour and the traffic's practically
text: standing still.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Threw on the emergency, jumped the
dialog: seat and fucked her brains out -
dialog: What do you think!
dialog: (they laugh)
dialog: What do I have to do? Draw you a
dialog: picture?
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: What was I supposed to do? I was
dialog: watching in the rear view. You
dialog: know, just checkin' traffic.
dialog: (to Travis)
dialog: So howsit?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (w/o inflection)
dialog: Some fleet driver for Bell just cut
text: up. Just heard it on the radio.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Stick up?
text: A WAITRESS brings Travis' coffee and a glass of water. He
text: asks for a cheeseburger.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Sure. What do you think? She wanted
dialog: to get out of the cab. I said
dialog: "Look, you're in the middle of the
dialog: fucking bridge..."
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: You said that?
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're
dialog: on a bridge..."
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: And what happened?
text: Travis awaits Wizard's answer.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: She stayed in the cab, what's she
dialog: gonna do? but she stiffed me. A
dialog: real skunk.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
text: A real skunk.
text: Wizard realizes Travis and Dough-Boy may not have met.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (paternal)
dialog: Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie
dialog: T.?
text: Charlie T. nods sleepily. Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
dialog: (laughs)
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: We call him Dough-Boy cause he
dialog: likes the dollars. He'll chase a
text: buck straight into Jersey.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Look who's talking?
dialog: (gestures around table)
dialog: Who else would stay up all night to
dialog: catch the morning rush hour?
text: Travis sips his coffee. Charlie T.'s eyelids slip shut.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (to Travis)
dialog: So howsit?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (w/o inflection)
dialog: Some fleet driver for Bell just got
text: cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Stick up?
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No, just some crazy fucker. Cut
dialog: have his ear off.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Where.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
text: In the jungle. 122nd.
text: Travis' eyes turn toward the restaurant's other patrons.
text: POV: THREE STREET PEOPLE sitting at a table. One GUY,
text: stoned, stares straight ahead. A raggedly attractive GIRL
text: rest her head on the shoulder of the other, a heavily
text: bearded YOUNG MAN with a headband. They kiss and tease each
text: other, momentarily lost in their separate world.
text: Travis watches the hippie couple closely, his feeling
text: sharply divided between cultural contempt and morose jealousy.
dialog: Why should these people enjoy the love and intimacy that has
dialog: always eluded him? He must enjoy these schizoid emotions,
text: because his eyes dwell on the couple.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: You run all over town, don't you,
dialog: Travis?
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (referring to 122nd St.)
dialog: Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what
dialog: it is.
text: Travis turns back to his companions.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: I mean, you handle some pretty
dialog: rough traffic, huh?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: I have.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: You carry a piece? You need one?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Nah.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I suppose not.
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
text: Waitress slaps down smudge-marked glass of water, and a
text: cheeseburger plate that looks more like a shrunken head on a
text: serving platter.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Well, you ever need one, I know a
dialog: feller that kin getcha a real nice
dialog: deal. Lotsa shit around.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: The cops and company raise hell
text: they find out.
text: Travis drops two Alka-Seltzer into his glass of water.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Truck drivers bring up Harlem
dialog: Specials that blow up in your hand.
dialog: But this guy don't deal no shit.
dialog: Just quality. If you ever need
dialog: anything, I can put you in touch.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: For a fee.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: For a fee.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: I never use mine. But it's a good
dialog: thing to have. Just as a threat.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: well, if there's this many hackies
dialog: inside, there must be lots of hares
dialog: outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: What ya gonna do with all that
dialog: money, Dough-Boy?
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Support my kids. Can you dig it?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: nice to meet ya, Travis. So long,
dialog: Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for
dialog: me.
dialog: (nods to Charlie T.)
text: Charlie T. remains unmoved: He is sleeping.
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
text: Dough-Boy exits. Travis smiles perfunctorily, then looks
dialog: back at Wizard. They really don't have much to talk about,
dialog: and the Wizard doesn't care to manufacture any more
dialog: conversations.
text: Travis scans the greasy spoon: The scene is unchanged.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DAY
text: Traffic passes.
scene_heading: INT. PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
text: Tom and Betsy are talking. She takes out a cigarette. He
text: takes out matches to light it.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Try holding the match like this.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: This is gotta be a game, right?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (putting on glasses)
dialog: This I gotta see.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (burning fingers)
dialog: Ouch!
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: Oh, are you all right?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I'm great. Always set my fingers on
dialog: fire. If you want to see another
dialog: trick. I do this thing with my nose.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No. I just wanted to see if you
dialog: could light it that way. The guy at
text: the newsstand can.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand,
dialog: Mr. Asbestos...
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: He happens to be missing fingers. I
dialog: first noticed when -
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Is he Italian?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No, why?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You sure he's not Italian?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: He's Black, OK?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Well, If he had been Italian, they
dialog: could have been shot off. Sometimes
dialog: the mob does that to teach guys a
dialog: lesson, If they blow a job or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: As I said, he isn't Italian.
dialog: Besides, I thought they just killed
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Don't be naive. They can't kill
dialog: everybody. They have different
dialog: punishments for different things.
dialog: Like, if they kill a stool pidgeon,
text: they leave a canary on the body.
dialog: It's symbolic.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Why don't they leave a pidgeon
dialog: instead of a canary?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I don't know. Maybe they don't
dialog: leave a canary. Don't be technical.
dialog: What I'm saying is if this newsstand
text: guy's Italian and his fingers are
dialog: gone, maybe he's a thief.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: First, he's not Italian. Second
dialog: he's not a thief. I noticed the
dialog: fingers when he was getting my
dialog: change - the right change. Two of
text: his fingers are missing. Just stubs.
dialog: Like they were blown away. I was
dialog: putting my change in my purse when
dialog: I saw him get out a cigarette. I
dialog: couldn't help watching. I was dying
dialog: to see how he'd light it.
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: With the other hand, right?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No, stupid. With the stubs. That's
dialog: the whole point.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I know that guy. His hand looks
text: like a paw. An old Black guy, the
dialog: newsstand at -
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No, this is young - well, I'm never
dialog: sure how old Black people are -
dialog: but, anyway, he isn't old. That's
dialog: for sure.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Show me how he did that again.
scene_heading: EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM HEADQUARTERS
text: Travis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the
dialog: Palantine Headquarters.
dialog: He s dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not
text: jeans) are pressed, his boots shined, his hair combed. Under
text: his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy
text: league tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in.
text: Watching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are
text: surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive.
text: His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes
dialog: he is cursed, and therefore he is.
text: Travis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward
text: Betsy's desk. Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis
text: ignores him.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (at Betsy's desk)
dialog: I want to volunteer.
text: As the CAMERA examines Travis' face more closely, one can
text: see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient
dialog: diet.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (at Betsy's desk)
dialog: If you'll come this way.
text: Travis elbows Tom off.
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (to Betsy)
dialog: No. I want to volunteer to you.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (under his voice)
dialog: Bets.
text: BETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture, indicating
text: everything is OK. He walks away.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (curious)
dialog: And why is that?
text: TRAVIS is on his best behavior. He smiles slightly:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Because you are the most beautiful
dialog: woman I have ever seen.
text: BETSY is momentarily taken back, but pleased. TRAVIS'
dialog: presence has a definite sexual charge. He has those star
dialog: qualities BETSY looks for: She senses there is something
text: special about the young man who stands before her. And then,
text: too, there is that disarming smile. He is, as Betsy would
dialog: say, "fascinating".
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Is that so?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But what do you think of Charles
dialog: Palantine?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (his mind elsewhere)
dialog: Who mam?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Charles Palantine. The man you want
dialog: to volunteer to help elect president.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Oh, I think he's a wonderful man.
dialog: Make a great, great President.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You want to canvass?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yes, mam.
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
text: Betsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a
text: little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: How do you feel about Senator
dialog: Palantine's stand on welfare?
text: This takes TRAVIS back a bit. He obviously doesn't have the
dialog: slightest idea what Palantine's stand on welfare is, in
dialog: fact, he doesn't have any idea about politics whatsoever.
text: TRAVIS thinks a moment, then improvises an answer:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Welfare, mam? I think the Senator's
dialog: right. People should work for a
dialog: living. I do. I like to work. Every
dialog: day. Get those old coots off
dialog: welfare and make 'em work for a
dialog: change.
text: Betsy does a subtle double-take: This isn't exactly
text: Palantine's position on welfare. She remain intrigued by
dialog: Travis.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Well, that's not exactly what the
dialog: Senator has proposed. You might not
dialog: want to canvass, but there is
dialog: plenty more other work we need
dialog: done: Office work, filing, poster
dialog: hanging.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a
dialog: real good worker.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (gesturing)
dialog: if you talk to Tom, he'll assign
dialog: you to something.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather
dialog: work for you.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Well, we're all working tonight.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at
dialog: night.
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Well, then, what is it you exactly
dialog: want to do?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (bolstering courage)
dialog: If you don't mind, mam, I'd be
dialog: mighty pleased if you'd go out and
dialog: have some coffee and pie with me.
text: Betsy doesn't quite know what to make of Travis. She is
text: curious, intrigued, tantalized. Like a moth, she draws
text: closer to the flame.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this
dialog: place here in my taxi many times a
dialog: day. And I watch you sitting here
dialog: at this big long desk with these
dialog: telephones, and I say to myself,
dialog: that's a lonely girl. She needs a
dialog: friend. And I'm gonna be her friend.
dialog: (smiles)
text: Travis rarely smiles, but when he does his whole face glows.
text: It is as if he is able to tap an inner reserve of charm
text: unknown even to himself. Betsy is completely disarmed.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: It's just to the corner, mam. In
dialog: broad daytime. Nothing can happen.
dialog: I'll be there to protect you.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: All right.
dialog: (relents)
dialog: All right. I'm taking a break at
dialog: four o'clock. If you're here then
dialog: we'll go to the corner and have
text: some coffee and pie.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam.
dialog: I'll be here at four o'clock
dialog: exactly.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: And... ah... Betsy...
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: My name is Travis.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Thank you, Travis.
text: Travis nods, turns and exits.
text: Tom, who has been watching this interchange with a pseudo-
text: standoffish (actually jealous) air, steps over to Betsy. His
dialog: manner demands some sort of explanation of what Betsy was
dialog: doing.
text: Betsy simply shrugs (it's really none of his business) and
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I'm just going to find out what the
text: cabbies are thinking.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Travis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the
text: Palantine Headquarters. He checks his watch.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: April 26, 1972. Four o'clock p.m. I
dialog: took Betsy to the Mayfair Coffee
dialog: Shop on Broadway...
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP
text: Travis and Betsy are sitting in a booth of a small New York
text: Coffee Shop. They both have been served coffee; Travis is
text: nervously turning his cup around in his hands.
text: As Travis speaks V.O., WAITRESS brings their orders: Apple
text: pie for TRAVIS, fruit compote for BETSY.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: I had black coffee and apple pie
text: with a slice of melted yellow
dialog: cheese. I think that was a good
dialog: selection. Betsy had coffee and a
dialog: fruit salad dish. She could have
dialog: had anything she wanted.
text: Betsy's conversation interrupts Travis' V.O.:
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: We've signed up 15.000 Palantine
dialog: volunteers in New York so far. The
dialog: organizational problems are becoming
text: just staggering.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I know what you mean. I've got the
dialog: same problems. I just can't get
dialog: things organized. Little things, I
dialog: mean. Like my room, my possessions.
dialog: I should get one of those signs
dialog: that says, "One of these days I'm
dialog: Gonna Organezizied".
text: Travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation,
text: than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. The very
dialog: sight of it makes one's heart proud.
text: Betsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin. Travis'
text: contagious, quicksilver moods cause:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Travis, I never ever met anybody
dialog: like you before.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I can believe that.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Where do you live?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (evasive)
dialog: Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint.
dialog: It ain't much.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: So why did you decide to drive a
dialog: taxi at night?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I had a regular job for a while,
dialog: days. You know, doin' this, doin'
dialog: that. But I didn't have anything to
dialog: do at night. I got kinda lonely,
dialog: you know, just wandering around. So
dialog: I decided to works nights. It ain't
dialog: good to be alone, you know.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: After this job, I'm looking forward
text: to being alone for a while.
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah, well...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: In a cab you get to meet people.
dialog: You meet lotsa people. It's good
dialog: for you.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: What kind of people?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Just people people, you know. Just
dialog: people.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Had a dead man once.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: He'd been shot. I didn't know that.
text: He just crawled into the back seat,
dialog: said "West 45th Street" and conked
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I shot the meter off, for one thing.
dialog: I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid.
dialog: Then I dropped him off at the cop
dialog: shop. They took him.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: That's really something.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in
text: a cab. Especially when the moon's
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: The moon?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: The full moon. One night I had
text: three or four weirdoes in a row and
dialog: I looked up and, sure enough, there
dialog: it was - the full moon.
text: Betsy laughs. Travis continues:
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Oh, yeah. People will do anything
dialog: in front of a taxi driver. I mean
dialog: anything. People too cheap to rent
text: a hotel room, people scoring dope,
dialog: people shooting up, people who want
dialog: to embarrass you.
dialog: (a bitterness emerges)
dialog: It's like you're not even there,
dialog: not even a person. Nobody knows you.
dialog: Betsy cuts Travis' bitterness short:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad.
dialog: I take lots of taxis.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I know. I could have picked you up.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
text: Late one night. About three. At the
dialog: plaza.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Three in the morning? I don't think
dialog: so. I have to go to bed early. I
dialog: work days. It must have been
dialog: somebody else.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No. It was you. You had some manila
text: folders and a pink bag from Saks.
text: Betsy, realizing Travis remembers her precisely, scrambles
dialog: for a polite rationale for her behavior:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You're right! Now I remember! It
dialog: was after the Western regional
dialog: planners were in town and the
dialog: meeting went late. The next day I
text: was completely bushed. It was
dialog: unbelievable.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: If it wasn't for a drunk I would
dialog: have picked you up. He wanted to go
dialog: to the DMZ.
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: BETSY
speaker_heading: The DMZ?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: South Bronx. The worst. I tried to
dialog: ditch him, but he was already in
dialog: the cab, so I had to take him.
dialog: That's the law. Otherwise I would
dialog: have picked you up.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: That would have been quite a
dialog: coincidence.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You'd be surprised how often you
dialog: see the same people, get the same
dialog: fare. People have patterns. They do
dialog: more or less the same things every
dialog: day. I can tell.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Well, I don't go to the Plaza every
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I didn't mean you. But just ordinary
dialog: people. A guy I know - Dough-Boy -
dialog: met his wife that way. They got to
dialog: talking. She said she usually
dialog: caught the bus so he started
text: picking her up at the bus stop,
text: taking her home with the flag up.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: That's very romantic. Some of your
dialog: fares must be interesting. See any
dialog: stars, politicians, deliver any
dialog: babies yet?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, no... not really... had some
text: famous people in the cab.
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: I got this guy who makes lasers.
dialog: Not regular lasers, not the big
text: kind. Little lasers, pocket sized,
dialog: small enough to clip your belt like
dialog: a transistor radio, like a gun, you
dialog: know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: What hours do you work?
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I work a single, which means
dialog: there's no replacement - no second
text: man on the cab. Six to six,
dialog: sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours
dialog: a week.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: You mean you work seventy-two hours
dialog: a week.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I
dialog: squeeze a few more hours in the
dialog: morning. Eighty miles a day, a
dialog: hundred miles a night.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You must be rich.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (big affectionate smile)
dialog: it keeps ya busy.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You know what you remind me of?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: That song by Kris Kristofferson,
dialog: where it's said "Like a pusher,
dialog: party truth, partly ficition, a
dialog: walking contradiction".
dialog: (smiles)
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I
dialog: never have pushed.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I didn't mean that, Travis. Just
dialog: the part about the contradiction.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (more at ease)
dialog: Oh. Who was that again?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: The singer?
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Kris Kristofferson.
text: Travis looks at Betsy intently and they exchange smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Travis is walking confusedly around SAM GOODY'S at MIDDAY,
text: obviously unable to locate what he desires.
text: Travis is lost among the hip, young intellectual type that
text: populate the store. He watches the stylish, attractive
text: female help, unable to come right out and requests what he
dialog: desires.
text: A young SALESGIRL sees his plight, walks over and asks if he
text: needs any help. Travis INAUDIBLY says a name to her, although
text: the name is obviously Kris Kristofferson.
text: The Salesgirl digs out Kristofferson's "Silver-Tongued
dialog: Devil" album for him.
text: Travis says something additional to the Salesgirl and she
text: goes off to gift-wrap the album.
text: Travis emerges from the RECORD STORE, the brightly gift-
text: wrapped album proudly tucked under his arm.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A lengthy POV SHOT from Travis' vantage point behind the
dialog: wheel.
text: We see the city as Travis sees it. The front windshield is a
text: little dirty, the lighted meter just up at the low right
text: screen. The intercom crackles with STATIC and MESSAGES.
text: The light turns green; we take off with a start. A short
text: first gear - quick shift - a long second gear. The cab eases
text: to the right of the street, checking out prospective fares.
text: Our eyes scan the long lines of PEDESTRIANS. The regular -
dialog: bums, junkies, tourists, hookers, homosexuals, hippies -
text: they mean nothing now. They only blend into the sidewalks
text: and lighted storefronts.
text: Our eyes now concentrate on those that step away from the
text: curb - is that man hailing a cab or scratching his head?
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
text: In the next block there are perhaps three, four fares -
text: quick gas-up through this yellow light - brake sharply -
dialog: check the action. The first: Tourist, nickel tipper - let
dialog: the next guy pick them up. Let the second go also, the
text: third - there's a live fare. Middle-aged LOCAL WOMAN: Short
dialog: fare to the East Side, good tip.
text: We pull to the curb, waiting for her to get in. It is a long
text: wait - a Black STREET WALKER crosses in front of the cab. We
text: focus on (as Travis would) a YOUNG COUPLE embracing in the
dialog: distance.
text: As we travel, we hear Travis' random thoughts about selecting
dialog: fares and tips:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: You work at night, you get an
dialog: instinct. You can smell them. The
dialog: big tippers, the stiffs, the
dialog: trouble makers. Quarter is good tip
dialog: for Manhattan. Queens is better,
dialog: Brooklyn is best. go for the guys
dialog: with suitcases. The rich are the
dialog: worst tippers, hooks are lousy.
dialog: Spooks are okay, but they don't
dialog: live at Park Ave after all.
text: The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A
text: quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly,
text: "192 East 89". We take off with another jolt. Cross back up
text: 9th Ave, then cut through the park.
dialog: We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we
text: string together? Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but
text: quickly steps back again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a
dialog: $1.40 fare.
dialog: Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the
dialog: numbers - 134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40.
text: Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters
dialog: and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35.
dialog: The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take
text: off again with a jolt.
text: This is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring
text: main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen
dialog: instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are
dialog: these objects?
text: EXT. TRAVIS' TAXI speed down darkened street.
text: Travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza.
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: I called Betsy again at her office,
dialog: and she said maybe we could go to a
text: movie together after she gets off
dialog: work tomorrow. That's my day off.
dialog: At first she hesitated, but I
dialog: called her again and she agreed.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask
dialog: her last name again. Damn. I've
dialog: got to remember stuff like that.
text: Travis' thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter Travis'
text: cab. He activates the meter and pulls off.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE
dialog: St. Regis Hotel.
text: Travis checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he
text: recognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE,
text: candidate for President. He must have left the Hotel
text: shortly after BETSY.
text: Tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks
text: deferentially to Palantine:
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It's 12:30 now. You'll have fifteen
dialog: minutes before the actual luncheon
text: begins.
text: Palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an
dialog: earlier conversation.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: I don't think we have to worry
dialog: about anybody here committing
dialog: themselves until things start
text: coming in from California.
text: Travis recognizes his passenger. He puts out his cigarette.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Say, aren't you Charles Palantine,
dialog: the candidate?
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: (only mildly irritated)
dialog: Yes I am.
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, I'm one of your biggest
dialog: supporters. I tell everybody that
dialog: comes in this cab that they should
dialog: vote for you.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: (pleased; glances to
dialog: check Travis' license)
dialog: Why, thank you Travis.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody
dialog: I know is going to vote for you.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I was going to put one of your
dialog: stickers on my taxi but the company
dialog: said it was against their policy.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: (pleasant)
dialog: I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned
dialog: more about this country sitting in
text: taxi cabs than in the board room of
dialog: General Motors.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (joking)
dialog: And in some other places too...
text: Palantine, his Assistant and Tom all laugh. Palantine,
text: quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to Travis:
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: Travis, what single thing would you
dialog: want the next President of this
dialog: country to do most?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I don't know, sir. I don't follow
dialog: political issues much.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: There must be something...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Well, he should clean up this city
text: here. It's full of filth and scum.
text: Scum and filth. It's like an open
dialog: sewer. I can hardly take it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Some days I go out and smell it
dialog: then I get headaches that just stay
dialog: and never go away. We need a
dialog: President that would clean up this
dialog: whole mess. Flush it out.
dialog: Palantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional
text: bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in his
text: tracks. He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but
text: tries to give it some meaning.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: (after a pause)
dialog: I know what you mean, Travis, and
dialog: it's not going to be easy. We're
dialog: going to have to make some radical
dialog: changes.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (turning the wheel)
dialog: Damn straight.
scene_heading: EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL
text: TRAVIS' taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel.
text: PALANTINE and AIDE get out of the cab. SECOND AIDE stays in
text: back seat a moment to pay TRAVIS.
text: PALANTINE looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods
text: goodbye to TRAVIS.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: Nice talking to you, Travis.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: Thank you, sir. You're a good man,
dialog: sir.
text: Travis' taxi departs.
text: PALANTINE and AIDES walk up carpet to the St. Regis.
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN on PALANTINE as he stops, turns back and
text: watches Travis' departing taxi.
text: PALANTINE turns back and ascends the hotel steps with his
speaker_heading: AIDES.
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
scene_heading: EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - EARLY MORNING
text: TRAVIS, dressed to the teeth, walks brightly down the
text: sidewalk. His face is frehsly shaved, his hair combed, his
dialog: tie straightened.
text: He pauses in a store window to check his appearance.
text: Under his arm he carries the gift-wrapped Kristofferson
dialog: record album.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS
text: BETSY, smartly dressed, waves goodbye to another CAMPAIGN
text: WORKER and walks out the door to greet him.
text: A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS and BETSY are walking down
text: Broadway toward Times Square. BETSY does not let their
text: bodies touch as they walk although TRAVIS contemplates
text: edging closer to her.
text: Betsy has opened the package and is admiring the record -
dialog: or, rather, Travis' sentiment behind giving it.
text: Travis looks around himself with pride: This is a moment in
dialog: his life - one of the few.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You didn't have to spend your
dialog: money - ?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: He'll, what else can I do with it
dialog: all?
text: Betsy notices that the seal on the record has not been broken.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Travis, you haven't even played the
dialog: record?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (evasive)
dialog: Yeah, well my stereo player is
dialog: broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Your stereo broke? God, I could
dialog: hardly stand that. I live on music.
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I don't follow music much. I'd like
dialog: to though.
dialog: (second thought)
dialog: Honest.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: (pointing to album)
dialog: So you haven't heard this record yet?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No.
dialog: (sly smile)
dialog: I thought maybe you could play it
dialog: for me on your player.
text: Betsy's face backtracks a bit. Maybe she was wrong to go out
dialog: with this fellow she doesn't know.
text: She makes a polite laugh.
text: LATER. Travis and Betsy are in TIMES SQUARE, turning the
text: corner from Broadway to 42nd Street. Travis carries the
text: album under his arm.
text: They approach the garish marquee of a large midtown porno
text: theatre advertising "The Swedish Marriage Manual". The box
text: office is flanked on both sides by glass cages filled with
text: explicit publicity stills. Offending portions have been
text: blocked out with black tape.
text: Travis steps over to the window and buys two $5 tickets.
text: Betsy, befuddled, watches him. She doesn't know what to say.
text: Travis returns with the tickets.
text: Betsy still has not fully comprehended what is happening:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (innocent)
dialog: I bought a couple of tickets.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: But this is a porno movie.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No, these are the kind that couples
dialog: go to. They're not like the other
dialog: movies. All kinds of couples go.
dialog: Honest. I've seen them.
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
text: Travis seems confused. He is so much part of his own world,
text: he fails to comprehend another's world. Compared to the
dialog: movies he sees, this is respectable. But then there's also
dialog: something that Travis could not even acknowledge, much less
dialog: admit: That he really wants to get this pure white girl into
dialog: that dark porno theatre.
text: Travis makes an awkward gesture to escort Betsy into the
text: theatre. Betsy looks at the tickets, at the theatre, at
text: Travis. She mentally shakes her head and walks toward the
text: turnstile. She thinks to herself: "What the Hell. What can
dialog: happen?" She's always been curious about these pictures
dialog: anyway, and - like all women, no matter how intelligent -
text: she's been raised not to offend her date. A perverse logic
dialog: which applies even more in offsetting circumstances like
dialog: these.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE THEATER
text: Travis escorts Betsy to an empty center row. Travis was
dialog: right. Couples do go to films like this. There are at least
text: six or seven other MEN with their bewigged "DATES".
text: Travis settles into his familiar porno theatre slouch. Betsy
text: looks curiously from side to side.
text: ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is
dialog: speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in
text: a happy marriage. Subtitles translate her words. Then,
text: without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating
text: on a sterile table-like bed.
text: Travis watches intently. The color, however, is slowly
text: draining from Betsy's cheeks. One thought fills her mind:
dialog: "What am I doing here?"
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
text: That does it. Betsy just looks at him for a moment, then
text: gets up and starts to leave. Travis, confused, hustles after
dialog: her.
text: He follows her out of the theatre.
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
text: ON THE SIDEWALK
text: Travis catches up with her.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I'm leaving.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Betsy looks at Travis, trying to understand him:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: These are not the kind of movies I
dialog: go to.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, I don't follow movies too
dialog: much...
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: You mean these are the only kind of
dialog: movies you go to?
text: The TICKET GIRL watches expressionlessly from the booth.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: This is sort of high class...
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I mean porno movies.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Well... mostly...
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: My God!
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: We can go to another movie if you
dialog: like, I don't care. I got money.
dialog: There's plenty...
text: Travis gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees,
text: but is interrupted by Betsy:
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: If you just wanted to fuck, why
dialog: didn't you just come right out and
dialog: say it?
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
text: Travis is flabbergasted by Betsy's blunt language. His arm
text: still gestures toward the marquees, his lips continue to
text: move, but words do not come out.
text: Unable to respond to Betsy's question, Travis picks up where
dialog: he left off:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: ... there's plenty of movies around
dialog: here. I haven't seen any of them,
dialog: but I'm sure they're good.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and
dialog: all that, but I think this is it.
dialog: I'm going home.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: You mean you don't want to go to a
dialog: movie?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: There's plenty of movies around here.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No, I don't feel so good. We're
dialog: just two very different kinds of
dialog: people, that's all.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: It's very simple. You go your way,
dialog: I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: But... Betsy...
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: I'm getting a taxi.
text: She walks to the curb.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (following her)
dialog: What about the record?
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Keep it.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Can I call you?
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
text: Betsy looks for a cab.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (tender)
dialog: Please, Betsy, I bought it for you.
text: Betsy looks at his sad, sweet face and relents a bit.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: All right, I'll accept the record.
text: Betsy accepts the record, but quickly turns and hails a taxi.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: Taxi!
text: A taxi quickly pulls up.
text: Travis feebly protests to no one in particular:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: But I got a taxi.
text: Betsy gives instructions to CAB DRIVER, looks briefly back
text: at Travis, then straight ahead. Taxi speeds off.
text: Travis looks around helplessly: A cluster of PEDESTRIANS on
text: the crowded street has stopped to watch the argument. Travis
text: looks back at the woman in the porno theatre box office who
text: has also been following the argument.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INSIDE TRAVIS' APARTMENT
text: Travis is sitting at the table. There are some new items on
text: the table: His giant econo-sized bottle of vitamins, a giant
text: econo-sized bottle of aspirins, a pint of apricot brandy, a
text: partial loaf of cheap white bread.
text: On the wall behind the table hang two more items: A gag sign
dialog: reading "One of These Days I'm Gonna Get Organezizied" and
text: an orange-and-black bumper sticker for Charles Palantine.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: May 8, 1972. My life has taken
text: another turn again. The days move
dialog: along with regularity...
text: C.U. of notebook: Travis is no longer sitting at the desk.
text: The pencil rests on the open notebook.
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
text: LATER THAT DAY: TRAVIS has pulled his straight-backed chair
text: around and is watching his small portable TV, which rests on
text: the upright melon crate.
text: A cereal bowl partially filled with milk rests in his lap.
text: Travis pours a couple shots of the apricot brandy into the
text: bowl, dips folded chunks of white bread into the mixture,
text: and eats them.
text: Travis is watching early evening NEWS PROGRAM. TV background
text: SOUND. Charles Palantine is being interviewed somewhere on
dialog: the campaign trail.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
text: ... one day indistinguishable from
text: the next, a long continuous chain,
text: then suddenly - there is a change.
text: Betsy is walking down a midtown street when Travis suddenly
text: appears before her. He has been waiting.
text: Travis tries to make conversation but she doesn't listen.
text: She motions for him to go away and keeps on walking.
text: Travis, protesting, follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUILDING - DAY
text: Travis speaks intensely into a wall pay phone.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: I tried to call her several times.
text: We hear Travis' Voice on the phone.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (smoking a cigarette)
dialog: you feeling better? You said you
dialog: didn't feel so good...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: But after the first call, she would
text: no longer come to the phone.
text: Travis holds the receiver in his hand. The other party has
dialog: hung up.
text: TRACKING SHOT across interior lower wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT.
text: Against the stark wall there is a row of wilted and dying
text: floral arrangements. Each one of the four or five bouquets
text: is progressively more wilted than the one closer to the door.
dialog: They have been returned.
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: I also sent flowers with no luck. I
dialog: should not dwell on such things,
text: but set them behind me. The smell
dialog: of the flowers only made me sicker.
dialog: The headaches got worse I think
dialog: I've got stomach cancer. I should
dialog: not complain so. "You're only as
dialog: healthy as you feel."
text: A drama is acted out at PALANTINE HEADQUARTERS: Travis,
text: groggy and red-eyed from lack of sleep, walks into the
text: campaign headquarters about NOONTIME.
text: Betsy is standing near the rear of the office; she ducks
text: from sight when she sees Travis enter. Travis' path is cut
text: short by Tom's large-framed body. There is no live sound.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: I realize now how much she is like
text: the others, so cold and distant.
dialog: Many people are like that. They're
dialog: like a union.
text: Travis tries to push his way past Tom but Tom grabs him.
text: Travis says something sharply to Tom and the two scuffle.
text: Tom, by far the taller and stronger, quickly overcomes
text: Travis, wrenching his arm behind his back.
text: Travis kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door.
text: ON THE SIDEWALK
text: Travis' efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby
text: POLICEMAN. Travis quiets down and walks off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EXT.
text: Travis is again making his way through the garish urban
text: night. He stops for a PASSENGER on PARK AVE. A middle-aging
dialog: professorial executive.
text: C.U. TRAVIS: His face is expressionless. The MAN makes
text: himself comfortable in the back seat.
scene_heading: PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
dialog: Jackson Heights.
dialog: Travis has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights
text: and coming back with a fare.
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm off duty.
scene_heading: PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
dialog: You mean you don't want to go out
dialog: to Jackson Heights?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No, I'm off duty.
scene_heading: PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER
dialog: Then how come your "Off Duty" light
dialog: wasn't on.
text: TRAVIS switches on the "Off Duty" light.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: It was on.
dialog: (gesturing toward top
dialog: of taxi)
text: it just takes a while to warm up.
text: Like a TV.
text: TRAVIS doesn't budge. PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER curses to
text: himself and exits cab. Travis takes off.
text: POV as Travis' eyes dwell on the young HIP COUPLES coming
text: out of a East Side movie house.
text: LATER THAT NIGHT, TRAVIS pulls over for a young (mid-
text: twenties) MAN wearing a leather sports jacket.
text: TRAVIS eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER
text: 471 Central Park West.
text: EXT.
text: TRAVIS' taxi speeds off.
text: LATER, TRAVIS' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of
dialog: Central Park West.
text: Travis checks apartment numbers.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER
text: Just pull over to the curb a moment.
text: TRAVIS turns the wheel.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER
dialog: Yeah, that's fine. Just sit here.
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
text: TRAVIS waits impassively. The motor ticks away.
text: After a long pause, the PASSENGER speaks:
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER
dialog: Cabbie, ya see that light up there
text: on the seventh floor, three windows
dialog: from this side of the building?
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN on 417 Central Park West: TRACKING UP to
text: the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah.
text: A young WOMAN wearing a slip crosses in front of the light.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: Ya see that woman there?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (O.S.)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: That's my wife.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: But it ain't my apartment.
dialog: (a beat)
text: A nigger lives there.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: She left me two weeks ago. It took
dialog: me this long to find out where she
dialog: went.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I'm gonna kill her.
text: C.U. TRAVIS' face: it is devoid of expression.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER
dialog: What do you think of that, cabbie?
text: C.U. YOUNG PASSENGER's face: it is gaunt, drained of blood,
text: full of fear and anger.
text: Travis does not respond.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER
dialog: Huh?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What do you think of that, huh?
text: Travis shrugs, gesturing toward meter.
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER
dialog: I'm gonna kill her with a .44
dialog: Magnum pistol.
text: CAMERA returns to SEVENTH FLOOR WINDOW. Woman is standing in
dialog: the light.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: Did you ever see what a .44 can do
dialog: to a woman's face, cabbie?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Did you ever see what it can do to
dialog: a woman's pussy, cabbie?
text: Travis says nothing.
speaker_heading: YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.)
dialog: I'm going to put it right up to
text: her, cabbie. Right in her, cabbie.
dialog: You must think I'm real sick, huh?
dialog: A real pervert. Sitting here and
text: talking about a woman's pussy and a
dialog: .44, huh?
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN on Travis' face: He is watching the woman
text: in the seventh floor window with complete and total
text: absorption. It's the same glazed-over stare we saw in his
text: eyes as he watched the porno movie.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
scene_heading: BROOKLYN STREET CORNER - DAY
text: Travis stands near the corner wearing his boots, jeans,
text: western shirt and army jacket.
text: He pulls his aspiring bottle out of his pocket, shakes three
text: or four into his palm, pops them into his mouth and chews.
text: An "Off Duty" taxi pulls up to the curb. Travis gets in.
speaker_heading: INSIDE TAXI
text: Dough-Boy leans back from the wheel and greets Travis as he

speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Hey Travis. This here's Easy Andy.
dialog: He's a travelling salesman.

speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Hello Travis.
text: Travis nods as the taxi speeds off.
text: Dough-Boy slows down near an economy hotel. Not a flop
dialog: house, but not do fancy they care what the guests do in the
dialog: privacy of their rooms.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: This is fine, Dough-Boy
dialog: (to Travis)
dialog: Pay Dough-Boy here.
text: Travis pulls a twenty out of his pocket and gives it to
dialog: Dough-Boy.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: 20 bucks?
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: (takes bill)
dialog: Yeah. Hey thanks. That's real nice,
dialog: Travis.
text: Travis and Andy get out of the cab and walk toward the hotel.
text: Dough-Boy pulls away.
text: As they enter the hotel, they pass a JUNKIE, stoned out and
text: spread-eagled across the hood of a derelict old blue dodge.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL
text: Travis follows Andy up the worn carpeted stairs and down the
text: hallway. Andy unlocks the door to one of the rooms.
text: The HOTEL ROOM is barren and clean; there's no sign anyone
text: is staying in it. The fire escape is appropriately near.
text: Andy locks the door behind them, steps over to the closet,
text: unlocks it and pulls out two grey Samsonite suitcases - the
dialog: kind you can drive a truck over.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Dough-Boy probably told you I don't
dialog: carry any Saturday Night Specials
dialog: or crap like that. It's all out of
dialog: State, clean, brand new, top-of-
dialog: the-line stuff.
text: Andy places the suitcases on the white bedspread. The
text: suitcases are equipped with special locks, which he quickly
text: opens.
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
text: Andy opens the suitcases: Stacked in grey packing foam are
text: rows and rows of brand new hand guns.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You got a .44 Magnum?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That's an expensive gun.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I got money.
text: Andy unzips a cowhide leather pouch to reveal a .44 Magnum
text: pistol. He holds it gingerly, as if it were a precious
text: treasure. Andy opens the chambers and cradles the long
text: eight-inch barrel in his palm. The .44 is a huge, oversize
text: inhuman gun.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (admiringly)
dialog: It's a monster. Can stop a car --
text: put a bullet right into the block.
dialog: A premium high resale gun. $350 --
dialog: that's only a hundred over list.
text: Easy Andy is a later version of the fast-talking, good-
dialog: looking kid in college who was always making money on one
dialog: scheme or another. In high school he sold lottery tickets,
text: in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand guns.
text: Andy holds the Magnum out for Travis' inspection. There's a
text: worshipful CLOSEUP of the .44 Magnum. It is a monster.
text: Travis hefts the huge gun. It seems out of place in his hand.
text: It is built on Michelangelo's scale. The Magnum belongs in
text: the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver. Travis
text: hands the gun back to Andy.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I could sell this gun in Harlem for
dialog: $500 today - but I just deal high
dialog: quality goods to high quality
dialog: people.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now this may be a little big for
dialog: practical use, in which case I'd
dialog: recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson
dialog: Special. Fine solid gun - nickel
text: plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the
dialog: same as the service revolver. Now
dialog: that'll stop anything that moves
dialog: and it's handy, flexible.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: The Magnum, you know, that's only
dialog: if you want to splatter it against
text: the wall. The movies have driven up
dialog: the price of the Magnum anyway.
dialog: Everybody wants them now. But the
dialog: Wesson .38 - only $250 - and worth
dialog: every dime of it.
dialog: (he hefts the .38)
text: Throw in a holster for $10.
text: Travis hefts the nickel-plated .38, points it out the window.
speaker_heading: ANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Some of these guns are like toys,
dialog: but a Smith and Wesson, man, you
dialog: can hit somebody over the head with
dialog: it and it will still come back dead
dialog: on. Nothing beats quality.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You interested in an automatic?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I want a .32. Revolver. And a
text: palm gun. That .22 there.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: That's the Colt .25 - a fine little
dialog: gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but
text: it's as fast as the Devil. Handy
dialog: little gun, you can carry it almost
dialog: anywhere. I'll throw it in for
dialog: another $125.
text: Travis holds the .32 Revolver, hefts it, slips it under his
text: belt and pulls his shirt over it. He turns from side to
text: side, to see how it rides in his waist.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: How much for everything.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: The .32's $150 - and you're really
dialog: getting a good deal now - and all
dialog: together it comes to, ah, seven
dialog: eighty-five for four pieces and a
dialog: holster. He'll, I'll give you the
dialog: holster, we'll make it seventy-five
dialog: and you've got a deal - a good one.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: How much to get a permit to carry?
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Well, you're talking big money now.
dialog: I'd say at least five grand, maybe
dialog: more, and it would take a while to
dialog: check it out. The way things are
text: going now $5.000 is probably low.
dialog: You see, I try not to fool with the
dialog: small-time crap. Too risky, too
dialog: little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I
dialog: get the permit it'll be as solid as
text: the Empire State Building.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Nah, this'll be fine.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You can't carry in a cab even with
dialog: a permit - so why bother?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Is there a firing range around?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sure, here, take this card, go to
dialog: this place and give 'em the card.
dialog: They'll charge you, but there won't
dialog: be any hassle.
text: Travis pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills
text: and counts off eight.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You in Nam? Can't help but notice
dialog: your jacket?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket.
dialog: Where were you? Bet you got to
dialog: handle a lot of weapons out there.
text: Travis hands Andy the bills. Andy counts them and gives
dialog: Travis a twenty and five.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah. I was all around. One
dialog: hospital, then the next.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: (through counting)
dialog: It's he'll out there all right. A
dialog: real shit-eatin' war. I'll say
dialog: this, though: It's bringing a lot
dialog: of fantastic guns. The market's
text: flooded. Colt automatics are all
dialog: over.
dialog: (pockets the money)
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (intensely)
dialog: They'd never get me to go back.
dialog: They'd have to shoot me first.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You got anything to carry these in?
dialog: (gestures to pistols)
text: Travis is like a light switch: For long periods he goes
text: along dark and silent, saying nothing; then suddenly, the
text: current is turned on and the air is filled with the
text: electricity of his personality. Travis' inner intensity sets
text: Andy back a bit, but he quickly recovers.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Sure.
text: Andy pulls a gym bag from under his bed. He wraps the gun in
text: the sheet in the bag and zips it up. An identical gym bag
text: can be partially seen under the bed. He hands Travis the bag.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: You like ball games?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: I can get you front and center.
dialog: What do you like? I can get you
dialog: Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can
dialog: get you the Mayor's box.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Nah. I ain't interested.
text: Andy closes and locks the suitcases.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Okay, okay.
text: Travis turns to leave.
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Wait a second, Travis. I'll walk
dialog: you out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER. The face of TRAVIS' apartment has
text: changed. The long, blank wall behind the table is now
text: covered with tacked-up charts, pictures, newspaper-clippings,
text: maps. CAMERA does not come close enough to discern the exact
text: contents of these clippings.
text: Travis is in C.U. in the middle of the floor doing push-ups.
text: He is bareback, wearing only his jeans. There is a long scar
text: across his left side.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: May 29, 1972. I must get in shape.
dialog: Too much sitting has ruined my body.
dialog: Twenty-five push-ups each morning,
dialog: one hundred sit-ups, one hundred
dialog: knee-bends. I have quit smoking.
text: Travis, still bareback, passes his stiff arm through the
text: flame of a gas burner without flinching a muscle.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: Total organization is necessary.
dialog: Every muscle must be tight.
scene_heading: INT. FIRING RANGE
text: The CRACKING SOUND of rapid-fire pistol shots fills the
text: musty air of the firing range. The walls are heavily
text: soundproofed, and sawdust is spread over the floor.
text: Travis stands rock solid, firing the .44 Magnum at an arm's
text: length. With each blasting discharge from the Magnum,
text: Travis' body shudders and shakes, his arm as if each recoil
text: from the giant gun was a direct attack on his masculinity.
text: Travis fires the Magnum as quickly as he can re-set, re-aim
text: and re-fire. The Magnum is empty, he sets it down, picks up
text: the .38 Special and begins firing as soon as he can aim.
text: After the .38, comes the .25: It is as if he were in a
text: contest to see how quickly he can fire the pistols. After
text: all the guns are discharged, he begins reloading them
text: without a moment's hesitation.
text: Downrange, the red and white targets have the black outline
text: of a human figure drawn over them. The contour-man convulses
text: under the steady barrage of Travis' rapid-fire shots.
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT
text: TRAVIS, now wearing an unfastened green plaid western shirt,
text: sits at the table writing in his diary. The vial of bennies
text: is on the table.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: My body fights me always. It won't
dialog: work, it won't sleep, it won't
dialog: shit, it won't eat.
text: LATER. TRAVIS, his shirt still revealing his bare chest,
text: sits on his straight-backed chair watching the TV. The .44
text: Magnum rests on his lap.
text: The TV is Broadcasting ROCK TIME, a late afternoon local
text: teenage dance and rock show. On screen YOUNG TEENYBOPPERS
text: are dancing, and the TV CAMERAMAN, as any devotee of the
text: genre knows, is relentlessly ZOOMING-IN on their firm young
text: breasts, fannies and crotches -- a sensibility which reflects
text: TRAVIS' own. These supper-hour rock dance shows are the most
text: unabashedly voyeuristic form of broadcasting the medium has
dialog: yet developed.
text: The HARD ROCK NUMBER ends, and the TV CAMERA CUTS TO the
text: local DISC JOCKEY, a hirsute plastic-looking man about 35.
text: FIVE scrumptious TEENYBOPPERS are literally hanging on his
text: shoulders and arms, their faces turned up to him in droolish
text: awe. Out of his mouth comes an incessant stream of disc
dialog: jockey blather. He is the complete asshole; I don't know who
dialog: is currently performing this function in New York, but in
dialog: Los Angeles his name is Real Don Steele.
speaker_heading: TV DISC JOCKEY
text: Freshingly, fantastic, freaked-out
dialog: dance time. Can you dig it? Dig on
dialog: it. You got it, flaunt it.
text: TRAVIS watches the show, his face hard and unmoving. He is,
dialog: as the Scriptures would say, pondering all these things in
dialog: his heart. Why is it the assholes get all the beautiful
text: young chicks? He takes a swig of peach brandy.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EARLY EVENING, about 6:30 p.m. TRAVIS' taxi, with 'Off
text: Duty' light on, sits near the curb somewhere in midtown
dialog: Manhattan.
text: TRAVIS runs his hand down the left side of his jacket,
text: attempting to smooth out the bulge underneath.
text: TRAVIS opens his jacket partially, checking underneath.
text: There rests the nickel-plated .38 Special in its holster.
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
text: P.O.V. down the street where TRAVIS' taxi is parked: Several
text: blocks ahead the red, white and blue campaign headquarters
text: of CHARLES PALANTINE are visible.
text: TRAVIS' eyes resume their watch.
text: TRAVIS starts the car and drives toward the PALANTINE
scene_heading: HEADQUARTERS.
text: TRACKING P.O.V. shot of row of storefronts leading up to
text: Palantine Headquarters. P.O.V. passes headquarters: it is
text: half-empty. A few stalwart SUPPORTERS continue to work
text: toward the rear of the office. BETSY'S desk ----
text: Sign in window reads: "Only 4 More Days Until Arrival of
scene_heading: CHARLES PALANTINE."
text: TRAVIS' "Off Duty" light goes off as he speeds up and heads
text: toward a prospective fare.
scene_heading: LATER THAT NIGHT, about 9:30. UPTOWN -- 128th and Amsterdam.
text: The Jungle. TRAVIS' taxi pulls up to an address, lets off
text: YOUNG BLACK MAN.
text: TRAVIS receives fare and tip, takes off.
text: P.O.V. as TRAVIS works his way through Harlem back down
text: Seventh Ave. Cluster of YOUNG BLACK STREET PUNKS pretend to
text: hail cab -- we ignore them. One throws wine bottle which
text: crashes in our path -- taxi swerves to avoid it.
text: CAMERA TRACKS through sidewalk CROWDS with the roving,
text: suspicious, antagonistic eye of a taxi-driver.
text: LATER THAT NIGHT, about 12:30. TRAVIS is on the LOWER EAST
text: SIDE, somewhere on B Street, east of Tompkins Square.
text: The sidewalks are populated with the remains of what once
text: was the hippie movement: TEENAGE STREET-WALKERS, JUNKIES,
text: THUGS, emaciated LONERS on the prowl.
text: TRAVIS' taxi pulls over, letting out a fare.
text: TRAVIS pockets his fare, but the rear right door doesn't
text: slam -- instead there is the SOUND of another person jumping
text: into the cab.
text: TRAVIS checks the back seat in the rear-view mirror: there
text: sits a pale HIPPIE PROSTITUTE.
text: The GIRL is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made
text: up to look older. She wears floppy, Janis Joplin clothes.
text: Her face is pallid. She wears large blue-tinted sunglasses
text: and multi-colored leg stockings.
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
dialog: Her name, as we shall learn later, is IRIS.
text: TRAVIS hesitates, looking at her in the mirror.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Come on, mister, let's get outta
dialog: here -- quick.
text: TRAVIS moves to activate the meter, when the rear door opens.
text: IRIS is helped out of the cab by a MAN TRAVIS cannot see.
speaker_heading: SPORT
speaker_heading: (to IRIS)
dialog: Come on, baby, let's go. This is
dialog: all a real drag.
text: IRIS lets herself be taken out of the cab. The rear door
text: closes.
text: Sport leans partially in the front window, throwing something
text: on the front seat. TRAVIS looks: it is a crumpled $20 bill.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Just forget all about this, cabbie.
dialog: It's nothing.
text: TRAVIS cannot see the Sport's face lime green completely,
text: but notices he is wearing a jacket. The voice is that of a
text: man in his early twenties.
text: TRAVIS turns to catch a glimpse of Sport as he walks off
dialog: with Iris.
text: TRAVIS shrugs and turns around.
text: TRAVIS' taxi pulls away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: EARLY MORNING, 6:00 a.m. Quitting time -- TRAVIS pulls into
speaker_heading: TAXI GARAGE.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE
text: TRAVIS pulls into his stall.
text: TRAVIS sits in driver's seat, thinking a moment. He looks
text: to his right: the crumpled $20 bill still lies there,
text: untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously.
text: TRAVIS reluctantly picks up the $20 bill and stuffs it into
text: his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab. He gathers up
text: his time report and heads toward book-in table.
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
text: A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS is walking down the sidewalk
text: near the taxi garage. His hands are in his jacket pockets,
text: obscuring the slight bulge on his left side.
text: TRAVIS turns into the box offfice of PORNO THEATER. He
text: reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and
text: pulls out crumpled $20 bill. Seeing the $20 bill, he
text: decides not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet
dialog: instead.
text: TRAVIS walks past concession stand en route to the darkened
text: theater auditorium. A YOUNG MAN is now sitting listlessly
text: behind the concessions counter.
scene_heading: INT. PORNO THEATER AUDITORIUM
text: TRAVIS slouches down into his seat, his face glowing in the
text: reflected light from the screen.
speaker_heading: FEMALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Oh, come on, now, down, lick it,
dialog: come on...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Mmm, that's good. Ahh, ahh, more ...
text: TRAVIS averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too
text: graphic. Placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes,
text: TRAVIS can, by turning it inward, shut off or open up his
text: field of vision by small degrees.
text: MOVIE VOICE DIMINISHES, replaced by SOUND of TRAVIS' voice
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: The idea had been growing in my
dialog: brain ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRACKING SHOT to wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT. CAMERA MOVES
text: slowly across wall covered with clippings, notes, maps,
text: pictures. We now see their contents clearly:
text: The wall is covered with CHARLES PALANTINE political
text: paraphernalia; there are pictures of him, newspaper articles,
text: leaflets, bumper stickers. As the CAMERA MOVES along it
text: discovers a sketch of Plaza Hotel, Kennedy Airport and cut-
text: up sections of city maps with notations written in. There
text: is lengthy N.Y. Times clipping detailing the increased
text: Secret Security Protection during the primaries. A section
text: pertaining to PALANTINE is underlined. Further along there
text: is a sheet reading "traveling schedule" and a calendar for
text: June with finely written notations written over the dates.
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
dialog: ... for some time. True Force.
dialog: All the king's men cannot put it
text: back together again.
text: As the CAMERA reaches the end of its track, it finds TRAVIS,
text: standing, his shirt open, but the mattress. He is wearing
text: the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand.
text: In the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a lesson
dialog: in gunmanship:
text: TRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his
text: holster and firing it.
text: He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices
text: withdrawing it. He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length,
text: tightening his forearm muscles.
text: He has worked out a system of metal gliders taped to his
text: inner forearm, whereby the Colt .25 can rest hidden behind
text: the upper forearm until a spring near the elbow is activated,
text: sending the .25 flying down the gliders into his palm. He
text: has cut open his shirt to accomodate the gun mechanism and
text: now checks in the mirror to see how well the gun is hidden.
text: He straps an Army combat knife to his calf and cuts a slit
text: in his jeans where the knife can be pulled out quickly.
text: He now tries on various combinations of shirts, sweater and
text: jacket in front of the mirror to see how well he can hide
text: all the handguns he wishes to carry. Finally, wearing two
text: western shirts, a sweater and jacket, he manages to obscure
text: the location of all three guns, although he resembles a
text: hunter bundled up against the Arctic winter.
text: He sits at the table dum-dumming the .44 bullets -- cutting
text: "x's" across the bullet heads.
text: P.O.V.: he scans the objects of his room through the scope
dialog: of the .38.
text: TRAVIS stands in the middle of his apartment, staring at his
text: PALANTINE wall. His eyes are glazed with introspection; he
text: sees nothing but himself.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
dialog: Listen you screwheads: Here is a
dialog: man ...
text: TRAVIS lies on his mattress, all bundled up in his shirts,
text: sweater, jacket and guns. His face is turned toward the
text: ceiling, but his eyes are closed. Although the room is
text: flooded with light, he is finally catching some sleep.
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
text: The big furry animal drifts into his own world.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD)
dialog: ... who wouldn't take it any more,
text: a man who stood up against the
dialog: scum, the cunts, the dogs, the
dialog: filth. Here is ...
dialog: (voice trails off)
text: C.U. of diary: entry ends with words "Here is" followed by
text: erratic series of dots.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: NIGHT: the taxis are roaming the slick streets.
text: Sometimes after 2:00 a.m., TRAVIS pulls his cab to the curb
text: near an all-night delicatessen in Spanish Harlem. The
text: streets are relatively deserted.
text: TRAVIS waves to STOREKEEPER as he walks past counter:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Hey 'Melio.
text: Spanish rhythm and blues blares from a cheap radio.
text: TRAVIS walks over to dairy counter in rear of store, picks
text: out a pint of chocolate milk, goes over to the open cooler
text: and picks through various chilled prepackaged sandwiches.
text: He overhears a VOICE as he looks at the sandwiches.
text: When TRAVIS returns to the counter with the chocolate milk
text: and a sandwich in one hand, he sees a YOUNG BLACK MAN
text: holding a gun on 'Melio. The STICK-UP MAN is nervous,
text: hopped-up, or both; he bounces on the balls of his cheap
text: worn black tennis shoes -- a strung-out junkie on a
text: desperation ride. The STICK-UP MAN, a thorough
text: unprofessional, doesn't notice TRAVIS.
text: 'MELIO watches the STICK-UP MAN closely, deciding what to do
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: STICK-UP MAN
dialog: (shaking gun)
dialog: Come on, man. Quick, quick, quick.
dialog: Hand over that bread.
text: It doesn't take TRAVIS long to decide what to do: without
text: hesitation he pulls his .32 from his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Hey dude!
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
text: The STICK-UP MAN, surprised, turns toward TRAVIS, finding
text: only an exploding .32. The MAN's lower jaw bursts open with
text: blood as he reels and crashes to the floor. There is no
text: emotion on TRAVIS' face.
text: As the STICK-UP MAN falls, 'MELIO leans over the counter,
text: wielding his battered .38. He is about to fire when he
text: realizes the MAN is already dead.
text: 'MELIO, charged up, turns his gun toward TRAVIS, then,
text: realizing the danger is over, lowers it again.
speaker_heading: 'MELIO
dialog: Thanks, man. Figured I'd get him
text: on the way out.
text: TRAVIS sets his .32 on the counter.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You're gonna have to cover me on
dialog: this one, 'Melio. I can't stay for
dialog: the cop show.
speaker_heading: 'MELIO
dialog: You can't do that, Travis. You're
dialog: my witness.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: The hell I can't. It's no sweat
dialog: for you. What is this for you,
dialog: number five?
text: 'MELIO smiles and holds up four fingers:
speaker_heading: 'MELIO
dialog: No, only four.
dialog: (shrug)
dialog: Alright, Travis, I'll do what I can.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Thanks a lot.
text: TRAVIS exits. 'MELIO picks up the phone and starts dialing.
text: The bloody BODY lies on the floor unmoving.
text: TRAVIS, still carrying his pint of chocolate milk and
text: sandwich, walks down the empty sidewalk and enters his cab.
text: The street is deserted.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: DIRECT CUT TO PORNOGRAPHIC MOVIE: this is the first time we
dialog: have actually seen the porno movie itself.
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
text: SEVERAL ACTORS and ACTRESSES are dallying on screen in
dialog: whatever manner the ratings board deems permissible.
text: Whatever the action, the movie's decor is strictly Zody's --
text: ersatz landscape paintings, tufted bedspreads. As in most
text: porno films, the ACTORS look up occasionally toward the
text: CAMERA to receive instructions. Studio grunts, groans and
text: moans of pleasure have been dubbed in.
text: Action on screen begins to go into SLOW MOTION, the ACTORS
text: and ACTRESSES gradually transforming obscenity into poetry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRAVIS, sitting in his chair in his APARTMENT, watching
text: afternoon soap opera. He is cleaning his .38 and eating
text: from a jar of applesauce. Soap opera audio continues.
text: He watches the soap opera without expression.
text: SOUND TRACK of film also SLOWS DOWN, gradually mixing with
text: and then becoming the sound track of a midafternoon TV soap
dialog: opera.
text: A YOUNG GIRL and BOY are talking in those familiar soap
text: opera voices and a third party, the GIRL's mother, who had
dialog: tried to terminate their "relationship."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TELEVISION: The BOY is visiting the GIRL in her hospital
text: room. Both look as if they've stepped out of the Blue Chip
dialog: stamp catalogue.
speaker_heading: SOAP OPERA BOY
dialog: Is it that she just doesn't -- like
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: SOAP OPERA GIRL
dialog: (hesitantly)
dialog: Well, Jim, it's just that -- I
dialog: don't know how to say this -- it's
dialog: that she thinks your parents
dialog: aren't... good enough, I guess.
text: TRAVIS, through cleaning his gun, begins to play a game with
text: the television set.
text: He places the heel of his boot at the top of the melon crate
text: which supports the TV. Then, slowly rocking his heel back
text: and forth, he sees how far he can tip the melon crate
text: without knocking it over.
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
text: The TV, still broadcasting the hospital room melodrama,
text: rocks back and forth.
text: TRAVIS pushes the TV farther and farther until finally the
text: inevitable happens -- the crate tips backward, sending the
text: portable TV crashing to the floor.
text: There is a short flash and the TV screen turns white.
text: TRAVIS, realizing what he has done, bends over, turns the TV
text: upright on the floor, fiddles with the knobs, slaps it, and
text: tries to reactivate the vanished image. TRAVIS' efforts are
text: futile; a tube has broken, and the TV will not come back to
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Damn, damn.
text: TRAVIS bends over in the chair and places his head in his
text: hands, despairing of himself.
speaker_heading: FADE TO:
text: About 1 a.m. TRAVIS pulls his cab behind a line of empty
text: taxis parked outside the Bellmore Cafeteria, a cabbie
text: hangout on Park Avenue South.
text: He locks his cab and walks past the line of taxis. He
text: sidesteps TWO DRUNKEN FIGHTING BUMS and enters the Bellmore.
text: A LOUD BUZZER RINGS as TRAVIS steps INTO THE BELLMORE. He
text: pulls a ticket from the dispenser (silencing the buzzer) and
text: walks toward the wall-length counter.
text: An assortment of CABBIES are seated around a formica-topped
text: table near the rear of the cafeteria. Some are barely
text: awake, some are eating, the rest are swapping stories and
dialog: smalltalk.
text: Wizard, Dough-Boy, Charlie T and a FOURTH CABBIE are seated
text: at a long table.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: You know Eddie, he's the new hippie
dialog: kid in our group, long hair...
text: Wizard demonstrates length of hair and others nod.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: ...he called up the Dispatcher last
dialog: night. Charlie McCall, our
dialog: dispatcher...
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: One-Ball McCall?
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: That's the guy. Eddie calls him up
dialog: and says, "Hey, what do you want me
dialog: to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep.
dialog: I got a girl in the back and she
dialog: doesn't have the fare. She wants
dialog: me to come in back and collect.
dialog: What should I do?
text: The cabbies laugh. Across the cafeteria Travis selects a
text: cup of coffee and some pastries.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
text: This is on the two-way with about a
text: hundred and fifty cars listenin in.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: McCall says. "How much on the
text: meter?" Eddie comes back and says
text: "Two-fifty." McCall says, "Is she
dialog: worth it".
text: More laughter.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Fuckin One-Ball.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: And the kid says, "Yeah. She's
dialog: about 19, good-lookin." McCall
dialog: says, "What can I tell you?"
speaker_heading: FOURTH CABBIE
dialog: She should have told him to get an
text: OK from the front office.
dialog: (laughter)
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: McCall says, "Well, if you want
dialog: some help I'll see if I can send
dialog: some units out."
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
dialog: Yeah. About a hundred and fifty.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: I hope he had a checker.
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: She was just a kid. Stoned, you
dialog: know.
text: Travis, carrying his coffee and pastries, walks over to
text: their table. Charlie T spots him.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
dialog: Hiya Killer.
text: Charlie forms his hand into a pistol, cocks and fires,
text: making the SOUND, "Pgghew." TRAVIS nods.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: You're getting a rep, Travis.
text: TRAVIS sits down and the other CABBIES resume their
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
dialog: Got the five you owe me, Killer?
text: TRAVIS reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll of small
text: denomination bills. The crumpled $20 bill falls onto the
text: table. TRAVIS stares at it a moment. He unfolds a five,
text: gives it to CHARLIE T, then picks up the crumpled $20 and
text: puts it back into his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: WIZARD (O.S.)
dialog: (to Travis)
dialog: What's the action around?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Slow.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
dialog: Shit yes. Night woulda been dead
dialog: if I hadn't grabbed an outatowner
text: at Kennedy. Took him roun the horn
dialog: and got a five dollar tip to boot.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (joking)
dialog: One of these days we're gonna turn
dialog: you in, Charlie T. Fleecin the
dialog: hicks like that.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Remember the time this cat picks up
text: four dudes from the other side,
dialog: Pakastanis I think they were, holds
dialog: up their passports, to the toll
text: booth collector on the bridge and
dialog: charges em ten bucks each for
dialog: 'crossing the border?
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
text: They all laugh.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
dialog: Hell, I know'd you to do worse.
speaker_heading: DOUGH-BOY
dialog: Least I'm no airport rat. I work
dialog: the whole town.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
dialog: (chuckling)
dialog: It's a living.
text: WIZARD gets up to leave.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Well, I'm shovin' on.
text: WIZARD gets up, nods and walks toward the CASHIER. After a
text: second's thought, TRAVIS calls to him:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Hey Wiz, just a second. I wanna
dialog: talk to you.
text: WIZARD waits for TRAVIS as he takes a final gulp of coffee
text: and catches up with him. CHARLIE T calls to TRAVIS as they
dialog: go:
speaker_heading: CHARLIE T
dialog: See ya, Killer. Don't forget your
dialog: pea shooter.
text: CHARLIE T cocks his imaginary gun again, fires and chuckles.
text: WIZARD and TRAVIS nod goodbye, pay the CASHIER and exit.
text: EXT.
text: TRAVIS follows WIZARD out onto the sidewalk. TRAVIS follows
text: WIZARD as he walks toward his cab. He has something on his
text: mind, something he wants to talk to WIZARD about.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (walking)
dialog: Hey Wiz.
text: WIZARD leans back against the cab. TRAVIS is about to speak
text: when he spots a GROUP of BLACK and PUERTO RICAN STREET
text: PUNKS, ages 12-15, jiving down the sidewalk toward him. ONE
text: tosses a spray paint can around his back, basketball style.
text: ANOTHER mocks as if he's going to scratch a key along one of
text: the cabs.
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: WIZARD has no visible reaction. A flash of controlled anger
text: crosses TRAVIS' face. He stares at the BOY with the poised
text: key. It is the same look that crossed his face in the
text: Harlem Deli. We are reminded with a jolt that the killer
text: lies just beneath TRAVIS' surface.
text: The BLACK PUNK must instinctively realize this too, because
text: he makes a cocky show of putting the key back into his
text: pocket and be-bopping around TRAVIS and WIZARD.
text: The YOUNG MEAN-STREETERS continue down the street and TRAVIS
text: turns back to WIZARD.
text: Across the street, in the background, a JUNKIE nestles in a
dialog: doorway.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: Wiz?
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Look, ah, we never talked much, you
dialog: and me...
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I wanted to ask you something, on
dialog: account you've been around so long.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Shoot. They don't call me the
dialog: Wizard for nothing.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, I just, you know...
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Things got ya down?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Real down.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: It happens.
dialog: 
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Sometimes it gets so I just don't
dialog: know what I'm gonna do. I get some
dialog: real crazy ideas, you know? Just
dialog: go out and do somethin.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: The taxi life, you mean.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Like do anything, you know.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Travis, look, I dig it. Let me
dialog: explain. You choose a certain way
dialog: of life. You live it. It becomes
dialog: what you are. I've been a hack 27
dialog: years, the last ten at night.
dialog: Still don't own my own cab. I
dialog: guess that's the way I want it.
dialog: You see, that must be what I am.
text: A police car stops across the street. TWO PATROLMEN get out
text: and roust the JUNKIE from his doorway.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Look, a person does a certain thing
dialog: and that's all there is to it. It
dialog: becomes what he is. Why fight it?
dialog: What do you know? How long you
dialog: been a hack, a couple months?
dialog: You're like a peg and you get
dialog: dropped into a slot and you got to
text: squirm and wiggle around a while
dialog: until you fit in.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (pause)
dialog: That's just about the dumbest thing
dialog: I ever heard, Wizard.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: What do you expect, Bertrand
dialog: Russell? I've been a cabbie all my
dialog: life, what do I know?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I don't even know what you're
dialog: talking about.
dialog: 
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Neither do I, I guess.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: You fit in. It's lonely, it's
dialog: rough at first. But you fit in.
dialog: You got no choice.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
speaker_heading: WIZARD
dialog: Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all
dialog: right.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I seen enough to know.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Thanks.
text: WIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying, "Chin up, old
text: boy," and walks around to the driver's side of his cab.
text: WIZARD drives off, leaving the street to its natural
dialog: inhabitants.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE RALLY - DAY
text: A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in
text: QUEENS is draped in red, white and blue bunting.
text: A CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the
text: rally to begin. Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the
text: loudspeaker system.
text: The CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive
text: metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques,
text: stands out in the CROWD.
text: On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS
text: as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS.
text: TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY
text: stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER.
text: TOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to
text: what he was reading. Then he returns his gaze to the upper
text: left, watching something very closely.
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
text: After a moment he walks over to the steps where BETSY is
dialog: standing.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Betsy, come over here a moment.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: What is it? I'm busy.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (insistent)
dialog: Just follow me.
text: BETSY excuses herself and walks across the platform with TOM.
text: As they stand to the rear of the platform, TOM secretively
text: makes a gesture with his eyes and says out of the side of
dialog: his mouth:
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Look there.
dialog: (her eyes follow his)
dialog: No, over further - get your
dialog: glasses - yes, over there. Isn't
dialog: that little guy the same guy that
dialog: was bugging you around the office
dialog: about a month ago?
text: BETSY, putting on her glasses, looks closely. She tries not
text: to make her stare too obvious.
speaker_heading: BETSY
dialog: No, I don't think so.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: That's someone else.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Now look more closely. Look around
dialog: the eyes and chin. See? See there?
text: CAMERA CLOSES IN on TRAVIS BICKLE standing in the CROWD: he
text: has shaved his head to a short stubble. There he is: brush-
text: cut, wearing a giant grin, and a large "Palantine '72" button.
text: Although it is a pleasant sunny day, TRAVIS wears a bulky
text: bulged-out Army jacket.
text: TRAVIS looks warily from side to side and vanishes in the
speaker_heading: CROWD.
text: A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS walks up to a SECRET SERVICE MAN
text: standing near the fringes of the CROWD. The SECRET SERVICE
text: MAN -- in sun glasses, grey suit, ever-roving eyes -- is
text: immediately identifiable.
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
text: Whenever TRAVIS confronts a symbol of authority, he becomes
text: like a young boy. This time is no exception, although one
text: suspects there is a plan hatching beneath that boyish
text: exterior. The SECRET SERVICE MAN, for his part, is about as
text: talkative as the Sphinx.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Are you a Secret Service Man?
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: (indifferently)
dialog: Why do you ask?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I've seen a lot of suspicious-
dialog: looking people around here today.
text: SECRET SERVICE MAN glances at TRAVIS momentarily.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Oh, lots. I don't know where they
dialog: all are now. There used to be one
text: standing over there.
dialog: (points)
text: SECRET SERVICE MAN's gaze follows TRAVIS' finger for a
text: second, then return to TRAVIS.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (CONTD)
dialog: Is it hard to get to be a Secret
dialog: Service Man?
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I kinda thought I might make a good
dialog: one. I'm very observant.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I was in the Army too.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I'm good with crowds.
text: The SECRET SERVICE MAN is starting to get interested in
text: TRAVIS: he definitely ranks as a suspicious character.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What kind of guns do you guys use?
dialog: .38's?
text: The SECRET SERVICE MAN decides it's time to get some more
speaker_heading: information on TRAVIS:
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: Look, um, if you give me your name
dialog: and address, we'll send you the
dialog: information on how to apply.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You would, huh?
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: (taking out notepad)
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's
scene_heading: with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live
dialog: at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn,
text: New Jersey. Zip code 07410.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Got that?
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll
dialog: send you all the stuff all right.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
text: The SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to a SECRET SERVICE
text: PHOTOGRAPHER to catch a picture of TRAVIS. TRAVIS notices
text: this, and quickly slips away into the CROWD.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRAVIS sits at his desk in his APARTMENT, writing. He wears
text: jeans, western shirt and empty holster.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
text: June 11. Eight rallies in six more
text: days. The time is coming.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: NIGHT. TRAVIS' taxi picks up a FARE in the midtown area and
text: heads downtown.
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
text: LOWER EAST SIDE. TRAVIS lets off FARE on B Street and cuts
text: across toward Tompkins Square.
text: TRAVIS turns the corner when SKREETCH! he suddenly hits the
text: brakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth.
text: He has almost hit a YOUNG GIRL recklessly crossing the
text: street. She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her
text: balance and stares in shock through the front window. C.U.
text: GIRL's face.
text: TRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi
text: a week or so before. IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then
text: turns and continues walking.
text: TRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND. They
text: are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots,
text: jeans, floppy hats. And the old come-hither walk is
text: unmistakable.
text: TRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk
text: down the sidewalk.
text: TRAVIS' P.O.V. He examines them from bottom to top --
text: boots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats.
text: As TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar
text: FRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows. The GIRLS
text: look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some
text: unheard comment, and continue on.
text: IRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on.
text: On the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat
text: out of place in this environment, but making every attempt
text: to groove on it. They are high on something or another.
text: The GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them.
text: They exchange some small talk and walk off together. There
text: is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up.
text: TRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to
text: continue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS.
text: This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy.
text: As TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER
text: HIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and
text: her GIRLFRIEND. She walks over to the taxi, loans in the
text: open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised
dialog: as an innocent question:
scene_heading: C.U. HIPPIE HOOKER.
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE HOOKER
dialog: Hey cabbie! You comin' or goin'?
text: TRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination
text: of shock, embarrassment and revulsion. He is the child
text: caught with his hand in the cookie jar. The very presence
text: of this crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and
text: sickens him.
text: TRAVIS takes off with a skreetch. His taxi shoots down the
dialog: block.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A HOT JUNE DAY. TRAVIS' taxi, the "Off Duty" sign on, is
text: parked against the curb somewhere in HARLEM. WHITE COPS,
text: SECRET SERVICE MEN and REPORTERS, punctuate the otherwise
text: BLACK CROWDS which walk to and fro in the b.g.
text: CHARLES PALANTINE's voice can be heard coming from a distant
text: loudspeaker system. It is a political rally.
text: TRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in
text: the distance. His hair, of course, is still clipped short
text: and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses. Even though a
text: drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS
text: wears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the
text: .38 Smith and Wesson bulge.
text: A BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his
text: uptown campaign headquarters. On the platform sit an array
text: of BLACK DIGNITARIES. Nearby we recognize the SECRET
text: SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans
text: the CROWD anxiously.
text: PALANTINE is speaking animatedly. He is an excellent
text: speaker and captures our attention. He drives hard toward
text: his arguments, crashes down on his points. His strained
text: voice rings with sincerity and anger.
text: C.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks. He is dressed in rolled-up
text: shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
text: The time has come to put an end to
dialog: the things that divide us: racism,
dialog: poverty, way -- and to those
dialog: persons who seek to divide us.
dialog: Never have I seen such a group of
dialog: high officials from the President
dialog: to Senate leaders to Cabinet
dialog: members...
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
text: CUT TO TRAVIS: no expression. PALANTINE's words are barely
text: distinguishable from a block away:
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: (in distance)
text: ... pit black against white, young
dialog: against old, sow anger, disunity
dialog: and suspicion -- and all in the
dialog: name of the "good of the country."
dialog: Well, their game is over.
dialog: (applause)
dialog: All their games are over. Now is
dialog: the time to stand up against such
dialog: foolishness, propaganda and
dialog: demagoguery. Now is the time for
text: one man to stand up and accept his
dialog: neighbor, for one man to give in
dialog: order that all might receive. Is
dialog: unity and love of common good such
dialog: a lost thing?
text: ALL LIVE SOUND CEASES as TRAVIS' narration begins. He is
text: reading from a letter or card he has just written.
text: As he speaks we see SHOTS of PALANTINE speaking, a seated
text: row of YOUNG BLACK PALANTINE red, white and blue bedecked
text: CHEERLEADERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS examining the CROWD and
dialog: so forth. These SHOTS have no direct relationship to the
dialog: narration.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Dear Father and Mother,
dialog: June is the month, I remember,
dialog: which brings not only your wedding
dialog: anniversary, but also Father's Day
dialog: and Mother's birthday. I'm sorry I
dialog: can't remember the exact dates, but
dialog: I hope this card will take care of
dialog: all of them.
dialog: I'm sorry I again can not send you
dialog: my address like I promised to last
dialog: year, but the sensitive nature of
dialog: my work for the Army demands utmost
dialog: secrecy. I know you will
dialog: understand.
dialog: I am healthy and well and making
dialog: lots of money. I have been going
dialog: with a girl for several months and
dialog: I know you would be proud if you
text: could see her.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.; CONT'D)
dialog: Her name is Betsy, but I can tell
dialog: you no more than that.
dialog: (interrupted)
text: As TRAVIS reads third paragraph, a POLICEMAN is seen walking
text: from behind TRAVIS' taxi to his window.
text: The POLICEMAN's voice come during a pause in the narration.
scene_heading: LIVE SOUND RESUMES.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: (standing near window)
dialog: Hey, cabbie, you can't park here.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (penitent)
dialog: Sorry, officer.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: You waiting for a fare?
text: POLICEMAN leans his head in window, inspecting the cab. As
text: he does, TRAVIS slides his right hand into the left side of
text: his jacket, ready to draw his revolver.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No, officer.
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: All right, move it.
text: TRAVIS starts up his taxi and drives off.
text: LIVE SOUND again CEASES as TRAVIS resumes reading letter as
text: taxi drives away.
text: As TRAVIS reads final paragraph, scene CUTS TO INT. APARTMENT
text: where TRAVIS sits at his table.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: (resuming reading)
dialog: I hope this card finds you all
dialog: well, as it does me. I hope no one
dialog: has died. Don't worry about me.
dialog: One day there will be a knock on
dialog: the door and it will be me.
dialog: Love, Travis.
text: TRAVIS, at his desk, examines the card upon which he has
dialog: just written this letter.
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
text: C.U. cover of card. It is a 25¢ Wedding Anniversary card
text: with a four-color embossed cover. The design could only be
text: described as ur-kitsch. A cartoon Mr. and Mrs. All-America
text: stand before an outdoor barbecuing grill, clicking salt and
text: pepper shakers in a toast. Sentiment reads:
scene_heading: HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
dialog: To a Couple
dialog: Who Have Found
dialog: the Perfect Combination
dialog: For Marriage...
text: The card opens to read:
speaker_heading: LOVE!
text: Underneath the word "Love!" begins TRAVIS' short message to
text: his parents, a message which extends to the back cover of
dialog: the card.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: NIGHT on the LOWER EAST SIDE. TRAVIS sits parked in the
text: dark shadows of a side street. The lone wolf waits.
text: TRAVIS watches the SLUM GODDESSES as they work the section
text: of the street reserved for hippie hookers.
text: TRAVIS' P.O.V.: some of the YOUNG STREET GIRLS are arrogant,
text: almost aggressive, others are more insecure and inexperienced.
text: A BLACK MAN charges down the sidewalk across the street from
text: TRAVIS. He walks at a fast, maniacal clip, looking only at
text: the sidewalk in front of him. Out of his mouth comes a
text: continuous stream of invective: "That-cock-sucking-crazy-no-
dialog: good-asshole-bitch-when-I-get-my-fucking-fingers-on-her-
text: nigger-tits-I'm-gonna-ring-em-and-shit-up-her-ass..." and so
text: on. He is Out of Control. Nobody seems to notice or care.
text: TRAVIS takes a swig of peach brandy and continues his stake-
dialog: out.
text: Finally, TRAVIS spies the object of his search: IRIS walks
text: down the sidewalk with her GIRLFRIEND. Iris wears her large
text: blue sunglasses.
text: TRAVIS checks to see if his .38 is in place (it is), opens
text: the door and exits from the cab.
text: Flipping up the collar of his Army jacket, TRAVIS slouches
text: over and walks toward IRIS. He sort of sidles up next to
text: her and walks beside her: TRAVIS always looks most suspicious
text: when he's trying to appear innocent.
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (shy)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: You looking for some action?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well...I guess so.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (eyeing him)
dialog: All right.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: You see that guy over there?
dialog: (nods)
dialog: His name is Sport. Go talk to him.
dialog: I'll wait here.
text: Travis' eyes follow Iris' nod until they reach Sport,
text: standing in a doorway in his lime green jacket. Travis
text: walks toward him.
text: Sport, a thirtiesh white greaser, has the affections of a
text: black pimp. His hips are jiving, his fingers softly snapping.
text: He sings to him self, "Going to the chapel, gonna get
text: married..." His complexion is sallow; his eyes cold and
text: venal. He could only seem romantic to a confused underaged
text: runaway.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You name Sport?
text: Sport immediately takes Travis for an undercover cop. He
text: extends his crosses wrists as if to be handcuffed.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Here, officer, take me in. I'm
dialog: clean. I didn't do it. Got a
dialog: ticket once in Jersey. That's all.
dialog: Honest, officer.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Your name Sport?
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Anything you say, officer.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm no cop.
dialog: (looks back at Iris)
dialog: I want some action.
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30
dialog: half hour.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Take it or leave it.
text: TRAVIS digs in his pocket for money.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: No, not me. There'll be an elderly
dialog: gent to take the bread.
text: TRAVIS turns to walk away.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Catch you later, Copper.
text: TRAVIS freezes, not saying anything. He turns back toward
text: SPORT.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm no cop.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Well, if you are, it's entrapment
dialog: already.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm hip.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Funny, you don't look hip.
dialog: (laughs)
text: TRAVIS walks back to IRIS.
text: IRIS motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does.
text: IRIS and TRAVIS turn the corner and walk about a block,
text: saying nothing. IRIS turns into a darkened doorway and
text: TRAVIS follows her.
text: At the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dimly
text: lit hallway. On either side are doors with apartment
text: numbers. IRIS turns toward the first door, No. 2.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: This is my room.
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
text: At the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge OLD MAN.
text: His face is obscured by shadow. TRAVIS is about to enter
text: the room when the OLD MAN speaks up:
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Hey cowboy!
text: TRAVIS turns his head toward the OLD MAN who has stood up
text: and is advancing toward him.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (motioning to TRAVIS' jacket)
dialog: The rod.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Gimme the rod, cowboy.
text: TRAVIS hesitates a moment, uncertain what to do. The OLD
text: MAN reaches in TRAVIS' jacket and pulls out the .38 Special.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: This ain't Dodge City, cowboy. You
dialog: don't need no piece.
dialog: (glances at watch)
dialog: I'm keepin' time.
text: TRAVIS enters No. 2 with IRIS.
text: TRAVIS looks around IRIS' room: although dimly lit, the room
text: is brightly decorated. There is an orange shag carpet, deep
text: brown walls and an old red velvet sofa. On the walls are
text: posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda. A Neil
text: Young album is playing on a small phonograph.
text: This is where IRIS lives: it bears the individual touch of a
text: young girl.
text: IRIS lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places it
text: in an ashtray on the bedstand.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Why you hang around with them
dialog: greasers?
speaker_heading: IRIS
text: A girl needs protection.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah. From the likes of them.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: It's your time mister. Fifteen
dialog: minutes ain't long.
dialog: (gestures to cigarette)
dialog: That cigarette burns out, your time
text: is up.
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
text: IRIS sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and
text: coat. She takes off her blue-tinted sunglasses--her last
text: defense. Without the paraphernalia of adulthood, Iris looks
text: like a little girl she is. About 14, 15.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Easy.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: That ain't much of a name.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: What's your real name?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I don't like my real name.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (insistent)
dialog: What's your real name?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Iris.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: That's a nice name.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: That's what you think.
text: IRIS unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic
text: breasts -- two young doves hiding from a winter wind.
text: TRAVIS is unnerved by her partial nudity.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Don't you remember me? Button your
dialog: shirt.
text: IRIS buttons only the bottom button of her shirt.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (examining him)
dialog: Why? Who are you?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I drive a taxi. You tried to get
dialog: away one night. Remember?
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You tried to run away in my taxi
dialog: but your friend -- Sport -- wouldn't
dialog: let you.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I don't remember.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: It don't matter. I'm gonna get you
dialog: outta here.
dialog: (looks toward door)
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: We better make it, or Sport'll get
dialog: mad. How do you want to make it?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (pressured)
dialog: I don't want to make it. I came
dialog: here to get you out.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: You want to make it like this?
dialog: (goes for his fly)
text: TRAVIS pushes her hand away. He sits beside her on the edge
text: of the bed.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (taking her by the shoulders)
dialog: Can't you listen to me? Don't you
dialog: want to get out of here?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Why should I want to get out of
dialog: here? This is where I live.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: But you're the one that wanted to
dialog: get away. You're the one that came
dialog: into my cab.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I musta been stoned.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Do they drug you?
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (reproving)
dialog: Oh, come off it, man.
text: IRIS tries to unzip TRAVIS' fly. This only unnerves TRAVIS
dialog: more: sexual contact is something he's never really
dialog: confronted.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Listen...
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Don't you want to make it?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Can't you make it?
text: IRIS works on TRAVIS' crotch OFF CAMERA. He bats her hand
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (distraught)
dialog: I want to help you.
text: TRAVIS is getting increasingly panicked, but IRIS only
dialog: thinks this is part of his particular thing and tries to
dialog: overcome it.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (catching on)
dialog: You can't make it, can you?
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I can help you.
text: IRIS lowers her head to go down on TRAVIS. TRAVIS, seeing
text: this, jumps up in panic.
text: TRAVIS stands several feet from IRIS. His fly is still
text: open, and the white of his underwear shows through his jeans.
text: He is starting to come apart.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck
dialog: it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (confused)
dialog: You can do it in my mouth.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Don't you understand anything?
text: IRIS says nothing. After a moment, TRAVIS again sits on the
text: bed beside IRIS. She no longer tries to make him.
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
text: There is a moment of silence. IRIS puts her arm around his
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: You don't have to make it, mister.
text: TRAVIS rests a moment, collecting himself. Finally, he says:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (slowly)
dialog: Do you understand why I came here?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I think so. I tried to get into
dialog: your cab one night, and now you
dialog: want to come and take me away.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Don't you want to go?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I can leave anytime I want.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: But that one night?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I was stoned. That's why they
dialog: stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I
dialog: got no place else to go. They just
dialog: protect me from myself.
text: There is a pause. TRAVIS smiles and shrugs apologetically.
text: TRAVIS looks at Iris' cigarette. It's burning down to the
dialog: butt.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Well, I tried.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (compassionate)
dialog: I understand, mister. It means
dialog: something, really.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: Can I see you again?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: That's not hard to do.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: No, I mean really. This is nothing
dialog: for a person to do.
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Sure. All right. We'll have
dialog: breakfast. I get up about one
text: o'clock. Tomorrow.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Well tomorrow noon there's a... I
dialog: got a...
text: IRIS is interfering with TRAVIS' assassination schedule.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Well, you want to or not?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (deciding)
dialog: O.K. It's a date. I'll see you
dialog: here, then.
text: TRAVIS turns; IRIS smiles.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh, Iris?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: My name's Travis.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Thank you, Travis.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: So long, Iris.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Sweet Iris.
dialog: (smiles)
text: TRAVIS exits.
text: TRAVIS closes the door to No. 2 and stands in the corridor
text: for a moment.
text: The OLD MAN slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway
text: with TRAVIS' .38 in his hand. OLD MAN stands near TRAVIS,
text: and checks his watch.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: (holding gun)
dialog: I think this is yours, cowboy.
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
text: TRAVIS reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the
text: familiar crumpled $20 bill. He makes a big show of stuffing
text: the wrinkled bill into the OLD MAN's hand. The OLD MAN
dialog: doesn't understand the significance of it.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (restrained anger)
dialog: Here's the twenty bucks, old man.
dialog: You better damn well spend it right.
text: TRAVIS turns and walks away.
text: OLD MAN says as TRAVIS walks down stairs:
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Come back anytime you want, cowboy.
dialog: But without the rod -- please.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS does not respond.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ST. REGIS SUITE NOON
text: Palantine, Tom and Palantine's Assistant are seated in
text: garishly decorated suite.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Well, at least it wasn't chicken.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: It wasn't? I thought it was. It
dialog: tasted like chicken.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: C'mon, Senator. That was a class
dialog: dinner. The St. Regis is a class
dialog: joint. That was veal.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: Was it? It sure tasted like
dialog: chicken to me.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Lately, everything tastes like
dialog: chicken to me.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Everything? Got to watch your gut.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: What about it? I took 20 off
dialog: before we started this thing.
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: And you've put ten of it back on.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: Ten? I don't think so. You really
dialog: think so? Ten?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Those TV cameras do. I caught the
dialog: rally on CBS. You looked a little
text: paunchy.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: I don't think I gained ten pounds.
text: Palantine gets up and walks over to the window. Its bars
text: form a cross-sight on his head. He thinks to himself:
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: (weary)
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: He looks at the crowded traffic on Fifth Avenue eighteen
text: floors below. It is a mass of yellow.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. FIFTH AVE NOON
text: Travis' cab pulls away from the yellow mass and heads
text: downtown.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTONE COFFEE SHOP NOON
text: Travis' cab is parked near a neighborhood Bickford's.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRAVIS and IRIS are having late breakfast at a middle-class
text: EAST SIDE COFFEE SHOP. It is about 1:30 P.M.
text: IRIS is dressed more sensibly, wearing jeans and a maroon
text: sweater. Her face is freshly washed and her hair combed out.
text: Seen this way, IRIS looks no different than any young girl
text: in the big city. OTHER PATRONS of the coffee shop most
text: likely assume she is having lunch with her big brother.
text: They are both having an All-American breakfast: ham and
text: eggs, large glasses of orange juice, coffee.
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
text: Outside here environment, Iris seems the more pathetic. She
text: seems unsure, schizy, unable to hold a subject for more than
text: thirty seconds. Her gestures are too broad, her voice too
text: mannered. We sympathize with Travis' paternal respect.
dialog: This girl is in trouble.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: ... and after that Sport and I just
dialog: started hanging out...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Where is home?
text: Iris removes her large blue-tinted sunglasses and fishes
text: through her bag for another pair.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I got so many sunglasses. I
dialog: couldn't live without my shades,
dialog: man. I must have twelve pair of
dialog: shades.
text: She finds a pink-tinted pair and puts them on.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Pittsburgh.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I ain't ever been there, but it
dialog: don't seem like such a bad place.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (voice rising)
dialog: Why do you want me to go back to my
dialog: parents? They hate me. Why do you
dialog: think I split? There ain't nothin
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: But you can't live like this. It's
dialog: hell. Girls should live at home.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (playfully)
dialog: Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
text: There is a short, quick silence; TRAVIS' eyes retract. He
dialog: goes on:
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (ignoring her question)
dialog: Young girls are supposed to dress
dialog: up, go to school, play with boys,
dialog: you know, that kinda stuff.
text: Iris places a large gob of jam on her unbuttered toast and
text: folds the bread over like a hotdog.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: God, you are square.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (releasing pent-up tension)
dialog: At least I don't walk the streets
dialog: like a skunk pussy. I don't screw
dialog: and fuck with killers and junkies.
text: IRIS motions him to lower his voice.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Who's a killer?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: That fella "Sport" looks like a
dialog: killer to me.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: He never killed nobody. He's a
dialog: Libra.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I'm a Libra too. That's why we get
dialog: along so well.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
text: He looks like a killer.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I think Cancer's make the best
dialog: lovers. My whole family are air
dialog: signs.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
text: He shoots dope too.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: What makes you so high and mighty?
dialog: Did you ever look at your own
dialog: eyeballs in a mirror. You don't
dialog: get eyes like that from...
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: He's worse than an animal. Jail's
dialog: too good for scum like that.
text: There is a brief silence. Iris mind continued to whirl at
text: 78 rpms. She seems to have three subjects on her mind at a
text: time. She welcomes this opportunity to unburden herself.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Rock music died in 1970, that's
dialog: what I think. Before that it was
dialog: fantastic. I can tell you that.
text: Everybody was crashing, hanging out
dialog: at the Fillmore. Me and my
dialog: girlfriend Ann used to go up the
dialog: fire escape, you know? It was
text: unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere.
dialog: That Airplane--that's my group, man.
dialog: All Libras. But now everybody's
dialog: split or got sick or busted. I
dialog: think I'll move to one of those
dialog: communes in Vermont, you know?
dialog: That's where all the smart ones
dialog: went. I stayed here.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I never been to a commune. I don't
dialog: know. I saw pictures in a magazine,
dialog: and it didn't look very clean to me.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Why don't you come to a commune
dialog: with me?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Me? I could never go to a place
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (hesitant)
dialog: I... I don't get along with people
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: You a scorpion? That's it. You're
dialog: a scorpion. I can tell.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Besides, I've got to stay here.
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I've got something important to do.
dialog: I can't leave.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: What's so important?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I can't say -- it's top secret.
dialog: I'm doing something for the Army.
dialog: The cab thing is just part time.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: You a narc?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Do I look like a narc?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Yeah.
text: TRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS joins
text: his laughter.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: God, I don't know who's weirder,
dialog: you or me.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What are you going to do about
dialog: Sport and that old bastard?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Just leave'em. There's plenty of
dialog: other girls.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You just gonna leave 'em?
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (astonished)
dialog: What should I do? Call the cops?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Cops don't do nothin.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Sport never treated me bad, honest.
dialog: Never beat me up once.
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: You can't leave 'em to do the same
dialog: to other girls. You should get rid
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't know. Just should, though.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd
dialog: miss 'em.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (taken back)
dialog: God. I know where they should have
dialog: a commune for you. They should
dialog: have a commune for you at Bellevue.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (apologetic/sheepish)
dialog: I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: You're not much with girls, are you?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Well, Iris, I look at it this way.
dialog: A lot of girls come into my cab,
dialog: some of them very beautiful. And I
dialog: figure all day long men have been
text: after them: trying to touch them,
dialog: talk to them, ask them out. And
dialog: they hate it. So I figure the best
dialog: I can do for them is not bother
dialog: them at all. So I don't say a
dialog: thing. I pretend I'm not even
dialog: there. I figure they'll understand
dialog: that and appreciate me for it.
text: It takes IRIS a moment to digest this pure example of
dialog: negative thinking: I am loved to the extent I do not exist.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Do you really think I should go to
dialog: the commune?
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I think you should go home, but
dialog: otherwise I think you should go.
dialog: It would be great for you. You
dialog: have to get away from here. The
dialog: city's a sewer, you gotta get out
dialog: of it.
text: Mumbling something about her "shades" again, Iris fishes
text: through her bag until she comes up with another 99¢ pair of
dialog: sunglasses and puts them on. She likes these better, she
dialog: decides.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Sure you don't want to come with me?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I can't. Otherwise, I would.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: I sure hate to go alone...
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'll give you the money to go. I
dialog: don't want you to take any from
dialog: those guys.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: You don't have to.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I want to -- what else can I do
dialog: with my money?
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: You may not see me again--for a
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: What do you mean?
scene_heading: CLOSE on C.U. of TRAVIS:
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: My work may take me out of New York.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: IRIS' ROOM - DAY
text: Sport stands beside the bed.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: What's the matter, baby, don't you
dialog: feel right?
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
text: Iris is wearing her blue-tinted shades.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: It's my stomach. I got the flu.
text: Sport puts his hand on her hips. He is slowly, carefully,
text: smoothly manipulating her. It's the stone black hustle.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Oh, baby, there ain't no flu. You
dialog: know that, baby.
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Honest, Sport.
text: Sport puts some slow soul music on the stereo.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: You're just tired, baby. You just
dialog: need your man. I am your man, you
dialog: know. You are my woman. I wouldn't
dialog: be nothing without you.
text: Sport slowly grinds his hips to hers. Iris starts to move
dialog: with him. This is what she really wanted. Her man's
dialog: attention.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: I know this may not mean anything
dialog: to you, baby, but sometimes I get
dialog: so emotional, sometimes I think, I
dialog: wish every man could have what I
dialog: have now, that every woman could be
dialog: loved the way I love you. I go
dialog: home and I think what it would be
dialog: without you, and then I thank God
dialog: for you. I think to myself, man,
dialog: you are so lucky. You got a woman
dialog: who loves you, who needs you, a
dialog: woman who keeps you strong. It's
dialog: just you and me. I'm nothing
dialog: without you. I can go like this
dialog: for ever and ever. We can do it,
dialog: baby. You and me. Just you and me.
text: Sport slowly rubs his crotch into her. Iris smiles. She is
text: happy. The music rises.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: FIRING RANGE - DAY
text: TRAVIS stands at the firing range blasting the .44 Magnum
text: with a rapid-fire vengeance.
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
text: He sets down one gun, picks up the next, then the next.
text: Quickly reloading, he fires again.
text: The targets spin and dance under his barrage. The piercing
text: sound of GUNSHOTS ring through the air.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT
text: TRAVIS is again writing at the table. His western shirt is
text: open, exposing his bare chest.
text: A note of despair and doom has entered into TRAVIS' normally
text: monotone narration voice: this will be the last entry in his
dialog: diary.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.)
dialog: My whole life has pointed in one
dialog: direction. I see that now. There
dialog: never has been any choice for me.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: LENGTHY P.O.V. SHOT from TRAVIS' taxi: we see New York's
text: nightlife as TRAVIS sees it. CAMERA TRACKS down midtown
text: sidewalks in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION. There we see:
text: COUPLES, walking in SLOWING MOTION, young couples, middle-
text: aged couples, old couples, hookers and johns, girlfriends,
text: boyfriends, business friends -- the whole world matched up
text: in pairs, and TRAVIS left wandering alone in the night.
text: Others would notice the breasts, the asses, the faces, but
text: not TRAVIS: he notices the girl's hand that rubs the hair on
text: her boyfriend's neck, the hand that hangs lightly on his
text: shoulder, the nuzzling kiss in the ear.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTD)
dialog: Loneliness has followed me all my
dialog: life. The life of loneliness
dialog: pursues me wherever I go: in bars,
dialog: cars, coffee shops, theaters,
text: stores, sidewalks. There is no
dialog: escape. I am God's lonely man.
text: MATCHCUT TO P.O.V.: another neighborhood, LATER IN THE NIGHT.
text: Still in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.
text: The CROWDS are more sparse here, the streets darker. A
text: JUNKIE shudders in a doorway, a WINO pukes into a trash can,
text: a STREET-WALKER meets a prospective CLIENT.
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS (V.O.) (CONTINUED)
dialog: I am not a fool. I will no longer
dialog: fool myself. I will no longer let
dialog: myself fall apart, become a joke
dialog: and object of ridicule. I know
dialog: there is no longer any hope. I
dialog: cannot continue this hollow, empty
dialog: fight. I must sleep. What hope is
dialog: there for me?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT
text: TRAVIS, his shirt fastened, stands beside table.
text: C.U.: He lays a brief hand-written letter on the table. We
dialog: read it.
dialog: Dear Iris,
dialog: This money should be enough for your trip. By the time you
dialog: read this I will be dead.
dialog: Travis
text: TRAVIS stacks five crisp hundred dollar bills beside the
text: letter, folds them up with the letter, and puts them into an
dialog: envelope.
text: TIMECUT: A SHORT WHILE LATER. TRAVIS has cleaned up his
text: apartment. Everything is neat and orderly.
text: CAMERA PANS across room. The mattress is bare and flattened
text: out, the floor is spotless, the cans and bottles of food and
text: pills put out of sight. The wall is still covered with
dialog: Palantine political paraphernalia, but when we reach the
text: desk we see only four items there: an open diary and three
text: loaded revolvers: .44, .38, .25.
text: TRAVIS, freshly shaved and neatly dressed, stands in the
text: middle of his clean room. The empty holster hangs on his
text: shoulder. Metal .25 gliders can be seen under the slit in
text: his right sleeve. He turns toward table.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRAVIS, envelope in hand, closes the door behind him and
text: walks down the corridor.
text: He passes a ajar door and we are suprised to see the room is
text: empty--and trashed. Travis lives in a decaying, if not
dialog: condemned building.
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
text: EXT.
text: TRAVIS places the envelope to IRIS in his mail box.
text: BACK IN APARTMENT. CAMERA CLOSE ON revolvers lying on the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: SOUND of a political rally: cheering, laughing, a band
text: playing, talking.
text: AFTERNOON. A CROWD of about 500 PERSONS is assembled before
text: a platform outside a Brooklyn union hall. A DIXIELAND BAND
text: is playing on the platform.
text: C.U. CHARLES PALANTINE's feet climb out of a limousine.
text: There is a ROAR from the nearby CROWD.
text: PALANTINE, a bulky SECRET SERVICE MAN to the right and left
text: of him, pushes his way through the CROWD toward the platform.
text: Still cameras click, and TV cameras purr.
text: SLIGHT TIMECUT: PALANTINE is speaking on the platform.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRAVIS' empty taxi sits parked a few blocks away from rally.
text: At this distance, the rally sounds are almost
text: indistinguishable.
text: C.U. of TRAVIS' boots walking. They make their way past one
text: person, then two, then a cluster of three or four. SOUNDS
dialog: of rally increase.
text: We see a FULL FIGURE SHOT of TRAVIS: he is standing alone in
text: an opening near the fringes of the CROWD.
text: TRAVIS looks like the most suspicious human being alive.
text: His hair is cropped short, he wears mirror-reflecting
text: glasses. His face is pallid and drained of color, his lips
text: are pursed and drawn tight. He looks from side to side.
text: One can now see the full effect of TRAVIS' lack of sleep and
text: sufficient diet -- he looks sick and frail.
text: Even though it is a warm June day, TRAVIS is bundled up in a
text: shirt, sweater and Army jacket buttoned from top to bottom.
text: Under his jacket are several large lumps, causing his upper
text: torso to look larger than it should. He is slightly hunched
text: over and his hands shoved into his pockets.
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: Anyone scanning the crowd would immediately light upon
dialog: TRAVIS and think, "There is an assassin."
text: TRAVIS pulls the vial of red pills from his pocket and
text: swallows a couple.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: SECRET SERVICE MAN standing beside the platform, scanning
text: the CROWD. It is the same SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke
text: to at the first rally. TOM, dressed in a conservative suit,
text: stands beside him.
text: PALANTINE is wrapping up his short speech:
speaker_heading: PALANTINE
dialog: ... and with your help we will go
text: on to victry at the polls Tuesday.
dialog: (applause)
text: TRAVIS begins moving up into the crowd.
speaker_heading: PALANTINE (CONTD)
text: On to victory in Miami Beach next
dialog: month
dialog: (building applause)
dialog: and on to victory next November!
text: PALANTINE steps back, smiling and receiving the applause.
text: Then, nodding, at the SECRET SERVICE MAN he descends the
text: stairs and prepares to work his way through the CROWD.
text: TRAVIS unbuttons the middle two buttons of his jacket,
text: opening access to his holster. With the other hand he
text: checks the .44 hooked behind his back.
text: PALANTINE smiles and shakes a few of the many hands
text: outstretched toward him.
text: The SECRET SERVICE MAN, scanning the CROWD, spots something
text: that interests him. He looks closely.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN'S P.O.V.: TRAVIS, his face intense,
text: pushes his way through the CROWD.
text: PALANTINE works his way through crowds and cameras.
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN motions to SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN and
text: points in TRAVIS' direction.
text: TRAVIS slips his hand into his jacket.
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
text: The SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN converges on TRAVIS from the
dialog: side.
text: TRAVIS and PALANTINE draw closer to each other.
text: SECRET SERVICE MAN, walking just behind PALANTINE, grabs the
text: candidate's hand and pulls him backward. PALANTINE looks
text: sharply back at SECRET SERVICE MAN who motions for him to
text: take a slightly altered route.
text: TRAVIS sees this: his eyes meet the SECRET SERVICE MAN's.
text: He recognizes the situation. To his right he spots the
scene_heading: SECOND SECRET SERVICE MAN.
text: TRAVIS' eyes meet PALANTINE's: candidate and would-be
text: assassin exchange quick glances.
text: TRAVIS hastily works his way back through the CROWD. He
text: hears the SECRET SERVICE MAN's voice call out:
scene_heading: SECRET SERVICE MAN
dialog: Detain that man!
text: OVERHEAD SHOT reveals TRAVIS has the jump on his pursuers.
text: He is breaking free of the CROWD while they are still mired
dialog: in it.
text: TRAVIS, free of his pursuers, quickly makes his way down the
text: sidewalks. The SECRET SERVICE MEN look futilely about.
text: TRAVIS jumps in his cab. Sweat covers his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: The film is moving fast now; it pushes hard and straight
text: toward its conclusion. We're moving toward the kill.
text: LATE AFTERNOON. TRAVIS' taxi skids around a corner and
text: speeds into Manhattan.
text: TRAVIS checks his mail slot: the letter to IRIS has already
text: been picked up by the MAILMAN.
text: TRAVIS, stripped to the waist, walks back and forth across
text: his INT. APARTMENT, wiping his torso with a bath towel.
text: TRAVIS begins dressing:
text: -- He straps the Army combat knife to his calf.
text: -- He reflexes the metal gliders and the Colt .25 on his
text: right forearm.
dialog: 
dialog: 102.
text: INTERCUT: SPORT stands in his doorway on the LOWER EAST SIDE
text: shot with LONG DISTANCE LENS. It is EARLY EVENING.
text: INTERCUT: A pudgy middle-aged white PRIVATE COP walks up to
text: SPORT. The two men laugh, slap each other on the back and
text: exchange a soul shake. They discuss a little private
text: business and the PRIVATE COP walks off in the direction of
text: IRIS' apartment.
text: -- TRAVIS straps on holster and fits the .38 Special into it.
text: INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP walks down block.
text: -- TRAVIS hooks the huge Magnum into the back of his belt.
text: He puts on his Army jacket and walks out the door.
text: INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP turns up darkened stairway to IRIS'
dialog: apartment.
text: NIGHT has fallen: TRAVIS' taxi careens down 10th Ave. He
text: speeds, honks, accelerates quickly. The glare of speeding
text: yellow and red lights flash through the night.
scene_heading: TRAVIS' P.O.V.: PEDESTRIAN attempts to flag down TRAVIS'
text: taxi, but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees
text: TRAVIS has no intention of stopping for anything.
text: INTERCUT: SPORT maintains his post in the dark doorway. He
text: waves to a GIRL who passes, and she waves back.
text: TRAVIS' taxi screeches to a stop and parks obliquely against
dialog: the curb.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: TRAVIS walks down the block to the doorway where SPORT
text: stands. CAMERA TRACKS with TRAVIS.
text: Without slowing, TRAVIS walks up to SPORT and puts his arm
text: on his shoulder in a gesture of friendliness.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Hey, Sport. How are things?
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: O.K., cowboy.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (needling him)
dialog: How are things in the pimp business,
dialog: hey Sport?

speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: I'm here to see Iris.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Iris?
text: TRAVIS pushes SPORT back into the dark recesses of the
dialog: corridor.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: Wha -- ?
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Yeah, Iris. You know anybody by
dialog: that name?
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hillbilly, you'd better get your
dialog: wise ass outa here and quick, or
dialog: you're gonna be in trouble.
text: TRAVIS is being propelled by an inner force, a force which
text: takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (restrained anger)
dialog: You carry a gun?
text: SPORT looks into TRAVIS' eyes, saying nothing: he realizes
dialog: the seriousness of the situation.
text: TRAVIS pulls his .38 Special and holds it on SPORT, pushing
text: him even further back against the wall.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Get it.
speaker_heading: SPORT
dialog: (submissive)
dialog: Hey, mister, I don't know what's
dialog: going on here. This don't make any
dialog: sense.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: (demanding)
dialog: Show it to me.
text: SPORT reluctantly pulls a .32 caliber pistol (a "purse gun")
text: from his pocket and holds it limply.
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
text: TRAVIS sticks his .38 into SPORT's gut and discharges it.
text: There is a muffled blast, followed by a muted scream of pain.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Now suck on that.
text: Agony and shock cross SPORT'S face as he slumps to the floor.
text: TRAVIS turns and walks away before SPORT even hits.
text: As TRAVIS walks away, SPORT can be seen struggling in the b.g.
text: TRAVIS, he gun slipped into his jacket, walks quickly up the
dialog: sidewalk.
text: AROUND THE CORNER, TRAVIS walks into the darkened stairway
text: leading to IRIS' apartment.
text: As he walks up the stairs, TRAVIS pulls the .44 Magnum from
text: behind his back and transfers the .38 Special to his left
text: hand. He walks up the steps, a pistol dangling from each
dialog: hand.
text: AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, TRAVIS spots THE OLD MAN sitting
text: at the far end of the dark corridor. THE OLD MAN starts to
text: get up when TRAVIS discharges the mighty .44 at him. BLAAM!
text: The hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder.
text: THE OLD MAN staggers at the end of the corridor: his right
text: hand has been blown off at the forearm.
text: There is the sharp SOUND of a GUNSHOT behind TRAVIS: his
text: face grimaces in pain. A bullet has ripped through the left
text: side of his neck. Blood flows over his left shoulder.
text: TRAVIS' .44 flies into the air.
text: TRAVIS looks down the stairway: there SPORT lies choking in
text: a puddle of his own blood. He has struggled long enough to
text: fire one shot.
text: Falling, TRAVIS drills another .38 slug into SPORT's back
text: but SPORT is already dead.
text: TRAVIS slumps to his knees. Down the corridor THE OLD MAN
text: with a bloody stump is struggling toward him. TRAVIS turns
text: his .38 toward THE OLD MAN.
text: The door to No. 2 opens: IRIS' scream is heard in the b.g.
text: The bulky frame of the PRIVATE COP fills the doorway. His
text: blue shirt is open, in his hand hangs a .38 service revolver.
text: The PRIVATE COP raises his gun and shoots TRAVIS. TRAVIS,
text: blood gushing from his right shoulder, sinks to the floor.
text: His .38 clangs down the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: THE OLD MAN grows closer. TRAVIS smashes his right arm
text: against the wall, miraculously, the small Colt .25 glides
text: down his forearm into his palm.
text: TRAVIS fills the PRIVATE COP's face full of bullet holes.
text: The PRIVATE COP, SCREAMING, crashes back into the room.
text: THE OLD MAN crashes atop TRAVIS. The .25 falls from TRAVIS'
dialog: hand.
text: Both men are bleeding profusely as they thrash into IRIS'
text: room. IRIS hides behind the old red velvet sofa, her face
text: frozen in fright.
text: TRAVIS, trapped under the heavy OLD MAN, reaches down with
text: his right hand and pulls the combat knife from his right calf.
text: Just as TRAVIS draws back the knife, THE OLD MAN brings his
text: huge left palm crashing down on TRAVIS: THE OLD MAN's palm
text: is impaled on the knife.
text: OLD MAN SCREAMS in pain.
text: Police SIRENS are heard in b.g.
text: With great effort, TRAVIS turns over, pinning THE OLD MAN to
text: the floor. The bloody knife blade sticks through his
text: upturned hand.
text: TRAVIS reaches over with his right hand and picks up the
text: revolver of the new dead PRIVATE COP.
text: TRAVIS hoists himself up and sticks the revolver into the
text: OLD MAN's mouth.
text: THE OLD MAN's voice is full of pain and ghastly fright:
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Don't kill me! Don't kill me!
text: IRIS screams in b.g. TRAVIS looks up:
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: Don't kill him, Travis! Don't kill
dialog: him!
text: TRAVIS fires the revolver, blowing the back of THE OLD MAN's
text: head off the silencing his protests.
text: The police SIRENS screech to a halt. SOUND of police
text: officers running up the stairs.
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
text: TRAVIS struggles up and collapses on the red velvet sofa,
text: his blood-soaked body blending with the velvet.
text: IRIS retreats in fright against the far wall.
text: First uniformed POLICE OFFICER rushes in room, drawn gun in
text: hand. Other POLICEMEN can be heard running up the stairs.
text: TRAVIS looks helplessly up at the OFFICER. He forms his
text: bloody hand into a pistol, raises it to his forehead and,
text: his voice croaking in pain, makes the sound of a pistol
text: discharging.
speaker_heading: TRAVIS
dialog: Pgghew! Pgghew!
text: Out of breath fellow OFFICERS join the first POLICEMAN.
text: They survey the room.
text: TRAVIS' head slumps against the sofa.

text: pretty much the same, although there is a new portable TV
text: and an inexpensive easy chair.
text: VISUAL: TRACK begins at table and works across the room to
dialog: the mattress.
dialog: We see these items:
text: -- On the table rests the diary, closed. A desk calendar
text: stands on the table: it is October.
text: -- Across the wall where the Palantine clippings once hung
text: there are now a series of new newspaper clippings. Right to
dialog: left, they read:
text: 1. The first is a full back page from the N.Y. Daily News.
text: Headline reads: "CABBIE BATTLES GANGSTERS." There are large
text: photos of police standing in IRIS' room after the slaughter,
text: and a picture of TRAVIS' cabbie mug shot.
text: 2. Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without
text: photo from the N.Y. Times. Two-column headline reads:
dialog: "Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead."
text: 3. A follow-up story from the News. Two-column photo shows
text: plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room.
text: Two-column headline reads: "Parents Express Shock, Gratitude."
text: 4. A two-column Daily News story without photo. Headline
dialog: reads: "Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover."
text: 5. A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure
text: page. Headline reads: "Cabbie Returns to Job."
text: -- At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the
text: wall. It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white
text: paper. The handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear
text: neat and orderly. We recognize that it is the same letter
text: that is being read in voice over.
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
text: -- When we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is
text: barren. A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at
text: the head of the mattress.
text: AUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middle-
text: aged uneducated man reading in voice over.
text: It is the voice of IRIS' FATHER and he is reading a letter
text: he sent to TRAVIS, and which TRAVIS has tacked to his wall.
speaker_heading: IRIS' FATHER (V.O.)
dialog: Dear Mr. Bickle,
dialog: I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma
dialog: and I were to hear that you are
dialog: well and recuperating. We tried to
dialog: visit you at the hospital when we
dialog: were in New York to pick up Iris,
dialog: but you were still in a coma.
dialog: There is no way we can repay you
dialog: for returning our Iris to us. We
dialog: thought we had lost her, but now
dialog: our lives are full again. Needless
dialog: to say, you are something of a hero
dialog: around this household.
dialog: I'm sure you want to know about
text: Iris. She is back in school and
dialog: working hard. The transition has
dialog: been very hard for her, as you can
dialog: well imagine, but we have taken
dialog: steps to see she never has cause to
text: run away again.
dialog: In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I
dialog: would like to again thank you from
dialog: the bottom of our hearts.
dialog: Unfortunately, we cannot afford to
dialog: come to New York again to thank you
dialog: in person, or we surely would. But
dialog: if you should ever come to
dialog: Pittsburgh, you would find yourself
dialog: a most welcome guest in our home.
dialog: Our deepest thanks,
