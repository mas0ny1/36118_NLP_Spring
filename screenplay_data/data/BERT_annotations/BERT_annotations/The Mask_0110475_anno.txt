speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: So, uh, what kind of account did
dialog: you have in mind?

speaker_heading: TINA

speaker_heading: STANLEY
text: A Rorschach test.
dialog:

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: That's it. It looks like... um.
text: A young woman riding bareback.
dialog: You know, like a Lady Godiva or
dialog: something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Really? I don't think I can...
dialog: 
text: She slowly runs a finger along Stanley's tie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Or... if that's not a horse it

dialog: a woman. That would be the woman
dialog: on top, of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
speaker_heading: (MESMERIZED)
dialog: ...Of course.

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Well, they call it Emeral Forest,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Burt! Pea green Civic!

text: Burt pops back up from beneath the hood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Green Civic... Green Civic. Oh
dialog: yeah! Brake drums are still on
dialog: order and I'm only halfway through
dialog: rebuilding the trans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: But I just brought it in for an
dialog: oil change!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Yeah? Well you're lucky we caught
dialog: those other problems before they
dialog: caused some serious trouble.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Alright. Alright. When will it
dialog: be ready?
dialog: 
text: Irv looks over at Burt, who gives him a "Make something up" look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Come back tomorro...
dialog: (Burt shakes his head "no".)
dialog: ...First thing next wee...
dialog: (Burt shakes again)
dialog: ...next month?
text: (Burt shakes an enthusiastic "yes".)
dialog: Yeah, first thing next month.
dialog: That's if we can get the parts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What am I going to do in the
dialog: meantime? I can't afford to keep
text: taking cabs all over town.
dialog: 
text: Irv smiles a rotten-toothed smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Oh, hell... we can take care of
dialog: that!
dialog: (to Burt archly)

scene_heading: EXT. MONKEY'S PAW - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The joint is jumping with musclehead BOUNCERS picking and
text: choosing from the crowd of terminally trendy WANNABE'S gathered
dialog: around the
text: entrance. A light drizzle is falling.
dialog: 
text: A parade of swanky cars pulls up one by one as CAR HOPS scurry to
dialog: keep up with the flow;
dialog: 
text: A glistening pearlescent Rolls Royce.
dialog: 
text: A fire engine red Ferrari.
dialog: 
text: A classic two tone Corniche in tan and burgundy.
dialog: 
text: And finally a broken down Citroen in rust bucket red and spackle
text: gray RUMBLES up to the front of the club with a disgruntled
dialog: Stanley behind
dialog: the wheel.
dialog: 
text: A car hop attempts to open the door, but it's rusted shut.
text: Stanley throws his shoulder into it and the door finally pops
text: open with a SCREECH of
text: metal. Stanley nearly tumbles out into the street.
dialog: 
text: He smiles nervously at a high class couple looking with disdain
text: at the eyesore-mobile. He pats the hood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: It's a classic.
dialog: 
text: The car hop jumps in and tries to throw the car into gear with a
text: horrible GRINDING. He finally waves over two other car hops who
dialog: quickly push
text: it off down the street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, Stanley. Nice wheels. What
dialog: is that, a Rolls Canardley?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Whatever you say, man.
dialog: 
text: Charlie gestures expansively towards the club.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What do you think? Pretty

dialog: 
text: Stanley now notices a life-sized poster of Tina Carlyle standing

dialog: of Miss Tina

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hey, isn't that...

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Right. The wet dream from the

speaker_heading: (PAUSES)

speaker_heading: GIRLS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
speaker_heading: (WAVES)
dialog: We're in luck. It's Barbie and

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Doesn't it bother you that all

dialog: 
text: Barbie and Pebbles hurry over through the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARBIE
dialog: We've been waiting out here for

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: No, problemo. Ladies, this is my

dialog: (leans closer)
dialog: Stanley's very influential in the
dialog: banking business.
dialog: 
text: Charlie is truly in his element as he elbows his way through the
text: crowd dragging his entourage with him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT DOOR
dialog: 
text: Charlie finally makes through the crush of badies at the entry
text: way's velvet ropes and calls to one of the two hulking BOUNCERS
dialog: that guard the
dialog: door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey Bobby! Bobby, buddy. What's
dialog: happening man?
dialog: 
text: Bobby completely ignores Charlie as he ushers a pasty faced ROCK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT.)
dialog: (to the girls)
dialog: This will just take a second.
dialog: (to the other bouncer)
dialog: Yo Nick! It's me... Charlie!
dialog: 
text: Nick is also completely oblivious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Forget it, Charlie. I refuse to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: How much cash you got on you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You heard me. How much you got?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I dunno, fifty or sixty bucks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hand it over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: No way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, I'll pay you back! I'm only
dialog: carrying plastic. C'mon man, you
dialog: want to stand out here all night?
dialog:

dialog: ropes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: (subtly flashing bills)
dialog: Hey Bobby!
dialog: 
text: Bobby's uncanny tip radar suddenly lights up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Charlie, how you doin' man? Long
dialog: time no see.
dialog: 
text: Bobby unsnaps the rope for Charlie and gets the cash handshake he
dialog: longs for.
dialog: 
text: The crowd surges around Charlie, Barbie and Pebbles as they step
text: by, briefly cutting Stanley off.
dialog: 
text: He catches up just as the all-important rope is SNAPPED closed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hey, wait a minute! Charlie!
dialog: 
text: But Charlie and the girls have already been whisked inside.
text: Dorian now steps out of the club and begins to check Bobby's
dialog: list.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: I'm with them! Hey, Bobby!
dialog: 
text: But Bobby is back into his deaf and dumb routine. Stanley unsnaps

speaker_heading: IMMEDIATELY

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hey! Leggo... awk!
dialog: 
text: Dorian glares at Stanley.

speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Lose him.
dialog: 
text: The bouncers drag Stanley through the crowd and unceremoniously
text: toss him out into the rain-slick street.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON THE STREET
dialog: 
text: Stanley slowly rises, smoothing out his disheveled clothing. A
text: horn BLARES and Stanley scrambles to one side as a limo swings
dialog: into the
text: club's alleyway, splattering him with a wave of muddy water.
dialog: 
text: Stanley wipes the mud from his eyes just in time to see Tina
text: Carlyle escorted from the back of the limo by a CHAUFFEUR
text: carrying an umbrella.
text: She's shoe-horned into a heart-stopping red dress that's fighting
text: a losing battle to restrain her decolletage.
dialog: 
text: Their EYES MEET. Tina pauses as she recognizes him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Oh... Stanley. Hi.
dialog: 
text: Stanley realizes he looks ridiculous but gives a pathetic little
dialog: wave hello anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA (CONT.)
dialog: Are you okay?
dialog: 
text: Stanley gestures "no problem" and tries to strike a casual pose
text: against a street lamp, but slips and nearly falls.
dialog: 
text: With a SQUEAL of grinding gears and the KA-POW of a backfire, the
text: car hop pulls Stanley's battered loaner right up behind him.
dialog: 
text: Stanley flashes a last nervous smile at Tina, and digs for the
dialog: car hop's tip money... nothing.
dialog: 
text: He shrugs apologetically to the disgusted car hop and climbs in.
text: The car RATTLES, COUGHS the finally ROARS off in a cloud of
speaker_heading: NOXIOUS
text: exhaust fumes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TAHOOCHIE BRIDGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A forlorn looking spot on the outskirts of Edge City. We can hear
text: Stanley's car SPUTTERING and POPPING along before it actually
dialog: pulls into
text: sight on the dark rain-slick street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
dialog: 
text: Stanley drives along in a miserable daze. Suddenly the engine
text: starts KNOCKING violently and the car dies.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE
dialog: 
text: Steam HISSES from the radiator as the car slowly rolls to a stop.
text: Stanley GRINDS the ignition key again and again trying futilely
dialog: to restart the
dialog: engine.
dialog: 
text: Finally, Stanley fights his way out of the rusted door with a
text: SQUEAL of metal, turns and kicks the bumper... which promptly
text: falls off with a
text: resounding CLUNK.
dialog: 
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
text: The front axle collapses, the tires fall off and the driver's
text: side door CLATTERS to the ground.
dialog: 
text: Stanley stands there staring at the steaming heap of useless
text: metal... his mind a complete blank.
dialog: 
text: He slowly turns, looking down at the black brackish water
text: swirling along beneath the Tahoochie Bridge. A wave of melancholy
text: sweeps over
text: him. Stanley plucks a button from his coat and watches as it
text: drops down... down to the river below.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, something catches Stanley's eye... a BODY, floating
text: along in the darkness. He snaps back to reality.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Hey... Hey mister!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BANK
dialog: 
text: Stanley rushes down the slippery embankment beneath the bridge.
text: He spots the body dead ahead, floating along in the moonlight and
speaker_heading: HURRIES
text: as fast as he can.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA DOLLIES with Stanley as he scrambles down the slope; a
text: black cat YOWLS as it races past him. He steps on and shatters a
text: discarded mirror, and he ducks under an old ladder that leans
text: against the bridge's foundation as he finally reaches the shore.
dialog: 
text: Stanley splashes into the waist deep water just in time to catch
text: the body as it floats by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSER - BODY
dialog: 
text: As Stanley grabs it, the "body" falls to pieces... revealing that
text: it's nothing but a trash bag, an old tire and some floating bits
dialog: of garbage all
text: clinging to the "head": an old wooden Mask.
dialog: 
text: Stanley shakes his head in disgust... some lifesaver.
dialog: 
text: Stanley inspects the Mask more closely; strange ritualistic
text: symbols carved into a puckish face with a leering grin and eerie
text: empty eye holes.
dialog: 
text: The faintest sound of a haunting "Mask SFX Theme" rises as
text: Stanley turns the Mask around and inspects the inside... slowly
dialog: bringing it
text: closer and closer to his face. The surface of the Mask begins to
speaker_heading: SHIMMER.
dialog: 
text: But then... RIBET! A frog jumps out of it, right into Stanley's
text: face. Stanley nearly loses his footing on the slippery river
dialog: bottom.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a blinding SPOTLIGHT shines down from the bridge and an
text: amplified voice calls out from a squad car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Hey, you! What are you doing down
dialog: there?
dialog: 
text: Stanley squints into the light, trying to think of a reasonable
dialog: answer.

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Nobody.

speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: (pulls her close)
dialog: That's right, baby. C'mere.
dialog: 
text: Tina slowly leans in for a kiss, her lips softly parted... but
text: raises a finger to Dorian's lips, stopping him cold. She glances
text: over at Freeze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Sorry. I never get personal in

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Alright, you guys. It's been a

speaker_heading: DEATH'S HEAD
dialog: Hey, man. You got us all wrong.
dialog: We don't want any trouble. I was

dialog: time. That's all. You got the
dialog: time?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Uh... yeah.
dialog: 
text: As Stanley pulls back his sleeve to check his watch, the Death's
text: Head flicks out a butterfly knife. With a FLASH of steel, he
dialog: slices straight
text: through Stanley's watch band and snatches the watch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEATH'S HEAD
dialog: (holding up his prize)
dialog: See, I only wanted the time! Heh,
dialog: he, heh...
dialog: 
text: All the punkers laugh like the half-wits they are as Death's Head
text: #1 shoves Stanley into Death's Head #2. #2 pushes him back across
dialog: to #3 and
text: so on. Stanley is roughly bounced back and forth more and more
text: violently within the circle of giggling street toughs. He finally

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hello, Milo.
dialog: 
text: Milo gets so excited he starts GAGGING and COUGHING.

speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Easy, buddy. I missed you too.

text: heads straight into...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE BEDROOM
dialog: 
text: Stanley's prized collection of "golden Age" Looney Tunes tapes
text: are neatly displayed on a simple bookshelf.
dialog: 
text: He tosses the Mask down on his bedside table, pops one of his
text: cherished Tex Avery cartoons into the V.C.R., plops down on his
dialog: bed and
text: starts to strip off his shoes and socks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: 
text: enters, holding a Frisbee in his mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: C'mon, Milo. I'm beat.
dialog: (to the dog YIPS)
dialog: Okay, okay. One throw.
dialog: 
text: Stanley tosses the Frisbee into the air. The disk sails...
dialog: 
text: OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND INTO THE HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Milo runs it down, leaps up, and makes a perfect catch. He trots
text: back to the bedroom, and drops it in Stanley's lap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Easy. This is the best part.
dialog: 
text: On the screen a cartoon dog ZZZIPS into frame and drops a
text: frizzing stick of dynamite down a bad guy's pants. KA-BOOM! The
speaker_heading: dog LAUGHS
text: maniacally.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly there is a POUNDING on the wall that rattles Stanley's
text: framed cartoon cels.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: Sorry Mrs. Peenman.
dialog: 
text: With a sigh, he ejects the tape and a much quieter talk show POPS
text: on. Larry King and a guest.
dialog: 
text: Stanley rises and crosses into the bathroom to wash up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON T.V.
dialog: 
text: King's guest, Dr. Arthur Neuman, is replying to a caller.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: That's correct. The truth is we
text: all wear masks, metaphorically
dialog: speaking. We repress the Id...
dialog: our darkest desires and hide
dialog: behind a more socially acceptable
dialog: image of ourselves in order to
dialog: cope with the frustrations of our
dialog: day to day lives.
dialog: 
text: Stanley's only half listening though the open bathroom door as he
text: brushes his teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Think I'm repressed, Milo?
dialog: 
text: Stanley tries a couple of fierce expressions in the bathroom
text: mirror, his mouth foaming with toothpaste.

speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
speaker_heading: (HALF-HEARTEDLY)

text: as King wraps it up, displaying the doctor's book.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARRY KING
dialog: The book is "The Masks We Wear,"

dialog: Dr. Neuman.
dialog: 
text: Stanley pops off the T.V.with his remote.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: No thank you, Dr. Neuman.
dialog: 
text: As he buttons up his P.J.s, Stanley notices Milo warily sniffing
text: at the strange Mask, which is still lying on the bedside table. A
speaker_heading: SUBTLE
text: SHIMMER crosses its surface. Milo WHIMPERS and quickly hops off
dialog: the bed.
dialog: 
text: We now begin to hear the "Mask Theme"... echoes of the POUNDING
text: Viking drums... growing louder. Haunting whispery VOICES seem to
text: call to Stanley as he slowly crosses to the bedside. He picks up
text: the Mask and turns it over in his hands running his fingers
dialog: across the time
text: work wood. The music builds...
dialog: 
text: He turns back to the bathroom mirror and slowly raises the Mask
text: to his face. Milo watches apprehensively from beneath the bed.
dialog: 
text: For an instant - the MASK SHRINK WRAPS like a vacuum over
text: Stanley's head. We hear the PIERCING MASK SFX.
dialog: 
text: Then, a beat later, the Mask is off with a POP. The SFX STOP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Whoa.
dialog: 
text: Stanley studies the old mask, then his own face in the mirror.
text: Everything's status quo. It must have been his imagination.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Naw...
dialog: 
text: He puts the Mask on again - firmly this time. Milo dives under
dialog: the bed as...
dialog: 
scene_heading: AN INCREDIBLE METAMORPHOSIS BEGINS:
dialog: 
text: RUBBERY WOODEN WHIPS shoot out of the Mask and wrap around
text: Stanley's head - locking the Mask in place.

text: STANLEY GRABS HIS HEAD - His body begins to move uncontrollably.
dialog: 
text: Spinning faster and faster like a gyroscope. The SFX get loonier
text: and loonier as he becomes...
dialog: 
text: A HUMAN TORNADO. Stanley's words are almost unintelligible as his
text: voice jumps one, two, five octaves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hellllllllppppmmmmmmmeeeeeeeee...
dialog: 
text: A HAND reaches out of the twister and locks onto the bedpost. The
text: whirlwind SCREECHES to a halt, causing sparks and smoke to rise
speaker_heading: FROM
text: the singed carpet. The smoke clears revealing...
dialog: 
text: THE MASK CREATURE
dialog: 
text: He's dressed in a snazzy zoot suit - a distortion of the paisley
text: material of Stanley's pajamas.
dialog: 
text: The head is no longer Stanley's. It's large, bald and bright
text: green. The huge bug-eyes glow with mischief. The nose is small,
text: bony and beaked.
text: The mouth and teeth are enormous and gleaming white as he breaks
text: into a learning grin.
dialog: 
text: The overall effect is devilishly loony, but not altogether
text: unhuman. In fact, there's something downright charming about him.
dialog: 
text: The Mask checks himself out in the mirror and likes what he sees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE MASK
dialog: S-s-s-nazzy!
dialog: 
text: He SNAPS his bow tie with a crazy gleam in his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE MASK (CONT.)
dialog: It's party time!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Trying to ber VERY, VERY quiet, the Mask tiptoes down the
text: darkened corridor. The floor makes a barely audible CREEEEK as
dialog: the Mask steps
text: with exaggerated care pst APARTMENT "A" with it's little "Quiet
text: Please" sign. He raises a finger to his lip, making the "SHUSH"
dialog: sign.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly - and unexplicably - a ringing ALARM CLOCK leaps out of
text: Stanley/Mask's pocket and starts jittering down the hall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY/MASK
dialog: O, jeepers--!
dialog: 
text: Stanley/Mask tries to snag the clock, but it bounces away every
text: time. Frustrated, he pulls a full sized SLEDGEHAMMER from his
dialog: pocket and
text: starts POUNDING the floor in an effort to stop the clock.
text: Glancing blows shatter the clock face and most of the works, but
dialog: those bells just keep
dialog: ringing.
dialog: 
text: The hammer, of course, slams craters the size of manhole covers
text: into the floor and reverberates through the building like
text: THUNDERBOLTS.
dialog: 
text: The door bursts open and Mrs. Peenman's angry face pops out
text: covered in blue mud pack and framed in curlers. She gets one look
dialog: at the Mask
text: with his oversized carnival mallet raised over his head and
text: SCREAMS bloody murder.
dialog: 
text: The Mask SCREAMS in response, his eyes bugging out on stalks and
text: his mouth expanding to the size of a tuba in mock horror.
dialog: 
text: Mrs. Peenman's door SLAMS shut and reopens a beat later as she
text: appears cocking an enormous shotgun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: Easy lady! I was just killin'
dialog: time!
dialog: 
text: The Mask starts ricocheting off the walls HOOTING maniacal
text: laughter as Mrs. Peenman lets loose with both barrels. KA-BOOM.
dialog: 
text: The Mask bounces off walls as Mrs. Peenman continues to blast
text: away, and finally leaps straight out the window. KEE-RASH.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sending his body SAILING our through the air towards the street
dialog: seven stories below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY/MASK
speaker_heading: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: SPLAT. Stanley/Mask lands face up in the middle of the street. He
text: slow... painfully starts to rise as a STREET CLEANING machine
dialog: turns a
text: corner and RUNS DIRECTLY OVER HIM. The machine disappears down
text: the street as we HOLD on Stanley/Mask's flattened body.
dialog: 
text: He raises one arm, grabs himself by the head and peels himself
text: off the street. He shakes himself out with one sharp CRACK and
dialog: straightens his
text: zoot suit. He's shocked to find a tiny SPOT on his sleeve.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY/MASK
dialog: Hey! You missed a spot!
dialog: 
text: As if on cue, a SECOND street cleaning machine SLAMS into him and
text: RUNS OVER HIM AGAIN. This time he reinflates himself back into 3-
speaker_heading: D
text: by blowing into his thumb and hops up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY/MASK
dialog: And next time, no starch!
dialog: 
text: Fully recovered, Stanley/Mask starts down the street, strutting
text: like a prize fighter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Hey mister...
dialog: 
text: Death's Head punker #1 hops down from his fire esscape behind the
dialog: Mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEATH'S HEAD #1
dialog: (grins evilly)
dialog: ...You got the time?
dialog: 
text: The Mask turns to see he is surrounded by the Death's Head
text: punkers. He seems to be delighted by their presence, but now that
dialog: they see his
dialog: face, they're totally freaked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: (wiggles eyebrows)
dialog: Why of course, Cubbie. I got all
dialog: the time in the world!
dialog: 
text: He whips out his forearm (which grows large for emphasis cartoon-
text: style). It's covered with crazily spinning watches, CHIMING
dialog: cuckoo clocks
text: and sun dials.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: London, Paris, Rome, standard,
dialog: substandard and no standards at
dialog: all! And for our English friends
dialog: we have... Big Ben!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEATH'S HEAD #1
dialog: Big Ben?
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stanley/Mask KICKS a nearby street post, snapping it in half and
text: sending a large decorative street clock PLUMMETING into the
dialog: sidewalk.
text: KA-BONG! It completely obliterates Death's Head #1. The other
text: gang members jump back in shock as the Mask races around the
dialog: corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEATH'S HEAD #2
dialog: Get him!
dialog: 
text: The Death's Heads pull out nasty homemade weapons and race around
text: the corner into the alleyway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALLEY
dialog: 
text: They come to a screeching halt as they discover Stanley/Mask
text: dressed as a carnival barker. Multicolored lights and Calliope
dialog: music come from
text: out of nowhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: And for my next trick...
dialog: 
text: Long pink and blue balloons appear in Stanley/Mask's hands and he
text: instantly goes into a frenzy of twisting and knotting them into
speaker_heading: AN
scene_heading: elaborate balloon sculpture. SQUEAK. SQUEAK. SCREECH.
dialog: 
text: The Death's Heads are too stunned by the severe weirdness of all
dialog: this to do anything but stand there and stare. (These guys were
dialog: no rocket
dialog: scientists in the first place.)
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
dialog: And viola! We have a giraffe!
dialog: 
text: Sure enough, he's created a first rate balloon sculpture. He
text: hands it to the biggest, dumbest Death's Head, who grins like a
dialog: little kid upon
dialog: receiving it.
dialog: 
text: The Mask instantly goes into another flurry of motion, sculpting
text: more balloons. SCREECH POP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
text: A few more twists of the wrist
dialog: and for you, Cubbie.
dialog: 
text: He hands this next prize to Death's Head #3.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
dialog: A French poodle! And finally my
dialog: favorite...
dialog: 
text: He goes into another flurry of motion.
dialog: 
scene_heading: E.C.U. - BALLOON
dialog: 
text: As the Mask pulls the ends of the knotted balloon, it straightens
text: out and MORPHS into...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
dialog: A Tommy gun!
dialog: 
text: A real one! He immediately sprays the Death's Heads with hot
dialog: lead. RATATATATATAT!
dialog: 
text: The greasy punkers dive for cover and scramble out of the alley
text: under a hail of bullets.
dialog: 
text: Stanley/Mask tosses the gun aside, intoxicated with his newfound
dialog: powers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
dialog: Wait a minute. This is
dialog: incredible! Why, with these
dialog: powers I could be a superhero!
dialog: I could fight crime... Work for

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Burt and Irv, both woozy from drink, attempt to finish a card
text: game. A dozen empty beer bottles and two half eaten chili dogs
text: adorn the table.
dialog: 
text: Irv takes a big bite of his chili dog and pauses to regard it
dialog: like a true connoisseur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Now these are serious chili dogs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: I know. Here's the proof...
text: (lets out a long BUUURP)
dialog: Aaah. Even tastier the second
dialog: time around.
dialog: 
text: Irv leans forward and sticks out his index finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Hey Burt, pull on my finger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: No way, man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: No, really. Go ahead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Irv, don't...
dialog: 
text: Irv raises a leg anyway and rips off a nasty fart. BRAAAP!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
speaker_heading: (PROUDLY)
dialog: That, my friend is the sweet smell
dialog: of success.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
speaker_heading: (SHRUGS)
dialog: No style. I give it a five tops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Okay, how about... Soprano.
dialog: 
text: Irv shifts his weight and hits an amazing high note. PWEEEEEP!
text: Burt is impressed in spite of himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT
dialog: Fine muscle control.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: And now for my grand finale,
dialog: THX... The audience is listening!
dialog: 
text: Irv lets one loose in perfect sensurround.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the front door EXPLODES inward. Stanley/Mask stands
text: there SILHOUETTED like a gunfighter from a Clint Eastwood movie.
dialog: 
text: Irv squints into the light, unable to make out the mysterious
dialog: figure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Hey, 40 watt... we're closed!
dialog: Nobody's here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: Ah... but you're here.
dialog: 
text: Irv rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: What I mean is...
dialog: 
text: He lets loose a sneaker to help make his point. POOOOT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IRV
dialog: Nobody's here that wants to
dialog: help you.
dialog: 
text: Stanley/Mask now steps into the light.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: But I'm here to help you.
dialog: 
text: Burt and Irv's eyes go wide as they get a better look at their
text: nemesis. Fear loosens Irv's sphincter and a last feeble bit of
text: gas escapes with a
speaker_heading: FWEEP!
dialog: 
text: Stanley/Mask whirls about with a flourish and pulls two gleaming
text: mufflers from the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: Sounds like you have a little
dialog: exhaust problem there!
dialog: 
text: There's a mad gleam in his eyes as he spins the mufflers like two
text: huge pistols and SNAPS them to a halt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
dialog: We better do a few touch ups
dialog: before you have some serious
dialog: trouble.
dialog: 
text: The Mask TWIRLS out of frame like a human tornado.
dialog: 
text: Camera PUSHES IN past Burt and Irv's shocked expressions into an
text: E.C.U. of the garage's bare light bulb as it JIGGLES on its wire.
text: We can't see the mayhem, but we can hear wacky/bizarre sound F.X.
text: as the Mask whirls about the garage. WHIZ! SCREECH! BANG! AHOOGA!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BURT AND IRV
dialog: No!... Wait! Eeeeeyaah!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
dialog:

dialog: window...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Stanley slowly awakens. He grabs his head and moans, looking and
text: feeling completely hung over. Then suddenly he remembers - and
speaker_heading: JUMPS
text: out of bed with a start.
dialog: 
text: He looks in the mirror, touching his face. It's the same old
text: Stanley. He looks at his paisley PJ's. Same old PJ's.
dialog: 
text: He picks up the mask. Same old mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: A dream... It was only a dream.
dialog: 
text: Stanley starts to relax. There's a KNOCK at the door.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAWN
dialog: 
text: Stanley's greeted by LT. KELLAWAY (50). This hound-dog of a cop
text: can't help but stare at Stanley's garish pajamas.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Nice PJ's pal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: You're Ipkiss? Stanley Ipkiss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
text: Some kind of prowler broke in and
text: attacked Mrs. Peenman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: (swallows hard)
dialog: Really? I didn't hear a thing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Then you must be a pretty sound
dialog: sleeper, Ipkiss 'cause she
dialog: unloaded a couple rounds of 20
dialog: ott buckshot five feet from your
dialog: door.
dialog: 
text: Kellaway swings Stanley's door open wider to give him a better
text: view of the damage. Mrs. Peenman stands there in the hall
text: tearfully speaking to
speaker_heading: anither OFFICER.
dialog: 
text: Stanley is flabbergasted to see:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUICK CUTS
dialog: 
text: C.U. - The shotgun blasts in the walls.
dialog: 
text: C.U. - The pot holes left from the mallet.
dialog: 
text: C.U. - The shattered remains of the wacky alarm clock.
dialog: 
dialog: All flashbacks from last night!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
speaker_heading: (GASPS)
dialog: That's... impossible!
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Excuse me?
dialog: 
text: Stanley quickly pulls himself together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: That's... a, possible. See, I
dialog: have this inner ear problem.
text: (wiggles a finger in his ear vigorously)
dialog: Sometimes I can't hear a thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
speaker_heading: (SKEPTICAL)
dialog: Is that a fact?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Kellaway leans closer to speak more loudly, but catches himself
text: and shoots Stanley a dirty look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Forget it.
dialog: 
text: He hands Stanley his card.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY (CONT.)
dialog: Here. You remember anything
dialog: unusual about last night, anything
dialog: at all, call me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Sure... thanks.
dialog: 
text: Stanley SLAMS the door and throws his body against it, his heart
text: pounding in his chest. Milo gives him that curious
text: dog-head-cocked-sideways look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Milo, it was real! How could it
dialog: all be... real?
dialog: 
text: Stanley suddenly notices the clock on the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Oh my god. I'm late!
dialog: 
text: He races into the bedroom.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
dialog: 
text: Kellaway is taking notes as patiently as he can from Mrs.
dialog: Peenman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Look, Mrs. Peenman, you gotta
dialog: admit your description is pretty
dialog: tough to swallow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. PEENMAN
dialog: Then you can choke on it for all
dialog: I care. I saw what I saw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Right.
dialog: (refers to notes)
text: A green head the size of a
text: pumpkin, purple zoot suit and
dialog: spats. That's a pretty serious
dialog: fashion risk for any
dialog: self-respecting second story man.
dialog: 
text: An OFFICER now hurries up the steps all out of breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Lt., we just got an emergency call
text: from a mechanic on 67th Street.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: Some kind of assault and battery.
dialog: Sound pretty bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
speaker_heading: (SIGHS)
dialog: Alright. Dont' worry Mrs.
dialog: Peenman, we'll find this guy for
dialog: you. Officer Deluca here has a

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT
dialog:

text: anywhere. He finishes tying his tie as he searches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Milo! Keys! Keys!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Milo's ears prick. He leaps up and immediately starts sniffing
text: around. He pulls a cushion off the sofa and emerges with the keys
dialog: just as Stanley
text: comes out, briefcaase in hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Good boy.
dialog: 
text: He pets his dog, takes his keys and starts out the door... but he
text: pauses to take a last look at the mask... It's eerie black eye
dialog: holes and devilish
text: grin seem to mock him.
dialog: 
text: On sudden impulse, he grabs it, hurls it out the balcony's

dialog: 
scene_heading: SLOW-MO - THE MASK
dialog: 
text: Sailing end over end through the air.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING
dialog: 
text: As the mask flies out into the sir, a sudden wind kicks up.

dialog: to glow

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING - DAY

text: Letters have been sprayed out to read "Rip Off!"
dialog: 
text: Several REPORTERS and curious ONLOOKERS stand nearby as Kellaway
text: and his men take it all in. PARAMEDICS appear wheeling Burt and
text: Irv out of the building on two gurneys.
dialog: 
text: They're both in severe discomfort and look more like cars than
text: men: Bodies spray painted metallic colors, hood ornaments glued
dialog: to their

text: mufflers sticking out of their rear ends.
dialog: 
text: They wince in pain at each tiny bump of the gurney.

speaker_heading: PEGGY
text: It looks like some kind of mob
dialog: scare tactic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: I said no comment. Now break it
text: up. This is a crime scene.
dialog: 
text: As the officers disperse the reporters and other onlookers, Peggy

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MECHANIC'S OFFICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The empty garage has been turned into a topsy-turvy nightmare.

speaker_heading: SIFTING
text: through some papers scattered all over the floor. Nothing.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: What happened to you last night?
dialog: The girls and I were looking all

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: How was the club?

speaker_heading: DICKEY

dialog: dollar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You don't know that. She's an

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Yeah. She can sense a guy's

speaker_heading: PEGGY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You're Mr. Nice Guy? Stanley do

dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Are you serious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Of course. DO you know how hard
dialog: it is to find a decent man in this

dialog: is some kind of wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Why are you covering this story?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: They cut my salary. I just can't
dialog: make it by on "Dear Peggy"
dialog: anymore. The truth is, I want
dialog: to be a real reporter and if I
dialog: can break this story I know
dialog: they'll let me.
dialog: (sits closer)
dialog: Look Stanley, I know Ripley Auto
dialog: is a crooked operation. They may
dialog: even have had ties to the Mob.
dialog: I'm not out to get you. I just

scene_heading: INT. DORIAN'S OFFICE

speaker_heading: DORIAN
text: Good afternoon, Councilman Snell.

speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: I got a little job for you, Tom.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNELL
dialog: That's impossible. He was

speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Pull a few strings. Find

dialog: it. You owe me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SNELL
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLES)
dialog: I owe you nothing, you little

dialog: 
text: Dorian suddenly EXPLODES, overturning his desk and sending Snell
text: tumbling backwards. In less than a heartbeat, he grabs Snell by
dialog: his shirt
text: ffront, SLAMS him up against the wall, SMASHES a whiskey bottle
text: and presses the jagged edge to his throat.
dialog: 
text: Snell hangs there whimpering. Dorian has a crazed look in his

speaker_heading: DORIAN
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Hey, are you okay.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
speaker_heading: (SWOONS)
dialog: Oh, Stanley!

speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Milo, down.
dialog: 
text: He pushes Milo away, tosses back the covers and rises out of bed.
text: It's still the dead of night and Stanley is all in a huff from

dialog: 
text: He spots Tina's clipping on his dresser mirror and rips it off,

speaker_heading: THE MASK

text: POUNDING beat of the Mask F.X. theme.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: stands transfixed, staring at the moonlit face. He can almost

speaker_heading: STANLEY
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Stanley is a driven man as he makes his way out onto the narrow

dialog: and climbs out
text: over the ledge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE LEDGE
dialog: 
text: Stanley wavers precariously on the crumbling masonry, then

speaker_heading: STANLEY

scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM

speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
dialog: S-s-s-mokin! Now let's see...

speaker_heading: MASK (CONT.)
dialog: What? Seems to be a minor cash

speaker_heading: DANCE FLOOR
dialog: 
text: The dance's grand finale. The Mask spins Tina around and around
text: his body like a baton in one of those awful Hawaiian fire dances.
dialog: 
text: As the band bangs out the final bars of the tune, the Mask
text: SCREECHES Tina to a halt, bends her over backwards and nails her
dialog: with a Valentino
text: kiss that literally blows her shoes off; SSSMACK! KAPOW!
dialog: 
text: She hangs onto the Mask's tie for support when BANG the tie is
text: shot in half. Tina falls on her cute behind.

dialog: tell me where my money is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE MASK
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 
text: The Mask immediately whips out an old fashioned pull handle
text: calculator, snaps on a green visor and starts tabulating. KA-
speaker_heading: CHING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE MASK (CONT.)
dialog: (fast talking)

dialog: 
text: Eddy pulls out his .38 and starts blasting BLAM. BLAM.
dialog: 
text: The Mask dodges the bullets by contorting his cartoon-flexible
dialog: body.
dialog: 
text: BLAM. The Mask SPINS once and freezes in a pirouette, now dressed
text: in a tutu.
dialog: 
text: BLAM. The Mask SPINS again and stops dressed as a matador, the
text: bullet whizzes under his cape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLAM BLAM BLAM
dialog: 
text: A hockey goalie bats the bullet away.
dialog: 
text: A Russian Dancer leaps over the shot.
dialog: 
text: A Cowboy DING! takes the hit.
dialog: 
text: The Mask staggers back... the forwards in a classic Western death
text: scene. He throws an arm around Sweet Eddy for support.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MASK
dialog: Ak... you got me Pahdnuh.
dialog: (cough... cough)
dialog:

speaker_heading: (COUGH)

dialog: Tell Tint Tim I won't be makin'

speaker_heading: (COUGH)
dialog: Tell Scarlet I do give a damn...
dialog: I... I... UUG!
dialog: 
text: And the Mask gives up the ghost, his pink tongue flops out the
text: side of his mouth. Eddy bursts into tears.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly a huge cartoon AUDIENCE pops up silhouetted in the
text: foreground, applauding wildly. An off-camera ARM shoots into
dialog: frame handing
dialog: the Mask an Oscar.
dialog: 
text: The Mask leaps to his feet and starts taking bows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE MASK (CONT.)
dialog: Thank you! You love me! You

dialog: 
text: Dorian pulls out his own .45 and opens fire.
dialog: 
text: The Mask starts HOOTING laughter and ricochets off the dance
dialog: floor.
dialog: 
text: Dorian gives chase, but suddenly the nightclub doors are KICKED

speaker_heading: THEIR
text: guns drawn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Drop it, Tyrel!
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Hello, Kellaway. You got a
dialog: warrant or did you just drop by
dialog: for a night cap?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: I got probable cause. A couple

speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Easy, junior. You're givin' me

speaker_heading: KELLWAY
dialog: One of them was wearin' some kind
text: of big green mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: For once you're on the right
dialog: track, but that's not one of my
dialog: men. Maybe you ought to try a
dialog: little actual police work instead
dialog: of this harassment bullshit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: This isn't harassment. You want
dialog: to see some harassment?
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: Search the place, boys.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Well what d'ya know? I guess they

dialog: 
text: Dorian shakes it off and glares at him.

speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: (cuffs him)
dialog: Better call that high-priced

dialog: comin' downtown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: I'll be back on the streets before
dialog: sunrise and you know it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Then just think of this as the
dialog: city's way of showing you a little
dialog: hospitality.
dialog: (pats him on the cheek)

dialog: 
text: As the police drag Dorian outside, Kellaway notices someting on

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSER
dialog: 
text: Kellaway picks up the slice of pajama fabric that was once the
text: Mask's tie and inspects it closely... It's the same fabric
dialog: Kellaway saw Stalney
dialog: wearing that morning.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB
dialog: 
text: Kellaway exits and walks right past the poster of Tina. Flattened
text: into the poster, with his arm around her, is a cartoon of the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: You're on your own, boys.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Don't worry, Lt. If he's in

dialog: 
text: Kellaway slips the pajamas fabric in his pocket.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: And if he's not, I got a
dialog: feeling I know where to find him.
dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
dialog: Police. Open up.
dialog: 
text: Stanley runs to the closet to hide the Mask. The instant he opens

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Oh my god!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LT. KELLAWAY (O.S.)
dialog: Ipkiss! I know you're in there.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: All right, I'm coming!
dialog: 
text: Stanley tosses the Mask and the Frisbee into the closet and SLAMS

dialog: 
text: He hurries to the door and opens it, an easy smile on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Lieutenant, what a surprise! What

dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: You can answer a few questions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I've got to get ready for work.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Trust me. Your bank's opening
dialog: late today.
dialog:

text: scratching at the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
dialog: Where were you last night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Here... mostly. Is something
dialog: wrong?
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Maybe, yes. Maybe, no. Maybe
dialog: it's all just a crazy coincidence
dialog: that this so called "Mask"
dialog: character always seems to be
dialog: wherever you are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Mask -- who?
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Don't insult my intelligence,
text: Ipkiss. First, he's spotted in
dialog: your building, then the bank where
dialog: you work and now I find this at
dialog: the Monkey's Paw.
dialog: 
text: He displays the TORN PIECE OF FABRIC. It matches the piece
text: missing in Stanley's pajamas. Stanley wilts.
dialog: 
text: Milo YAPS and leaps up, trying to open the closet door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Milo. No!
dialog: (moves the dog away)
dialog: Okay, so I went out on the town
dialog: last night. A guy's got to have

scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: In your jammies?
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Naw, I just took 'em with me in
dialog: case I didn't make it home. I
dialog: don't know about you, Lieutenant.
dialog: But I've got a pretty good track

dialog:

scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Wait a second... you smell that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
speaker_heading: (SNIFFS)
dialog: Bullshit. I hate the smell of
dialog: bullshit. Don't even think about
dialog: leaving town, Ipkiss. I'll be
dialog: in touch.

speaker_heading: TINA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Well, there must be plenty of

dialog: Maybe even get a record deal...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I wish it was that easy. There's
dialog: thousands of girls out there just
dialog: like me who...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Not just like you. You've got

speaker_heading: TINA

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Really? They say he's pretty

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yeah. If you hear anything about

speaker_heading: TINA

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Oh yeah. To tell you the truth,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I'll say. Do you think you could

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I suppose so.

speaker_heading: TINA

speaker_heading: STANLEY

dialog: kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: My pleasure, Swede. It's been
dialog: too long. I was worried you were
dialog: still pissed about that little
dialog: thing with Harry the Hat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE
dialog: That? It was nothing. He was
dialog: a pain in my ass anyway. Here,
dialog: sit down, sit down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Congratulations on the new casino.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE
dialog: Thanks, but it might be a little
text: early to celebrate. As a
dialog: matter of fact that's why I asked
dialog: you to stop by.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE
dialog: Here... have a little something
dialog: to eat. That's Svenska meatballs,
dialog: kid. The real thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: Dorian starts to eat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE
dialog: So, I tell you Dorian, it's a
dialog: terrible shame. I put all my hard
dialog: work into this beautiful casino
dialog: and what do you think? All the
dialog: sudden I got all kinda problems
dialog: with the city. Big problems.
dialog: The whole deal could fold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Maybe I can help you out. I'm
dialog: expecting to come into a little
dialog: investment capital shortly. If
dialog: worse comes to worse and you
dialog: really need to bail out...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE
dialog: What a sweet guy. Isn't this guy
dialog: a sweetheart? Thanks for the
dialog: offer Dorian, but I think maybe
dialog: I can solve this myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Is that right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE
dialog: That's right. You know that
dialog: Councilman you got in your pocket?
dialog: 
text: Dorian freezes with a forkful of meatballs halfway to his mouth.
text: He notices a PINK CARNATION squashed into the gravy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE (CONT.)
dialog: Well now you've got 'im in your
dialog: mouth. How you like that?
dialog: 
text: The Swede and his men have a good laugh as Dorian spits out his
text: meatball. The Swede pulls a gun and jams it under Dorian's chin.
dialog: 
text: Sweet Eddy goes for his gun, but one of the Swede's men pops up,
text: jamming a barrel to his temple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE (CONT.)
dialog: (to Dorian)
dialog: Now listen close scumbag! You
dialog: want to bw in business with me?
dialog: Okay, we're partners now. I'm
dialog: takin' fifty per cent off the
dialog: Monkey's Paw. You screw with me
dialog: again and I'll send you straight
dialog: down to Hell with your scumbag
dialog: councilman. You can apologize
dialog: for eatin' him for lunch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Sure, Swede. Take it easy.

speaker_heading: SWEDE

dialog: (his face TWITCHES)

speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN

speaker_heading: STANELY

speaker_heading: STANELY (CONT.)
dialog: It's this thing!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: (takes the mask)
dialog: Very interesting... looks like

dialog: Scandinavian. Where did you get
dialog: this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: (snatches it back)
dialog: I found it... or it found me.
dialog: I'm not sure. The problem is it's
dialog: ruining my life!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: So you believe this actually

speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: Mr. Ipkiss, please. This is just

dialog: have here is nothing more than
text: a piece of wood.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANELY
dialog: But your book says masks...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: My book uses masks as a metaphor
dialog: for our complex personalities.
dialog: The masks we must present to the
dialog: outside world... to suppress the
dialog: id. To protect our innermost
dialog: desires.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANELY
dialog: Yeah, well this one works in
dialog: reverse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: You're going to have to be willing
dialog: to work on this delusion or...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: It's not a delusion! Alright,
dialog: I'll prove it to you if I have
dialog: to, but I won't be responsible
dialog: for the consequences.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: Mr. Ipkiss please! There is no

speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN

dialog: Whooooooooaaaaa...
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: Whoa, what?
dialog: 
text: Stanley just stands there like an idiot. Nothing happened. He
text: tries it again. Same result.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: It didn't work?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: Does that surprise you? The mask
dialog: is nothing but a reflection of
dialog: you - the inner you.
dialog: 
text: Stanley isn't listening. He's thinking out load.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: It worked last night. And the
dialog: night before. Maybe it only works
dialog: at night... What kind of mask
dialog: did you say this was.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
text: Scandinavian. It looks like a
dialog: representation of Loki, the Norse
dialog: God of Mischief. He supposedly
dialog: caused so much trouble that Odin
dialog: banished him from Valhalla
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
speaker_heading: (GASPS)
dialog: What if he banished him... into

speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: Your date?

speaker_heading: STANLEY

dialog: 
text: Dr. Neuman puts an arm around Stanley and leads him to the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DR. NEUMAN
dialog: Mr. Ipkiss, please. Haven't you

dialog: been saying? Go as yourself.
dialog: And as the Mask.

scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: That's nice.

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Wow. They really do. All those
text: pinks and greens.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Well... I'm sure my cousin will
dialog: be along any minute. He never

dialog: that way.
speaker_heading: (RISES)
dialog: I guess I'll get going.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: No, Stanley. Stay for a second.
dialog: I was thinking about what you said
dialog: and I, uh, I want you to know I
dialog: appreciate it. Maybe you're
dialog: right. If I believed in myself
dialog: a little more I wouldn't rely on
dialog: guys like Dorian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Dorian... You mean Dorian Tyrel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Yeah. He's sort of my manager.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Tina, you've got to be careful
dialog: of that guy. He's a dangerous

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You really mean that, don't you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Absolutely. You ought to hear
dialog: the stories...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: No, I mean, you're really worried

dialog: Stanley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: C'mon, Tina this is serious. How
dialog: involved are you with this guy?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I can take care of myself,

speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Look, this may sound a little cold
dialog: but I do what I have to do to get

dialog: without Dorian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: And who are you with him Tina?
dialog: I'm not exactly sure who I am

dialog: to find out. If you really had
dialog: any faith in yourself, you
dialog: wouldn't be hanging on to some

dialog: 
text: The Mask leaps out from behind a stand of trees in all his glory

speaker_heading: THE MASK (CONT.)
dialog: Let me get that for you!

speaker_heading: KELLAWAY

speaker_heading: STANLEY/MASK

dialog: 
text: Kellaway shoots him a dirty look.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY/MASK

scene_heading: EXT. STONE WALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Kellaway leaps/tumbles down from the wall into some bushes and

text: friggin' SWAT team - they're ALL in the street, dancing with this
dialog: crazy maniac!
dialog: 
text: Stanley/Mask sidles up to a heavily armed female SWAT officer,
dialog: "dirty dancing" her across the street -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY/MASK
dialog: The senoritas they sing, and how
dialog: they sling their sombreros --!
dialog: (It's very nice! So full of
speaker_heading: SPIIIIICE--)
dialog: (dip!)
dialog: And when they're dancing they

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: You go out there and I'll blow
dialog: your brains out!
dialog: 
text: Furious, Kellaway yanks open the door of an abandoned squad car,
text: pulls out a tear gas gun and fires into the air. The sharp REPORT
speaker_heading: AND
text: stinging gas seems to break the spell of THE MASK. The music

speaker_heading: CHORUS
text: line, looking confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LT. KELLAWAY (CONT.)
dialog: Goddamn it! Arrest that thing!

dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE MASK
dialog: 
text: bumps into an OLD LADY who SCREAMS at his hideousness.
dialog: 
text: The Mask realizes how obvious he is. He turns away and brings his
text: arms to his head. There's a RIPPPING sound. And when he turns
dialog: around,
text: the Mask has now transformed back into...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: Carrying the mask, Stanley tries to blend in with the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: 
text: followed by a handfull of officers bears down on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Halt! Halt or we'll shoot!
dialog: 
text: Stanley quickly cuts down...
dialog: 
scene_heading: A NARROW ALLEY
dialog: 
text: Stanley races down the lane - cops hot on his trail. Bullets
text: EXPLODE all around him. Just as he reaches the next street...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A CAR
dialog: 
text: screeches to a halt - almost running Stanley over. The window
text: rolls down revealing...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY BRANDT
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Stanley! Get in!
dialog: 
text: Stanley jumps into the passenger seat.

scene_heading: INT. PEGGY'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Someplace where we'll be safe.

scene_heading: EXT. DAILY TRIBUNE BUILDING - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The streets are empty.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NEWS SHIPPING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Stanley and Peggy sit on stacks of bound newspapers in the vast
text: shadowy shipping room. In the b.g., a huge machine spews out
dialog: hundreds of
text: newspapers on an assembly line. Everything's mechanized:
text: printing, folding, wrapping.
dialog: 
text: Peggy hands Stanley a cup of coffee. He's a complete wreck,
text: clothes disheveled, rings under his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: I saw it. I saw the whole thing.
dialog: What's happening to you, Stanley?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: It's crazy... I've lost all
dialog: control. When I put on this mask
dialog: I can do anything... be anything,
dialog: but it's ruining my life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Stanley, I don't know what's
dialog: happening to you, but I do know
dialog: this. That letter you sent my
dialog: column was from a guy with more
dialog: guts and heart than any of the
dialog: creeps I've met in Edge City.
dialog: Whatever this mask is, you don't
dialog: need it. You... Stanley Ipkiss,
dialog: are already all you ever need to
dialog: be.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Gosh, Peggy. Do you really mean
dialog: that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
speaker_heading: (PAUSES)
dialog: Actually... no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: We now hear a door open and footsteps.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
speaker_heading: (RISES)
dialog: What took you guys so long? I've
dialog: been vamping here for twenty
dialog: minutes.
dialog: 
text: Dorian and three of his men stand there with their guns trained
dialog: on Stanley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: This is him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: You have the fifty thou?
dialog: 
text: Sweet Eddy FLICKS open a briefcase lined with cash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY (CONT.)
text: Right. When he puts on the mask
dialog: he becomes that green thingamajig.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: (still dumbfounded)
dialog: Peggy, what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Sorry, Stanley. You really are
dialog: a great guy, but I just can't lose
dialog: my condo. You know how hard it
dialog: is to find an apartment in this
dialog: city.
dialog: 
text: Sweet Eddy and a second thug grab Stanley and hang him over the
text: steel maw of the whirring news press.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Okay Ipkiss. Where's the money
dialog: from the heist?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: My aparment. It's in my
dialog: apartment!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Thanks. Now I believe you have

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Hey, you said you wouldn't hurt
dialog: him!
dialog: 
text: Dorian toys with the wooden mask, enjoying his control over the
dialog: situation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: You're right. Easy boys. One
dialog: thing at a time. Tell me about
dialog: this mask, Ipkiss. How does it
dialog: work?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I don't know... You just put it
dialog: on!
dialog: 
text: The Mask FX theme builds, Dorian raises the mask to his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET EDDY
dialog: Better be careful, boss.
dialog: 
text: With a CRACK of thunder a whirlwind of light and power swirls
text: around Dorian's figure. Unlike Stanley's transformation, Dorian's
dialog: is much more
text: diabolical. He grows and changes within a nimbus of ROARING
text: light. Finally the light dies away and Dorian/Mask rises from a
dialog: circle of swirling
dialog: smoke.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: C.U. DORIAN/MASK
dialog: 
text: While Stanley was a zoot suited bee-bopper in hyper-drive,
text: Dorian/Mask is more like a hulking evil GENIE, fresh out of the
text: lamp and pissed at
text: the world. His diamond earring and touches of his neuvo-gangster
text: look is still apparent, but his huge grin stretches out like a
speaker_heading: TYRANNOSAURUS
text: Rex's under eyes that glow green with wicked power. His voice is
text: a deep inhuman RUMBLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: What a rush.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET EDDY
dialog: Whoa, boss... are you okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: I'm better than ever, you idiot.
dialog: Now stop the presses. There'll
dialog: be a new headline tonight.
dialog: 
text: Sweet Eddy stands there looking disappointed with Ipkiss still
text: held dangling above the churning presses.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET EDDY
dialog: But what about him?
dialog: 
text: Dorian/Mask wheels about and ROARS at Sweet Eddy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: DO AS I SAY! I have other plans
dialog: for Ipkiss. Everything's become
dialog: so clear to me now!
dialog: 
text: Peggy sheepishly reaches for the suitcase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Ah... excuse me. If you don't
dialog: mind, I'll just take my money and
dialog: be going. You guys make
dialog: yourselves at home.
dialog: 
text: Dorian/Mask slides up to Peggy threateningly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Must you go? What a shame. You
dialog: and I could make beautiful
text: headlines together.
dialog: 
text: Peggy removes his arm from her shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Thanks, anyway. That wasn't part
dialog: of the deal.
dialog: 
text: Peggy snatches the briefcase, but Dorian/Mask blocks her exit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Of course. You only want what's
dialog: coming to you, don't you?
dialog: 
text: Peggy whips out a snub-nose .38 out from beneath her coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PEGGY
dialog: Back off Freakazoid. I wasn't
dialog: born yesterday.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Ah... But you might die today!
dialog: 
text: Dorian throws the switch and the presses CHURN to life. In a
text: flash he snatches Peggy off her feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
dialog: A girl like you deserves
dialog: to have her face plastered all
text: over page one.
dialog: 
text: He tosses her into the grinding mill of steel and paper.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as Peggy's feet disappear between the presses'
text: huge rollers and continues down, down past the whirling gears and
text: hydraulics to finally ENDFRAME on the chute where the newspapers
text: roll out on a conveyor belt.
dialog: 
text: Headlines in blood red ink now read: "Reporter Killed in Freak
text: Accident" next to a picture of a slightly flattened-looking
text: Peggy, her mouth open
text: in a silent scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET EDDY
dialog: What do we do with Ipkiss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: The police are looking for the
dialog: Mask. We shall give them the
dialog: Mask. And Eddy...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET EDDY
dialog: Yeah, Dorian?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Get the boys ready. The Swedes'
dialog: expecting us at the casino opening
dialog: tomorrow night. We wouldn't want
dialog: to disappoint him, would we?
dialog: 
text: Dorian/Mask throws his head back and lets loose a deep BOOMING
text: LAUGH. It's unnerving even to Eddy, but he laughs nervously in
speaker_heading: RESPONSE
text: and elbows the other thugs to join in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The door is kicked open and two of Dorian's henchmen burst into
text: the room. Milo leaps off the couch and scrables behind the
dialog: curtains. They
text: yank open the closet door and start scooping the cash into
text: plastic garbage bags.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CAR
dialog: 
text: Stanley lies in the back seat, gagged, bound hand and foot and
text: half hidden under a blanket. A thug in the driver's seat pokes
dialog: his .45 under
text: Stanley's nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: That money better be where you
dialog: said it was, Ipkiss or you can
dialog: Ipkiss your ass goodbye.
dialog: 
text: He chuckles at his own little joke.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT
dialog: 
text: Milo peeks out from behind the curtain as the henchmen finish
text: their job. He ducks behind the curtain and looks out the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILO'S P.O.V.
dialog: 
text: of the henchmen's car. Stanley can barely be seen peeking out the
text: car window. The henchmen pushes him back down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: 
text: His ears perk up. The boss is in trouble! He checks back outside
dialog: the curtain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE HENCHMEN
dialog: 
text: finish up and start out the door carrying the trash bags. Milo
text: races right by them, just out of sight.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
dialog: 
text: The henchmen hop in and start the engine. As the car peels out

speaker_heading: DODGING

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: The SWAT team got an offer to open

speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: C'mon Lieutenant, it wasn't your
dialog: fault. Something will turn up.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: Sure. Stanley Ipkiss is going
dialog: to fall right into my lap...
dialog: 
text: A car SCREECHES BY. The door flies open and a BODY comes tumbling
text: out - knocking Kellaway down. He looks up at the body sitting in
speaker_heading: HIS
dialog: lap -
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: ...Ipkiss!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I can explain everything...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Don't bother.
dialog: 
text: Doyle pulls a GREEN RUBBER MASK out of Stanley's pocket. Kellaway
text: starts hauling him up the precinct steps.
dialog: 
scene_heading: LT. KELLAWAY
dialog: You have the right to remain
dialog: silent, you freakin' Looney Tune.
dialog: Anymore of your half-baked
dialog: wisecracks can and will be used
dialog: against you by me, personally...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You've got to listen to me!
dialog: 
text: Kellaway and Doyle drag Stanley into the precinct - just as MILO
text: charges up. But the dog is shut out of the station.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bruised, beaten and exhuasted - Stanley's thrown into a small
text: cell. The KEY-GUARD locks the cell up - then walks away.
dialog: 
text: Stanley looks around his dismal quarters. A filthy toilet. The
text: cot even worse. There's a YOWLING. He climbs up on the cot and
dialog: looks out the
text: small, barred window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY'S P.O.V.:
dialog: 
text: There's a dumpster below the window, overflowing with trash. Next
text: to the trash heap - is MILO. The dog looks up at Stanley and YIPS
dialog: happily.
text: Stanley forces a smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Go find yourself a new home, Milo.
dialog: It looks like I'm going to be here
dialog: for a long long time...
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - DAWN

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: About time you found me a
dialog: lawyer...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: ...Tina?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Hello, Stanley.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: What's wrong? Your boyfriend kick
dialog: you out for not delivering me on
dialog: schedule?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Is that what you think - that
dialog: I set you up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: I don't know. But I've got plenty
dialog: of time to figure it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You're just going to have to trust
dialog: me on this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Now is not the best time for
dialog: me on trusting women.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I ran out on Dorian last night,
dialog: Stanley. I just came to tell you
dialog: I'm sorry. Sorry about
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You ran out on him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: That magic mask of yours turned
dialog: him into some kind of monster...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: He wasn't exactly Mother Theresa
text: in the first place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
text: He's going to the casino opening
dialog: tonight and he's planning to do
dialog: something terrible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
text: A real change of pace for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Half this town will be there
dialog: Stanley. I tried to tell the
dialog: cops, but they wouldn't listen
dialog: to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: As long as he's got the mask,
dialog: there's nothing they can do to
dialog: stop him anyway. There's nothing
dialog: anyone can do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: There must be some way. How does
dialog: it work?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
speaker_heading: (PAUSES)
dialog: It's like it brings you innermost
dialog: desires to life. If deep down
dialog: inside you're a little repressed
dialog: and... a hopeless romantic, you
dialog: become sort of a love-crazy wild
dialog: man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: And if you've got a black heart?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Then the world's going to be a
dialog: very dark place. And if I were
dialog: you, I'd get out of town. Fast.
dialog: 
text: Tina takes a beat and absorbs this information.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: For what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Lots of things. For really
dialog: believing in me when I couldn't.
dialog: For sharing a sunset with me.
dialog: For being the first guy to treat
dialog: me like I was a person instead
text: of a slab of meat.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: And for being any kind of
text: romantic. Even a hopeless one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
speaker_heading: (SOFTENING)
dialog: You're welcome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You know, that night at the club

speaker_heading: TINA

speaker_heading: KEY-GUARD

speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: I've got to disappear for awhile

scene_heading: EXT. STATION - DAY
dialog:

dialog: doubles back
dialog: and heads -
dialog: 
text: INTO THE ALLEY
dialog: 
text: Behind the station. She looks over her shoulder. No one's there.
text: Tina hurries toward the next street and -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A BIG SEDAN
dialog: 
text: roars up, cutting her off. She turns and runs back the way she
text: came - but freezes when THE LIMO screeches up, blocking her.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STANLEY'S CELL - AT THE WINDOW - SAME TIME
dialog:

speaker_heading: STANLEY

speaker_heading: TINA
speaker_heading: (CHOKING)

speaker_heading: DORIAN

speaker_heading: DORIAN

scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Agitated, Stanley paces around the room. Stanley's eyes pop open.

speaker_heading: STANLEY
text: peers down the hall and sees
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE KEY GUARD
dialog: 
text: watching a TV boxing match. He's CHEWING on the leather key-chain

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: climbs up on the cot and looks out the window.

speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: (stage whisper)
dialog: Milo!
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE ALLEY - SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Just a pile of trash. The dog's gone. Then... a RUSTLE. A filthy
text: blanket moves... and MILO emerges from it - tail waggling as he
dialog: sees Stanley.
dialog: 
text: The little dog jumps up, helplessly trying to reach the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Come on, boy!
dialog: 
text: Milo gets an idea. He jumps on boxes and trash bags, using them
text: as steps. He climbs higher and higher until he's reached the top
dialog: of the
text: dumpster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Come on, Milo!
dialog: 
text: Milo jumps from the dumpster. He almost reaches the window, but
text: falls back down again into the trash heap.
dialog: 
text: The dog leaps a second time. On this jump, Stanley grabs him and
text: brings him through the bars.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

text: YELPS joyously. Stanley muzzles him and peeks -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOWN THE HALL
dialog: 
text: The Key-Guard's SNORING in his chair. The chewed leather key-
text: chain strap is still in his MOUTH. His half-eaten sausage and
dialog: cheese still lies

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: shows Milo the guard, then whispers in the dog's ear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Keys, Milo. Get the keys!
dialog: 
text: Milo cocks his head at the sound of the word KEYS. He zips out
text: through the bars.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Milo trots down the hall and approaches the key-guard's station.
text: The dog stares and sniffs at the SNORING man.

scene_heading: INT. STANLEY'S CELL - A MOMENT LATER
dialog: 
text: Milo returns, slipping back into the cell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Good boy...
dialog: 
text: He pulls the wedge of cheese out of the dog's mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: I said "keys" not "cheese"! Keys.
scene_heading: K-E-Y-S... keys!
dialog: 
text: Stanley pushes the dog back out the cell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FOLLOWING MILO
dialog: 
text: He approaches the guard and stops - staring at the keys dangling
text: from the man's mouth. Milo jumps up on the desk and bites down on
speaker_heading: THE
text: key-chain. He starts to pull when...
dialog: 
text: The guard stirs and almost wakes up. Milo freezes. A moment
text: later, the guard starts SNORING again. Milo grabs the keys and

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LIMO
dialog: 
text: The tinted glass LIGHTS UP from inside like muted fireworks as
text: Dorian's transformation begins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - C.U. - SLEEPING GUARD
dialog: 
text: CAMERA PANS from his snoring mouth down to his gun as a hand
text: carefully lifts it out of his holster.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIDER
dialog: 
text: Gun in hand, Stanley silently backs away with Milo at his side.
dialog: 
text: The Guard chokes off a snore and begins to wake up. He sees
text: Stanley's cell door standing open and goes for his gun... but
text: grasps air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: puts one hand over his eyes and slams the butt of the gun down as
text: hard as he can on the Guard's head. THONK. The Guard drops back
speaker_heading: DOWN
text: on his chair unconscious.
dialog: 
text: Stanley peeks from beneath his hand and regards his work. Not
text: bad. Milo yips happily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Come on.
dialog: 
text: Stanley turns and starts for the door when he bumps straight into
dialog: Lt. Kellaway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Ipkiss!
dialog: 
text: Stanley is shocked, but quickly realizes he's got the gun. He
text: points it at Kellaway with greater authority.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hold it! I warn you! I'm
dialog: seriously stressed out here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Easy, Ipkiss. Don't be an idiot.
dialog: You're in the middle of a police
dialog: station. There's no way you're
dialog: just going to walk out of here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
speaker_heading: (PAUSES)
dialog: You're right.
dialog: 
text: Stanley pockets Kellaway's gun while keeping him covered with the
text: Guard's gun. He pulls the handcuffs from Kellaway's belt and
dialog: begins to
text: handcuff the two of them together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Now what are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Putting myself in your custody.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: You are certifiable.
dialog: 
text: Stanley unbuttons his shirt and holds it open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Milo!
dialog: 
text: Milo immediately jumps inside and Stanley buttons up. He now
text: looks like he has a pretty nasty pot belly, but otherwise okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY (CONT.)
dialog: Okay. Now we have to hurry or
dialog: we'll miss the party.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Of course. We wouldn't want to
dialog: keep Alice and the white rabbit
dialog: waiting.
dialog: 
text: Keeping the gun jammed in Kellaway's ribs, Stanley folds his
text: jacket over his gun hand. We hear it cock beneath the jacket. KA-
speaker_heading: LATCH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Now move.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: The opening is in full swing as the limo and two sedans pull up
text: to the front doors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSER - LIMO
dialog: 
text: as the CAR HOP attempts to open the passenger door, it EXPLODES
text: off and shoots ten feet from the car taking the unfortunate Car
dialog: Hop with it.
text: Dorian/Mask steps out of swirling mists within the limo in all
text: his wicked green glory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Don't be shy, Tina. I know how
dialog: you like to make an entrance.
dialog: 
text: He pulls her out of the limo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: And I must say, that's a dress
dialog: to die for. Or should I say in?
dialog: 
text: Dorian's men scramble, hauling the C-7 out of the limo and racing
text: off into the darkness with their automatic weapons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION
dialog: 
text: Lt. Kellaway and Stanley march past POLICEMEN, FELONS and
text: CITIZENS in the front desk area looking stiff and unnatural as
dialog: hell. Doyle
text: waves hello from the coffee service as he munches on a chocolate
dialog: doughnut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: Hi Lieutenant. Where are you
dialog: taking Ipkiss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay...
dialog: ouch!
dialog: 
text: Stanley jams him in the ribs with that hidden gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE
dialog: What did you say?
dialog: 
text: Milo pokes his head up out of Stanley's shirt, but Stanley
text: instantly pushes it back down. Doyle does a double-take wondering
dialog: what's wrong
text: with this picture as they continue their stiff-legged walk out
text: the door. Doyle gives an uncertain wave with his half-eaten
dialog: doughnut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOYLE (CONT.)
dialog: ...See ya.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: CAMERA BOOMS DOWN. The casino is a true Caesar's Palace style
text: show place featuring a dragon-prowed Viking ship that's the
speaker_heading: CENTERPIECE
text: of the room. The gaming floor is packed with happy PARTY GOERS.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA ENDFRAMES on Charlie Schumacher as he snatches a drink off
text: a passing WAITRESS' tray and turns to a gorgeous Valkyrie change
text: girl whose helmet has two large horns sticking out of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hello tall, Nordic and beautiful.
dialog: One look at you and I know how
dialog: your hat feels.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Mrs. Peenman appears, pushing her way past Charlie with
text: a paper bag filled with quarters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MRS. PEENMAN
dialog: Out of my way, Buster. Mama feels
dialog: lucky tonight.
dialog: 
text: She jams a quarter in a slot machine right behind Charlie and
text: throws her weight behind the handle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE FRONT DOORS
dialog: 
text: as they suddenly EXPLODE inward, blowing Security Man off their
dialog: feet.
dialog: 
text: Dorian/Mask steps through the smoking ruin dragging Tina after
text: him. He's flanked by a half dozen of his heavily armed men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Now... let the games begin!
dialog: 
text: Armed Security pull their weapons, but are immediately blown away
text: by the thugs. The crowd is thrown into a panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT./EXT. POLICE CAR
dialog: 
text: As it tears through the streets of Edge City with its siren
text: BLARING. Kellaway sits in the rear of the car with his hands
text: cuffed behind his back.
text: Stanley's at the wheel with Milo at his side. Kellaway is livid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: Ipkiss, I'll have you locked up
dialog: for this so long sex will be safe
dialog: again!
dialog: 
text: Kellaway is thrown into the door as Stanley SCREECHES around a
dialog: corner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: The frightened crowd mills about in terror as Dorian's thugs seal
text: off the exits. They frisk down their captives for loot and
dialog: jewelry. Orlando runs
text: up to Dorian/Mask with canvas sacks filled with money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORLANDO
dialog: We scored over half a mil from
dialog: the safe!
dialog: 
text: A SECURITY GUARD now pops out from behind a mock-stone pillar and
text: opens fire on Dorian. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
dialog: 
text: Orlando dives for cover. The bullets seem to have no effect as
text: Dorian rips a Viking spear off a wall display and hurls it
text: straight across the room
dialog: with supernatural force.
dialog: 
text: The spear SKEWERS the Security Guard, sends him flying back and
text: PINS him to a slot machine which immediately rings TILT and
dialog: spills out
dialog: quarters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: You can come out now, Orlando.
dialog: I think he got the point.
dialog: 
text: Dorian hauls Tina over to the Vikin ship where his men are wiring
text: up boxes of C-7 and sticks of dynamite. He slams her up against
dialog: the prow as
text: his men lash her in place with coils of rope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Let me go you bastard!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: What's wrong darling? This is
dialog: your big production number. You
dialog: of all people know how important
text: it is to go out with a bang.
dialog: 
text: Dorian pulls his walkie talkie out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
dialog: Eddy... How goes it?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PIER - PILINGS
dialog: 
text: Sweet Eddy and two other Thugs are busy wiring explosives to the
text: pillars that support the pier the casino rests on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET EDDY
dialog: All set boss.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: Dorian plugs the timer into the nexus of all the wiring.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
text: Excellent. The real party starts
dialog: now and ends in...
dialog: (sets timer)
dialog: Thirty minutes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CASINO - PARKING LOT
dialog: 
text: Stanley SCREECHES to a halt in the cop car.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
dialog: 
text: He turns to Kellaway, brandishing his gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Okay. When I push the red button
dialog: the safety is off, right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KELLAWAY
dialog: I'm not helping you, Ipkiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Alright, suit yourself.
dialog: (to Milo)
dialog: You stay and be a good boy.
dialog: 
text: As soon as Stanley shuts the door Milo starts pawing at the
dialog: handle.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: The Swede scrambles under a crap table to escape the mayhem and
text: bumps into Mayor Tilton.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TILTON
dialog: Hey, watch it! Oh, Arnie...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the entire table is lifted away as if it were a child's
text: toy and they look up into the evil grinning of Dorian/Mask.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Swede... my dear, dear business
dialog: partner. And Mayor Tilton! What
dialog: a surprise. We have just enough
dialog: time left to play my favorite
dialog: game!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: As Stanley sneaks in an employee's door, the coast looks clear.
text: He snaps off the kitchen lights.
dialog: 
text: Stanley spots a THUG standing guard outside the kitchen's double
text: doors. He ducks back down behind a barrel and gets an idea. The
dialog: label on
text: the barrel reads "Olive Oil".
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: The Thug seems to be enjoying the mayhem when he hears an off
text: camera WHISTLE. He pulls out his .45 and cautiously enters the
dialog: kitchen to
dialog: investigate.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
dialog: 
text: The Thug enters, brandishing his gun and cautiously makes his way
text: into the kitchen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: C.U. - FOOT
dialog: 
text: He steps into a large slick of olive oil and his legs shoot right
text: out from under him. SLAM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG'S P.O.V.
dialog: 
text: as he slides across the kitchen floor at high speed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THUG
dialog: Whoaaaaa!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Stanley pops up from behind the overturned barrel with a
text: huge frying pan and slams it right into camera. CLANG.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: plucks the gun from the unconscious Guard and sneaks into the
dialog: casino.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: Stanley appears out of the kitchen doors and gets the attention
text: of the nearest captive party-goers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Pssst. You guys. Over here.
dialog: 
text: Charlie turns around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Stanley! What are you doing here?
dialog: 
text: He motions them over to the kitchen and hands Charlie the gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Start sneaking people out the
dialog: back. Watch out for the oil.
dialog: 
text: Stanley now makes his way deeper into the casino.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - POLICE CAR
dialog: 
text: Milo finally manages to pop the lock and the car door opens. He
text: scurries off towards the casino.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO
dialog: 
text: The Swede struggles desperately as he's tied to a spoke of a huge
text: wooden NUMBERS WHEEL, a kind of upright roulette wheel that's one
speaker_heading: OF
text: the casino's attractions. Mayor Tilton and two other town
text: dignitaries are tied to the other three spokes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEDE
dialog: Let me offa this thing, you
dialog: lousy scumbag!
dialog: 
text: Dorian/Mask pulls three Viking hand axes off a wall display and
text: casually begins to juggle them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: Sorry Swede. I've got an ax to
dialog: grind with you. In fact I got
dialog: a couple and I'm afraid they may
dialog: give you a splitting headache!
dialog: 
text: He nods to one of his men who gives the wheel a big spin. As the
text: captives SCREAM Dorian prepares to throw his first ax.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
dialog: Round and round she goes. Who
dialog: dies first, nobody knows!
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON THE VIKING SHIP
dialog: 
text: Stanley pops up behind the dragon-prow and starts untying Tina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Stanley!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hang on, Tina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Stanley, look out!
dialog: 
text: Stanley ducks just as a Viking ax splits the dragonhead right
text: next to him in half.
dialog: 
text: Dorian ROARS with rage as he rushes across the room to the boat.
dialog: 
text: Stanley pops back up firing his gun. BLAM. BLAM. BLAM.
dialog: 
text: Dorian takes the direct hits. He grins horridly at Stanley and he
text: extends his slimy tongue.
dialog: 
scene_heading: C.U. - TONGUE
dialog: 
text: The bullets all stand there on end in a neat little semi-circle.
dialog: 
text: Dorian now sucks in a mighty breath. Stanley grabs a Viking
text: shield and protects Tina and himself.
dialog: 
text: Dorian blows the bullets back at Stanley.
dialog: 
scene_heading: RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT.
dialog: 
text: They batter the shield. Stanley's knocked backwards from the
dialog: impact.
dialog: 
scene_heading: A HUGE GREEN CLAW
dialog: 
text: drags Stanley out and SLAMS up against the prow next to Tina. One
text: of his men immediately begins tying Stanley in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: How touching! The two love birds.
dialog: Just to show you there's no hard
dialog: feelings, I'm going to let you
dialog: spend the rest of your lives
dialog: together.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: You've got it all wrong! I could
dialog: care less about this creep.
dialog: Nobody could replace you, Dorian.
dialog: Nobody!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: If you think a line like that's
dialog: going to save your life, you're
text: dumber than he is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
speaker_heading: (SOFTLY)
dialog: Okay. Maybe it's too late. Then
dialog: all I want is... a kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: A kiss?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
text: One last kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Sure, why not...
dialog: 
text: Dorian/Mask sticks out his slimy TWO-FOOT TONGUE, and stick his
text: eyebrows back. Hiss massive lips flutter as he puckers up. But
dialog: Tina turns
text: her head way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: No! From the real Dorian. The
dialog: guy I used to love.
speaker_heading: (BREATHY)
dialog: Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian
dialog: Tyrel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORLANDO
dialog: No time, boss. This building's
dialog: going down any minute...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: I make the decisions! And I've
dialog: decided...
dialog: 
text: Tina stares at him dreamily. Ego gets the better of him. He
text: reaches up and RIPS the mask off. SSSSHUPP!
dialog: 
scene_heading: DORIAN/MASK TRANSFORMS BACK INTO DORIAN
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: ...to give the girl one last
dialog: thrill.
dialog: 
text: He plants his mouth on Tina's -- kissing her roughly. Tina really
text: gets into it. But Stanley watches as Tina slyly positions the leg
dialog: that he
dialog: freed up. And...
dialog: 
scene_heading: TINA DROP-KICKS THE MASK
dialog: 
text: right out of Dorian's hand. It flies into the air.
dialog: 
text: A SERIES OF SLO-MO SHOTS AS...
dialog: 
text: THE MASK SOARS THROUGH THE AIR...
dialog: 
text: DORIAN, ORLANDO and SWEET EDDY ON THE RUN...
dialog: 
text: THE MASK REACHES ITS SUMMIT THEN TUMBLES DOWN THROUGH THE AIR...
dialog: 
scene_heading: HANDS REACH HIGH... FINGERTIPS GRAZE IT...
dialog: 
dialog: But then suddenly... shockingly...
dialog: 
text: A SNOUT, FLAPPING TONGUE AND BARE TEETH
dialog: 
dialog: soar straight up through thr human hands and...
dialog: 
scene_heading: MILO GRABS THE MASK
dialog: 
text: as though it were a Frisbee. Everyone's stunned.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REAL TIME
dialog: 
text: The dog lands back on the ground -- the mask firmly in his mouth.
text: He starts to run away but... Dorian grabs his hind leg.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: C'mere, you ugly little mutt...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILO
dialog: 
text: legs pumping frantically, is losing ground. At the last second,
text: he drops the mask and jams his muzzle into it. Lightning FLASHES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN'S
dialog: 
text: eyes widen as
dialog: 
scene_heading: MILO TRANSFORMS INTO -- DOG/MASK!
dialog: 
text: His pint-sized doggy body now has a giant-sized GREEN HEAD with a
text: double-row of JAGGED CANINE TEETH. The plain collar now sparkles
text: with GLEAMING STUDS. RAZOR-TOENAILS distend. The eyes glow hell
text: fire green.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN (CONT.)
dialog: Whoa!
dialog: 
text: Reflexively, Dorian lets go. Dog/Mask unleashes an incredibly
text: loud SONIC WOOF that explodes glass front slot machines all
dialog: around them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN (CONT.)
dialog: Don't let it get away!
dialog: 
text: Sweet Eddy lunges at the Dog/Mask. But the canine-creature runs
text: between his legs and CHOMPS DOWN on his butt. The tiny dog picks
speaker_heading: BIG
text: Sweet Eddy up and shakes him back and forth, like a rag doll.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: watches this, then takes a look at the TICKING DETONATOR. Less
text: than a minute to go. He strains at his bonds -- forcing the rope
dialog: into a
text: FLAMING VIKING WALL TORCH.
dialog: 
text: Tina winces as Stanley's hand-rope begins to burn.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOG/MASK
dialog: 
text: uses Eddy as a club -- knocking other Thugs down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SWEET EDDY
dialog: Get him off me!
dialog: 
text: Dorian raises his Uzi and SPRAYS THE AREA WITH GUNFIRE! Dog/Mask
text: leaps away in the nick of time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ORLANDO
dialog: C'mon! We've got the money.
dialog: Let's get the hell out of here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: I gotta have that mask!
dialog: 
text: Dorian chases Dog/Mask into the maze of slot machines.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: 
text: burns through his ropes. He frees himself and races to the
dialog: detonator. 15 - 14 - 13 - 12
dialog: 
text: IN THE MAZE OF SLOT MACHINES
dialog: 
text: Dorian stalks Dog/Mask, whistling for him to come. A stream of
text: WATER now trickles down on him from above.
dialog: 
text: Dog/Mask is in the chandelier taking a whiz and snorting doggie
text: laughter. Dorian sprays the ceiling with gunfire, but...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOG/MASK
dialog: 
text: pounces on Dorian, knocking him flat, then races out of sight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIKING SHIP
dialog: 
text: Stanley yanks one wire after another, but the timer still ticks
text: down -- 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 -- Stanley pulls the last wire. The timer
text: stops. Tina exhales,
text: relieved, as Stanley unties her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (kissing him)
dialog: You did it...
dialog: 
scene_heading: C.U. - TIMER
dialog: 
text: as it TICKS back to life... 2 - 1 - 0!
dialog: 
text: A muffled EXPLOSION rumbles from beneath the floorboards.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The two front support pilings BLOW UP.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CASINO - SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: The entire floor TILTS. Gaming tables and slot machines start to
text: slide by. Stanley grabs Tina and hangs onto the prow of the boat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Milo! Milo, come!
dialog: 
text: Dog/Mask appears racing up the tilting floor and leaps into the
dialog: boat as...
dialog: 
text: THE LAST TWO PILINGS BLOW UP!
dialog: 
text: The entire casino floor drops straight down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE SHIP SLIDES
dialog: 
text: straight across the gaming floor towards the huge front doors.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: 
text: SCREAMS as the boat slides right over him.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Viking ship CRASHES through the doors and SPLASHES down in
text: the marina as the entire casino sinks into the water.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. VIKING SHIP - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It bobs for a moment, then floats! Stanley, Tina and the dog
text: emerge from their hiding place, under one of the dining tables.
dialog: 
text: They can't quite believe they're alive. Their faces reflect
text: romantically from the light of the Viking torch sconces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Stanley... we made it. We're
dialog: alive!
dialog: 
text: Milo lets loose a happy "Whoof!" and leaps into Stanley's arms.
text: Stanley removes the mask with a SCHWOOP and Milo transforms back
dialog: into a
dialog: regular dog.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: I'll take that.
dialog: 
text: They turn as DORIAN clamors over the side of the boat. He's got a
text: gun pointed right at them.
dialog: 
text: Stanley slides an iron grappling hook through the mask's eye
text: holes and holds it overboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Hold it right there or you'll be
dialog: looking for this on the bottom
dialog: of the harbor.
dialog: 
text: Dorian stops in his tracks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Drop it and I'll kill you all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: You can have it. But she gets
dialog: to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Fine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: Go where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Swimming. We're still close to
dialog: shore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
text: Five seconds, Ipkiss.
dialog: 
text: Stanley tosses a wooden barrel overboard and turns to Tina.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STANLEY
dialog: Go ahead. Hurry...
dialog: 
text: Tina takes the dog and slips overboard. Dorian moves in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN
dialog: Okay. Put it down. Right over
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: Dorian waves his gun at the nearest dining table. Stanley starts
text: to put down the mask. But at the last instant -- he tosses it
dialog: 
text: INTO THE PILE OF TNT
dialog: 
text: As Dorian turns to see where it lands, Stanley jumps him. Dorian
text: FIRES but misses. Stanley jumps Dorian -- knocking his gun away.
dialog: 
text: Dorian falls into one of the WALL TORCHES -- toppling it.
dialog: 
text: The TWO MEN slug it out as a FIRE STARTS. It burns closer and
text: closer to the dynamite -- the mask in the middle of the pile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE WATER
dialog: 
text: Tina and Milo cling to the floating barrel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: (sees fire)
dialog: Stanley! The dynamite!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BACK ON BOARD
dialog: 
text: Dorian pummels Stanley with a flurry of jabs to the head as the
text: FIRE SEARS toward the explosives.
dialog: 
text: But Stanley counters with a solid right that rocks Dorian back.
text: Dorian grabs him by the collar to retaliate but sees...
dialog: 
text: The FIRE licking at the dynamite casing on which the mask lies.
dialog: 
text: Dorian lunges for the mask. Stanley jumps overboard. The dynamite
dialog: explodes!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FROM THE WATER
dialog: 
text: Tina and Milo watch as the ship blows up. The fireball burns
text: bright, smoke everywhere.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TINA
dialog: ...Stanley?
dialog: 
text: Beat. Stanley surfaces gasping for breath. Tina pulls him over to
text: the barrel and Milo licks his face.
dialog: 
text: And then the smoke parts revealing...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: 
text: standing on the remains of the boat. Like Wile E. Coyote, he's
text: charred pitch black, with singed hair and clothes. But like a
dialog: cartoon -- he just
text: shakes off the soot and stands there in all his fearsome
dialog: Dorian/Mask glory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK
dialog: What a BLAST! This mask makes
dialog: me a god!
dialog: 
text: He picks up the last fizzing, but UNDETONATED STICK OF TNT and
dialog: laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DORIAN/MASK (CONT.)
dialog: I'm immortal...
dialog: 
text: He raises his arms and thunders to the heavens. At that moment --
text: the SUN peaks over the horizon.
