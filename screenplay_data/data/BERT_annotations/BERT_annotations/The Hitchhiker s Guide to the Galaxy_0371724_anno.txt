scene_heading: OVER DARKNESS... 1
dialog: ...we hear what we will come to know as the VOICE OF THE
speaker_heading: GUIDE.
speaker_heading: GUIDE VOICE
dialog: It is an important and popular fact that
dialog: things are not always what they seem.
text: A small square image appears on screen. Home video. The
text: dolphin stadium at Sea World.
speaker_heading: GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: For instance, on the planet Earth, man had
dialog: always assumed that he was the most
dialog: intelligent species occupying the planet,
dialog: instead of the third most intelligent
dialog: which was, in fact, entirely accurate.
text: The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc.
speaker_heading: GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: The second most intelligent creatures
dialog: were, of course, dolphins who curiously
dialog: enough had long known of the impending
dialog: destruction of the planet Earth. They had
dialog: made many attempts to alert mankind to the
dialog: danger, but most of their communications
dialog: were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to
dialog: punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so
dialog: they eventually decided they would leave
dialog: Earth by their own means.
text: They leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher...
speaker_heading: GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: The last ever dolphin message was
text: misinterpreted as a surprisingly
dialog: sophisticated attempt to do a double-
text: backward somersault through a hoop while
text: whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but
dialog: in fact the message was this...
dialog: "So long and thanks for all the fish."
scene_heading: TITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES)
text: Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles.
text: Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a
text: Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR
text: ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the
text: dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never
text: come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the
text: dolphins have vanished.

scene_heading: INT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2
text: CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates.
text: A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind
text: faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands
text: and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room.
text: 3 IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror. 3
text: He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER
text: through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA
speaker_heading: KETTLE WHISTLES O.S.
scene_heading: 4 INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 4
text: Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS
text: VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice
text: through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS.
text: He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his
text: mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO
text: ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)
text: at a costume party.
text: He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold
text: compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The
text: tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he
text: sees the bulldozers.
text: The tea cup shatters on the floor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 5 EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING 5
text: Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in
text: front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his
text: house. He yells into his mobile phone.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: What do you mean he's gone out to lunch?
dialog: You just said he was still at breakfast!
text: MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him.
speaker_heading: PROSSER
dialog: Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in
text: front of the bulldozers forever.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.
speaker_heading: PROSSER
dialog: This bypass has got to be built and it's
dialog: going to be built. You should have made
dialog: your protest months ago.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: The first I heard of it was when a workman
dialog: came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to
dialog: clean the windows, and he said he'd come
dialog: to demolish the house. He didn't tell me
dialog: right away of course. First he wiped a
dialog: couple of windows and charged me twenty
dialog: quid. Then he told me.

text: The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the

speaker_heading: PROSSER
dialog: Look. These plans have been on display at
dialog: the planning office now for a year.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: On display? I had to go down to a cellar!
speaker_heading: PROSSER
dialog: That's the display department.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I eventually found them in the bottom of a
text: locked filing cabinet in a disused
text: lavatory with a sign on the door saying
dialog: 'beware of the leopard'.
speaker_heading: PROSSER
dialog: Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
dialog: damage that bulldozer would suffer if I
dialog: just let it roll straight over you?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: PROSSER
dialog: None at all.
speaker_heading: FORD (O.S.)
dialog: (American accent)
dialog: Arthur!
text: Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill,
text: pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
text: bags of peanuts. This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense.
text: As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down
text: towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.
text: He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Ford?
text: He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Arthur! There you are. Here drink and
dialog: eat with me. We need to talk.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford
dialog: They're going to demolish my home,
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Whoa. You already know? How?
text: Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.

dialog: something important, and I gotta tell you
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: But what about my house?
text: Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the
text: bulldozer driver. He pushes the cart over to him.
text: ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves
text: his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die.
text: The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
text: and eating the peanuts. Ford returns to Arthur.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they
dialog: won't destroy your house until they've
dialog: finished the beers.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Can we trust him?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And how far's that?
speaker_heading: FORD
text: About twelve minutes away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 6 INT. VILLAGE PUB - MIDDAY 6
text: Ford and Arthur enter the half-full pub. Ford hurries to

speaker_heading: FORD
text: Six pints of bitter. And quickly. The
text: world's about to end.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.
text: He starts to pull pints. Ford shoves bar peanuts into
text: his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Well, when does he get back from lunch?
dialog: Or is he going straight out for tea?!
text: He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.

speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to
dialog: spend it.
text: Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Three? At lunchtime?
speaker_heading: FORD
text: Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Very deep. You should send that in to the
dialog: Reader's Digest. They've got a page for
dialog: people like you.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Drink up.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Why three pints?
speaker_heading: FORD
text: Muscle relaxant.
dialog: (grabbing more peanuts)
dialog: And eat these. You'll need the salt.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: What's going on. Ford?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: What would you say if I told you I wasn't
dialog: really from Guilford but from a small
text: planet somewhere in the vicinity of
dialog: Eetelgeuse?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely
dialog: to say?
speaker_heading: FORD

scene_heading: QUICK CUT TO A STREET - MID-DAY 7
text: Ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand
text: to a fast approaching car.
text: Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
text: out of the way as the car zooms past.
scene_heading: (6 cont) BACK TO FORD IN THE PUB: (6 cont)
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Didn't you find it a little strange that I
dialog: was trying to shake hands with a car?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I assumed you were drunk.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: I thought cars were the dominant life
dialog: form. I was trying to introduce myself.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: And that's why you're named after a
dialog: discontinued car from the seventies?
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: You saved my life that day. Now I'm
dialog: saving yours.
text: Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: This must be Thursday. I never could get
dialog: the hang of Thursdays.
speaker_heading: FORD
dialog: Look, if it's about your house...
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: No, it's not that. It's....
text: He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
dialog: I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I
dialog: found her, and then I let her get away.
dialog: You remember that fancy dress party I told

scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: 8 INT. ISLINGTON FLAT - NIGHT 8

speaker_heading: ARTHUR (V.O.)

dialog: home and, I don't know, brush the dog.
dialog: Anything. But there I was -- and then,
dialog: there she was...
text: Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet,
text: sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.
speaker_heading: TRICIA (O.S.)
dialog: Who are you?
text: Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid
text: 19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is
text: holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks
text: beautiful. Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.
speaker_heading: TRICIA
dialog: No, I mean who are you?
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um...

dialog: Livingston, I presume.

text: THE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of

dialog: image and laugh.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and
dialog: beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five
dialog: degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics,
dialog: another in biology...
speaker_heading: TRICIA
dialog: I've got so many degrees I am officially
dialog: unemployable. Let's drink to that!
text: They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR (V.O.)
dialog: And just as I was asking myself, "Why is

dialog: giving me the time of day, out of nowhere
dialog: she says...
speaker_heading: TRICIA
dialog: Let's go somewhere.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a

speaker_heading: TRICIA
dialog: I was thinking Madagascar.
speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: Is that a new club on Dean Street?

speaker_heading: TRICIA

speaker_heading: ARTHUR
dialog: I can't just...what about my house? Who

speaker_heading: ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of

speaker_heading: FORD

speaker_heading: BARMAN

dialog: been called into existence several miles

dialog: since this is not a naturally tenable
dialog: position for a whale, this innocent
