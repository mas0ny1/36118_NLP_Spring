speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES...
text: The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows...
text: The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.
text: ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.
text: Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time.
text: The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues
text: staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly
text: he breaths in.
text: Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this
text: is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing
text: at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the
text: far wall.
text: Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a
text: tight fist.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT
text: The SOUNDS of the boxing match reach FEVER PITCH as we TRACK WITH
text: Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
text: Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other.
text: The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which
dialog: way the fight will turn.
text: One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts
dialog: changing hands...
text: The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way
text: though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him
dialog: here.
dialog: Again bets are placed....
text: PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late
dialog: thirties).
text: Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing
text: his arm around him, pulling him in close.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: ... I love violence!
text: Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey.
text: Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.
text: BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is
text: immediately on the ropes.
text: Julian watches, concerned.
text: Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian
text: and takes it outside.
text: BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the
text: tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings
text: and backfists.
text: As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the
dialog: auditorium.
text: Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with
dialog: adulation...
text: Julian watches, transfixed...
text: Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant
text: in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him...
text: Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him...
text: ... Which is almost like a religious ceremony... The audience
text: bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light... A look
text: of calm washing over his face... A sense of stillness and peace...
dialog: Enlightenment through victory and violence...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHANGING ROOMS - NIGHT
text: Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside
text: him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes.
text: We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something
text: of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have
dialog: gained his approval.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Two fifty, three hundred...
text: Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You did well out there. You've got
dialog: something, Liang. Potential, yeah?
text: Liang nods.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
text: WE TRACK with Billy as he makes his way through the small
text: subterranean nightclub.
text: A Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few
dialog: locals gambling...
text: He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to
dialog: gamble.
text: Billy moves across to a small private corner...
text: ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking
text: Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts
text: up between him and another Thai Man.
text: The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it
text: suddenly gets out of control... Billy starts viciously hitting
text: the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: A fan does what it can to cool Julian down as he counts out money
text: at his desk. Sitting opposite him, feet on the table, is Gordon,
dialog: Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got...
text: Julian's phone rings. He interrupts his counting. Picks up and
dialog: listens...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
speaker_heading: (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: Hold on, hold on. What did he say?
text: Beat as Julian listens. He glances over at Gordon who looks up,
dialog: concerned.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (ON THE PHONE)
dialog: No, tell him to stay there. Tell them
dialog: both to stay there.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (ON THE PHONE)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
text: The Lizard sits outside the nightclub, somehow managing to smoke

text: Julian and Gordon arrive.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: He still in there?
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: ... No.
text: Beat... Julian glances at Gordon.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You told him I was coming...
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: Wouldn't listen...
text: Julian stares at him...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.
text: The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the
text: bloodstain to Julian.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: When was the last time you slept?
text: The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes.
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: Just cause I ain't slept for three days,
dialog: don't mean I don't know right from
dialog: wrong... and your brother has become
dialog: a real problem...
text: Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices
text: this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not going to cause another
dialog: ruckus in my club now - are you?
text: A long pause as Julian considers it.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and
dialog: then he broke my face...
text: Julian turns to Gordon.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Like I always said. One day he's going
dialog: to meet the devil.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You know where he is now?
text: The Lizard stares at Julian.
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: Bangkok has millions of people my
dialog: friend. You and your brother, you're
dialog: lost to my world...
text: The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian...
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
dialog: So what you going to do? You wanna come
dialog: in? Very good amphetamine in here...
text: Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You go. I'm gonna look around. See if
dialog: I can find him.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Sure--?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Go on.
text: He turns back to The Lizard.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Which way'd he go?
text: The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns
text: and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club.
text: The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: His brother didn't pay.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: So? That's his problem.
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: Now it's your problem.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked--
speaker_heading: THE LIZARD
dialog: You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.
text: Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money...
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: How much...?
text: ...and The Lizard smiles for the first time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: group of girls who stand in the background.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You seen Billy?
speaker_heading: MA LONG
dialog: Not this evening.
text: A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares
text: at her, stone faced.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking
dialog: for him, yeah?
speaker_heading: MA LONG
dialog: He's not coming in. I tell him to stay
dialog: away. He hurt one of my girls Julian.
dialog: Not good...
text: Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few
dialog: to Ma Long.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him
dialog: I'm looking for him...
text: Ma Long nods as she takes the money.
text: Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again.
text: Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT
text: Billy's so wasted he's bumping into people. He starts window
text: shopping the various brothels that line the street: groups of
text: girls smiling at him... Anything for a price...
text: PICK OUT one particularly young-looking girl. Just fifteen.
text: She makes eye contact with Billy... He smiles... Pulls out a roll
dialog: of notes...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT
text: Julian out in the middle of the road. Girls on the pavement, girls
text: in the windows. A steady line of punters cruising past.
text: He stands alone. Focussed. Watchful. An island in a sea of neon.
text: It feels ominous. Like something really bad's about to happen...

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. TAXI - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Police cars are parked up outside. Chang gets out of his taxi.
text: Pays the driver. Makes his way inside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SEEDY HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Chang makes his way up the stairs to a landing where a GROUP OF
text: POLICEMEN are gathered. Their circle opens up as Chang approaches
text: and they bow as he joins them - like he's a God. One of the group,
text: Kim Han Ho, gestures towards the door of Room 610 where TWO COPS
text: stand guard. Chang gives a nod and the door is opened.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT
text: Chang stands silhouetted in the doorway. Stepping into the room
text: he moves into the light in CLOSE UP. His face is a mask.
text: The bed is drenched in blood. The fifteen year old prostitute
text: lies naked on her back. She's dead, her body having been savagely
text: beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong.
text: Billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants, his eyes glazed,
text: staring at MTV, a bottle of Mehkong whiskey in his hand, a crack
text: pipe on the floor.
text: Chang stares at him, giving nothing away.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
text: A young cop, Daeng, who has been watching Chang, summons up courage

speaker_heading: DAENG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Who is that guy?
text: Phaiban says nothing.
speaker_heading: DAENG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Is he a cop?
speaker_heading: PHAIBAN
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: He was...
text: Before Daeng can ask another questions, two more cops lead an
text: older Thai man, Choi Yan Lee (50's, overweight, dragged straight
text: from his bed) down the corridor towards the crime scene.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT
text: As Choi Yan Lee is delivered to the doorway, Chang gets up and
text: goes over to him.
text: A moment of uncertainty in Choi Yan Lee's face. Fear. He doesn't
text: know why he's been brought here. He looks for some comfort from
text: Chang. Chang gives him nothing.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT
text: Chang leads Choi Yan Lee to the doorway. Slowly Choi Yan Lee realises
text: what he's looking at. His daughter. Dead. Mutilated.
dialog: Every father's worst nightmare.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Is this your daughter?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: How could you?
text: ... but Choi Yan Lee just stares at his daughter. Finally:
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: ... What?
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: How could you let this happen?
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I didn't do anything.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Well now's your chance.
text: A long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand
text: what Chang is suggesting. Chang stands back.
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Do what thou will.
text: Choi Yan Lee nods. Chang leaves the room, closing the door behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT
text: Chang sits drinking tea in silence with Lieutenant Kim. The guards
text: in the corridor stare at the closed door of Room 610 from where
text: we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death.
text: ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared. Phaiban puts a
text: reassuring hand on his shoulder.
text: As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming
text: out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck
text: snapping. And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down
text: on his body.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT
text: Chang opens the door and looks through.
text: Choi Yan Lee is sitting breathlessly on the floor covered in blood.

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: You missed my turning. I live that way.

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I thought... You were there. He killed

dialog: Answer the question. What are you sorry
dialog: for?
text: Beat. Choi Yan Lee is wrongfooted. Tentatively...
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I killed the Westerner?
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: And why did you do that?
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: He killed my daughter.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: You knew what she was doing and you did
dialog: nothing.
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: How else can we make money? Four
dialog: daughters. No sons. What else could I
dialog: do?
text: Daeng watches as Kim opens the boot and pulls something out. He
text: walks towards Chang and hands it to him. Daeng sees that it's
text: an axe.
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: What did you expect me to do? You have
dialog: to have pity on me. My daughter's just
dialog: been murdered.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: This isn't about her. This is about your
dialog: other three daughters and making sure
dialog: you don't forget them.
text: Chang nods to Kim and Phaiban who grab hold of Choi Yan Lee. Kim
text: slips a plastic strap around Choi Yan Lee's arm, using it as a
text: tourniquet. They wrestle him to the ground and pull his arm out.
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me.
text: Chang approaches with the axe. He stops for a moment. Looks down

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I'll change. I'll be a better man.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: The anonymity of a hotel room. Julian opens the curtains and we
text: see the sky line of Bangkok - he looks out.
text: He lies back on the bed, surfing through two hundred TV channels.
text: Settles on a boxing match. Starts drifting off...
text: As he drifts we hear the SOUND OF SINGING. A karaoke rendition
dialog: of 'I Hung My Head' by Johnny Cash.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I set off running
dialog: to wake from the dream
dialog: My brother's rifle
dialog: went into the sheen
dialog: I kept on running

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
text: REVEAL that the voice is that of Chang and he's not half bad either:
dialog: deeper than you'd have though, and with it comes a stage presence,

speaker_heading: CHANG
dialog: The sheriff he asked me
dialog: Why I had run
dialog: And then it came to me
dialog: Just what I had done
dialog: And all for no reason
dialog: Just one piece of lead
dialog: I hung my head
dialog: I hung my head.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - MORNING
text: On the kitchen table Chang sees a picture. A badly-drawn house
text: with a man, a woman and a child. Across the bottom: "LOVE YOU

text: Kanita thinks for a moment.
speaker_heading: KANITA
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
text: Put him in jail.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: KANITA
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Keep him as a pet?
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: How could they be sure he wouldn't do

speaker_heading: KANITA
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: They could ask him...? Very nicely?

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: "And so the king and the fairies that

dialog: OUT different objects...
text: We see that Chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector
text: - the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs
text: and other bits of movie memorabilia...
text: Amongst the many family photos we also PICK OUT several pictures
text: of Chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like

text: Now all the men have gone and he can see only women.

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: GORDON (O.S.)
dialog: He's dead...
text: Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: What?
text: No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his
text: body and slowly opens the door.
text: Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's
dialog: crew.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: GORDON
text: They found his body in a hotel room...
text: Julian doesn't know what to say... Neither does Gordon.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, get dressed and I'll see you
text: downstairs.
text: Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out
text: the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He
text: glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed.
text: He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on
dialog: make up.
speaker_heading: MAI
dialog: What happened?
text: Julian looks at her.
speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

text: He looks out across the city again then back to the phone.
text: It's like he's scared.
text: He picks it up quickly and dials. A moment as it rings then it's
dialog: answered.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Hello Mum.

speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - DAY

text: of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok.
text: She hands her passport over to the Concierge.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: I'd like to check in now please.
text: The Concierge checks the computer.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: I'm afraid the room won't be ready until

speaker_heading: CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
dialog: ... It's policy
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: I'd like to speak to your manager.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: CONCIERGE
dialog: Yes of course...
text: The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Good afternoon madam, what seems to be
dialog: the problem?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Listen to me... I've just travelled six
dialog: thousand miles to see the corpse of my
dialog: first born son and I haven't slept for
dialog: thirty hours and he says I can't go to
dialog: my room.
text: The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her
dialog: force...
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: I'm sorry madam...
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: ... it simply isn't possible.
text: Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes. Peels off a couple
dialog: of hundred dollar bills.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: ...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the
dialog: fucking key...
text: She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around...
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Well I might be able to arrange
dialog: something...
text: The Manager turns to the Concierge.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Don't leave the money there. Some
dialog: cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.
text: The Manager hesitates.
speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Put it in your pocket.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: There's really no need--
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Put it in your fucking pocket.

scene_heading: INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / ROOM 300 - DAY
text: The struggling Porter opens the door and lets Jenna in. She walks
text: into the suite and gives it the once over.
dialog: Satisfactory.
text: The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her
text: clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece... As soon
text: as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Hey... Open this.
text: Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath,
text: beginning to undress.
speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I need a drink.
text: The Porter is stunned.
speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Well don't just stand there...
text: The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling
text: the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail.
text: Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and
text: takes a huge slug.
text: The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot.
text: Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the
text: Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she
text: starts talking to him...
speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT'D)
dialog: I loved him so much you know... Billy...
text: Beat. The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.
speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone loves their children don't
dialog: they? Well, not everyone, but...
text: She looks over at him. The Porter smiles at her.
speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you want to see a picture?
text: The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse.
text: Opens it up. A picture of Billy.
text: She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it,
dialog: not knowing what to do...
text: Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally...
speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Madam. I have to return to my station.
text: Jenna snaps out of it in an instant.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: What, yeah, thanks.
text: She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHTMARE
text: The elevator doors open. Julian steps out into the empty hallway.
text: Everything is normal... But everything is also not normal.
text: The CAMERA tracks from behind as Julian walks - looking at the
text: doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one:
text: He knocks but there is no answer. Realizing the door isn't locked,
text: he pushes it open and steps in.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHTMARE
text: The room is exactly the same as the one Jenna's staying in. However,
text: instead of her, Julian sees a man sitting on the bed, his back
text: to him. His features are obscured...
text: Julian slowly begins to walk towards him, but before he can reach
text: out, the figure turns to face him...
text: It's Chang. But there is blood smeared all over his face...
text: Julian stares at him in horror. Slowly he looks down at his hands
text: only to discover that they're dripping in blood...
text: We ZOOM IN on his hands.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Julian wakes from his nightmare - covered in sweat. He is alone.
text: He sits up. Looks at his hands, still very shaken by his nightmare...
text: We hear the traffic of Bangkok. Julian gets up and walks to the
text: table... Light up and begins to smoke morphine... He walks to
text: the window and looks out over Bangkok...
text: His phone rings - Julian answers...
speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / BAR
text: Jenna looks immaculate. She stubs out her cigarette when she spots
text: Julian making his way towards her. She gets up and they embrace.
text: She holds on to him. A little too long.
text: Finally she pulls away. She looks at him for a long time.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Could it be have been one of the gangs?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't
dialog: popular.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: You know Billy... He was eccentric.
text: Jenna smiles to herself as if this brings back memories and Julian
text: even smiles. Both sit in silence for a moment.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: But you're going to find out who did
dialog: it, right?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I'll make sure it gets done.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: No, it needs to be you that does it.
dialog: We need to show them. Do you understand

speaker_heading: JULIAN

text: On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough
text: to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering
text: wife Kim Yan Lee. She serves a chilled coconut to a man. As he
text: turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking
text: member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam.
text: We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's
text: looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's
dialog: selling.
text: They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting
dialog: for Choi Yan Lee to turn up.
text: Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching...
text: Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the
text: bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor.
text: Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.
text: The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK

speaker_heading: SHUT.

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE

speaker_heading: KIM YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

dialog: doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
text: Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to
dialog: Charlie Ling.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
text: At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's
text: face. His eyes lock with Julian's.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Is your name Choi Yan Lee?
text: Choi Yan Lee nods his head.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Ask him why he killed my brother.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: You killed his brother. Big mistake fat
dialog: man. Why'd you do it?
dialog: Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught...
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: He murdered my daughter.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
text: He says he killed his daughter.

text: Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face...
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please.
dialog: I'll give you anything. Anything you
dialog: want. My daughters. My shop. Please.
dialog: I've paid for what I did. Look at me.
text: In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward,

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?
text: Julian turns to Charlie Ling.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: What's he saying?

speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
dialog: He says... He says he's paid for what
dialog: he's done. That he's been punished
dialog: already.
text: Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: He told me to do it. Then he took my
dialog: hand. Look.
text: Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Who did that to him?
text: Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: The Angel of Vengeance...
text: Charlie Ling looks at him surprised... yet there's a sense that

speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: It's a lie - he doesn't exist...
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel
dialog: of Vengeance.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: What's he saying?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
dialog: He's lying...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
dialog: It's a story old women tell their grand
dialog: children... 'The Angel of Vengeance'
dialog: is supposed to come down from the
dialog: heavens and judge the living...
dialog: restore karma to the world..
text: Gordon laughs... but Julian listens with great interest...
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: How does he do that?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
dialog: Leads people to their destiny...
dialog: That's the myth anyway.
text: Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Ask him who cut his hand off.

speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do it.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Who turned you into a cripple - and no
dialog: bullshit this time.

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
scene_heading: (IN THAI, QUIETLY)
dialog: I'm telling you the truth... The Angel

speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
dialog: He says it was The Angel of Vengeance...

speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Pull yourself together fat man. If you

dialog: and shove it down your throat.
speaker_heading: CHOI YAN LEE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I'm telling you the truth. He'll find

text: Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: What did he say?
text: Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to
dialog: get a better answer out of him...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE LING
dialog: He said you don't find The Angel of
dialog: Vengeance. He finds you...
text: Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing
text: his gun anymore. Puts it away.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Are we going to kill him or what?
text: The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive.
dialog: Julian's got to get out...
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: This his phone?

speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: THAI MAN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I run a boxing club. Not much call for

speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What's this got to do with me?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: He was the father of the girl that was

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Then I guess you boys have got a lot

dialog: excuse me...
speaker_heading: KIM

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: Where were you last night?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: With my mum...
text: Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're

speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to speak to her?
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: That wont be necessary at the moment.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Am I suspect?
text: Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian
text: stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of

text: moment and then turns to Kim.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: This is not the man.
text: And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves.

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I want you to find out who that guy is.

speaker_heading: PHAIBUN
dialog: He used to be a great boxer.
speaker_heading: KIM
dialog: He has to do it. Since he came out of

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.
speaker_heading: JENNA

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Yes you are. You're going to do it for

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: This isn't about Billy. This is about

text: by the glass.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: You're right. We're family. We stick
dialog: together. But Billy was family too.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Billy was a fuck up... He deserved

dialog: know it.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: That's it. I'm not listening to this.
dialog: I don't ever want to hear you mention
dialog: his name again... Do you hear me?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Yeah we were brothers, but we were never
dialog: close... And he was only in Bangkok
dialog: cause you couldn't control him. So you
dialog: sent him to me--
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: -- So you sent him to me and what could
dialog: I do?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: You could have protected him.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I did what I could. And that's more than
dialog: you ever did.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: I would've done anything for him. Okay,
dialog: he wasn't born with as many advantages
dialog: as you were. He struggled with things.
dialog: But I always stood by him.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: And what did that get him? I'll tell
dialog: you what, a one way ticket to this
dialog: fucking place, just like me.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Don't you dare blame me for what
dialog: happened back then.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I'm only here 'cause of you. If you

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: You would've been a great fighter...

speaker_heading: JULIAN

dialog: smuggling.
text: He turns to Mai.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's true... The whole thing's a front.
dialog: Every day I see kids coming in with great

dialog: because of you, Ma. You and the money
dialog: and the drugs.
text: Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up.

speaker_heading: JENNA

dialog: that's more important to me.

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: That's right Mum. That's what's more
dialog: important to you. But what about me?
dialog: Sometimes I think you only got me out
dialog: of there so the cops couldn't trace it
dialog: back to you...
text: Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...that's right Mum. Think about it.
dialog: With me gone you were safe. And it turned
dialog: out to be good for business as well.
dialog: All very convenient.
text: Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands
text: now shaking.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that what happened with Billy? Did
dialog: Billy become a problem like I did?
dialog: Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big
dialog: fucking problem when he was here...
dialog: Still, at least you didn't have him
dialog: killed.
text: Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at
text: her. Very intense.
speaker_heading: JULIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum.
dialog: Doesn't matter what you say. And do you
dialog: want to know why?
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Surprise me.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: 'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the
dialog: ring. Me versus him.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Well that seems sensible... And what
dialog: do you hope that's going to achieve?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I don't expect you to understand. Cause
dialog: you don't understand anything that
dialog: isn't about you.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: And when you lose, what's going to
dialog: happen then?
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: I don't know... But maybe this time I'll
dialog: win. Like you say, only God forgives.
dialog: Maybe this time he'll forgive me...

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: JENNA (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you

speaker_heading: MAI

speaker_heading: JENNA

speaker_heading: JENNA

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: I didn't say it was easy. But then,
dialog: you're a resourceful man, aren't you?
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: I looked into it. Chang's a hard man

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: Well then you're going to have to find

speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: There might be a way... But Julian can't
dialog: find out...

speaker_heading: JENNA

speaker_heading: YURI KARKOV

speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: You really want to know?
speaker_heading: YURI KARKOV
dialog: Yes. It may effect the price.
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: He killed my son.
speaker_heading: YURI KARKOV
dialog: Revenge. Pricey...
speaker_heading: JENNA
dialog: This is Bangkok. Nothing's that

speaker_heading: YURI KARKOV
dialog: You're right. Most things are cheap in

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A crappy van pulls up outside. Out get three Cambodian men. Very
text: poor, badly clothed. They look like farmers. Only they pull out
text: semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng
text: and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen
text: walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE.
text: An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all
text: the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering
text: the room with broken glass.
text: Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover.
text: Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and
text: his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
text: Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair.
text: In it, his pistol.
text: The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull
text: it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting.
text: A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's
text: jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs
text: it and returns fire, letting off four rounds.
text: He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman
text: Two sees this and sprays at Chang -
text: - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again,
text: shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times.
text: Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon
text: jams. He drops his weapon and runs.
text: Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him.
text: He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood
text: from his chest.
text: Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat
text: as he waits. As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken,
text: running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and
text: starts to pull away.
text: Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down.
text: The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open
dialog: doors.
text: Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires
text: off two rounds.
text: Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver
text: falls forward, dead.
text: The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's
text: made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere.
text: Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Do you want to die? Do you want me to

speaker_heading: GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: No. Please. Don't kill me.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't

speaker_heading: GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: GUNMAN THREE (O.S.)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: It's my first time. I've never done

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I know that. You're wearing sandals.
dialog: Hitmen don't wear sandals.
text: The door opens. Sandaled feet step out of the van. Gunman Three

text: to point his weapon at the unarmed man.
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Give me a reason.
text: The Cops appear behind him in the doorway. Chang holds his ground.

speaker_heading: GUNMAN THREE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I'm begging you. Please--
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

text: Flanked by the Cops, Chang frog marches Gunman Three through the

dialog: could ever want for your TV, computer or Hi-fi.
text: Gunman Three is so scared that he keeps forgetting the route and

text: Finally they reach the entrance to a particular shop.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELECTRICAL SHOP - NIGHT
text: Chang enters, followed by the others. Gunman Three is incredibly

text: As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three
text: next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting

text: He approaches them with a heavy sigh.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: LI PO
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: GUNMAN THREE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: LI PO
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Good...
text: Li Po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile

speaker_heading: LI PO
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: As for myself, I'm not scared of paying
dialog: for what I've done. I just... just don't
dialog: hurt my son.
text: Chang looks down at Pan - who is just staring at them, not

text: Chang takes the phone from Li Po.
speaker_heading: GUNMAN THREE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: You see? He knows. He's got the details.
dialog: I told you he would.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: And I told you not to talk unless I asked

text: Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three.
speaker_heading: GUNMAN THREE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd
dialog: let me live.
text: Chang shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I never said that.
text: Chang fires. Gunman Three's brains spatter across the TV screens
text: on the far side of the wall.
text: Pan begins to cry and Li Po hugs him and tells him how much he
dialog: loves him... thinking they're next...
text: Chang studies the mobile phone.

speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: LI PO
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

speaker_heading: YURI

speaker_heading: YURI

speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)

text: The music's killed.
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: That's better. Thank you very much...
text: Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone.
text: Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white.
text: Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in
text: Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri
text: winces. Chang shakes his head.
text: Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across
text: to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear.
text: Dimitri answers. Chang speaks through the phone.

dialog: I need information.
text: Phaiban spins a spotlight onto Dimitri.
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
dialog: And you're going to help me.

dialog: performance...
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Whether you like it or not.
text: Dimitri's body starts to shake in fear.
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
dialog: It was an English woman - she wanted

speaker_heading: CHANG
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI

speaker_heading: CHANG

speaker_heading: CHANG
dialog: And what's my name?
speaker_heading: DIMITRI
speaker_heading: CHANG--
text: Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know
text: what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind
dialog: by Phaiban.
text: Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri...
speaker_heading: CHANG
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: I see the way you look at my people.
dialog: The way you abuse them with your eyes.
dialog: For this, I take your sight.

text: Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in
dialog: Russian...
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: You live in my country, but you fail
dialog: to learn our language. You don't even

text: Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on
text: his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of
text: his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off.
text: ...Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying
dialog: animal...
text: Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around
text: the room like a chicken without a head...
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: You had opportunities. You could have
dialog: chosen other paths... But you wouldn't

text: side, then the other.
text: SOUND OUT. We can't hear Dimitri's screaming. We can't hear
dialog: anything at all.
dialog: Beat.

text: The ceremonial music begins...
text: Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient,
dialog: traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried
text: out before a fight takes place.
text: It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their
text: arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing
text: shapes and outlining fighting positions.
text: As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative;
text: now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches
text: that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost
text: beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about
dialog: to follow...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
text: The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring
text: up the SOUND of the baying crowd. Chanting. Screaming. Wild
text: excitement. Ready for the fight they've all been waiting for...
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
text: The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside
text: him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.
text: In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple
text: of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.
text: The first bell sounds. Five second warning...
text: Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers
text: him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.
text: Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.
text: The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang
text: walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between
text: them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.
text: Then a look between the two fighters.
text: Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks
text: back at him without emotion.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Fight.
text: Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack
text: first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps
text: his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right
text: leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of
text: Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his
text: left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's
text: too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps
dialog: back.
text: Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an
text: attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,
text: connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.
text: Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.
text: Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.
text: Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.
text: He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.
text: Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike
text: with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack
text: was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and
text: uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects
text: with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.
text: Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds
text: over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs
text: and punches to his upper body and face.
text: Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to
text: the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under
text: Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to
text: place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him
text: fall down.
text: Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make
text: the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this
text: enrages Julian.
text: He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a
text: high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns
text: with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,
text: punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's
text: down. But again no killer punch.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Come on.
text: Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.
text: Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take
text: out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.
text: Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a
text: look of intense anger and frustration.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
text: Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting.
text: Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack.
text: A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian
text: moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as
text: he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own
text: kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,
text: using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike
text: with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.
text: PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and
dialog: Kanita.
text: Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches
text: and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.
text: He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.
speaker_heading: REFEREE
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Break.
text: The two fighters step back from each other. Chang's face is damaged.
text: Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds.
text: End of the second round.
text: Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting
text: Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks
text: and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing
text: Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon...
text: End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan
text: the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.
text: Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring
text: into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at
text: but can't make it out.
text: POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When
text: she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the
text: fight - urging him to hit harder...
text: Jenna then walks back to Gordon...
text: On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the
text: ring. Looking into the crowd.
text: Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.
text: Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of
text: the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and
text: she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he
dialog: knows...
text: The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.
text: He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.
text: The Referee starts counting.
text: Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
text: Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out.
text: Kim watches on, concerned.
speaker_heading: KIM
speaker_heading: (IN THAI)
dialog: Get up. Please get up.
text: After a long, terrible pause... Chang gets up. He looks over into
text: the crowd. Makes eye contact with his wife. It's okay.
text: She shakes her head. She can't bear it. Tears running down her
text: face.
text: Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates,
text: confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.
speaker_heading: CHANG
dialog: It wasn't you, was it?
text: Julian shrugs, puts his guard up.
speaker_heading: CHANG (CONT'D)
dialog: You're innocent.
speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: CHANG
dialog: It's not your fault.

text: to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him.
text: He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in
dialog: his mind.
dialog: It's not his fault.
text: Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left,
dialog: right. Julian just takes them...
text: Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the
text: middle of the ring.
text: Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out
text: a roundhouse left kick -

text: Buddha's smiling back at him...
text: Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and
text: incredibly vibrant... A group of school children, all of whom

text: the shotgun with two fresh cartridges.
speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: Only God forgives. And now mother -

speaker_heading: OPENS -

text: Confused, Julian continues to level the weapon at his head. Gordon
text: backs away into the room.
speaker_heading: GORDON
dialog: Easy...

speaker_heading: JULIAN
dialog: ... Yeah.
speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: JULIAN

speaker_heading: GORDON

speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: You've become a liability. You can see

text: It clatters to the floor.
speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: And now she wants me to take over. She
dialog: wants me to be the favoured son. What
dialog: am I supposed to say?

speaker_heading: GORDON (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't want it to end like this. First
dialog: I fuck your mother. Then I--
