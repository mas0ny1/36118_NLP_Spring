scene_heading: EXT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: A burned-out hotel rots away on an ugly, abandoned road. We
text: MOVE THROUGH the crumbling courtyard and into the scorched:
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: When I was on top, I lived in the
dialog: shadows. I knew how to get in, and
dialog: when to get out.
dialog: 
text: SWEEPING UP what was once a grand staircase as the faint
text: clack of a TYPEWRITER grows louder. PUSHING THROUGH a door -
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 416 - NIGHT
text: An empty, unfurnished hotel room -- and REMY, buck naked,
text: sitting in the middle, pecking at the typewriter on his
dialog: lap.
text: His body is thin, wiry. A scar runs down the middle of his
text: chest. A shotgun is to his right. A scalpel to his left.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: I was feared. Respected. Vilified.
scene_heading: INSERT - THE PAGE IN THE TYPEWRITER
text: as the next words are rapidly typed: =O-S- -i-m-e-
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Most times, they never saw me coming.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
text: A FIGURE stands in the shadows, watching through an
text: apartment window as a HOOKER leads her JOHN into a bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The hooker’s on her knees. The guy moans, grunts, building -
text: A shadow appears in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMY (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Smythe? I’m from the Credit
dialog: Union.
text: Remy steps into the light and fires a taser -- the prongs
text: SLAM into the wall, barely missing the petrified John --
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Holy fuck -- wait, I can pay --
text: With an easy snap of Remy’s wrist, the taser prongs
dialog: retract.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Sorry. That’s not my department.
text: Remy launches the taser again -- it hits the guy’s chest --
dialog: 
text: 300 volts SIZZLE through his convulsing body. The guy
text: collapses, out cold. Remy’s a blur of motion as he whips
text: out a duffel bag and begins setting up:
text: An expandable lamp. A scalpel. A white apron, tied around
text: his waist and neck. Remy leans in, pushing on the guy’s
dialog: belly --
text: And a phone handset WHACKS Remy upside the head. He spins --
text: The hooker, terrified, holds the handset like a club.
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Don’t you fucking touch me --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Ma‘am, there’s no need for violence.
text: She gamely WHACKS him in the head again.
speaker_heading: HOOKER i
dialog: I’‘1l call the cops, I swear --
text: Remy’s 9mm is suddenly in his hand and BLASTING the phone
text: into a million plastic fragments. The hooker is stunned.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Lady, why you gotta bust my balls?
speaker_heading: HOOKER
dialog: Help! Somebody --
text: In a BLUR Remy’s across the room, SLAMMING the hooker
text: against the wall. He slaps a hand over her trembling mouth.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Listen to me. Listen! I’m here to do
dialog: a job, just like you. Your new pal
dialog: bought something that he couldn’t pay
dialog: for, and I’ve come to take it back.
dialog: Now if he dies, he dies, and that’s a
dialog: shame, but he should have thought of
dialog: that before he started paying for
dialog: blowjobs and stopped paying his
dialog: bills. Do you understand me?
text: Still scared, she nods.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: So let’s be adults about this and let
dialog: everyone get on with their business.
text: Remy backs away, keeping an eye on her. She’s shaking,
text: barely able to move. He turns back to the guy --
text: As the hooker SCREAMS and runs at Remy --
text: Who expertly ZAPS her with a no-look taser blast. She
dialog: drops.
text: Without missing a beat, Remy lifts the scalpel, picks a
text: spot on the guy’s belly, and SLICES it open. He thrusts his
text: hand into the open wound, and --
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: An amorphous blob of blood and tissue is tossed into the
text: sink -- it CLANGS oddly against the basin. Remy, his apron
text: covered in blood, flips on the faucet.
text: He removes a lacquered box from his bag and sets it on the
text: counter. A logo is stamped onto the top: A black circle
text: with a lightning bolt shooting through it. He looks to the
dialog: sink --
text: Where the water has begun to wash away the bodily fluids
text: covering the blob. A distinct glitter of metal appears...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: A SIMILARLY SHAPED METAL SPHERE
text: sitting on a man’s palm. Silicon tubes snake out of it.
speaker_heading: TV SPOKESMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Friends, are you weary of watching
dialog: your widening waistline? Are you
dialog: tired of trying on tightening
dialog: trousers?
scene_heading: INT. REMY’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Where the commercial continues on a small plasma screen set
text: into the steering wheel. Remy drives his beat-up sedan,
text: windows down. On the seat next to him is the lacquered box.
speaker_heading: TV SPOKESMAN (V.O.)
dialog: Then you’11 love the new Kenton ES-19
dialog: with preset esophogeal inhibitors,
dialog: available now at The Credit Union. We
dialog: help you get more you out of you.
text: Remy CLICKS off the TV as he pulls to a red light. A hot-
text: rod pulls up next to Remy’s sedan, music loud, engine
text: gunning.
text: The YOUNG GUY inside glances over -- a challenge, perhaps --
text: and catches sight of the tattoo on Remy’s arm -- that same
text: black circle with five shimmering lightning bolts through
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: The guy, suddenly terrified, throws his car in reverse and
text: bails out as fast as he can. Remy doesn’t flinch.
scene_heading: EXT. MALL - NIGHT
dialog: Seems like your average suburban mall, though there are an
text: excessive number of ambulances pulling up outside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
text: The Mall. Disneyland for suckers.
dialog: Mecca for the meek.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - NIGHT
text: Remy struts purposefully down the wide corridors. People
text: stream to either side as he passes, afraid to come too
dialog: close.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: For me, it was work.
text: We pass an empty storefront -- the paint faded where the
text: words THE GAP used to be. A banner hangs across the window:
dialog: ' 2
speaker_heading: DEPOT.
text: Remy turns a corner and slams into a SIX-FOOT TALL LUNG.
scene_heading: LARRY THE LUNG
dialog: (muffled, inside costume)
dialog: Hey, buddy, watch your damn --
dialog: (beat; recognizing Remy)
dialog: Oh, sir. I’m so sorry -- I didn’t --
text: Remy brushes aside the mascot and continues on his way.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - OUTSIDE CREDIT UNION - NIGHT
text: A long line of customers waits outside this storefront, the
text: words CREDIT UNION #418 emblazoned atop the double doors.
text: That circle-and-arrow logo sparkles in brightly lit neon.
text: HARRY THE HEART, Larry’s cardiac counterpart, jumps rope
text: with his own aorta. CHILDREN laugh at the mascot’s antics.
text: Down the line, most customers use crutches, walkers. Some
text: have portable IV bags. A few are wheeled along on hospital
text: gurneys. Everyone waits his turn...
text: Except for Remy. He strolls past the line and gives a nod
text: to the GUARDS manning a metal detector. Remy walks through -
text: Setting off a SCREECHING ALARM. No one seems to care.
scene_heading: INT. CREDIT UNION - FRONT OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Looks like an insurance office. We MOVE WITH Remy past a
text: line of booths where customers watch slick video
dialog: presentations.
speaker_heading: VIDEO NARRATOR #1 (V.O.)
dialog: .in years past, nearly two hundred
dialog: thousand people waited on organ
dialog: transplant lists at any given time,
dialog: hoping for someone else to die so
dialog: that they could possibly live. But
dialog: thanks to modern biomedical
dialog: science...
text: We MOVE down, where the next monitor is further along in
text: the presentation. An animated cross-section of the body
text: opens up.
speaker_heading: VIDEO NARRATOR #2 (V.O.)
dialog: where the artificial organ, or
text: artiforg, is expertly and cleanly
dialog: inserted into the customer. Then...
text: Remy moves beyond the video booths, past SALESMEN plying
text: their wares on the customers trapped in their cubicles.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #1
dialog: .it’s top-of-the-line, I can
dialog: guarantee you that. No one else makes
dialog: a better kidney right now...
text: Passing another cubicle where a YOUNG WOMAN signs papers --
speaker_heading: SALESMAN #2
dialog: .the APR is thirty-nine point six
dialog: percent, standard for a generic
dialog: pancreatic unit with your excellent
dialog: credit history...
text: An entire FAMILY squeezes into the last cubicle,
text: surrounding their pale, deathly ill FATHER. The Credit
text: Union Manager and top closer -- a snazzily dressed FRANK --
text: finishes his spiel:
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: .three final letters will be sent.
dialog: After the thirtieth day of the sixth
dialog: month of nonpayment, we are legally
dialog: entitled to retrieve the property --
dialog: at our own expense, of course,
dialog: utilizing our skilled and licensed
dialog: technicians. But I assure you, this
dialog: is rare -- only one-point-five
dialog: percent of all artiforgs are ever
text: repossessed.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You owe this to your family, Mr.
dialog: Troy. You owe it to yourself.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, if you could just sign here...
dialog: 
text: Remy’s lips twist contemptuously as he passes by. He winks
text: at the sick father, who pales by another two shades.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
text: He signed it. Everyone signs it.
scene_heading: INT. CREDIT UNION - BACK OFFICE - NIGHT
text: It’s darker back here, not quite so corporate. Just a few
text: low card tables where scraggly REPO MEN drink their coffee.
text: Remy stares up at the far wall, where a huge chalkboard is
text: divided into a chart, the boxes scrawled with names and
dialog: numbers.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND (0.S.)
dialog: Goddamn ears again.
text: RAYMOND PEARL is a good foot taller than Remy, a hulking
text: mass of angry meat. He nods up to the chalkboard, where
text: next to the name R. PEARL, it says MARSHODYNE E-2000, AUDIO
scene_heading: MODULE.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Job’s a job, Ray --
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I’m just saying, ears four times ina
dialog: row, that’s chop shop. This fucking
dialog: probation ain’t fair.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Wasn't fair what you did to that girl
text: on the subway, either.
scene_heading: SUDDEN FLASH -- RAY ON A SUBWAY TRAIN
text: gleefully ripping out the artificial organ of a girl no
text: older than sixteen. Lights flicker, terrified passengers
speaker_heading: SCREAM --
text: BACK TO SCENE
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Yeah, well... you weren’t there.
dialog: (beat; softer)
dialog: Listen, my sister’s kid, he wants in.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Talk to Frank.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I kinda thought maybe a
dialog: recommendation coming from you, from
dialog: a Level Five --
text: Raymond gestures towards Remy’s tattoo, the five shimmering
text: bolts. Raymond only has three.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I don’t even know the kid.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Sure you do! He works outside, wears
text: the lung costume.
text: Before Remy can respond, FRANK bursts through the door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’re killing me coming in through
dialog: the front like that. I got guys
dialog: tryin’ to make sales, you’re out
text: front spooking the clients.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Like Joe Asshole gives a crap. Guy
dialog: needs a new bladder, he’1ll buy a new
dialog: bladder.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It might make him... reflect. We
dialog: can’t have reflection.
text: Frank leads Remy away from Ray and back to:
scene_heading: INT. ARTIFORG LOCKER - CREDIT UNION - DAY
text: A gated room set off from the main compound. Hundreds of
text: the lacquered artiforg boxes are stacked all around a
text: familiar iron statue: A black sphere with a lightning bolt
dialog: through it.
text: Remy tosses Frank the box; Frank flips it open. Set inside
text: is the metallic oblong sphere from the kitchen sink.
text: Frank leans over a nearby computer, pecking at the
dialog: keyboard.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Easy job?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: ‘Bout average.
text: Frank hits ENTER, and the computer BEEPS. Job completed.
text: Frank pulls the artiforg out of the lacquered box and
text: tosses it into a bin marked ARTIFORG OUTBOX. They turn to
dialog: leave --
speaker_heading: JAKE (0.S.)
dialog: Five-day count, big man. Give it up.
text: We WHIP around to find JAKE FRIEVALD, a taut, lean fellow
text: with a tattoo identical to Remy’s. Black tank top, fatigue
text: pants. A military boy who never gave up the look.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Jake Frievald kicked my ass in the
dialog: third grade.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BIKE RACKS - ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
text: Young Jake and Young Remy pummel one another with abandon,
text: surrounded by a circle of KIDS cheering them on.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Or I kicked his. It doesn’t matter.
scene_heading: INT. OUTSIDE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Jake and Remy sit, bloodied, in the waiting area.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: We sat there for hours, outside the
dialog: Principal's office, waiting for our
dialog: punishment. By the end of the day, we
dialog: were best friends for life.
text: BACK TO SCENE
scene_heading: INT. ARTIFORG LOCKER - CREDIT UNION - DAY
text: Jake and Remy press their thumbs together as a greeting.
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Two livers and a Jarvik.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Three? Back in the day you'd grab
dialog: three before lunch. C’mon, let’s hit
dialog: a few.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Gotta tell Carol I’m going.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Of course you do.
text: Jake follows Remy out --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Use the back door, guys -- the back --
text: But they’re already out through the front, into the pool of
text: waiting customers. Frank hangs his head and sighs.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - OUTSIDE CREDIT UNION - DAY
text: Remy and Jake, bloody as all hell, head into a store called
text: ALL THINGS GOOD.
scene_heading: INT. ALL THINGS GOOD - DAY
text: A quaint country store -- stuffed bears sitting on handmade
text: wood tables, a white picket fence snaking through the joint
dialog: to give it that homey feel.
text: The customers get one look at Remy and Jake’s bloodstained
text: shirts and quickly file out.
dialog: 
text: Remy approaches the back counter where a stern-faced beauty
text: stares him down. This is CAROL.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We're gonna head over to Montego, you
dialog: want me to bring you home some wings?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I want you to try changing the shirt
dialog: before he sees you.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Peter’s here already?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: He gets here the same time every day.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Maybe you could take him. Go do
dialog: something with your son instead of
text: going to the bar with the asshole.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That’s what my mom calls me, too.
text: Jake holds up a crocheted scarf, getting bloodstains on it.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have these in blue?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: (ignoring Jake; to Remy)
dialog: Did you talk to Frank today? About
dialog: moving over to sales?
text: Remy glances at Jake, who’s watching their conversation.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Didn’t come up. Listen, I’1l1 help
dialog: Peter with his homework when I get
dialog: back.
text: Carol shakes her head, disappointed.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Just go. Before he sees the blood.
text: Remy heads for the door, Jake right next to him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: That went well.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DUSK
text: An abandoned industrial area. Windowless, burned out
text: warehouses line the street. Remy’s car cruises by...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. REMY’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
text: Remy drives, Jake shotgun.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You'd actually work less hours.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: If I could convince Frank.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And you'd make more money.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Hazardous duty, man.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sittin’ in the sales office?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I look some cancer-riddled prick in
dialog: the eye and say, “you owe it to your
dialog: family. You owe it to yourself.”
dialog: Might choke on my own vomit.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So tell Carol to blow.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Yeah, you tell her.
text: Jake has no answer to that. Looks up ahead, notices a wiry,
text: chipped tooth ADDICT limping along a chain link fence.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Guy up there. That’s a Flexorgen. I
dialog: know that gimp a mile away.
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Twenty bucks he’s overdue.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Slow up.
text: Remy slows the car to a crawl. Jake reaches into his
text: duffel, pulls out a radar-gun-shaped scanner. He points
text: the scanner at the addict, depresses the trigger, and we go
dialog: into...
speaker_heading: SCANNER P.O.V.
text: CAMERA RACES straight at the greasy loser at light speed.
text: A sickening sound as we pierce his flesh and go
scene_heading: INSIDE HIS TORSO
text: Racing past ribs, swimming through blood, and barreling by
text: organs, until finally landing...
dialog: 3
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
text: CLOSE ON: A shiny, metallic hip replacement. We hear a
text: distinct, warbled PING!

dialog: Green letters on black: i i
dialog: Current.
text: BACK IN THE CAR
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: All paid up. You owe me twenty.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’1l get drinks.
text: A little further up the road, Remy spots an OBESE man
text: waddling down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Check out fatty. You know that guy’s
dialog: organs gave out a long time ago.
text: Jake hits the scanner. -PING!
scene_heading: ON THE SCREEN: Kenton pancreatic system M-4* w/ glucose
scene_heading: monitor. Account Status: 179 days PAST DUE.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Deadbeat?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Two more days.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Should reclaim him anyway.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You can’t transfer. You’1l always be
dialog: repo.
text: Remy rolls down his window, calls out.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Nice night for a walk.
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN
dialog: Fuck off.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: How’s that pancreas holdin’ up?
text: Remy lets his arm dangle out the window. The big guy clocks
dialog: his sphere-and-lightning-bolts tattoo --
dialog: 
dialog: seen:
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN
dialog: (suddenly nervous)
dialog: I -- I sent the money in this
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You better hope you did.
speaker_heading: OBESE MAN
dialog: I swear. I was just at the post
dialog: office.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Two days, that pancreas is mine.
text: The fat man takes off running as fast as he can.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Look at him go. Gonna need a new
text: heart soon as he rounds the corner.
scene_heading: EXT. MONTEGO BAY BAR - NIGHT
text: A neon sign outside the bar: A Rasta relaxing on a hammock,
text: slung between two palm trees. A fat spliff glows red, on
text: and off, as he smokes it.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: J. Mulhearn. You think it could be
dialog: Jamie Mulhearn?
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
text: Reggae Dancehall music plays. Remy and Jake nurse Red
text: Stripe beers. Empties line the table.
text: Remy stares at a pink sheet with a yellow receipt attached.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Guy in C Squadron? With the fucked-up
dialog: mustache? No way, lemme see that.
dialog: (grabbing pink sheet)
dialog: Holy shit, it ig him. Poor shit still
text: lives with his parents.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You ever repo anybody you know?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: My grandpa.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Fuck you, you did not.
text: Jake laughs and takes another sip of his beer.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, but I would. On day 181, if I got
dialog: the pink sheet. Job’s a job, man.

scene_heading: INT. REMY ’S CAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

speaker_heading: PROSTITUTE
dialog: Jagoff!
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Eyes on the road, Romeo. I won’t be
dialog: your best man for that one.

speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: INT. BROTHEL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Bad wallpaper, worse curtains. A price list on the wall
text: over young Remy’s head gives the menu of the day in very

dialog: room.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
text: Nineteen years old, on forty-eight

scene_heading: INT. BETH’S ROOM - BROTHEL - DAWN
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)

speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I wanted to.

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Why would you want to marry me?
speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: JAKE

scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Shafts of moonlight illuminate tattered sleeping bags,

scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Dozens of people come streaming out of the building,
text: pouring out windows, scrambling down rickety fire escapes.
text: Scattering like ants after their pile’s been kicked. Back
dialog: inside:
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT
text: A WIRY MAN is struggling to get out the window when Remy
text: grabs him and throws him back inside like a rag doll. Remy
text: quickly hits him with a taser, taking the fight out of him.
speaker_heading: JAKE (O.S.)
dialog: I got ten upstairs. How’d you do?
text: Jake descends a crumbling staircase, taking in the carnage.
text: Remy silently counts the unconscious bodies on the floor.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Twelve.
text: Suddenly, the wiry man, twitching on the floor, manages to
text: struggle to his feet and lunges for the window again.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
dialog: 17.
text: Remy moves to grab him, but the guy jumps for it. Escapes.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Try eleven.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Shit. Still beat you.
text: Jake smiles. Takes in the bodies scattered all over the
text: floor. All those overdue artiforgs waiting to be
dialog: harvested.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Let’s get to work.
text: Jake starts filling out yellow repo receipts as Remy pulls
text: out his scalpel and kneels over the closest body.
scene_heading: INT. CREDIT UNION - FRANK'S OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Frank is on the phone, peering down at the Repo Men milling
text: about on the first floor.
text: Dozens of unboxed artiforgs suddenly drop on the desk in
text: front of him. He jumps back in surprise, then looks up to
text: see Remy and Jake, covered in blood.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus Christ. Don’t you guys wear
dialog: aprons?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Yeah, and fry hats, too.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We did a little freelance.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Let me cali you right back.
text: Frank hangs up.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: 21 hosts, 57 ‘forgs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: But where did you...?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We found a nest.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Little bastards on the run, guess
dialog: they find comfort in sticking
dialog: together.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That’s so stupid -- for them. But
dialog: it’s brilliant for us.
dialog: (beat; excited)
dialog: We should make you guys a task force.
dialog: You go out, take down these nests.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: And how do we get paid?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Lump sums. Big jackpots. Very classy.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: No thanks, I’1l stick to my
dialog: assignment.
text: Frank turns to Jake, clinging to this new concept.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How about it? I’1l put you with Ray --
dialog: he’d be great at mass extractions.
text: Jake looks at Remy. Can’t betray his friend.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don’t run on spec. Give me a pink
dialog: sheet.
text: Frank lets out a heavy sigh and hands Jake a pink sheet
text: with a yellow receipt attached. Jake scans his assignment.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: (impressed)
text: Jarvik job. Out in The Heights.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Nice ‘burb. Who’s the host?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: Says J.T. Bonasera.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: James Todd? Is that Jimmy T-Bone?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The record producer. Half a year past
dialog: due.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: But the guy’s gotta be a billionaire.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tax evasion -- IRS tagged his
dialog: residuals. Every time you hear one of
dialog: his tunes, the feds get a little
dialog: richer.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: How come I never heard of this guy?
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: ‘Cause you gotta have taste.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I have taste.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Uh-huh. He’s the one that did Baby in
dialog: My Sleeve. Carol and me, that was our
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So it’s a mercy killing.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: That's real nice.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Listen, I/11 make you a deal. You
dialog: come watch the game at my place
dialog: tomorrow, and I’11l switch you this
dialog: guy for Jamie Mulhearn.
text: Remy hesitates, masking his relief.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Yeah, okay. T-Bone deserves to get
text: his heart ripped out by someone who
dialog: appreciates his work.
text: As they exchange pink slips...
scene_heading: INT. REMY AND CAROL’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Remy enters to find Carol sitting on the couch, beneath a
text: shelf filled with trinkets from her store.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Hey. I got your wings.
speaker_heading: CAROL
text: Already ate.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Mind if I have ‘em?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Would that be before or after you
dialog: help Peter with his homework?
text: Remy checks his watch. Winces. Knows he screwed up.
text: Remy drops the sack of food on the coffee table. Surprises
text: Carol when he cuddles up next to her on the couch.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Hey, remember that song Baby in My
dialog: Sleeve? Jimmy T-Bone --
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
scene_heading: SUDDEN FLASHBACK --
text: THE SAME HOUSE -- moving boxes litter the floor. A BABY,
text: maybe two months old, sleeps in a carrier atop the same
text: coffee table. MOVING PAST...
text: Remy stands on the brand new couch, hanging the shelf on
text: the wall above it.
text: A younger, sexier Carol, wearing a nurse’s uniform, dances
text: over to him, hips swaying to the smooth hip-hop-jazz riff
text: of Jimmy T-Bone’s Baby in My Sleeve. She climbs up on the
text: couch, comes up behind Remy --
text: Kisses his ear, takes the hammer from his hand and drops it
text: to the floor. Remy turns into her, unzipping her uniform --
text: Lowering her to the couch, the two falling into one another-
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Where the now older, world-weary Carol moves away from
dialog: Remy.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Yeah, I remember. What about it?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Forget it.
text: Remy’s up and out of there.
scene_heading: INT. REMY AND CAROL'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Remy carefully cracks the bedroom door, then sneaks into...
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Remy crosses the darkened room, stands over a sleeping
text: PETER, his 10-year-old son. Runs a finger across his cheek.
dialog: Quietly:
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Sorry, buddy.
text: Remy turns to leave the room. Peter calls out to him,
text: groggy.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, Dad.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Did you do your report?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I started.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’1l help you finish in the morning.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Okay. It’s on the Romans.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: They were some bad-ass dudes.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Did you know they used to make people
dialog: fight with lions?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Barbaric. Go to sleep.
text: Remy heads for the door.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dad, why did the Romans stone people
dialog: to death?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Because they didn’t have any guns.
dialog: Goodnight.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Night.
text: And Remy closes the door behind him...
scene_heading: INT. REMY AND CAROL’S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Remy sits over a bowl of cereal. Carol, across from him,
text: reads the paper. It’s silent. Peter carries in several
dialog: books.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You ready, Dad?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Maybe we can skip the homework until
dialog: later tonight. First let’s go watch
text: the game at Uncle Jake's.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Peter, Jake is not your uncle.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: And tell your father we didn’t
dialog: discuss anything about going to his
dialog: house.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Tell your mother it’s just a barbeque
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I thought you had to work.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: It’s a night job. Come on, it’1ll be
dialog: good for the kid to get out. .
text: OFF Carol, unhappy but resigned...
scene_heading: EXT. JAKE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: Remy navigates his way through the crowded backyard,
text: dragging Carol and Peter behind him. Peter’s face is buried
text: in a handheld video game. Jake spots them coming.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, brought the whole family.
dialog: (rubs Peter's head)
dialog: You want a hot dog, Ham-bone?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I guess so.
text: Jake throws a hot dog on the grill. Peter fixes his hair.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You have a good day at school?
speaker_heading: PETER
text: It’s Saturday.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: So? When I was your age, we went to
dialog: school every day. And at night, too.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Nuh-uh.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Don’t lie to my child, Jake.
text: Jake rolls his eyes to Remy. Remy shrugs. His cell phone
text: RINGS. He pops it open.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Yeah?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No, I’m not home. It’s not a good
dialog: time.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Christ. Fine, take it to 1450
text: Greendale. Two minutes.
text: Remy snaps the phone closed.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: What? Nothing. I left some equipment
text: at the office.
text: Remy walks quickly to Jake, talks quietly.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Gimme your apron.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What’s up?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I got a mobile coming in. Keep Carol
text: and Peter busy.
text: He takes Jake’s apron and heads out. Jake calls over toward
dialog: Peter...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, Peter, you wanna flip some
dialog: burgers?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can we make the fire higher?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: c’mere, you little pyro.
text: Remy veers over towards Carol.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’1l be right back.
scene_heading: EXT. JAKE’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY
text: Remy waits at the curb, Jake’s red and white checkered
text: apron tied around his waist. A taxi cab pulls into the
dialog: driveway.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE CAB
text: The FARE peers nervously out the window from the backseat.
speaker_heading: FARE
dialog: I just want the Fairfield Downtown --
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Quick errand, buddy. Don’t worry, I
dialog: ain't charging.
text: The Cabbie makes a show of turning off the meter. On the
text: passenger seat is an artiforg scanner, blinking PAST DUE.
text: Remy approaches the cab.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24,
speaker_heading: FARE
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Relax, fella. Guy’s a friend of mine.
text: The fare, spooked, reaches for the far door handle -- but
text: it’s broken off. No way out. He turns back --
text: Remy opens the. cab door and TASERS the guy. He slumps.
speaker_heading: THE CABBIE
text: Adjusts the rear view mirror as Remy goes to work.
scene_heading: IN THE REAR VIEW
text: Scalpels fly, blood splatters. Remy moves quickly.
text: After a few moments, a bloodied Remy appears at the
text: Cabbie’s window; Remy tosses two hundred bucks at the guy.
speaker_heading: CABBIE (CONT'D)
dialog: For an extra fin, I'll get rid of the
dialog: body.
text: Remy tosses him a twenty. He hears a commotion behind him.
speaker_heading: JAKE (0.S.)
dialog: Carol, wait -- I’ve got a blanket --
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: It’s fine, my sweater’s in the car --
text: Remy jerks around to see Carol coming out of the house,
text: Peter at her side. Jake follows behind, trying to get her
dialog: to come back inside --
text: No luck. Carol stops on the front step -- freezes --
text: There’s Remy, bloodied, holding an artiforg as the cab
text: drives away. He, too, is frozen.
text: Peter actually looks up at his father for once --
text: Then, unimpressed, goes back to his video game.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT’D)
dialog: I am so done with this.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Cc’mon, it’s just a kidney...
text: Carol drags Peter into their car and guns the engine. As
text: she drives away.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I couldn’t keep her busy.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Yeah. I saw that.
text: Jake throws his arm around Remy.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I’‘1l give you a ride home after the
dialog: game.
scene_heading: INT. JAKE’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Jake pulls up into Remy’s driveway. Remy sighs as he eyes
text: the house. Lingering in the car.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I don’t know how you put up with it.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Every man’s suburban dream.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Not mine.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m gonna go do the T-Bone job first.
dialog: Give her time to calm down. You gonna
dialog: head over to Jamie Mulhearn’s?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Already been there. He says to say
dialog: hi.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You didn’t do it?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Oh, I did the job. He said to say hi
dialog: before that part.
text: Remy climbs out of the car. Stares at the house with dread.
text: Jake backs out. Remy heads straight for his own car and
dialog: climbs in.
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - NIGHT
text: JIMMY “T-BONE” BONASERA sits behind the mixing board in his
text: home studio, fiddling with various knobs and switches, fine
text: tuning the smooth riff that emanates from the speakers.
text: Remy approaches quietly from behind as T-Bone lifts a vial
text: of sparkling red powder, rubbing the substance into his
dialog: gums .
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Nice house.
text: T-Bone turns off the music, but doesn’t turn around.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Thanks. Ain’t really mine anymore.
dialog: You with the IRS?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: T-BONE &
dialog: Soul suckers are taking everything E
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: So am I.
text: T-Bone turns and looks at Remy for the first time. Spots
text: the duffel bag. The defibrillator unit. The tattoo.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Can I finish this song?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Of course. I’m a big fan.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: You could help. My assistant left two
dialog: weeks ago.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I don’t know. I’ve never made music
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: It ain’t complicated. A song’s just a
text: whole mess of tiny parts working
dialog: together. All you gotta do is break
dialog: the song back down. Extract the
dialog: individual parts.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I can probably do that.
text: As Remy takes a seat behind the mixing board...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: LATER. The final strains of the newly mixed song pour out
text: of the speakers. T-Bone listens, rapt, eyes closed. Remy
text: can’t control his smile, overwhelmed by the experience.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Now that’s a hit right there.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: The IRS will be thrilled.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Do me a favor. See that Mad Dog over
dialog: at Blue Note Records gets this.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: It’s done.
text: T-Bone pops out a memory stick; Remy puts it in his duffel.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: So we gonna do this, or what?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m sorry. I really am a big fan.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: A gig’s a gig, right? Should I sit,
dialog: stand?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Easiest if you laid down.
text: T-Bone lies on the floor. He unbuttons his shirt, then
text: pours a little more red powder and rubs it into his gums
text: one last time. His hand shakes a bit as he offers the vial
dialog: to Remy.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Wanna Q up?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I should probably do this straight.
text: He hands T-Bone a pen and a yellow repo receipt.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you mind? Less paperwork if I can
dialog: get the client to sign off before...
text: T-Bone signs his name on the bottom of the receipt, and
text: Remy nods his thanks. He lines up a scalpel, electric saw,
text: and a suction unit, then gathers the defibrillator.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: What’s that thing for?
speaker_heading: REMY
text: It’s a defib unit. Jarvik stops
dialog: pumping when you jolt it with an
dialog: electric pulse. Keeps me from losing
text: a finger.
text: Remy flips the defib unit on and it HUMS to life. He
text: twists the dial to 300...
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: This gonna hurt?
text: Remy rubs the shock pads together.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You won’t feel a thing.
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
text: T-Bone closes his eyes. Remy places the shock pads on T-
text: Bone’s chest. Depresses the thumb buttons, and suddenly....
speaker_heading: SPARKS
text: erupt out of the defibrillator pads! The explosion sends
text: Remy FLYING BACKWARDS through the air -- body twisted --
text: FREEZE-FRAME on half-dead Remy, mid-flight.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I have been knocked unconscious on
dialog: three separate occasions.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: INT. LONG WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Remy sits on a long bench, in military dress. Several
text: soldiers wait alongside him.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: First day overseas, my regiment was
dialog: sent for tests to see how we could
dialog: best assist the U.S. Military in the
dialog: African campaign.
text: Muffled BOOMS begin filtering through the walls. At first
text: they’re soft, but they grow louder... boom... Boom... BOOM -
text: Silence. After a moment, a door opens at the far end of the
text: hall. A NURSE steps out with a clipboard and stares at
dialog: Remy.
scene_heading: INT. TESTING ROOM - DAY
text: Big, gleaming white room. Sterile. In the center:
text: Remy, strapped to a metal framework that conforms to his
text: body like a vertical beach chair.
text: A DOCTOR pulls hard on each strap, then slips a pair of
text: goggles with wires coming out of them over Remy’s eyes.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: What is this thing?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: It’s a control chair. For the
text: concussion test. Head back.
dialog: 
text: The doctor squishes a helmet over Remy’s head.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: The what test?
text: But the doctor’s disappeared. Remy turns back, and suddenly
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: THE SAHARA DESERT
text: appears all around him. Nothing but sand for miles. A
text: muffled BOOM sounds in the distance, with a flash of light.
text: Remy squints, trying to make out the source of the
dialog: explosion.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Hello? Am I supposed to do something?
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
text: Through a one-way mirror, we can SEE Remy, the chair
text: shaking him around as the BOOMS grow louder.
text: The doctor takes a sip of tea and grabs a baseball bat,
text: wrapped in plastic, from a rack of bats on the wall. The
text: sign above reads STERILE.
scene_heading: INT. TESTING ROOM - DAY
text: Bat in hand, the doctor re-enters. Remy is still strapped
text: in his chair, grimacing as the virtual explosions
text: intensify.
scene_heading: REMY‘S POV - AN ARC OF FIRE
text: coming closer -- a missile heading directly for him, and --
speaker_heading: THE DOCTOR
text: WHACKS Remy in the head with the baseball bat.
dialog: curt TO:
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: That was knockout number one.
text: Moaning. Not erotic one bit. It’s the sound of pain.
scene_heading: INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY
text: Remy’s eyes flutter open, and he staggers to his feet --
text: Inside a long recovery room, filled with cots and moaning
text: soldiers, most still out cold. Remy’s the only one
dialog: standing.
text: The doctor approaches.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Congratulations, son. You’ve got a
text: very small brain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: Remy sits in a control chair -- like the one in the
text: concussion test -- at the front of this high-tech tank.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Small brains, big skulls. That’s why
dialog: Jake and I came out of concussions as
dialog: fast as we did.
text: Jake sits behind him in the gunner’s chair. A thin panel of
text: glass is between them. Remy puts his thumb on one side of
text: the glass, Jake does it on the other --
scene_heading: PRESSING THUMBS TOGETHER
text: as a light zaps across the surface, and the TANK ENGINE
text: roars to life. We have ignition.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And that’s why they put us in a tank.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: A row of tanks maneuver deftly over the sand, side-by-side.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: But by the time we finished training,
dialog: the war was already winding down.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: Remy writes a postcard; Jake plays solitaire. The monitor
text: in their tank shows three enemy soldiers waving
text: frantically, trying to surrender.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: It gave me time to write to Beth.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: The tanks mindlessly ROLL OVER the three soldiers.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: Remy’s writing yet another letter in back as Jake steers
text: the tank, gleefully targeting rabbits and snakes.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: But the more often I wrote, the less
dialog: I heard back.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
text: The tanks roll to a stop.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: And then, one night, it was over.
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
scene_heading: INT. MILITARY AIRPLANE - NIGHT
text: Freezing soldiers sitting side-by-side as they make their
text: way back to America. Remy flips through a meager pile of
dialog: letters.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: I hadn’t heard from Beth in two
dialog: months.
scene_heading: EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT
text: Remy strolls purposefully through the red-light area.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: My plan was to go in there, sweep her
text: off her feet, and take her away from
dialog: all this mess.
scene_heading: INT. BROTHEL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Remy storms in, past the waiting clients. The familiar
text: MOANS emanate from behind the curtain. Remy storms through -
scene_heading: INT. BETH’S ROOM - BROTHEL - NIGHT
text: Two beefy MARINES are servicing the lady on the bed --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Beth, your husband is home!
text: The marines turn -- the girl on the bed sits up --
text: It’s not Beth. The new prostitute SCREAMS --
text: The Marines, scowls on their faces, leap out of bed, draw
text: back their fists -- the punches FLY forward --
speaker_heading: BLACK
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And that takes care of the second
dialog: time I was knocked unconscious.
speaker_heading: END FLASHBACK
scene_heading: INT. MANSION - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Remy’s frozen in mid-air, having been shocked by the
text: electric defibrillator paddles. Somewhere, a typewriter
speaker_heading: CLACKS --
text: UNFREEZE. The mid-air fall resumes, Remy blasted backwards -
text: SLAMMING into a wall, crumpling to the floor below.
dialog: 32.
text: His eyes are open, but glazing over. A trickle of blood
text: runs from his nose. His palms are burned and blackened.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Blackout number three. This time, I
dialog: was legally dead for twenty minutes.
text: Jimmy T-Bone sits up and sees Remy laid out on the carpet.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: If T-Bone hadn’t spooked and called
dialog: the meds, there’d be no more story to
dialog: tell.
text: The guy grabs for a phone and frantically starts dialing.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Everybody's gotta be a fucking hero.
text: We HOLD on Remy’s blank stare as everything slowly goes...
speaker_heading: BLACK.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: When I came to, the first thing I saw
dialog: was...
scene_heading: CLEAVAGE. A GREAT SET.
speaker_heading: NURSE (0.S.)
text: I think he’s awake.
scene_heading: INT. REMY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Remy’s nurse pulls back. Hospital ceiling above.
text: Jake and Frank pop into frame, staring down at us --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Gave us a scare there, pal.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Looking good. Looking real good.
text: Remy’s about as far from good as you can get. An IV drips
text: into his wrist; a machine displays his weak blood pressure.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (barely above a whisper)
dialog: The... client...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Lookit this guy -- two seconds out of
text: a coma and he’s worried about work.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I got him, buddy. Soon as the medics
dialog: cleared you, I finished the job.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
text: Remy weakly holds out his thumb; Jake presses his against
text: it. Remy looks around the empty room --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Carol...?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I called her. She knows. I don’t
dialog: think she’s sending flowers any time
dialog: soon.
text: Remy nods. Then...
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I can’t... remember -- what --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Faulty shock unit. We got the boys in
text: the shop looking at it right now.
text: Jake and Frank share a look -- Remy notices --
speaker_heading: REMY

dialog: Sure. Yeah. Take my jobs for a few

speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It’s not... It’s not that.
text: Remy’s confused. Jake looks ashamed. Remy follows his gaze
dialog: over to
scene_heading: A SMALL METALLIC BOX
text: on a tall wheeled cart. Silicon tubing snakes out and into
text: an open incision in Remy’s chest.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: It’s a Jarvik 39. Top of the line --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: No. No no no -- get it out --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ten million beat warranty, it’s got

speaker_heading: JAKE

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Course you’ re not. You’re the top
dialog: Repo Man in this whole damn town. And
dialog: you can still gas, grab, and go, but

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

text: Jake and Frank jog after Remy --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What? What’d I say?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You asshole.
text: A nurse scowls at Remy as he stumbles by.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Sir, that’s hospital property --

scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
text: The automatic doors open, and Remy, already looking weaker,

text: Jake and Frank stand in the doorway.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Come back inside.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m... fine...

text: And he collapses five feet from the hospital doors. Remy
text: struggles to his hands and knees and starts to crawl.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Now you're just being childish.
text: Remy keeps crawling. Jake shakes his head, pained --
text: nothing he can do. Heads back inside.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
text: Hours later. Two PARAMEDICS whisk a gurney and patient away
text: from an ambulance, and the vehiclé moves out --
text: Revealing Remy, on his stomach, maybe five feet from where
text: he was six hours ago. Still trying to crawl.
text: Hospital PATIENTS and VISITORS step over Remy, paying him
text: no mind as he gasps and wheezes, barely able to move.
text: Frank sits on a nearby bench, smoking a cigarette. Waiting
dialog: Remy out.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

dialog: able to take each individual breath -- when Frank’s

scene_heading: INT. CLIENT’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: A middle-aged man is on the floor, out cold. Shattered

text: Remy’s hand trembles.
dialog: 
dialog: pees
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: But it wasn’t like before.
text: He sits back, takes a breath, and re-applies the scalpel --

text: Then he runs into the kitchen and pukes in the sink.
scene_heading: INT. MONTEGO BAY BAR - NIGHT
text: Jake drinking, laughing. The usual. Remy sits beside him,

speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Suddenly, everything was different.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: And then the guy just started crying.
text: Bawling like a little girl, begging.
dialog: And this snot bubble comes out of his

dialog: bigger it got. Bigger and smaller,
dialog: bigger and smaller...
text: PUSH IN on Remy...
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: I was still swapping stories with

scene_heading: INT. DESTROYED BUILDING - NIGHT

text: soft, almost sweet SONG sings out. It grows louder.
scene_heading: INT. CAVERN - DESTROYED BUILDING - NIGHT
text: An open-air space amid all the rubble. A group of cellar-

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: BETH

text: Remy can’t help but grin. This is his kind of woman.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Gotta admit -- the gal had spunk.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Remy’s come to a decision. He walks down the hall into:
scene_heading: INT. REMY AND CAROL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Carol does the dishes. No spunk left any more. He walks up
text: to the sink; she doesn’t look at him.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m going.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: No. I’m going.
text: Now she turns. Accepting it, knowing it was going to
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: What do you want me to tell Peter?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’1l tell him myself.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Peter sleeps in his bed, a handheld video game in his

speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Eventually.
text: Remy backs out of the room without waking him.
scene_heading: INT. REMY AND CAROL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Remy lugs his life’s possessions past his old bedroom,
text: Carol sound asleep in the background.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: I'd like to say I left to keep Carol
dialog: from having to take on my financial
dialog: burdens.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Peter stirs awake. Rubs his eyes, looks out the window --
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
text: As his dad loads up his car and pulls out.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Or so the boy didn’t have to watch

scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Remy pulls his car up to the curb and looks in
text: THROUGH A WINDOW
text: where Beth lies on the bed, watching T.V.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: But it was something else that drew
dialog: me away.
text: Remy reclines his car seat and pulls a jacket over him for
text: warmth. He’s going to sleep out in the car tonight.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Remy enters, waking Beth, who stretches, happy to see him.

speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Peanut butter -- the crunchy kind,
dialog: like you like, soft toothbrush,
dialog: strawberry toaster strudel, and mint
dialog: shampoo.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh. I don’t really like mint shampoo.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Shampoo’s for me.
text: She looks at him askance -- he’s never taken a shower there
text: before. He motions out the window --
text: Where his car, with all his stuff, sits. Beth realizes he’s
text: moving in, and can’t help the smile that comes to her face.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - DAY
text: As Beth helps Remy lug his possessions into their room.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: My living situation was one thing. My
dialog: work situation was another. No repos

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Beth stirs noodles in a pot, cooking their meager dinner.
text: Remy sits at a table nearby, PINGING Beth with his scanner,

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So what happens if somebody catches
dialog: you at the computer?
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Entering falsified returns, grounds

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Don’t get caught.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Good plan.
text: Remy smiles. Beth stirs the noodles, thinking. Then...
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, I could go back to work.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Why not? a

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Be nice. I’m your wife.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Ex-wife. And this is as nice as I
dialog: get.
text: The scanner WHOOPS it up again; yet another readout from
text: Beth’s overdue body.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you even know how many ‘forgs
dialog: you've got in there?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Let’s see... liver, pancreas,
dialog: kidneys, stomach, and lungs from the

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Hey, it’s a tough gig out there.
text: Hooker down the street shows up with

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Wanna see?
text: Beth moves towards him.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Jackson Reproductive Replacement

text: She straddles Remy; he barely protests. She unbuttons her

speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
text: It’s right behind my Kenton stomach
text: ES/18. Lady Mystique model. Comes in
text: six sparkling colors.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Which one did you choose?

text: Beth moves Remy’s arm further down her body --
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Shocking... pink...
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: And your hips...
text: Remy slides his hands down her hips, moving them across her

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Flexor Durajoints... million step

text: Now Remy’s clothes are coming off, too --
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: You haven’t asked me about my lips...
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (feeble protest)
dialog: Come on. I’m married.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah. To me.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I guess I never signed any divorce
dialog: papers.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Me neither.
text: And then Beth pulls Remy into a hard kiss as they move into
dialog: one another -- naked now, free --
text: The artiforg printouts fall to either side as Remy throws
text: Beth down on the table, their bodies thrusting
dialog: desperately...
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
text: Remy wakes up beside a naked Beth. Tries to sneak out of

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: And now?
text: Beth thinks for a beat.
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: BETH

scene_heading: INT. CREDIT UNION ARTIFORG LOCKER - NIGHT
text: Remy sneaks through piles of lacquered boxes, each one an
text: artiforg that’s been returned to the Union.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
text: A mortgage. Motel rent. A manager who
dialog: wanted double or he’d snitch. And
text: that damn Jarvik, ticking away inside
dialog: my chest.
text: He grabs a lacquered box, opens it, and takes out the
text: metallic organ within. He begins rasping away the serial

speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: It all took cash, and I didn’t have
dialog: the guts anymore. But I could make it

text: REMY AT THE COMPUTER
text: Typing fast, keying in the serial number from a pink slip.
text: Glancing around nervously.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Beth had fifteen outstanding

scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT
text: Remy sneaks by a sleeping GUARD, then turns --
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Except for the part about not getting
dialog: caught.
text: Jake is there. He’s seen everything.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Hey.
text: They stare at each other; neither knows what to say. Jake
text: leans against the Credit Union sphere-and-bolt statue. When
text: it finally begins, their conversation is as casual as ever.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: a4
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: My uncle was a bank robber. I ever
dialog: tell you that?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Uncle Joe?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Nah, my mom's brother, Lou. Made a
dialog: whole mess of the West Coast,
dialog: knockin’ over savings and loans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And the man was good at it -- nobody
dialog: knew a damn thing. Most days, he woke
text: up and went to work at the auto shop,
dialog: but every so often he’d skip out for
text: lunch and pull on a ski mask. Fifteen
dialog: years he did this. And then one day,
dialog: he forgot to wear gloves, and they
dialog: pulled a print from some bullshit
dialog: drunk and disorderly twenty years
text: back. A day later, the cops were
text: knocking on his door.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Lemme guess -- he was relieved.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No, he was fucking pissed.
dialog: (beat; softer)
dialog: But he just wasn’t that guy anymore.
text: He was off his game, and he knew it.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Maybe it was a blessing.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Maybe.
text: They stare at each other, understanding each other
dialog: perfectly.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: What am I supposed to do for money? I
dialog: can’t do anything else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: It’d be the same for me.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Then what?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You find a way. Talk to Frank about
dialog: the sales thing. Make Carol happy.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: And if I suck at it?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Do something else. But you gotta keep
dialog: those payments coming. Soon as you
dialog: fall behind, that’s Day One.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: And six months later...
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: We put a guy on you.
text: Remy stares off, the reality hitting him hard. He sees
text: Raymond Pearl walking off with a fresh pink sheet.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Probably Ray.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Or me. Job’s a job.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Job’s a job.
text: Remy turns to leave. His fate is set. Then turns back --
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is he now?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Uncle Lou.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: You know that erotic cake shop up on

speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Is he happy?
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: He makes pornographic desserts for a

scene_heading: EXT. MALL - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. CREDIT UNION - FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Remy sits across from a beleaguered looking Frank.
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Frank surprised me. He took it better
dialog: than I expected.
text: Frank erases Remy’s name from the big board. Then -- throws
text: the eraser at the wall in anger. He’s lost his best guy.
scene_heading: INT. CREDIT UNION - FRONT OFFICE - DAY
text: Remy, looking uncomfortable in suit and tie, sits across
text: from a family of four in a sales booth.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Mr. Timmons, you owe it to your
dialog: family. You owe it to yourself.
text: The sickly looking patriarch nods and takes the pen. But
text: before he signs, Remy continues...
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: ‘Course, if you can’t pay your bills,
dialog: some Union guy like me might show up
dialog: next to your bed, wake you out of a

dialog: to reclaim our property.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m just saying.
text: The man drops the pen. His wife faints.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I wasn’t cut out for sales.
scene_heading: INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
text: Remy raises a cleaver high into the air. His apron is
text: covered in blood.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: But I had to work. So I tried
text: something a little more in line with
dialog: my training.
text: Remy slams the cleaver down onto a butcher block --
text: separating a sirloin steak.
text: Remy’s trying his hand behind the deli counter. He whacks
text: at a slab of meat, over and over again, juices flying --
scene_heading: THE DELI CUSTOMERS
text: back away from the counter, horrified.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Six months, and I must have tried

scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Remy, in an embarrassing T.G.I.Friday’s type ensemble
text: delivers several meals to a table full of college guys. One
text: particularly assholish frat guy waves Remy over, lifts his
text: hamburger bun to show that his food is not cooked right.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: The customer, they say, is always
dialog: right. I’d never really thought about
dialog: what that meant before.
text: Remy takes the basket of food and jams it into the guy’s
text: face, knocking him over in his chair --
text: And then wailing on him while the stunned frat boys look
dialog: on.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Remy and Beth pack up. Clothes. Work gear. He gently packs
text: away his scalpels, ether cannisters... Looks at them fondly.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: It’s amazing how fast a hundred and
dialog: eighty days can go by.
text: Beth puts a hand on Remy’s arm.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: If you go with me, you’re done.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m done anyway.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Crappy street. Crappy neighborhood. Remy and Beth, their
text: bags at their feet, stand outside Remy’s car.
text: Remy pulls out a glass bottle filled with gas, a soaked rag
text: in the neck. He lights the rag with a match --
text: And tosses the bottle into the front seat of his car.
text: He and Beth walk away, bags in hand, as the fire engulfs
text: the car, erasing any trace of its existence.
scene_heading: EXT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Remy and Beth keep their heads low as they stick to the
text: shadows along a trash-strewn sidewalk.
text: As they head toward the entrance of this sad excuse for a
text: building, we realize it’s the same burned-out hotel on the
text: same ugly abandoned road where we first met Remy.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Welcome to paradise.
dialog:

dialog: 59.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Remy and Beth scope out the rooms, trying to find a

speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
text: There are hiders, and there are
dialog: seekers.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - INSIDE FOYER - NIGHT
text: Beth takes the reins, showing Remy how and where to board
text: up the windows, doors, setting booby traps, etc.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Hiding was new to me. But Beth had
dialog: practice.
text: She reaches over and turns off Remy’s flashlight.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Rule number one: Natural light only.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
text: As Beth and Remy root through a dumpster. Remy holds up two
text: pieces of fabric, one blue, one red. Beth points to the
dialog: red.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 403 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: And they hang the red fabric over the window.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Curtains!
scene_heading: INT. BUSTED-UP ROOM - TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Remy RIPS open a hole in the wall with a hammer and fluffy
text: pink insulation pops out.
text: Beth grabs a handful and shoves it into a pillowcase, and
text: Remy does likewise.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 403 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: The decorations are complete, a woman's touch amid the
text: debris. Candles, a blue tarp for a tablecloth, a stolen
text: mattress for a bed. Flowers poke out of cracks in the wall.
text: Remy lays out weapons: Taser, scalpel, shotgun...
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Remy searches through piles of broken furniture, testing
text: busted chair legs and posts for use as potential weapons.
text: As he swings a piece of wood through the air, he notices
text: something beneath a pile. He clears away trash to find:
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
text: An old typewriter. He grabs it, blows off the dust. Tests
text: the weight, as if to use it to crush in someone’s head, but
dialog: then gets another idea...
text: The faint CLACK of a typewriter sends us:
scene_heading: INT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: RACING through the dilapidated lobby, up the stairs, and
dialog: into...
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 416 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Where Remy sits at the typewriter, naked, back where we met
dialog: him at the very beginning. We’re now where we first came
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: But you can only hide for so long
dialog: before they find you.
text: Suddenly, LAUGHTER. Remy, spooked, leaps to his feet.
text: Shotgun in one hand, pistol suddenly in the other.
text: Laughter again. Distinct. High-pitched. Remy tenses --
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Remy, shotgun in hand, follows the laughter. Coming from
dialog: down the hall --
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 438 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Louder now, interspersed with voices. Remy presses himself
text: against the wall, breathing hard. Shotgun out the window --
text: Children. THREE LITTLE GIRLS, playing in the courtyard
dialog: below.
text: Remy relaxes as the girls pull out a jump-rope and begin
text: chanting a song to count out their game:
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRLS
dialog: There was a man from Troubadour/ Who
dialog: got blown up during The War/ He did
dialog: not die, would not concede/ How many
dialog: artiforgs did he need? Stomach!
dialog: Bladder! Pancreas! Eyes! Intestine!
dialog: Heart! Kidney! Liver...
text: Remy shakes his head at his own paranoia --
speaker_heading: BETH (O0.S.)
dialog: If you're going to shoot the kids,
dialog: aim for the big one. More meat on
dialog: her.
dialog: 61.
text: Remy lowers the shotgun barrel and turns to find Beth. She
text: tosses his clothes at him. Remy begins to dress as Beth
text: walks over by the typewriter.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: For a guy who’s so paranoid, you sure
dialog: make a lot of noise.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: The writing helps me think.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What is it? A book? Epic poem?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: It’s a letter.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: To who?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Peter. My son.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I never played you for a dad.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Neither did I.
text: Beth moves forward, then stops -- alarmed --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Somebody’s coming.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You don’t hear it?
text: Beth and Remy peek out the window, peering down to the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: All I hear are those damn kids.
text: DOWN IN THE COURTYARD
text: The girls are still jumping rope, now singing...
speaker_heading: JUMP ROPE GIRLS
dialog: Tell it to the Mama/ Tell it to the
dialog: son/ They all be gone when the day is
dialog: done/ On come the wrinkles/ On come
text: the sneeze/ The old man dies on his
dialog: old man knees...
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
text: BACK AT THE WINDOW
text: Beth grabs Remy’s ear lobe, twisting. He yelps.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Still natural? I can’t believe you
dialog: haven't upgraded these.
text: Beth digs through a nearby crate and fishes out a long,
text: thin wire. Tiny pad on one end, a metallic jack on the
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Put this in your ear.
text: Remy looks down at the tiny pad, watching as Beth inserts
text: the metallic jack into her ear cavity. It digs in tight,
text: finally CLICKING into place.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Vocom makes share wires?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It’s aftermarket. Shut up and listen.
text: Remy puts the “earphone” into his ear to share Beth’s
text: amplified hearing.
text: Suddenly, bis world comes alive with sound. Past the girls’
text: singing. Past the traffic. Finding a BARKING dog in the
text: distance. An arguing couple, ignoring the quiet CRIES of
text: the baby in the next room.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (incredibly loud)
dialog: What am I --
text: Remy and Beth both cringe at his overly amplified voice.
text: Beth scolds him with her eyes, showing him the small wheel
text: controls in the skin behind her ear that she continues to
text: amplify, screening out the ambience. Focusing.
text: Wings flapping. Footsteps. And finally, the familiar
text: PING! PING! of an official Union-issue scanner.
text: Remy yanks the wire out of both of their ears.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Get away from the window.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Raymond Pearl reaches into his duffel, extracting a taser,
text: a scalpel, and an enormous gun. Clearly not Union issue.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 403 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: REMY
text: Ray Pearl. Psychopath with a Union

speaker_heading: REMY

scene_heading: EXT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: Gun in hand, Raymond strides right past the jump rope
text: girls. They continue their chant, the rhythm growing
dialog: faster...
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 403 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: Tension mounting as Remy and Beth run short on time.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: There’s the back fire escape --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: No. I have something better. Follow
dialog: me.
text: As Beth follows Remy towards the hall...
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: Raymond’s boots kick up dust as he mounts the stairs, his
scene_heading: scanner honing in. PING - PING - PING -
scene_heading: EXT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: On the jump rope girls’ feet, skipping impossibly fast.
speaker_heading: JUMP ROPE GIRLS
text: The old man dies on his old man
dialog: knees!
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - 5TH FLOOR - TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: Raymond kicks a door off its remaining hinge. The room is
text: charred out. A blue tarp sits on the otherwise rotted
text: floor. Remy sits on the far side of the room, typing.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Pathetic. I can’t believe you were a
dialog: Level Five.
text: Remy looks up. Mock surprise.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: They sent the ear guy after me? That
dialog: hurts.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You're a funny guy. I’11 laugh at
dialog: that when I got your heart in my
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (seductively)
dialog: Ooh. Come here, sweet talker.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: It’s gonna be a pleasure rippin’ off
dialog: that tattoo.
text: Remy stands for a fight. Raymond bull rushes. And just as
text: he trounces across the middle of the blue tarp...
text: THE BURNED OUT FLOOR GIVES WAY
text: Wood splintering, cracking -- Raymond plunging downward.
text: Remy looks up at Beth, who was hiding behind the door. They
dialog: share a smile...
text: UNTIL THE REST OF THE FLOOR CONTINUES TO CRUMBLE.
text: Beth backs up against the wall -- the floor cracking
text: towards her -- Remy leaping -- but she’s swallowed up --
text: Remy watches in horror as Beth plunges two stories down, a
text: loud CRACK as she hits the floor near Raymond. Remy bolts.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 314 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: Beth lays amid a ton of debris, barely conscious, clutching
text: her badly twisted knee. She spots Remy’s gun on the floor
text: nearby. Reaches -- straining --
text: Raymond drags himself along the floor, battered and
text: bloodied, but still moving forward. He grabs the gun,
dialog: looks up --
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You'll do.
text: A sick smile crosses his lips -- he pulls the trigger --
speaker_heading: A FOOT
text: Stomps Raymond’s hand back down, pinning the gun to the
text: floor. The SHOT goes wild.
text: Raymond looks up to see Remy standing over him, pumping the
text: sawed-off shotgun...
scene_heading: EXT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - DAY
text: A terrifying BLAST freaks out the jump rope girls. As they
text: sprint off, leaving their jump rope behind... .
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - TYLER STREET HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Remy carries an unconscious Beth toward their room. She
text: emits a small groan, eyelids fluttering.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (soft, almost tender)
dialog: Hey, there. You’re back with us.
text: Beth’s hand rifles upward, clamping hard around Remy’s

speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: (choking)
dialog: Beth -- it’s me --

text: quickly releases him. Remy coughs --
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Jesus Christ --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Sorry. You live on the streets long

text: She brushes herself off and tries to stand --
text: Nearly falling again. Her artiforg knee is a mess.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Let me carry you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’ve got it.
text: Beth tries to take a few more steps, but limps horribly.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Come on, you’re leaking hydraulic
text: fluid all over.
speaker_heading: BETH .
dialog: I can fix it myself.
text: She sits on the floor and tears open her pants, exposing
text: her open wound. Her metallic kneecap glints in the
text: moonlight, the artiforg metal puncturing her natural flesh.
text: Reaching into her bra, Beth pulls out a small package of
text: tools -- screwdriver, hammer, miniature soldering iron. She
text: fiddles with the artiforg, wincing from the pain.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (staring at her knee)
dialog: You know how quick I could pluck that

speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: Wouldn't -- really -- help us.
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Under 12 seconds.
text: Beth stops what she’s doing and looks at Remy, then twists
text: away at something metal in her leg. It CLICKS.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I think I got it. Help me up.
text: Remy pulls Beth to her feet. Her limp’s not so bad now, but
text: she’s clearly in pain.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT’D)
dialog: It‘ll hold.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We can’t rest, we have to go. They
dialog: found me faster than I thought.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You think there’11l be more of them?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Once they’re on you, they don’t stop.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So what do we do?
scene_heading: EXT. MALL - DAY
text: The Mall, as usual, is abuzz with activity. Remy slinks
text: down a side street and into an alley.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND MALL - DAY
text: Larry The Lung steps out into the alley and, with a grunt,
text: removes the top half of his costume. He’s just a teenager.
text: The half-dressed lung pulls out a cigarette and lights up.
speaker_heading: REMY (O.S.)
dialog: Hell of an example you're setting.
scene_heading: LARRY THE LUNG
dialog: ‘Hey, pal, I’m on a break --

speaker_heading: REMY

dialog: mouth.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - OUTSIDE CREDIT UNION - DAY
text: Crowded, as usual. Customers wait in line outside the
dialog: Union.
text: Larry The Lung, in full costume, walks toward the Union;
text: customers wave and smile at him, and he waves back.
scene_heading: REMY’S POV - INSIDE THE COSTUME
text: there’s little room to maneuver. Remy peers out through two
text: hidden mesh eyeholes, trying to keep up the act.
text: He walks down the line of ailing. customers --
speaker_heading: HEAVYSET MAN (0.S.)
dialog: Hey! Hey, Larry!
text: Remy is spun around by a HEAVYSET MAN holding a coughing
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: HEAVYSET MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You think we could get a picture?
text: The guy throws an arm around Remy, lifting the dying pooch
text: into his face as his WIFE takes a snapshot. He sing-songs:
speaker_heading: HEAVYSET MAN (CONT’D)
dialog: We’re gonna get Muffin here a new
dialog: widdle biddie heart, aren’t we? Yes
dialog: we are! Top of the line! Yes we are!
text: Remy extricates himself and heads for the Union doors. As
text: usual, two GUARDS man the metal detectors.
text: Remy does his best to wave at them -- they wave back -- he
dialog: walks through --
text: ALARMS BLARE. Remy instinctively keeps walking --
text: But ARMED GUARDS swarm out of every crevice like roaches
text: with the lights turned off. Customers start to shout --
dialog: Remy spins -- more guards --
text: Turns back to run out -- even more -- he’s trapped --
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
text: But the guards and alarm aren’t for him. They're .
text: surrounding a FREAKED-OUT MAN in a white shirt, his voice
text: high, crazed.
scene_heading: FREAKED-OUT MAN
dialog: Is this the return line? Somebody
dialog: tell me, where’s the return line?
text: The guards tighten the circle.
speaker_heading: FREAKED-OUT MAN (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m here to -- I missed a few
dialog: payments, but -- but I thought rather
dialog: than make you guys come out --
text: Raising his scanner, the lead guard PINGS the customer.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: We've got an eight month past due
text: pancreas out here.
text: The man unbuttons his shirt.
scene_heading: FREAKED-OUT MAN
dialog: I didn’t want to make it difficult. I
dialog: know how hard it is, trying to keep a
dialog: profit margin -- ‘cause you have to
dialog: pay the -- the Repo Men --
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Sir, just calm down and you can come
text: inside, talk to a credit supervisor.
text: But the guy’s too far gone to talk anything out.
scene_heading: FREAKED-OUT MAN
dialog: So I thought maybe -- maybe if I did
dialog: it for you -- you’d gimme a break --
text: He takes off his pants, tossing them on the mall floor, and
text: in the process, he’s pulled out a 9-inch KNIFE --
text: The guards raise their rifles -- the crowd cowers -- the
text: man raises the knife high --
text: And STABS it into his own stomach.
text: Everyone stops, transfixed, as he pulls the knife back and
text: forth, committing fully to this odd hari-kari --
text: Then, raising his free arm high, like a salute --
text: He PLUNGES his hand into the wound. Grunting softly, his
text: expression barely changing, he tugs at something. Hard.
text: He stumbles forward -- a new scream from the crowd -- and
text: then backwards, still tugging, still searching --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
text: And with his final ounce of strength, he yanks mightily --
text: Ripping out his artificial pancreas. He holds it in the
text: air, the cords and tissue and blood dripping to the floor --
text: And then collapses in a heap outside the Credit Union
text: doors. Chaos ensues.
speaker_heading: CONFUSED GUARDS
text: start SHOOTING the dead man’s body -- customers screaming --
text: As Frank angrily rushes into the mall. He glances at the
text: carnage and picks up the pancreas.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who reclaimed this organ? Who
dialog: reclaimed this goddamned organ???
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: The customer, sir. He did it himself.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Credit Union clients do not reclaim
dialog: their own organs.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Yes, sir. This one did, sir.
text: Frank stands in the doorway, looking at the bloody mess.
text: Shaking his head. Disgusted.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Customers. Don’t know their goddamned
dialog: place anymore.
text: We MOVE with a pissed-off Frank back into:
scene_heading: INT. CREDIT UNION - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: As all the worried CLIENTS file out of the sales cubicles,
text: trying to figure out what the commotion was.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nothing to worry about, folks. Just a
dialog: little misunderstanding. Free coffee
text: in the cubicles.
text: Frank pushes past the crowd, moving into:
scene_heading: INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Walking to his desk -- still steaming --
text: When the door SLAMS behind him. He turns --
text: And is suddenly on his knees, forced into a headlock. He
dialog: looks up --
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: REMY
text: stands over him, his bottom half still dressed in the Larry
text: the Lung costume.
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Afternoon, boss.
text: With a single move, Remy flings Frank into his office
text: chair. Remy pulls a pistol on him with his left hand --
text: And with his right, he slaps
text: A PATCH OF SKIN,
text: bearing Ray’s Union tattoo, onto the desk. Still bloody.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s what’1ll happen to the next one
dialog: you send. And the one after that. I
dialog: can guarantee you'll run out of Repo
dialog: Men before I run out of ways to kill
dialog: them.
text: Frank stares at Remy. At the gun pointed in his face.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Can I say something?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: It’s your office.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How long before you slip up?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: That's the $800,000 question. Give or
dialog: take.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And the girl?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You come after her, you come after
dialog: me.
text: Frank nods -- he understands.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shoulda taken the job as the lung.
dialog: You look good in that costume.
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Itches like a motherfucker.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, that’s what the kid says, too.

speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t suppose you’1l wanna stick
dialog: around for an exit interview?
text: Remy smiles a bit at that -- shakes his head --
text: Then TASERS Frank into unconsciousness.
text: Remy hauls the top half of the Larry the Lung costume back
dialog: on. Time to head back out.
scene_heading: INT. TYLER STREET HOTEL - STAIRWELL - DAY
text: Remy, out of costume now but still flush with adrenaline,
text: bounds up the stairs, a bag under his arm --
scene_heading: INT. ROOM 416 - TYLER STREET HOTEL - CONTINUOUS
text: And into the hotel room. Beth sits at the far end of the
text: room, an odd, strained look on her face.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Your knight in bulletproof armor just
dialog: bought us some more time. Plus,
text: stopped at the store and lifted some
dialog: of those artichoke hearts you wanted -
text: But Beth’s expression doesn’t change. She looks... scared?
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JAKE (0.S.)
dialog: Your ex-wife’s quite the hostess.
dialog: Served me coffee and everything.
text: Remy freezes. He knows that voice.
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: sits behind him, at the other end of the room. The jig is
text: pretty much officially up.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: That’s the thing with me and Jake:
dialog: Somehow, no matter where we were, he
dialog: always ended up right behind me.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACK:
scene_heading: INT. TANK HANGAR - DAY
text: A DRILL SERGEANT leads a younger Remy, Jake, and a gang of
text: eager soldiers down a long hallway.
scene_heading: DRILL SERGEANT
dialog: You tank boys will be training inside
dialog: this hangar.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DRILL SERGEANT (CONT'D)
dialog: It is where you will eat, where you
dialog: will shit, and where you will sleep,
dialog: because once you’re in the desert,
dialog: that tank will be your home. You will
dialog: only be allowed outside into the real
dialog: world once you have proven that you
dialog: will not fuck it up.
text: They come to a stop inside a hangar, where tanks sit side-
text: by-side, evenly spaced. The drill sergeant hands out
text: numbers. Remy gets number 2; Jake has number 8.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRILL SERGEANT (CONT’D)
dialog: You will be assigned to tanks based
dialog: on number, because your names no
text: longer matter. In the heat of battle,
dialog: I do not want your meager minds taxed
dialog: by the difficulty of remembering your
dialog: names.
text: He looks down at his clipboard:
speaker_heading: DRILL SERGEANT (CONT'D)
dialog: Number one and number five, take your
dialog: tank. Don’t touch anything.
text: The two soldiers salute and run toward a tank, scrambling
text: up top to drop down inside. He walks along, assigning more -
speaker_heading: TIG
dialog: Numbers four and ten, take your tank.
dialog: Don’t touch anything. Six and nine,
dialog: take your tank. Don’t touch anything.
dialog: Two and eight, take your tank --
text: Remy and Jake start to run --
text: BOOM -- an explosion behind them --
text: SOLDIER #5 is launched upwards out of his tank at 100MPH --
text: SLAMMING into the ceiling of the hangar --
text: And falling, THUDDING to the ground at Remy’s feet, still
text: strapped into an ejection seat. He’s quite dead.
text: A moment later, his parachute opens near the top of the
text: hangar and flutters down next to his body.
text: The sergeant takes one look at the body on the floor.
scene_heading: DRILL SERGEANT
dialog: Don't - touch - anything.
scene_heading: INT. TANK - DAY
text: Remy sits in a control chair -- like the one in the
text: concussion test -- at the front of this high-tech tank,
text: twisting and turning as he tries to get comfy.
dialog: 73.
text: Jake sits behind him in the gunner’s chair.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)

speaker_heading: BACK TO:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Carol never served me coffee.
text: Jake’s got his taser out, but he’s not pointing it at
text: anyone. Yet. Remy couldn’t make a move if he wanted to. And
text: though their conversation is casual, it’s strained. Tense --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Beth does a lot of things Carol
dialog: doesn’t do.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I was just at the office. Musta
dialog: missed you.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Actually, I’m on a new assignment.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Oh yeah? Who’s the client?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Just some asshole I spent half my
dialog: life with. Here’s the thing, though:
dialog: I got this smokin’ chick coming over
dialog: tonight.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: No shit.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: And she’s easy --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Just your type.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I'd hate to leave her waiting for me.
dialog: Maybe it’d be better if I didn’t
dialog: start hunting this guy down til
dialog: tomorrow morning. :
text: Remy’s eyes narrow -- is Jake giving him an out?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Sure. Get a good night’s sleep.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Only... the thing that worries me is
dialog: what happens if this fucker finds a
dialog: way out of the country before nine
dialog: A.M. tomorrow? You know I’m a 48
dialog: states kinda guy. I don’t do South
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Then I guess... he’d be clear?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I guess so. If he could get out.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Which he couldn’t.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: No. Never happen.
text: Jake stands, brushes off his pants. Goes to the door.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Hey --
text: Jake turns. Remy starts to speak, then stops. Instead of
dialog: whatever he was going to say, he just says:
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: See you later.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Try not to.

scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - SECURITY CHECK - NIGHT
text: Long lines snake around the airport terminal as PASSENGERS
dialog: wait to pass through metal and weapons detectors --
text: As well as walk-through artiforg scanners. A bored-looking
text: REPO MAN sits next to one of them. He waves a BUSINESSMAN
dialog: to walk through --
text: A green wave of light washes over the businessman's body --
text: As an ARTIFICIAL LIVER appears inside his body, as if
text: glowing from within. It’s just a projection, a hologram-
text: type image placed onto his frame, but it clearly shows his
dialog: artiforg.
text: A PING sounds out, and a bulb above him turns green. He
text: walks through.
text: The Repo Man waves the next passenger in, and we MOVE BACK
text: through the line to find Remy and Beth, waiting their turn.
text: Blood from Beth’s knee wound still seeps through a bandage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So he’s just letting us go?
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Jake doesn’t let anybody go. He’s
dialog: giving us a head start, that’s all.
dialog: What we do with it is up to us.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But nobody ever gets through the
dialog: airport. I don’t like this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m not in love with it, either. Just
dialog: try and hide that limp.
text: Remy checks the area, then swiftly walks to the front of
text: the line, lifting his sleeve so the passengers see his
text: tattoo. They don’t come near him.
text: He approaches the bored Repo Man -- who perks up, eyes
text: opening wide -- he recognizes Remy --
text: Remy grabs him and pulls him to the side, speaking quickly.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Look -- I know you know what’s going
dialog: on, and I know what kind of
dialog: commission’s in it for you. What I
dialog: don't know is how many other Union
dialog: guys you've got in shouting distance,
dialog: but I’d lay short odds they’11 get
dialog: here long after my scalpel’s stuck in
dialog: your throat.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now: Will you help me?
speaker_heading: AIRPORT REPO MAN
dialog: Yeah. Christ, man, of course, for you
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Good choice. See the little lady in
dialog: line? She’s with me. When we go
dialog: through, all you have to do is shut
text: down the scanner. Once we're past,
dialog: power it back up again. Two seconds,
dialog: tops. Got it?
text: The Repo Man nods. Remy’s back to all smiles as he steps in
text: line next to Beth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: . REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s taken care of.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What do I do?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Just walk.
dialog: 76.
text: Indeed, when they get to the walk-through scanner
speaker_heading: THE REPO MAN
text: flicks a switch.
scene_heading: REMY AND BETH
text: hustle on through and
speaker_heading: THE REPO MAN
text: flicks the system back on. Just that fast. The lights are
text: back on, more passengers are streaming through, and all
dialog: seems just like it was before.
text: Remy and Beth walk away, down toward the gates.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: That was easy. Let’s do it again!
text: She playfully turns around, and Remy grabs her waist and
text: spins her back. No time for games yet.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT GATE - NIGHT
text: Remy and Beth sit on uncomfortable plastic chairs, waiting
text: for their flight to board. The gate sign reads SAO PAOLO,

speaker_heading: REMY‘S WATCH
dialog: reads 8:30
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What do we do once we get there?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We'll talk about it in the air.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: REMY
text: In the air.
text: Remy scans the crowd -- passengers going by, everything
dialog: seems normal --
text: But something's odd. He stands, looks around --
text: Out of the corner of his eye, he notices
speaker_heading: THREE REPO MEN
text: burning down a stairway, heading for their terminal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
text: Remy grabs Beth, running behind the gate counter. The GATE

text: He turns to Beth -- and grabs her knee. She winces --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m sorry. This is going to hurt. A
dialog: lot.
text: Before she can respond, Remy braces her leg with his knee,
dialog: locking her in place --
text: And whips out a scalpel, going for her knee. We move away --
text: As Beth clamps her lips tight, suppressing a scream. Remy
dialog: working as fast as he can. Just as he said, he’s an expert -
text: Seconds later, he holds up her overdue artiforg kneecap.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait here.
text: It’s not as if Beth has a choice -- she’s passed out.
text: Remy pops up from behind the counter and practically jogs
dialog: up. to the:
speaker_heading: AIRPORT REPO MAN
text: who looks back and forth -- from Remy to the approaching
text: Repo Men hustling down to the terminal. He’s petrified --
speaker_heading: AIRPORT REPO MAN
dialog: C’mon, man, it’s what you would have
dialog: done --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You're right.
text: With incredible force, Remy JABS an edge of the artificial
text: kneecap between the Repo Man’s shoulder blades. He grunts --
text: As Remy steps away, up to the approaching Union Men, and
text: points out the Repo Man, frantically batting at his back.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: There he is. Easy commission.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Hiding behind a dumpster. Remy watches over Beth, who's

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Did we... make it?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Yeah. We made it. Welcome to South
dialog: America.
text: Beth’s eyes flutter open. She sees the alley. They close
text: again in defeat.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Fuck you.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You need a new kneecap.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Great. Let's go down to the Credit

text: Remy lets out a heavy sigh -- there’s no good plan.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I know somebody who can help.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We can’t trust anyone. There’s a

speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.)
dialog: Those sleazy motherfuckers took food
dialog: off my table for years. Black market,
dialog: aftermarket, whatever you wanna call
dialog: it, they’re vultures, plain and
dialog: simple.
text: After several beats of darkness, the door reopens and a
text: flashlight pierces the darkness. A rail thin, beady eyed
text: OUTSIDER sleazoid slinks into the house. Approaches the
text: fallen body, then sets to work, flashlight in mouth,
text: plucking out the remaining artiforgs, tossing them in a
dialog: sack.
speaker_heading: REMY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: He used to leave me a key up here...
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: How well do you know this asshole?
text: Beth just smiles. Remy’s eyes narrow.
text: RUMBLE. Down the hall. It’s a freight elevator. We hear a
text: DING -- the SHOOSH of doors opening -- then a CREAK, CREAK -
text: Remy tenses, pulling his gun -- edging in front of Beth --
text: A leg slides into view -- only it’s horizontal and three
text: feet off the ground. Then another leg --
text: And a shopping cart -- with a DEAD BODY inside.
text: Pushing it along is ASBURY, the Outsider. Big ol’ fro, nose

speaker_heading: ASBURY

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m not with them anymore.
speaker_heading: ASBURY

speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: Thought of you when I tweaked these.

text: Beth begins talking, clearly not in control of her voice --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: He used to leave me a key up here.
dialog: Asbury. He’s a friend. Sort of --
text: Asbury grins and punches another button. Beth shuts up.
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: Vocom auto playback, four hour lapse.
text: A real head-blaster at parties.
text: As Asbury pulls the dead body into his work area, Remy
text: takes a look around at all the artiforgs on the shelves.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You pay for these?
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: You payin’ for yours?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: That's different --
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: Oh yeah? I’m Robin Hood, U-man. I can
dialog: lift a valve out some fresh meat,
dialog: drop that ‘forg in a client half-
dialog: cost, cash.
text: Asbury reaches into the stomach wound of the dead body and
text: fishes around with his bare hands. He plucks out a metallic
text: liver and tosses it on the table, then goes back for more.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Or he can do it the legal way --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: How’s a vato in the ghetto gonna up-
dialog: front the Union? Nah, uptown it’s all
dialog: about the equity. Only equity I care
dialog: about is hangin’ in your skin.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Ever been out to the desert? The
text: vultures die when the hunters go
dialog: home.
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: So that’s how you wanna play it --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Boys?
text: Beth lifts her pants leg -- the knee looks even worse than
text: before. Asbury knocks off the pissing contest.
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: Okay. I’m tight with a surgeon gal.
dialog: She’1l mech up that knee better’n
text: Kenton hisself.
text: Asbury rips out the dead man’s eyeballs and tosses them
text: into a container filled with artiforg eyeballs -- they
speaker_heading: SQUISH --
speaker_heading: ASBURY (CONT‘D)
dialog: Whoops. Natural babies there.
text: He scoops the real eyes out and 3-points them into the
dialog: trash.
scene_heading: INT. SURGEON’S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Beth lays down on a makeshift operating table in this funky
text: run-down apartment.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Asbury says you’re the best mechie
dialog: around.
text: Reveal ALVA. She has 32 eyebrow rings and purple hair woven
text: into corn rows. Green beads at the end of her braids click
text: against each other as she moves.
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Mechie. I swear, I don’t understand
dialog: what that boy’s saying half the time.
dialog: Just call me Alva.
text: A seven year old GIRL scampers into the room, her purple
text: hair also woven into corn rows. Same eyebrow jewelry.
speaker_heading: LIL’ ALVA
dialog: Another one, mom?
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Yeah, another one. Just let mama work
dialog: a minute.
text: Lil’ Alva climbs up and has a seat on the counter right
text: next to Remy, her legs kicking.
speaker_heading: ALVA (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s Lil’ Alva.
speaker_heading: LIL’ ALVA
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: Hi.
text: Alva gives Beth an injection in the upper arm.
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Now, before we start, I need to know
dialog: about your other artiforgs.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Which ones?
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: All of them.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: To fix my knee?
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: The interrelationships are all real
dialog: delicate, so I need brand names,
dialog: dates, everything.
text: Beth takes a deep breath, then launches into it...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: My intestines are the UltraCoil P
dialog: Series with optional rapid flush.
dialog: Liver is a Hexa-Tan, it’s a specialty
dialog: house in Denmark. I got it in
dialog: Robin’s Egg Blue, my favorite color.
dialog: Not that that matters. My kidneys
dialog: are actually two different models...
dialog: (eyelids closing)
dialog: One is Union generic. Didn’t hold up
dialog: so well. So I upgraded the other...
text: to a top of the line Taihitsu...
dialog: (yawns)
dialog: Built-in... ketone monitor...
text: And... boom, Beth’s asleep.
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Lord, I thought she was gonna go on
dialog: forever.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Don’t you need to know about her
dialog: other artiforgs?
speaker_heading: ALVA,
dialog: Nah, that’s just my version of count
text: backwards from one hundred.
dialog: (to Lil’ Alva)
dialog: Alright, baby. You're up.
text: Lil’ Alva suddenly jumps down off the counter. Approaches
text: Beth’s still body as the elder Alva moves away.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Wait, she’s the surgeon?
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: I just do anesthesia these days.
dialog: Little one’s got a real steady hand.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: She’s like five years old!
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: She’s seven. But she’s been doing it
dialog: since she was four. Ain’t that right,
dialog: pumpkin?
speaker_heading: LIL’ ALVA
dialog: Shhh!
text: Lil’ Alva concentrates as she works the laser into Beth’s
text: knee like a kid playing a video game. Remy squirms, but
text: holds his tongue.
scene_heading: INT. ASBURY’S LOFT - DAY
text: Asbury hoses down the blood from his work station, humming
text: himself a tune. A KNOCK at the door interrupts him.
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: (calls out)
dialog: ‘Lo? My mechie score you up already?
text: No answer. Asbury drops the hose, heads through the Chinese
text: screens to investigate. As he arrives in the front hall...
speaker_heading: THE DOOR
text: swings open to reveal... Jake.
speaker_heading: ASBURY (CONT’D)
dialog: U-Man number two. You boys re-gen
dialog: like the cancer.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I understand you've seen a friend of
dialog: mine. I need to talk to him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
text: Asbury’s not sure how to handle this request. As Jake
text: steps into the apartment...
scene_heading: EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
text: Remy and Beth walk briskly down the sidewalk, keeping their
text: faces hidden. Beth’s knee is better than new, but she
text: doesn’t seem too happy.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I can’t believe you let Raggedy Ann
dialog: cut on me. And you just stood there --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You're walking fine --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: That’s not the point. You said it
dialog: felt weird, so you should’ve stepped
dialog: in --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’m not the one who sent you there.
dialog: Take it up with your Outsider friend.
scene_heading: INT. LOFT HALLWAY - WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY
text: Beth and Remy approach Asbury’s apartment. The front door
text: is open. Remy shoots Beth a look.
scene_heading: INT. ASBURY’S LOFT - DAY
text: The loft looks no different, but Remy’s on edge. He steps
text: in front of Beth and leads her through the Chinese screens,
text: an intricate maze of blacks and reds --
text: Asbury is on a sofa, a hole where his stomach used to be.
text: Blood stains the floor, the couch. Beth gasps at the sight.
text: Hand over her mouth, near tears, Beth approaches her dead
dialog: friend --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Let’s get out of here.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We don’t even know what happened --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We know enough.
text: Beth kneels by Asbury’s side and closes his eyelids.
text: There’s a WHIRR as his artiforg eyes shut down --
text: And Beth gets an idea. She runs to a shelf and rifles
dialog: through a box we saw earlier --
text: Beth holds up Asbury’s Vocom Universal Remote.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Four-hour lapse, right?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Sure, if he’s got a Vocom --
text: She points the remote control at Asbury and presses the
scene_heading: REWIND button --
text: Asbury’s jaw CLICKS open, and a WHIRR emanates. Beth hits
text: STOP, looks to Remy. He nods -- go on -- and she pushes
speaker_heading: PLAY.
text: SCREAMS of pain burst forth from Asbury’s mouth --
text: Beth, freaked out, STOPS the sound.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT'D)
text: Little more rewinding.
text: Beth hits REWIND again, and after a few seconds, she
text: prepares to make another go at it. PLAY.
text: Asbury’s jaw CLICKS open again, and the dead man, with no
text: facial expressions whatsoever, begins to talk, his jaw
text: slightly out of sync with the words:
speaker_heading: ASBURY
dialog: -- whoops, natural babies there...
dialog: You goin’ alone?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: This is it -- keep going --
speaker_heading: ASBURY
text: Three blocks down, fifth floor.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Go on, I’1l be stylin’ when you flip
dialog: back around. Sleep it out here if you
dialog: need to. Hasta luego.
dialog: (beat; seemingly to self)
dialog: Damn, girl's looking on top.
text: Beth can’t help but smile at his posthumous compliment.
text: There’s a long pause; Beth hits FAST-FORWARD. As soon as
text: she hears sound -- PLAY --
speaker_heading: ASBURY (CONT’D)
dialog: ‘Lo? My mechie score you up already?

text: A sudden grunt from Asbury’s throat -- a gurgle --
text: The SCREAMS start again -- loud, piercing, pained --
text: Remy punches STOP. He looks to Beth --
scene_heading: INT. LOFT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: They run for the stairs, jumping over some unfinished
text: construction, bricks scattered along the ground. Remy
text: throws open the stairwell door to find --
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: He looks almost as upset at seeing Remy as Remy does at
text: seeing him.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Afternoon, partner.
speaker_heading: REMY
text: Afternoon.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: (to Beth)
dialog: Good to see you again.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Can't say the same.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I heard about the airport.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I like to put on a show.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Wish you woulda done a better job of
dialog: running.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: That makes two of us.
text: Jake leans against a wall, but keeps his eyes on Remy.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Frank’s got everyone’s balls ina
text: vise back at the shop. Security boys
dialog: working overtime. He couldn’t stand
dialog: how easy you got inside.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: He thought that was easy?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Any case, he’s doubling commissions
dialog: on priority one debtors, which is
dialog: pretty much the two of you. So.
dialog: thanks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: My pleasure. Buy a boat.
text: Jake takes a step forward; Remy steps back. A slow circle.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Do me one favor.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Anything.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You and me, one on one. Leave her
dialog: alone.
text: Jake lifts his scanner and PINGS Beth. The screen FILLS
text: with artiforg numbers, all PAST DUE. A Repo Man’s wet
dialog: dream.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Fine. She walks now.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Wait just a second --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Go. Run downstairs. Don’t look back.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What am I, a golden retriever?
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Take the deal, lady.
text: Beth steps closer to Remy. She’s made her decision. Jake
text: nods -- it’s what he expected. He unholsters his taser.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT'D)
dialog: I‘1l make it fast.
text: Remy takes out his own taser.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Me, too.
text: Jake sticks his thumb out --
text: Remy presses his thumb against Jake’s.
text: GRABBING Remy’s wrist, Jake pulls him close, striking out
dialog: with the taser --
text: Remy knocking it away, spinning, firing with his own taser -
text: The prongs SLAMMING into the wall behind Jake.
dialog: 89.
text: Remy jumps on top of Jake, wrestling him to the ground.
text: There’s no fancy kung-fu moves -- it’s just a grunt-and-
text: groan contest, each trying to get leverage --
text: Remy pulling his scalpel from his waistband, getting it up
text: near Jake’s neck, Jake holding him off with one hand --
text: Reaching for a brick on the ground with the other --
speaker_heading: BETH (0.S.)
dialog: Look out --
text: Remy turns to see
speaker_heading: THE BRICK
text: coming toward his head, Jake whipping it through the air --
speaker_heading: BLACK
text: Silence. For just a moment, then, fading back in:
speaker_heading: BETH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Get up. Come on, get up, we have to
dialog: get out of here.
scene_heading: REMY’S POV - BETH
text: comes into focus, standing over him.
text: They’re still in the Outsider’s hallway --
speaker_heading: JAKE
text: lies on the floor, twitching from a taser blast. Beth,
text: taser in her hand, helps Remy to his feet.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT’D)
dialog: You want to finish this off?
text: Remy looks down at the scalpel in his hand, then to Jake.
dialog: He can’t do it.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Let’s just go.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Now. Back to Alva’s.
scene_heading: INT. SURGEON'S APARTMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Ain’t nothing I can do to help you.
text: Alva busies herself, cleaning the surgical equipment. She
text: won't look at either Remy or Beth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
text: Lil’ Alva sits atop a table, legs dangling.
speaker_heading: LIL’ ALVA
dialog: What about --
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Hush up.
speaker_heading: BETH g
dialog: The guy who’s after us -- he killed
dialog: Asbury. That doesn’t even matter to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: We all go about our lives in our own
dialog: ways. Running’s no different.
speaker_heading: ‘ BETH
dialog: That’s a nice fucking attitude --
text: Remy puts a hand out. Stops Beth. Opens the door.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: We get it. You’ve got a little girl
dialog: to protect. I’ve got a son, I
dialog: understand. Odds are I won't see him
dialog: again, but...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I definitely understand.
text: They turn to leave. Alva’s clearly upset with herself for
text: turning them away. She takes a moment to make a decision --
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Wait.
text: Remy and Beth stop in the doorway.
speaker_heading: ALVA (CONT'D)
dialog: {to Lil’ Alva)
dialog: Run on up and get momma’s shotgun.
text: Lil’ Alva grins widely and scoots into another room.
speaker_heading: ALVA (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s a long way to the railroad.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
text: Alva leads Remy and Beth down a maze of alleys. Lil’ Alva
text: bounces along next to them, carrying her own shotgun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIL’ ALVA
dialog: C’mon, slowpokes!
speaker_heading: ALVA
dialog: Keep your voice down, child.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Are you sure this is the right way?
speaker_heading: LIL’ ALVA
text: Right up ahead.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Maybe we should turn around --
text: A chorus of SHOTGUN PUMPS echo out. Remy looks up --
text: To find himself and Beth surrounded by five MUSCULAR WOMEN
text: pointing shotguns at them. Lil’ Alva turns and smiles
dialog: widely.
speaker_heading: LIL’ ALVA
dialog: Told ya.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
text: RHODESIA, a thick black woman with a confident air, leads
text: Remy and Beth through this low-slung hall.
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: Every day, the Union gets hungrier,
dialog: and every day we take in more just
dialog: like the two of you.
text: As they walk, Remy’s sleeve rides up. Rhodesia sees his
text: Union tattoo. He self-consciously pulls the sleeve back
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: RHODESIA (CONT'D)
dialog: It don’t matter to me, honey. So long
dialog: as Alva vouches for you, y’all got a
dialog: home down here.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Where exactly is “down here?”
text: They’ve come to a door. Rhodesia opens it wide --
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - DAY
text: The Willy Wonka Candy Factory of artificial organs.
text: Row after immense row of twenty-foot shelves are devoted to
text: stacking box upon box of high-demand artiforgs. This is
dialog: where they keep the inventory for wholesale orders.
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: Welcome to the Railroad.
text: Remy runs his hand along a shelf. Artificial hearts,

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: RHODESIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Kenton supply warehouse for the whole
dialog: city. Can’t nobody ping you up in
dialog: this hole.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Don’t they check it?
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: “They” is me, and no, I do not. Gal’s
dialog: got to have a day job, this is mine.
text: Beth looks around at all the artiforgs.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So if a repo man scans the building --
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
text: Screen fills with so many ‘forgs
text: makes him wanna cry.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (appreciating the idea)
text: Looking for a haystack in a field of
text: haystacks.
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: Come. on back, we’ll get you set up.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - IN BACK - DAY
text: A camp, of sorts, inside the warehouse. Ramshackle bunks
text: have been constructed within the artiforg boxes, hasty
text: blankets and mattresses set up on each shelf.
text: Dozens of ragged MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN sit around a
text: sterno pot, warming themselves.
text: A SCRAGGLY MAN, on his last legs, eats food from a tin can.
text: A FAMILY, the FATHER trying to keep his KIDS warm.
text: AN OLD LADY, her artiforg knuckles (gleaming brass,
text: naturally) moving quickly as she knits a blanket.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: They’re all wanted by the Union?
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: Most of ‘em. Some are family members,
dialog: couldn’t stand to let mommy or daddy
dialog: run on their own.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, we'll get you two settled in the
dialog: far corner. It’ll take a few weeks to
dialog: find good mattresses, so ‘til then --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Wait, lady -- hold on. We’ve got to
dialog: get out of the country. Tonight.
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
text: A smile curls the ends of Rhodesia’s lips. She calls out:
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: Everybody who needs to get out of the
dialog: country tonight, raise your hand.
text: Everyone’s hand shoots up high. Rhodesia turns back to
dialog: Remy.
speaker_heading: : RHODESIA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve got 953 outbounds and six --
dialog: count ‘em, six -- jammers on hand. So
dialog: unless you've got something real damn
dialog: impressive up your sleeve other than
dialog: that ugly-ass tattoo, I’d say you’d
dialog: better find a place to bunk down for
dialog: the next year or so.
text: Remy looks to Beth. Rhodesia throws them a pair of
text: blankets, and walks off.
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - ON SHELF - LATER
text: Beth does her best to prepare their bunk, piling up
text: blankets, trying to make the shelf, amidst the organs,
dialog: comfortable.
text: Remy, now without his typewriter, scribbles in longhand on
text: his piece of paper. Beth tries to get a look.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: When do I get to read it?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: When it’s done.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: When's that going to be?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I don’t know. When I’m dead, I guess.
speaker_heading: T-BONE (0.S.)
dialog: They told me you were here. Had to
dialog: see it with my own eyes.
text: Remy turns to see T-Bone Bonasera, the record producer
text: whose heart he tried to zap, climb up the edge of the
dialog: shelf.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: T-Bone?
speaker_heading: T-BONE
text: In the flesh, baby.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I thought... They told me --
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: I was dead? You think I was gonna
dialog: stick around, wait for the next Repo
dialog: Man to pop in?
text: Beth comes over, can’t suppress her grin.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So that makes two of us that got away
dialog: from you.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: (to Beth, re: Remy)
dialog: This man was my wake-up call. Second
text: I saw him lying on my floor, eyes all
dialog: glazed, I said T-Bone, you’ve got to
dialog: get your life in order. So I
dialog: hightailed it down here to
dialog: Rhodesia’s, got my ass off the Q, and
dialog: tonight I’m s’posed to be off to
dialog: Punta del Este and the warm ocean
dialog: breeze.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You've got one of the jammers?
text: T-Bone pulls out a small device with a bunch of wires on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: I did.
text: He puts the jammer in Remy’s hands.
speaker_heading: T-BONE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now you do.
text: Remy doesn’t know what to say. He starts to protest, but --
speaker_heading: T-BONE (CONT'D)
dialog: You saved my life. Tried to kill me
dialog: first, but sometimes that’s how it
text: goes down.
text: Remy’s stunned. He looks to Beth, who looks away. He
text: stands, turning her back around.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You should go. Before me.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No. The Union wants you more.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You’ve got 15 overdue ‘forgs --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But you were one of them. They can’t
dialog: take the risk of having you on the
dialog: loose.
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: There’s got to be another way --
text: Beth grabs Remy and kisses him. That shuts him up.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Jake knows you. He knows where you’1l
dialog: go. And the longer you’re here, the
dialog: more you put everyone else at risk.
dialog: It’s the right decision, and Remy knows it.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I don’t want to leave you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You’1l find me again. You always do.
text: They stare at one another. There’s no good way to do this.
speaker_heading: T-BONE
dialog: Time’s wasting, Repo Man.
text: Remy, with no other choice, takes the jammer and steps to
text: the edge of the shelf. He looks back one last time --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’1l write you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: This time, I’1l write back.
text: Remy jumps off the end of the shelf.
scene_heading: INT, EQUIPMENT CENTER - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RHODESIA

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And what’s in Punta del Este?
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: It ain’t what’s there -- it’s what’s

speaker_heading: RHODESIA

speaker_heading: THE SCANNER
dialog: 
text: WHOOPS as the screen fills with Remy’s artiforg heart
dialog: information.
speaker_heading: RHODESIA (CONT’D)
dialog: Now flick it on.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: It won’t work, The Union’s already
dialog: figured out all the jammer
dialog: frequencies.
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: Your boys fingered the 3.5 model.
dialog: This is 3.6. Go on, give it a try.
text: Remy flips a button on the box. There’s no discernible
text: change. Rhodesia PINGS Remy again with the scanner --
text: Empty. The scanner’s clear, as if Remy’s totally natural.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: How long have these been around?
speaker_heading: RHODESIA
dialog: Long enough to fool you, honey.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
text: Remy, keeping his head down, stands in line at security,

speaker_heading: UNION MAN

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: REMY

speaker_heading: ATTENDANT
dialog: They always do. So, if you’d care to
text: move onto the jetway, an attendant
dialog: will show you to your seat.
text: Remy doesn’t move.
speaker_heading: ATTENDANT (CONT’D)

dialog: We HOLD on Remy...
scene_heading: INT. SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - ON SHELF - DAY
text: As Beth sits on her pile of blankets, leafing through the
text: pages of the book that Remy left behind. She’s all alone.
speaker_heading: REMY (O.S.)
dialog: How's that book?
text: Beth looks up to see Remy, climbing onto the shelf. She
text: can’t help but smile.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It’s alright. A little preachy.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: What's it about?
speaker_heading: BETH
text: It’s a fairy tale. Bio-Repo Man loses
text: his heart and finds his soul.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I wouldn’t go that far.
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: CAROL AND

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You already tried hacking the
dialog: computer.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Not exactly. Before, I was on site,
text: trying to log in bogus ‘forgs.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So how’s this any different?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: If I can access the mainframe in
dialog: Union headquarters, I can reprogram
dialog: the network. Make it think your
dialog: accounts are all paid in full. You’1l
text: show up clean on the scanners.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Won't they figure it out?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Eventually. But by then we’ll be
text: drinking margaritas and picking sand
dialog: outta our asses.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Okay, but how are we supposed to get
dialog: into Union headquarters?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I know a guy on the inside.
speaker_heading: CAROL (0.S.)
dialog: Oh - My - God.
speaker_heading: PETER
text: gotten on the train. Remy tries to move away --
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey! Union man!
text: Heads turn. Remy changes tactics.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Sorry, lady. Got the wrong guy.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: You could have told me that years
dialog: ago, saved me the trouble.
text: Remy keeps his voice low, controlled.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: This is not a good time.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Not a good time, you sonofabitch?
text: Other passengers begin to listen in, putting Remy’s
text: surprise melodrama on stage. This could be dangerous.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT’D)
dialog: That’s a brilliant reason why you
dialog: took off on your son and haven’t sent
dialog: a single mortgage payment. Not a good
dialog: time -- you think that’11l hold up in
dialog: court?
text: He looks to Peter -- to Carol --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I can’t do this right now. Maybe one
dialog: day I can call and explain, but for
dialog: now I‘d appreciate it if you’d just
dialog: go away.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: That’s how you handle everything,
dialog: isn’t it? Rip it out and toss it
dialog: away. I’m sure that’s exactly what
dialog: you'd like. All your problems to just
dialog: disappear, poof, all by themselves --
text: Suddenly, Carol’s eyes go wide, her entire body tensing
text: with a sudden and powerful jolt. Then she drops to the
text: floor in a heap, eyes rolled back in her head. Remy looks
dialog: up to see...
speaker_heading: PETER
text: With Remy’s taser in his hand, the metal knobs sparking
text: with residual energy. He smiles, a bit unsure, at Remy --
text: Who grabs Peter and hugs his boy close.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (happily)
dialog: That was very naughty what you just
dialog: did. Very, very naughty.
text: He holds Peter at arm’s length, then reaches into his bag
text: and pulls out the manuscript, bound with a rubber band.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: When you’re old enough, read this.
dialog: And if you still want to talk when
dialog: you‘re done, you come and find me.
text: Peter nods and takes the book as the train pulls into the
text: next station. Remy gives him one more hug --
text: Remy and Beth hop off the train as the doors close and the
text: train pulls away, taking Peter and a comatose Carol with
dialog: it.
scene_heading: INT.:MALL - OUTSIDE CREDIT UNION - NIGHT
text: The line of sick, elderly, and frail is endless. Frank
text: begins lowering the steel gate, calling out --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Credit Union number 418 will reopen
dialog: for business tomorrow morning at ten.
text: A sad groan of disappointment from the masses.
speaker_heading: FRAIL LADY
dialog: Sir, please. I may not make it to
dialog: morning. I’ve been waiting in line
dialog: since six A.M.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Then show up tomorrow at 5:59.
speaker_heading: FRAIL LADY
dialog: I'd like to speak to the manager.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You just did.
text: The gate CLANGS shut and Frank heads off.
text: Reveal Remy and Beth, hiding in the shadows, as they watch
text: Frank walk away...
scene_heading: EXT. MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Frank unlocks his car door, sits inside. A moment of
text: confusion as Frank processes the tiny glass shards all over
text: the car. Some fucking vandal must have broken his window.
text: Suddenly -- WHAM! Frank’s car seat collapses backward --
text: As Remy pops up from the backseat and JAMS a long metal
text: trachea into Frank’s open mouth. Blood trickles from
text: Frank's lip as he struggles, chipping a tooth --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Relax, Frank. You might need your
dialog: air.
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
text: Beth on Frank now, wrapping duct tape around his mouth,
text: crudely holding the artiforg windpipe in place.
text: Remy pulls out an artificial lung, clamping it to the
text: trachea. His finger hovers over a tiny black lever.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
text: I flip on this Yoshimoto and dial up
dialog: deep inhalation mode --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Suck all the air right outta you.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Instant raisin. Now drive.
text: Remy shoves the seat back up as Frank meekly drops the car
dialog: into reverse...
scene_heading: EXT, STREET - NIGHT
text: As the car shoots down the road --
scene_heading: EXT. CREDIT UNION HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: The gigantic Union sphere and lightning bolt looms on the
text: portico of this state-of-the-art structure. Security
text: cameras sweep the area.
text: Remy and Beth step out from the shadows of the parking lot -
text: Remy’s got an unconscious Frank over his shoulder.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: (to Beth)
dialog: Did you have to knock him out?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I don’t trust him.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You don’t have to carry him.
scene_heading: AT THE ENTRANCE
text: Frank's face drops into frame, his chin SLAMMING down a
text: metal shelf. Remy pries one of his eyes open. A retinal
text: scan confirms Frank’s identity. A beep, and the door slides
dialog: open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: See? It’s all who you know.
text: Remy drops Frank's body to the floor and heads inside.
text: Beth follows, and the door closes behind them.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. UNION HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: A staircase spirals up the darkened lobby. A giant
dialog: i Computer banks, quite retro in their size,

text: Remy and Beth bolt up the stairs --
dialog: §
scene_heading: INT. ACCOUNTING OFFICE - UNION HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
text: A single computer sits in the middle of the room, and Remy
text: moves to it. He takes a seat and begins typing.
dialog: The photos of debtors flick by --
text: Landing on Remy’s own. A few more keystrokes, and Beth’s
text: face is right beneath his. He hits one more button --
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: I’ve got it.
speaker_heading: ON SCREEN
text: beneath their pictures: PAID IN FULL.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: what -- that easy?
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Hey, I’m good.
speaker_heading: A METAL LUNG
text: comes crashing down on Remy’s head, knocking him to the
text: ground. He looks up --
text: To see Frank standing over him, raw red skin around his
text: mouth and neck where he’s torn the duct tape off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: This just makes me sad. You know how
dialog: hard it is to find a good Repo Man?
text: He kicks Remy in the ribs. Frank’s quite pissed.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT’D)
dialog: A man who can extract all night long
dialog: and come in the next morning at nine
dialog: A.M. ready to do it all again?
dialog: 
text: Another kick. Remy tries to stand, gets knocked down --
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT’D)
text: A man who, at the end of the day,
dialog: just doesn’t give a shit about other
dialog: people?
dialog: 
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: JAKE (0.S.)
dialog: They’re a dying breed.
text: Jake stands at the door, taser by his side. He approaches
text: the fallen Remy.
text: Frank, surprised but happy, looks at his watch as he takes
text: Remy’s taser from his pocket.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let’s wrap this up. I’m a half hour
dialog: late for my reservation at Le Foie.
text: Jake offers a hand to Remy. Helps him to his feet.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I really wish you would have done a
dialog: better job of running.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: That makes three of us.
text: Suddenly, Beth makes a move, bolting out of the accounting
text: office and escaping into the darkness.
speaker_heading: REMY (CONT’D)
dialog: Two of us.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Enough chat, Jake.
text: Jake takes a step toward Remy, who holds his ground.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Sorry about beating your ass in the
dialog: third grade.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You shoulda seen the other guy.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Jesus Christ! Do your goddamned job,
dialog: or I’1l do it for you!
text: Jake nods. Knows what he has to do. Remy nods back.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: A job’s a job.
text: Jake turns to Remy and winks. He flicks his taser on --
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Fuck that.
text: And wheels around, SHOOTING the taser at
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: who convulses and drops to the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT’D)
dialog: You know how long I’ve wanted to do
dialog: that?
text: Jake gives Remy a hand up. Remy’s eyes go wide --
scene_heading: ON A SECURITY MONITOR
text: GUARDS are streaming into the building.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Let’s get the fuck out of here.
scene_heading: INT. UNION HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - NIGHT
text: Jake and Remy run for the stairs --
text: To find two guards already running up. They turn back to
dialog: the other exit --
text: To find three more guards coming their way, guns drawn.
text: Jake and Remy go back-to-back. This is it --
scene_heading: A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM
text: Pierces the silence from behind the guards. Several whip
text: around, but see nobody. Then another piercing voice --
speaker_heading: VOICE #1
dialog: Please, no, dear God, no --
dialog: And another, pleading --
speaker_heading: VOICE #2
dialog: -- I have kids, three kids --
text: Hiding beneath the staircase, we find
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Wielding the Universal Remote from Asbury’s apartment.
text: She’s creating the cacophony, making the repossessed Vocom
text: voice boxes housed in the Union play back their dying
text: hosts’ final words.
text: More screams join in, hundreds of pleading voices bursting
text: out at once, all trying to fight off Repo Men for survival.
speaker_heading: THE GUARDS
text: begin firing in all directions in the confusion. Remy
text: tasers a nearby guard, clearing a path. Jake crunches
text: another’s nose, making a bloody mask.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Over here!
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
text: Remy looks to find Beth at the exit. It’s all clear. He
text: runs down the stairs to her, turns --
text: To see Jake, still on the second floor, fighting off three
dialog: more guards.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Come on!
text: A guard sees Remy, runs for him --
text: And Jake steps in to intercept, tasering the guard --
text: But leaving himself wide open.
speaker_heading: A BULLET
text: pierces Jake’s body. Then another. And another.
text: Remy’s powerless to stop it as Jake staggers backwards,
text: tips over the railing and falls towards
text: THE SPHERE AND LIGHTNING BOLT STATUE BELOW
text: The sound is horrific.
text: Jake lies motionless, IMPALED on the giant lightning bolt.
text: SPARKS flicker out of the giant computer bank below the
text: bolt as his blood runs into the circuitry.
text: Remy moves’ towards him --
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: We have to go. We have to.
text: Remy stands there, motionless. Beth pulls at his shirt,
dialog: tugging --
text: And Remy gives in. They run out.
text: The computer continues to SPARK as Jake’s blood seeps in,
text: sending arcs of electricity through the air.
speaker_heading: BETH AND REMY
text: run down a long corridor toward the exit, Union computer
text: monitors SPARKING and BLACKING OUT as they run past.
scene_heading: ANOTHER UNION SECURITY CAMERA
text: picks them up as they exit the building --
scene_heading: ON THE SECURITY MONITOR
text: as Beth and Remy run for their car --
text: A burst of STATIC -- and the picture goes to
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: BLACK
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY CHECK - AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
text: The long lines, the usual scanners. The same Union Man who
text: double-crossed Remy earlier on waves the passengers through
text: First one stops in the scanner, light washes over him:
speaker_heading: PAID IN FULL
text: Next to step in is
speaker_heading: BETH
text: moving nervously through the scanner. The wash of light --
text: PAID IN FULL. She smiles, relieved, moves on.
text: And right behind her, moving confidently --
speaker_heading: REMY
text: walks through the scanner, locking eyes with the Union Man
text: he knows full well is onto him. But the light comes on:
scene_heading: PAID IN FULL.
text: The Repo Man takes out his hand-held scanner and SCANS Remy
text: Nothing. No pings, nada. He starts scanning random people --
scene_heading: PAID IN FULL. PAID IN FULL, PAID IN FULL.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: You might wanna get that thing looked
dialog: at.
text: Remy pats the Repo Man on the back and walks right on by,
text: as the guy angrily pounds his scanner, trying to get it to
dialog: work.
text: Remy and Beth stroll down the nearest jetway and board the
text: next flight to Bogota. By the time the Repo Man looks up
text: again, they’re gone.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: A TV SET, BLACK AND WHITE

speaker_heading: REPORTER

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: REPORTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Credit Union spokesmen have denied
dialog: rumors of sabotage, claiming that
dialog: they do not yet know what caused the
dialog: disruption of their computer banks
dialog: and the sudden closure of all
dialog: outstanding artiforg accounts,
dialog: leading to the collapse of the
dialog: world’s largest corporation.
scene_heading: PEOPLE RUNNING THROUGH THE STREETS, ARTIFORGS IN THEIR ARMS
speaker_heading: REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Nearly every city with a Credit Union
dialog: Depot has reported widespread looting
text: and vandalism, and many experts
dialog: believe it’s only a matter of time
dialog: before martial law is declared across
dialog: the country...
text: The sounds of the SURF overwhelm the reporter’s voice, and
dialog: we PULL BACK to find ourselves on:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - PUNTA DEL ESTE - DAY
text: Impossibly beautiful ocean, beautiful sky. A SUNBATHER
text: turns off his portable TV and returns to his lounging. He’s
text: got a long, rippled scar in the center of his chest.
dialog: In fact, everyone on this foreign beach has a scar of some
text: sort or another. The signs all around are in Spanish and
text: Portuguese. As we MOVE through the crowd...
speaker_heading: REMY (0.S.)
dialog: Christ, it’s hot. Is it supposed to
dialog: be this hot?
speaker_heading: BETH (0.S.)
dialog: It’s the tropics.
speaker_heading: REMY (0.S.)
dialog: Sure, but... Christ, it’s hot.
text: Remy and Beth sit on chaise lounges at the ocean’s edge.
text: Beth’s got on a cute little bathing suit, and though all
text: her scars are showing, she doesn’t seem to care.
text: Remy, still in his somber black-on-black, has a bandage on
text: his shoulder. Beth pulls it down -- the skin is raw and
text: read, but healing. There’s no tattoo.
text: A hardcover book sits on the sand between them.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Are you gonna stay here and act macho
dialog: or come have some fun?
text: Remy thinks it over.
speaker_heading: REMY
dialog: Macho.
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: Hey, ease up. I don’t want him...
dialog: uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: Nothing to worry about. If you’d hit
dialog: him with the brick any lower, it
dialog: might have posed a problem, but the M-
text: 5 is top of.the line.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: What’s he thinking about?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: No way to know.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: But he’1l be... happy?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: So long as someone’s paying for the
dialog: system.
text: Jake nods over to the other side of the hallway --
text: Where the bottom half of Beth’s torso can be seen. There's
text: more than a bit of blood -- as more ASSISTANTS box up her
text: overdue artiforgs.
speaker_heading: JAKE
dialog: I’ve got 15 commissions lying on the
dialog: floor over there. That should pay it
text: off in full.
text: The other assistants lift Remy’s stretcher up and it pops
text: into place. They begin to roll him down the long hallway.
text: Jake watches him go.
speaker_heading: JAKE (CONT’D)
dialog: Sweet dreams, brother.
text: We MOVE WITH Remy, a small smile on his face, those wires
text: trailing out of his brain.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: -which is why I’d recommend the M-5
dialog: neural net from Kenton. We’re running
dialog: a special on it this month, just 18
dialog: percent interest for the first year,
dialog: twenty-four after that.
text: Remy, on his cart, moving away from us now, wheeled down
dialog: that long hall...
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Why should your loved one pass on
dialog: just because of a little brain
dialog: damage? That's barbaric. That’s just
dialog: bad science.
dialog: 
dialog: penny:
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
text: The elevator doors at the far end of the hall opening...
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: With the new M-5 neural net, the
