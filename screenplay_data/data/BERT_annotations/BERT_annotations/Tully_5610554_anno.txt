scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (JONAH’S BEDROOM) - NIGHT
scene_heading: MUSIC: “SPACE ODDITY” by the Langley Schools Music Project
text: MARLO MOREAU wears a maternity T-shirt and sweatpants. She is
text: hugely pregnant. She kneels on the floor of a BOY’S BEDROOM
text: in a small suburban home. Her son JONAH, 5, is standing next
text: to her. He is shirtless but wears pajama pants.
text: The song “Space Oddity,” as performed by a children’s choir
text: plays on Jonah’s little CD player.
text: Marlo holds a strange little PLASTIC BRUSH with nylon
text: bristles. It’s not for Jonah’s hair. Instead, she runs the
text: brush in long, smooth strokes down her son’s bare arm.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hold still, Jonah.
text: She moves to the other side, running the brush down the other
text: arm, gently pressing the soft bristles into his skin.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: There we go. Let’s do feet now. Sit
dialog: down.
text: Jonah sits down. He casually grabs his crotch and holds on.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you need to go to the bathroom?
text: Jonah continues holding himself.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Just being your own best friend,
dialog: huh?
text: Jonah nods blithely.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay.
text: She resumes brushing, gently running the bristles over the
text: soles of Jonah’s BARE FEET.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (SARAH'S ROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo heads into another bedroom, equally small but more
text: feminine. SARAH, 8, is sitting at a small desk, looking
text: irritated with her homework.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Almost done here?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Let me see.
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “In Chapter Three of I Hate Rules,
dialog: Katie Kazoo decides that there
dialog: should be no more rules at school.
dialog: What are the consequences?”
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Things get out of hand, don’t they?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: How about George? He ate ten
dialog: desserts and then what happened?
text: Sarah plays with her hair, distracted.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not going to write this
dialog: for you, Sares.
text: Sarah puts her head down on the desk dramatically. She BANGS
dialog: it twice.
text: Marlo stares at her daughter wearily.
text: Sarah bangs her head a THIRD TIME for good measure.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT
text: Marlo walks into the kitchen. It’s small and there are a few
text: boxes of assorted ENERGY BARS propped open on the already-
text: cluttered counters. Marlo Grabs two LUNCH BOXES off the
text: counter. Then, she reaches for her PHONE and plugs a set of
text: EARBUDS into it. She picks a song.
text: MUSIC UP: “Blue” by the Jayhawks.
text: As the music plays, Marlo begins makes two LUNCHES for Jonah
text: and Sarah. Finally, an escape from the children, even if
text: she’s still servicing them.
text: She places two different sandwiches into plastic bento boxes.
text: She pours Goldfish crackers from a Costco-sized container
text: into two of the compartments. She cuts on the diagonal.
text: Marlo’s husband DREW enters. He’s a slightly nerdy software
text: engineer in a Doctor Who T-shirt. Marlo pulls out her
text: earbuds. Her private moment is over abruptly.
text: Without missing a beat, Drew begins filling Thermoses and
text: slicing the green tops off the strawberries. Marlo and Drew
text: are a well-oiled machine. Their childcare routines are
dialog: choreographed like ballet.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Jonah’s finally down. Jesus, it’s
dialog: like trying to kill the head
dialog: vampire.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Did you bring Sarah her inhaler?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah. Did you, uh, brush Jonah?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Roger wilco. Hey, don’t forget,
dialog: we're going to my brother’s for
dialog: dinner tomorrow night.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Ugh. Craig hates me.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Craig doesn’t hate you. He just
dialog: hangs out with i-bankers all day,
dialog: so his default setting is “ass.”
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You think he’1ll respect me more now
dialog: that I got a promotion?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: No.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But, I bet he can’t wait to show us
dialog: his new Tesla!
text: They switch to stupid, deep “bro” voices to imitate Craig.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: “It’s sick, dude!”
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: “It’s soooo sick! Look how I plug
dialog: it in.”
text: They bond briefly over making fun of Craig.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: “I don’t just look cool, I’m single-
dialog: handedly saving the planet.”
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: “You're welcome, Earth.”
text: Marlo chucks a mayonnaise-covered knife into the sink.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. VITUS SCHOOL (LOWER LOT) - DAY
text: A wet spring morning in Rye, New York. Marlo’s dented Honda
text: Fit rolls into the parking lot of ST. VITUS ELEMENTARY
speaker_heading: SCHOOL.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO’S CAR - DAY
text: Marlo is behind the wheel. Jonah and Sarah are strapped into
text: booster seats in the back of the car.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: This is not our lot.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Go to the other parking lot.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: The other parking lot’s full,
dialog: honey. We have to park here today.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (groaning)
dialog: Not again...
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Jonah, I have to meet with Mrs.
dialog: Bell in...
dialog: (checking)
dialog: negative three minutes. Please
dialog: let’s just park here.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Other lot! Other lot!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jonah, don’t.
text: Jonah begins KICKING THE SEAT and SCREAMING. He can’t handle
text: any disruption to his routine. He melts down.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: No! No! Noooooo!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (distressed)
dialog: Mom! Make him stop!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Other lot! Other lot!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Jonah, stop!
text: Marlo attempts to respond calmly, but she’s unraveling.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (to Sarah)
dialog: You know how he is with his
dialog: routine. He doesn’t like when we do
dialog: things differently.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nobody cares about what I like!
text: Jonah is WAILING at this point.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: Jonah, the other lot is full.
dialog: There’s nowhere to park.
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Jesus Christ. Please.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. VITUS SCHOOL (UPPER LOT) - DAY
text: A different, crowded parking lot; Jonah got his way. One CAR
text: pulls out of a spot; Marlo’s car is braked patiently, waiting
text: for said spot. Marlo’s car pulls into the spot.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO’S CAR - SAME
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (to Jonah)
dialog: All right, you happy?
text: Jonah nods, tear-stained.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL (PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE) - DAY
text: Marlo enters the PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE, flustered. MRS. BELL,
text: a.k.a. LAURIE, waits at her desk.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hi Laurie. I’m sorry I’m late.
dialog: (lying)
dialog: Regent was backed-up for blocks.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Hi Marlo. Are you on maternity
dialog: leave yet? You look like you're
text: about to pop.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah. Friday was my last day.
text: Marlo stands awkwardly in front of the desk, forcing a big,
text: fake expectant smile. This is her “school persona.”
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Such a blessing.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: I’ll try not to take up too much of
dialog: your time here, so I’ll just get
dialog: right to it: Ms. Marvish tells me
dialog: that Jonah is still having a tough
dialog: time in class. We’re concerned
dialog: about his social and emotional
dialog: development.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: Kindergarten’s a tough transition.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: It’s April.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: And there’s about to be a big
text: disruption in Jonah’s life, too.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
text: Laurie nods at Marlo’s huge belly: duh.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Jonah’s sweetheart. We love him.
dialog: But as you know, he’s an “out-of-
dialog: the-box” kid. He’s quirky.
text: Marlo nods, subtly lip-syncing the word “quirky” as Laurie
text: says it. It’s a euphemism that comes up a lot regarding
dialog: Jonah.
speaker_heading: LAURIE (CONT’D)
dialog: There are twenty-four other
dialog: children in the class, and it’s not
dialog: fair to them when Jonah needs so
text: much of the teacher’s time.
text: Marlo’s response is eager, desperate.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: We’re working on the meltdowns at
dialog: home. And we’re doing these
dialog: exercises and all this stuff. I
dialog: just made this chart--
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: We think Jonah could benefit from a
text: one-to-one aide. A teacher just for
text: him, who shadows him during the day
dialog: and gives him the extra support he
dialog: requires.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Is the aide someone on staff here?
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: No, we don’t provide aides.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh, so I have to go out and get
dialog: AIDS all by myself.
text: She chuckles dryly at her own joke. Laurie doesn’t catch on.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Yes, you’d need to hire this
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m paying to get AIDS!
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: One aide. He just needs one.
text: Marlo nods seriously, giving up on the AIDS joke.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Right. Okay.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: We don’t usually make these kinds
dialog: of accommodations for students at
dialog: Saint V.’s, but you guys are a
dialog: great family, so...
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Thank you, Laurie. I really, really
dialog: appreciate it. I want to make this
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: No problem. Have a great day now.
text: Marlo musters a smile and rises to exit, shattered.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
text: With the kids dropped off and a temporary reprieve from work,
text: Marlo enters the local COFFEE PLACE on the town’s main drag.
text: She heads to the counter.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’ll have a decaf skim latte
dialog: please.
text: An OLDER FEMALE CUSTOMER behind Marlo pipes up.
speaker_heading: NOSY CUSTOMER
dialog: You know there’s trace amounts of
dialog: caffeine even in decaf, right?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Huh?
text: The women gestures to Marlo’s PREGNANT BELLY.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: NOSY CUSTOMER
dialog: Just so you know.
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: You still want it?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah, yeah.
speaker_heading: NOSY CUSTOMER
dialog: Just don’t overdo it!
dialog: (then, know-it-all)
dialog: My daughter has three, so I read up
dialog: on all this stuff.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: This is my third as well.
speaker_heading: NOSY CUSTOMER
dialog: Are your children short-statured?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NOSY CUSTOMER
text: From the caffeine.
text: The BARISTA is tapping out a total on the register.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes. My kids are miniature. And my
dialog: son actually came out with the
text: Starbucks logo burned into his ass
text: like a cattle brand.
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: Would you like any sweetener with
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah. Give me the one that causes
dialog: cancer in rats.
text: The barista shrugs and tosses four PINK PACKETS at Marlo.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: Marlo, seated at a table, takes a voracious bite of a giant
text: MUFFIN. She drinks her latte. Suddenly--
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Marlo?
text: VIOLET, a woman about Marlo’s age approaches the table. She’s
text: unconventionally attractive with an artistic style. She
text: carries a to-go box of coffee and her mouth is agape.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: vi?
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You said it.
text: They stare at each other for a moment, stunned.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: What are you doing in Rye?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I’m here for a memorial. My
dialog: friend’s dad passed away.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: It’s fine. He was a dick.
text: Marlo’s sudden laugh is a GOOFY BARK. She covers her mouth.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Jesus. What was that?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: That’s the standard “Marlo laugh.”
text: Somewhere between a bike horn and a
dialog: goose orgy. I miss it.
text: Violet pulls up a chair and sits down. There’s ELECTRIC
text: NOSTALGIA in the air-- and also considerable awkwardness.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: So do you live here? Fill me in on
dialog: everything. I mean, you randomly
dialog: dropped off Facebook like five
dialog: years ago, never to be heard from
dialog: again, so.
text: This is lightly delivered, but there’s hurt beneath...
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I hate social media.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: We all do. That’s the point. It’s a
dialog: mandatory rage-fuck.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Ha. Well, I live here in town.
text: Still married to Drew. Two kids.
dialog: Nothing’s changed.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Mm, I don’t know how to tell you
dialog: this, but you’ve really blown up.
text: Marlo laughs again.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (CONT'D)
dialog: No, congrats. Anyway, I have to get
dialog: this coffee back to the house
text: before it gets as cold and black as
dialog: my womb. Do you still have my
dialog: number?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: The same one? 718?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Same number as always, and same
dialog: address too.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: What? You’re still at the loft?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
text: Mm-hm. Still in Bushwick. Building
dialog: went co-op years ago, so I bought
dialog: the place. I’m surrounded by
text: Millennials crying on the phone to
dialog: Mommy. Call me sometime, okay? If
dialog: you feel like it.
text: Marlo nods as Violet exits. Once Violet is gone. Marlo sits
text: and stares at her muffin for a moment. Her cheeks are red.
text: When she reaches for her latte, the cup RATTLES briefly
text: against the saucer.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Drew, Marlo, Sarah and Jonah are in the car headed to Marlo’s
text: brother’s house. Marlo, drained by the day’s events, clutches
text: a bottle of cheap wine in the passenger’s seat.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: Are you guys excited to see your
dialog: cousins?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah!
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Is the dog going to be out?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: DREW
text: Jonah, the dog weighs like two
dialog: pounds. He can’t hurt you.
text: Jonah moans, worried as usual.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What is that dog’s name again?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: “Prosecco.”
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I want to kill myself.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DREW
text: Mommy’s joking. Like a clown.
text: Marlo “honks” her own nose in response.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: Beep-beep.
scene_heading: EXT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Marlo’s older brother CRAIG lives in a newly constructed
text: “French”-style mansion with a motor court and fountain. It’s
text: incredibly grand compared to Marlo and Craig’s little
text: rambler. Jonah spots Craig’s new car.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Is that Uncle Craig's electric car?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah, it’s called a Tesla.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Can we get one?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You wouldn’t want one. They catch
text: on fire all the time.
text: Drew snorts at Marlo’s lie.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Really?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah, like five kids died in one
text: last week. It burst into flames
dialog: while they were on their way to see
text: the Easter Bunny at Monmouth Mall.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: You're lying!
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Don’t get too close to it.
scene_heading: INT./EXT CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (ENTRY) - NIGHT
text: Drew knocks on the oversized front door. It swings open.
text: Reveal ELYSE, Marlo’s smiling sister-in-law, who is whippet-
text: thin and gorgeous in a cashmere sweater and jeans. An
text: expensive-looking DOG barks behind her.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Heyyyyyyy!
text: Everyone greets each other. The kids hug Aunt Elyse, who is
text: upbeat and affectionate. Elyse’s three kids, DASH, EMMY and
text: GRETA appear, excited to see their cousins.
speaker_heading: ELYSE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to kids)
dialog: What’s up buddy? Sarah, I’m going
dialog: to steal those boots right off your
dialog: feet. So cute.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey, Elyse.
text: An energetic young woman, SHASTA, appears in the foyer.
speaker_heading: SHASTA
dialog: (to Marlo’s kids)
dialog: Hi guys. I made an obstacle course
dialog: in the playroom if you want to come
dialog: check it out!
text: Emmy, 10, makes an introduction.
speaker_heading: EMMY
dialog: This is Shasta, our nanny.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hi.
text: Four year-old Greta pipes up.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: GRETA
dialog: We have karaoke!
speaker_heading: EMMY
dialog: Yeah, we got a karaoke machine.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Cool!
text: Greta grabs Jonah’s hand. All five kids joyously run off
text: toward the playroom with Shasta.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Shasta’s so awesome. She has a
dialog: masters degree in Early Childhood
dialog: Education. I feel like she should
dialog: be telling me what to do.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Marlo, you are glowing.
text: Marlo looks like death warmed over.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Really? I feel like an abandoned
text: trash barge.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: In the eighties there was this
text: giant boat full of garbage that
dialog: just drifted up and down the East
dialog: Coast for weeks. They couldn’t
dialog: figure out where to dump it.
text: Eventually, they docked the boat in
dialog: Brooklyn and burned all the trash.
text: Elyse hesitates, then laughs cheerfully.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: The ninth month is tough. I
dialog: remember I could barely make it to
dialog: the gym. Come on!
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (VARIOUS/KITCHEN) - NIGHT
text: Elyse leads Drew and Marlo into the gigantic kitchen, where
text: Marlo’s brother CRAIG is opening a bottle of wine. Craig is a
text: charming, gregarious guy. He’s wearing an expensive suit, the
dialog: tie loosened.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yes. Yes. The Moreaus have arrived.
dialog: This is gonna be a good night.
dialog: Drew, how are you, buddy?
text: He and Drew do the one-armed guy hug. Drew sheds his jacket,
text: tossing it on a stool.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: Marlo.
text: Marlo tries to accept his hug, but her belly gets in the way.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I have my own hug-buffer now.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Just what you've always wanted.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That’s actually true.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: When is your due date again?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Monday.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Jesus. Don’t have it here.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: (to Craig)
dialog: She could have it in the ofuro!
dialog: (then)
dialog: We just got this Japanese soaking
dialog: tub. It was a gift from Craig’s
dialog: boss.
dialog: She shrugs like, isn’t that weird?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: My boss once bought me a cup
dialog: of soup. I paid him back.
text: Elyse assesses Marlo’s belly.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: You know, I feel like it’s
text: definitely a boy.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Marlo didn’t want to know this
dialog: time, but I kind of wish we had
dialog: decided to find out.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Well, you’re going to find out any
dialog: day now.
text: Craig and Elyse smile, awaiting a response from Marlo. Isn't
text: this exciting? She fakes a smile.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yep.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (DINING ROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo, Craig and Drew walk into the dining room, holding
text: drinks and chatting. The table is gorgeous and rustic, with
text: flickering candles and artfully mismatched plates and
text: goblets. It’s perfect without trying too hard. Marlo notices
text: that there are only four place settings at the table.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Where are the kids going to sit?
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Oh, they’re with Shasta. They have
dialog: their own little kid-friendly
dialog: spread. Mac and cheese, Kobe
text: sliders, something green...
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Lucky little bastards.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Wow, we can actually have a
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: I know, right?
text: She fiddles with her phone and speaks into it.
speaker_heading: ELYSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Siri. Play Hamilton.
text: Music fills the room via Wi-Fi. Elyse looks pleased with
dialog: herself for liking hip hop.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: So, three.
dialog: 17.
text: Marlo is confused for a beat, then realizes Craig is
text: referring to her pregnancy. He nods at her belly.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh. Yeah. It’s crazy.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: You’re going to love it. We love
dialog: having three. And the third kid is
dialog: always the easiest.
dialog: (to Craig)
dialog: Right? Greta’s so chill.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Chill would be nice.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Yeah, you guys really have your
text: hands full with Jonah.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: I don’t mean that in a bad way.
dialog: He’s so great.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No, he’s tough. He’s quirky. The
dialog: school actually wants us to get him
dialog: a aide because the teacher can’t
dialog: handle him anymore.
text: Marlo glances at Drew, flustered that he would disclose this.
text: Drew eats matter-of-factly.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Oh. Well, that’s awesome.
dialog: (spinning it)
dialog: That they’re, you know, recognizing
dialog: his needs.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh yeah, they’re all over it.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT
text: Elyse enters the kitchen, protesting as Drew and Marlo
text: attempt to carry in the dirty serving dishes.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Guys, do not help. I got it.
text: She hands a platter to a waiting HOUSEKEEPER.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Let me at least put this away.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No. You're not allowed. Besides, I
dialog: want to show you something.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I saw the Tesla.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah, yeah, no. Come here.
text: He puts a brotherly hand on Marlo’s shoulder and steers her
text: away from the sink.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (TIKI BAR) - NIGHT
text: Craig has a TAHITIAN-STYLE home bar that looks like something
text: at a resort. Marlo looks around at the decor
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You like it?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s like I’ve been transported to
dialog: another room of your house.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: It was inspired by the most
dialog: beautiful place I’ve ever been.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Tahiti?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Epcot.
text: Marlo climbs awkwardly onto a stool. Craig goes behind the
text: bar and pours himself a scotch and Marlo a pineapple juice.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I have a special baby gift for
dialog: you this time around.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Is it money?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Ha ha. It’s more like an
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Okay...
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Have you ever heard of a night
dialog: nanny?
text: Before Marlo gets a chance to reply...
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: Everyone does it. I mean, everyone
dialog: we know. It’s like a regular nanny,
dialog: but she only comes to your house at
text: night. She stays over for a few
dialog: weeks-- or months-- and takes care
dialog: of the new baby so Mom and Dad can
dialog: get some sleep!
text: His tone is cheerful, careful. What is he getting at?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: How does that work? Does this lady
dialog: breast-feed? Jesus, there’s nothing
dialog: you people won’t outsource.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: No! She doesn’t breast-feed. This
dialog: isn’t feudal China. She wakes you
dialog: up to do...
dialog: (gesturing, awkward)
dialog: That. But then you can go right
dialog: back to bed when you’re done.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Why have a baby if you’re not
dialog: willing to put in the time? Sleep
dialog: deprivation is part of the deal.
dialog: Besides, I don’t want some stranger
dialog: in my house bonding with my newborn
dialog: at night. That’s like a Lifetime
text: movie where the nanny tries to kill
text: the mom and the mom wins but still
text: walks with a cane for the rest of
dialog: her life.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: We had a night nanny.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You did? I don’t remember that.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: That’s because she was only here at
dialog: night! They come in and out like a
dialog: ninja. I barely had any interaction
text: with the woman.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: Elyse said she was great.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Craig, you didn’t hire one of these
dialog: people for me, did you?
text: Craig’s tone becomes more serious.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Marlo. You’ve got a lot going on. I
dialog: know this kid wasn’t planned, okay?
dialog: I know, I know, it’s a miracle and
dialog: the best thing ever and blah blah
dialog: blah...
text: Craig lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: ...But I don’t want what happened
dialog: last time to happen again.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Craig, don't...
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: I love you. I don’t want to ever
dialog: see you that way (again)
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (over)
dialog: It won’t happen. Just stop.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Drew needs to focus on his career.
text: He’s finally getting somewhere and
dialog: you can’t let this baby derail him.
dialog: And you need to be there for Jonah
dialog: and Sarah. Get them to school in
dialog: the morning. Be “happy Mommy.”
dialog: Awake. Present. Especially for
dialog: Jonah.
text: The mention of Jonah gives Marlo guilty pause.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you think this is some
dialog: bougie thing that rich assholes do.
dialog: And maybe it is. But remember, I
dialog: wasn’t always a rich asshole.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: I grew up in the same shitty house
dialog: as you, with the same shitty
dialog: parents and that shit-brown Buick
dialog: on the lawn. And I’m telling you--
dialog: for the sake of your kids-- get
dialog: over yourself and call her.
text: He reaches into his pocket and hands her a folded-up piece of
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: CRAIG (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the number. Make whatever
dialog: arrangements you need, for however
dialog: long you want. She’1ll bill me; we
dialog: already worked it out. This isn’t
dialog: the person we used-- she was booked
dialog: until August-- but this one comes
dialog: highly recommended. Think about it.
text: Marlo tucks the folded paper into her pocket.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: How much money does this cost?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: An assload.
dialog: (then, serious)
dialog: Think about it.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Marlo is driving. A tipsy Drew is in the passenger seat.
text: Marlo rants about Craig’s proposal.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (mid-rant)
dialog: .»-I mean, I understand having a
dialog: cleaning lady or a babysitter or
dialog: whatever if you can afford it. But
dialog: the “night nanny” thing just sounds
dialog: crazy. Like, what is this, Downton
dialog: Abbey?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It sounds pretty ideal to me. Like,
dialog: not having to wake up five times a
dialog: night or whatever?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You don’t wake up anyway.
text: Her observation is matter-of-fact, not hostile.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I don’t have boobs, Marlo.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah, that’s true.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: It’s not like I can do anything.
text: They’ve arrives a stoplight. Marlo looks out the window at a
text: group of YOUNG PEOPLE congregating on a sidewalk. They're
text: talking and laughing, animated.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m fine with doing it myself
dialog: anyway. You need to be rested for
dialog: work. This is a big year for you.
text: As she recites this, she’s fixated on the young crowd.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: You’re sure you’re going to be
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Of course.
text: He notices that she’s spaced-out.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Honey?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DREW
text: It’s green.
text: The light has changed. Marlo accelerates.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: The lights are off. Drew sleeps. Marlo is lying in bed,
text: wrestling with a huge snakelike body pillow. She can’t get
text: comfortable. She settles for a moment. We hear a distinct
text: POP. Marlo’s eyes open.
text: Marlo gets up and walks to the bathroom. From her P.O.V., we
text: see WATER dribbling onto the floor with every step. It’s not
text: the dramatic scene we see in movies, just a tiny dribble. But
text: it’s unmistakable.
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAWN
text: A disoriented Drew drives to the hospital. Marlo rides
text: quietly in the passenger seat.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - DAY
text: Drew holds Marlo’s hand while an ANESTHESIOLOGIST who looks
text: sixteen years old injects an EPIDURAL into her spine.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - DAY (LATER)
text: Marlo watches E! News on TV in her hospital bed.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - DAY (LATER)
text: Marlo lies on her side checking her phone.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL (DELIVERY ROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo is pushing out her baby. A DOCTOR and a couple of
text: NURSES are there. Drew stands by taking video with his phone.
text: A not-particularly-meaningful SONG plays on someone’s iPod.
text: The doctor is laid-back, almost distracted.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR
dialog: Okay, can you feel my hand inside
dialog: you? Push against my hand. One,
dialog: two, three.
text: Marlo closes her eyes and pushes silently.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL (RECOVERY ROOM) - DAY
text: Marlo is sitting up in the hospital bed, still wearing a
text: hospital gown and tethered to an I.V. Craig and Elyse are in
text: the room. Elyse holds the BABY, making little cooing noises.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Marlo, she is your mini. Look at
dialog: those lips.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I wish we could stay, but Emmy’s in
dialog: the middle school musical tonight.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What show is it?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: (proud)
dialog: Rent.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I don’t get it. It’s like, just pay
dialog: your fucking rent. Problem solved.
text: Elyse is about to pass back the sleeping baby back to Marlo.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You can just put her in the
dialog: bassinet.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Oh. Okay.
text: Surprised, she places the baby in the hospital bassinet.
text: Craig leans in and pats Marlo’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You take it easy, okay? And tell
text: Dad congrats when he wakes up.
text: Reveal Drew SOUND ASLEEP on a cot. Craig and Elyse quietly
text: exit the room.
text: Marlo swings her numb legs out of bed and tries to get up.
text: It’s tough. She looks over at Drew. He is sound asleep on a
dialog: cot.
text: Marlo manages to get up and walks gingerly toward the
text: bathroom, dragging her I.V. behind her. She stumbles into the
text: door frame. Through the open back of her hospital gown, we
text: see she’s wearing an ADULT DIAPER.
text: Marlo reaches for the nurse call button.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Craig and Elyse walk to the elevator.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: So did you talk to her about the
dialog: night nanny?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Yeah. She said she could never let
text: a stranger take care of her baby.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Oh, so she’s judging our choices.
dialog: Nice.
dialog: 25.
text: Craig pushes the elevator button.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I just want my sister back. The
dialog: last few years... She used to be
dialog: happy, you know?
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Wasn’t she also like, totally
dialog: irresponsible?
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: She got a little wild sometimes,
dialog: sure. But overall, she was just fun
dialog: to be around. Then she had the
dialog: kids. Once Sarah came along, it was
text: like somebody snuffed the match.
dialog: And when Jonah was born...
text: They shudder at the unspoken.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Yeah, that wasn't pretty.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Maybe you should call Drew and see
dialog: if he can convince her.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Drew hates me.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL (BATHROOM) - DAY
text: Marlo sits on the toilet in the cramped bathroom while a
text: motherly RUSSIAN NURSE encourages her.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN NURSE
dialog: You have to show me you can do a
dialog: pee-pee.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s just not coming out.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN NURSE
dialog: If you don’t pee soon, we have to
text: put the catheter back in.
text: Marlo strains desperately, hoping to avoid this outcome. We
text: hear a trickling/pouring sound.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: There.
text: She struggles to stand up. The nurse glances into the bowl.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN NURSE
dialog: That’s not enough.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Why is this so important?
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN NURSE
dialog: Don’t get angry.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I peed. Why don’t you believe me?
dialog: It’s in there, I swear. Run a test
dialog: or something.
dialog: (angry)
dialog: How much do you fucking need? Do I
dialog: have to spray it all over the room?
dialog: You want a golden shower?
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN NURSE
dialog: You need to rest, mommy.
text: We hear the baby CRY OUT.
speaker_heading: RUSSIAN NURSE (CONT’D)
dialog: I can take her to the nursery.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: No. She needs me. I’m the only one
dialog: who can do it.
text: She staggers out of the bathroom toward her baby.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Marlo nurses the baby alone. The T.V. flickers in the dark
dialog: living room. It could be 2:00 am, could be 4:00. Time doesn’t
dialog: exist anymore.
text: The living room is temporarily “baby central.” There’s a
dialog: portable BASSINET (known in parental circles as a Pack n’
text: Play), a pile of diapers and a makeshift CHANGING STATION on
text: a chair.
text: Marlo closes her eyes. She opens them. Her arms are empty.
text: THE BABY IS GONE.
text: She leaps to her feet, panics. Scans the floor. Runs to the
text: kitchen. She hears a coo coming from the kitchen sink. A
text: baby's arm, waving. What is the baby doing in the sink?
text: Marlo opens her eyes. The baby is in her arms, still nursing.
dialog: It was a dream, a weird one.
dialog: 27.
text: Through a series of dissolves, we see a MONTAGE of endless,
text: grinding, exhausting DAYS and NIGHTS of baby care. We never
text: leave the living room. Marlo sleeps on the couch with a
text: blanket and pillow-- when she gets to sleep.
text: Marlo is suddenly DRIVING HER CAR. Jonah is inexplicably (and
text: illegally) sitting in the front seat. Marlo glances in the
text: rear view and sees the BABY lying in the back seat. She SLAMS
text: on the brakes, gasping. She looks over at Jonah, who has
text: turned into a DISAPPROVING OLDER WOMAN. (Her mother?)
text: Marlo suddenly wakes up, in her makeshift bed on the couch.
text: The baby is in her arms. What time is it? Hard to say. Drew,
text: in a suit and tie, enters to kiss the baby goodbye and head
text: to work. He looks so polished. Marlo, so feral.
text: Marlo paces, nurses, feeds. Her clothes change, but they’re
text: all the same variation on T-shirt and sweat pants.
text: Marlo is lying on the floor of a FOREST, gazing up at the
text: sky. It's peaceful for a moment. Someone POKES her with a
text: stick in the shoulder. Poke. Poke. Poke. Poke.
text: Marlo wakes up. She’s fallen asleep sitting up. Jonah is
text: repeatedly poking her in the shoulder with a TOY LIGHT SABER
text: Later: Jonah and Sarah are watching cartoons. Sarah tries to
text: snuggle up to her mom, who barely responds.
text: Marlo stares blankly at Barbie’s Mermaid Adventure. Her eyes
text: brim with TEARS.
scene_heading: INT. SAINT VITUS SCHOOL - DAY
text: Marlo walks down the hallway with Jonah like a zombie. She
text: carries the baby’s INFANT CAR SEAT by its handle; it has a
text: muslin blanket draped over it so we can’t see the baby. They
text: arrive at his KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Love you.
text: Jonah jumps up and down and licks Marlo’s sleeve, clinging to
text: her. She manages to detach him.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Okay.
text: Jonah dashes into his classroom. Marlo continues down the
dialog: hallway.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: INT. SAINT VITUS SCHOOL (PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE) - DAY
text: Laurie is seated at her desk, drinking coffee and pushing
text: paper. Marlo enters, escorted by a MALE SECRETARY.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Hi. Thank you so much for coming in
dialog: today. I know mornings aren’t easy.
dialog: Especially for you right now.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Why?
text: Laurie gestures to the car seat warmly.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, yeah.
text: Marlo sits down in front of the principal’s desk and places
text: the car seat on the floor. Laurie obviously finds it a little
text: odd that Marlo doesn’t want to show off or talk about the
text: baby, but says nothing. She comes around to Marlo’s side of
text: the desk and sits in the other chair there.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: So, we’re coming up on the end of
dialog: the kindergarten year, and I just
dialog: wanted to talk to you about
dialog: Mister Jonah!
text: Her quasi-affectionate use of “Mister” doesn’t mask the
dialog: tension.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: We're getting him the aide. The one-
dialog: one aide. We just have to figure
dialog: out how we’re going to pay...
text: Her voice trails off. She’s sick of talking about it.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Right. I know.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Back when you guys applied, we did
dialog: express some concerns about whether
dialog: or not Saint Vitus was the right
dialog: fit for Jonah. But we love your
dialog: family, and we have such a great
dialog: relationship with your brother and
dialog: his wife...
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I know Jonah is only here because
dialog: of them.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: That’s not--
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: No, I know. They’re big donors and
dialog: they called in a favor.
text: Now Laurie is uncomfortable. She takes a deep breath.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: We think Jonah might be better
text: served by a different school.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You’re expelling him?
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: No, Marlo... Expulsion is a
dialog: punishment. We would call this a
dialog: dismissal.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: There are places better suited to
dialog: kids like Jonah.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What does that mean, “kids like
dialog: Jonah?”
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: Well, you know, Jonah is quirky.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: What is this “quirky” thing
dialog: everyone keeps saying?
dialog: (officious voice)
dialog: “Parenting Your Quirky Child.” It’s
dialog: so stupid. What does it mean? It’s
dialog: like, do I have a kid or a fucking
dialog: ukelele? Why can’t you say what you
dialog: mean, which is that you think Jonah
dialog: is retarded? And he’s ruining it
dialog: for all the other kids in the class
dialog: who are reading like, The Iliad or
dialog: whatever?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry about my retarded son. Oh,
dialog: I’m sorry, quirky. Because he’s a
dialog: pocket watch. Fuck. This.
text: She stands up and grabs the baby carrier. Mrs. Bell is
dialog: alarmed.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: No, no, no. Jonah is bright. He’s
dialog: great. It’s just not the right fit.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Just say what you mean. You hate my
dialog: kid. You hate us.
text: The secretary appears, having overheard the skirmish.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: Dallas, please walk her out.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Don’t touch me, Dallas.
speaker_heading: SECRETARY
dialog: I wasn’t--
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: You need to calm down. I’m not
dialog: letting you leave like this.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh, I leave like this every day;
dialog: you just don’t know it. This is the
dialog: real me, when I’m not licking your
dialog: asshole. Surprise!
text: Marlo turns and accidentally SLAMS the unwieldy car seat hard
text: against the frame of the door. We hear the baby SQUEAL.
text: Laurie and the secretary gasp.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: She's FINE.
text: She manages to exit, leaving the stunned pair in her wake.
scene_heading: INT. VAN (PARKING LOT) - DAY
text: Marlo steps up into her van and manages to snap the baby’s
text: car seat into its base. She climbs into the driver's seat,
text: and stares into space, breathing heavily. The baby begins
text: CRYING in the back seat.
dialog: 31.
text: Marlo climbs into the backseat. She finds a pacifier in the
text: baby’s seat and sucks on it to “clean” it.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Here.
text: The baby rejects the pacifier.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: (desperate)
dialog: Take it. Just take it.
text: The baby finally starts sucking. Marlo collapses in the
text: unoccupied captain’s chair next to the baby. Now it’s Marlo’s
text: turn to burst into TEARS. Her shoulders heave.
text: Marlo makes a decision. She crawls down onto the floor of the
text: van and searches for something. There’s a lot of garbage and
text: family detritus. Then, under the driver’s seat, she finds
dialog: what she’s looking for.
text: She unfolds the PIECE OF PAPER with shaking hands.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Tully.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT
text: The kids are watching TV. Marlo takes a FROZEN PIZZA out of
text: the oven and slaps it down on a cutting board. She drains
text: some broccoli from a pot on the stove and divides it on to
text: two plates. Just going through the motions.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Daddy!
text: We hear the FRONT DOOR open. The kids get up and run to the
text: door to greet Drew, thrilled to finally get some attention.
text: A suit-clad Drew walks in, flanked by Sarah and Jonah.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Frozen pizza, all right.
dialog: (noticing the TV)
dialog: I thought we weren’t doing screen
dialog: time during the week?
text: Marlo just looks at him with hollow eyes. Drew puts his palms
text: up helplessly.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Fine with me. It’s your rule.
text: He walks to the kitchen table and sits.
text: the plates and sits down. The kids take their places.
text: He laughs,
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: So, uh, I decided to call that
dialog: night nanny.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I just-- you know, Craig’s paying
dialog: for it, so I’m sure he’1ll lord that
dialog: over us.
text: barely masking his annoyance.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh, I’m sorry. I wouldn’t want you
dialog: to sustain a bruise to your ego.
dialog: That’s cool. I‘1l just cancel. I’1l
dialog: just cancel and make another pot of
dialog: coffee. We’re good.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No, no! I’m sorry. I didn’t mean--
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: Are you okay?
text: Marlo shrugs.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys, is Mommy okay?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: She’s coming tonight at 10:30.
dialog: 32.
text: Marlo comes over with
text: Jonah knocks over a GLASS OF MILK. It spills directly onto
text: Marlo’s shirt and lap, but she doesn’t flinch.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Jesus! Careful, Jonah.
text: Marlo peels off her shirt wordlessly. She sits in a NURSING
text: BRA. Her body is a deflated, stretch-marked mess. Drew looks
text: away. Sarah’s eyes widen with comic amusement.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Mom, what’s wrong with your body?
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (ENTRY) - NIGHT
text: Marlo sits in the dimly lit living room, holding the baby.
text: She watches HBO’s Cathouse with the closed-captioning on.
text: Onscreen, a naked PROSTITUTE negotiates with a john. The room
text: is a wreck.
text: We hear a soft KNOCK. Marlo gets up and hurries quietly to
text: the door with the baby on her shoulder. She opens the door,
text: revealing TULLY, the night nurse, standing there bathed in
text: porch light.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Hello. I’m Tully.
text: Tully is in her early twenties. Her hair is long; she wears a
text: T-shirt and jeans and has a BACKPACK slung over her shoulder.
text: There’s punky black EYELINER applied in cat-like swipes above
text: her eyes. She looks like a friendly grad student with slacker
dialog: tendencies.
text: Marlo is taken aback; this is not what she expected.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You must be Marlo.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: May I come in?
text: Marlo steps aside wordlessly. Tully enters.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: (indicating the baby)
dialog: Who’s this?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You mean the baby?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Yes. What’s her name?
text: For some reason, the question startles Marlo. It’s as though
dialog: she’d forgotten the baby was human.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Her name is Mia.
text: Tully is examining the baby, who is snuggled against Marlo’s
text: shoulder. We see the baby’s FACE for the first time. Her eyes
text: are open. She is beautiful.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Mia.
text: Marlo rambles nervously.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It was my mother’s name. I always
dialog: said I would use it. But now it’s
dialog: really popular, I guess.
text: She shrugs as if apologizing for her choice.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Who cares?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Who cares if it’s popular? It’s a
dialog: beautiful name.
text: She touches Mia’s cheek. Mia coos. Marlo is mesmerized by
text: Tully’s calm, direct manner.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It is.
dialog: (then)
dialog: How old are you?
text: Tully smiles. Marlo checks herself.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m sorry; I just wasn’t expecting--
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Don’t apologize. I get that a lot.
dialog: I’m older than I look.
text: There’s an awkward beat. Then:
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: So, how does this work?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: How do you want it to work?
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I have no idea.
text: Tully strides confidently into the house proper. Marlo
text: follows behind her, as if being led into her own home.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I’m here to take care of you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I thought you were here to take
dialog: care of the baby.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Well, you kind of are the baby.
text: Marlo chuckles, confused.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Even though this one’s been
dialog: earthside for three weeks, her DNA
dialog: is still inside of you. In fact,
dialog: her cells will hang around in your
dialog: bloodstream for years.
text: As she speaks, Tully reaches for Mia. Marlo hands Mia over
text: without hesitation, surprising herself.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: And though Mia here will be her own
dialog: person someday, right now she’s
dialog: still very much a part of you. She
dialog: knows your voice, your smell, your
dialog: heartbeat. And you know her better
dialog: than anyone. You built her from the
text: toes up.
text: Marlo just stares at Tully. Then:
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I feel like I don’t know her at
dialog: all yet.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: It’1ll come.
text: She smiles reassuringly-- and we believe her.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Okay.
text: They’re standing in the KITCHEN now.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I'll be here as long as you need
dialog: me. You look like you could use
dialog: some rest. I’1ll settle in with Mia
dialog: down here. You go upstairs and
dialog: sleep.
text: Marlo seems shocked by this suggestion.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Don’t I need to show you what
dialog: to do?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Are there diapers down here?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Does she have a place to sleep?
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: There’s a bassinet in the den.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Then we're good. I’1ll come wake you
text: up when she’s ready to nurse.
text: Marlo nods, confused. Sleep-deprived. But game.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Okay. See you soon.
text: Tully smiles kindly.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: “And so to bed.”
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Samuel Pepys. He kept a diary
dialog: during the English Restoration.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Right. Samuel Pepys.
text: She turns, shaking her head, and heads toward the stairs.
text: Tully looks down at Mia, now awake, and smiles beatifically.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo enters the bedroom. Drew is in bed. The lights are off.
text: He wears a GAMING HEADSET as he plays SKYRIM on his Xbox. He
text: pulls off his headset when he sees Marlo, surprised.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: The night nanny is here.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh yeah? What’s she like?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Weird.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: She’s weird.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Are you going to just leave her
dialog: down there with Mia?
text: Marlo ponders this briefly.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Okay.
text: Marlo climbs into bed. She closes her eyes, overwhelmed by
dialog: the sudden possibility of sleep.
text: A moment later, she rises from the bed, anxious. She walks
text: toward the bedroom door. Opens it, revealing not the hallway,
dialog: but...
text: A BEACH...
scene_heading: INT. WATER'S EDGE - DAY (DREAM)
text: Marlo is standing at the edge of the ocean in a bikini. Her
text: body is beautiful, like it used to be. She runs her hands
text: over her flat belly.
dialog: 38.
text: She looks down and sees MIA lying on the sand, alert and
text: kicking.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (to Mia)
dialog: Don't go anywhere.
text: She walks into the ocean. It's beautiful. The sun shines on
dialog: the water.
text: Marlo ducks under. Suddenly, she's in a deep swimming pool.
text: She swims down, down.
text: We hear the song “Blue” again, but a muffled, underwater
dialog: version.
text: The floor of the pool is strewn with TOYS and random
text: detritus, like an empty FROZEN PIZZA BOX.
text: There's a MERMAID down there. Her hair undulates like kelp.
text: The mermaid turns around smiles at her. It's TULLY. The Tully-
text: mermaid swims up to Marlo.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Don't come up too fast.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo opens her eyes. Tully is standing over her, holding Mia
text: and speaking softly.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: There you go. Nice and easy. Hi,
dialog: Marlo. She’s ready for you.
text: Marlo is disoriented. Hair is plastered to her cheek with
text: drool. Drew is sound asleep next to her. Mia fusses a bit.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll help.
text: She leans down and un-clicks the strap of Marlo’s nursing
text: tank top. It’s a weirdly intimate gesture, but appreciated.
text: Marlo takes the baby wordlessly and feeds her. Tully sits
text: cross-legged on the floor of the dark bedroom. She stares
text: serenely at Marlo, not breaking eye-contact.
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - MORNING
text: We hear the sound of a BABY STIRRING.
text: Marlo wakes up. It’s Saturday morning. Birds chirp. Drew is
text: still sleeping. An audio-only BABY MONITOR is plugged in next
text: to the bed; Mia’s little noises are being transmitted.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - SAME
text: Marlo wanders downstairs. She gasps. The house is IMMACULATE.
text: Almost unrecognizable. The kitchen GLEAMS. There are YELLOW
text: DAFFODILS picked from the back yard, arranged in a vase.
text: Marlo walks over to the bassinet. Mia is swaddled neatly as
text: she stirs.
text: Jonah emerges behind Marlo, bleary-eyed in his pajamas.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Is it a school day or a family day?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s Sunday. It’s a family day.
text: Jonah looks around the room, confused.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Why is it clean?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK/PLAYGROUND - DAY
text: Marlo and Drew walk through a LOCAL PARK while Sarah runs
text: ahead in her SOCCER UNIFORM and Jonah rides a scooter.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: So she was in our bedroom last
dialog: night?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes. She brought Mia to me to nurse
dialog: and she just sort of sat in the
dialog: shadows and waited for me to
dialog: finish.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: And then she went downstairs and
text: chiseled the filth off our floors.
dialog: Doesn’t she sleep?
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: Maybe she’s nocturnal. Like an owl.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Or Sarah's hamster. Remember that
dialog: thing? The wheel going all night
dialog: long...
text: Sarah runs over, interrupting the conversation.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Mom, I need water.
text: Drew rolls his eyes as Marlo dutifully produces a Thermos.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: The game didn’t even start yet!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So? I’m thirsty.
text: Marlo offers Sarah water. Marlo resumes the conversation.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: The nanny just seems so serene.
dialog: Like she really enjoys taking care
dialog: of people.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What’s wrong with her?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Right?
scene_heading: INT. Marlo AND DREW'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM/ENTRY) - NIGHT
text: Marlo is watching Cathouse again and holding Mia. We hear
text: Tully’s soft, signature knock. Marlo hurries to the door.
text: A smiling Tully, casually attired in a Jayhawks T-shirt,
text: stands on the threshold with her backpack.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Good evening!
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hi. Hey, I just wanted to thank you
dialog: for cleaning the house. You really,
dialog: really didn’t have to do that.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I enjoyed it. I have an energy
dialog: surplus. Like Saudi Arabia.
speaker_heading: MARLO
speaker_heading: (WTF )
dialog: Oh, all right.
text: As they enter the den, Marlo realizes that she has forgotten
text: to turn off the television. A client and a topless hooker are
text: interacting on Cathouse.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, God! I’m sorry.
text: Embarrassed, she reaches for the remote. Tully stops her.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: No. What is this?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s an old reality show. It’s
dialog: called Cathouse.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: What’s it about?
text: People are FUCKING on the TV screen.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Um, the goings-on at a legal
dialog: whorehouse in Nevada. Just, you
dialog: know, day-to-day operations.
text: Tully looks at the smiling BLONDE onscreen.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Who's she?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: That’s Air Force Amy.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Is she a pilot?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: No... I’m going to turn this off.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: There’s really no need. You're
dialog: enjoying it.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m not enjoying it. It just
dialog: happened to be on...
text: She realizes she’s hit pause on the RECORDING she’s made.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: --.my DVR.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Marlo, I want to make it abundantly
dialog: clear that you can’t be self-
dialog: conscious around me. This won’t
dialog: work if you are.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m just not used to being served,
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Relax and accept my service.
dialog: Pretend I’m Air Force Amy.
text: The conversation has reached peak weirdness.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Okay. Well, I’m just going to go
text: upstairs and watch a movie with
dialog: Drew.
text: Tully has scooped up a cooing Mia.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Have fun. You know, I can put on
dialog: headphones if you guys want to be
dialog: intimate.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: We’re not loud. I mean, that’s
dialog: fine.
text: Tully holds Mia up in Marlo’s face.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Kiss good night? Tomorrow she’1ll be
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: In what way?
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: She’1l grow a little overnight. And
dialog: so will we.
text: With her eyes fixed warily on Tully, Marlo leans in kisses
text: Mia’s cheek.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: Drew is watching Orphan Black on Netflix. Marlo pulls out her
text: iPad from under the bed and immediately starts tapping away.
text: Marlo and Drew don’t acknowledge each other.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo wakes up. She massages her breasts; they’re
text: uncomfortably full. The clock on the night stand reads 2:07
dialog: am.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo walks into the living room. Tully is perched on a
text: chair, holding Mia as she sleeps. She smiles at Marlo.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Hi there.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hey. I think I need to nurse her. I
dialog: feel like I’m going to explode.
text: She subtly indicates her engorged boobs.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Sure. Let’s do a dream feed.
text: Marlo settles onto the couch while Tully hands her the baby.
text: She lifts her shirt as a sleeping Mia latches on. Marlo
text: WINCES in pain-- it’s intense.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: She’s got a strong latch.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes, she’s a barnacle.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: If she’s a barnacle, then are you a
dialog: boat, or are you a whale?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I don’t know?
speaker_heading: TULLY
text: Well, boats get hurt by barnacles.
dialog: But whales don’t. When a barnacle
text: latches onto a whales, it’s
dialog: harmless. It’s just a little
dialog: obligate parasite doing its thing.
text: Tully smiles. Marlo looks down at Mia’s little face, choosing
dialog: not to continue with this odd conversation.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Does she look like your other kids?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Huh? Yeah, she looks a lot like
dialog: Sarah. My daughter.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: What’s Sarah like??
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Well, Sarah’s eight. She’s getting
dialog: to this age where she can be really
dialog: hard on herself. And that makes me
dialog: nervous, because it doesn’t get
dialog: better for girls, you know?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: No, it doesn’t.
text: There’s a KNOWING SADNESS in Tully’s voice.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: And my son Jonah... well, he’s
dialog: pretty great. But he’s exhausting.
dialog: He all these weird behaviors and
dialog: anxieties. We have to brush him.
dialog: Like, I have to brush his body at
text: night. Like a horse.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Well, a therapist told us that it’s
dialog: supposed to reduce his
dialog: sensitivities to everyday things.
dialog: (sheepish)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: We can’t afford to take him to a
dialog: therapist anymore, so I just
dialog: watched YouTube and learned the
dialog: exercises. It’s called the
dialog: “Wilbarger Brush Protocol.”
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: “Protocol.”
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Right? It sounds like a Tom Cruise
dialog: movie, except shitty and kind of
dialog: sad. Anyway, it’s my fault he has
dialog: all these issues.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Why is it your fault?
text: Marlo hesitates. She’s not ready to share this information
text: with a near-stranger.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You don’t have to talk about it.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You seem like an amazing mom.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah, you'd be “amazed” by how much
dialog: I suck.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Why would you say that?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Well, I know moms who are really
dialog: amazing. They organize the class
dialog: parties and “Casino Night,” and
text: they make little cupcakes with
dialog: googly-eyes. All that stuff.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You’re laying bedrock; they’re
dialog: planting flowers.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: But I want to be the cupcake mom. I
dialog: used to love to bake. But now I’m
text: so exhausted. Even getting dressed
dialog: feels like work.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Every morning I open my closet and
dialog: think “Didn’t I just do this?” And
dialog: that continues for the rest of the
dialog: day. “Didn’t I just do this?” My
text: life is like stuck on repeat mode.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: That’s the downside of living on a
text: planet with a short solar day.
text: Although Jupiter’s even shorter.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You’re like a book of fun facts for
dialog: unpopular fourth graders.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What do you do for work, Marlo?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m the office manager at a company
dialog: that makes protein bars. I have a
dialog: useless degree in Philosophy, so
dialog: now I write emails letting people
dialog: know they can’t wear Crocs on
dialog: “casual Friday.” Or sometimes, you
dialog: know, I’1l make a sign for the
dialog: ladies room that says “Please stop
dialog: flushing tampons. Your bitch-
text: missiles are clogging the pipes.
dialog: XO, Marlo.” It’s deeply fulfilling.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: What do you wish you did?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: That’s the problem. I don’t know.
dialog: If I had some big dream that never
dialog: came true, I could at least be
text: pissed off at the world. Instead,
dialog: I’m just pissed off at myself.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You’re empty.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: No, I mean you’re empty on that
dialog: side. She’s done. I’1ll take her.
dialog: 47.
text: .»..Or not. Tully gently takes Mia from Marlo. Marlo seems
text: reluctant to go back to bed. She heads toward the stairs,
text: then turns.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Thanks for the, uh, interview. It
dialog: was cathartic.
dialog: We sense that it really was.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Come back to the couch any time.
text: She flashes Marlo the peace sign.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Marlo?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Hm?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I’m here to help you with
dialog: everything. Not just Mia. I can’t
dialog: fix the parts without treating the
dialog: whole.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: No one’s treated my “hole” ina
dialog: long time.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Now, if that were true, we wouldn't
dialog: have Mia. Sleep tight.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - DAY
text: 6:00 AM. Marlo comes downstairs, bleary eyed. She carries
text: Jonah; he’s almost too big to be held, but he still fits.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Are we going to have a good day
dialog: today?
text: Jonah MEOWS in response.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh, you're a kitty?
text: Marlo sees something on the counter: it’s a tray of WHIMSICAL
text: CUPCAKES with GOOGLY EYES. They’re beautifully decorated,
dialog: even Pinterest-worthy.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: What the f...?
text: Jonah scampers over to the cupcakes, delighted.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Mom! Did you make these?
dialog: They’re funny!
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: They sure are.
text: She picks one up, admiring the craftsmanship.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: You want to take these to school?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Yes! For my friends!
text: He hugs Marlo’s leg happily. Heartbreaking.
scene_heading: INT. SAINT VITUS SCHOOL (JONAH’S CLASSROOM) - DAY
text: Marlo, looking unusually bright and put-together, walks Jonah
text: into his classroom. She “wears” Mia in a comfy-looking WRAP,
text: a far cry from the car seat she carried her in during the
dialog: last time we saw her at school.
text: Class hasn’t started yet, but around ten KIDS scamper around,
text: socializing. Marlo peels the foil back from the tray,
text: flashing the cupcakes at Jonah’s teacher, MRS. MARVISH.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Okay if we brought in a treat?
dialog: They’re nut-free.
text: The handful of KIDS in the classroom roar with approval. One
text: even runs up and hugs Jonah, who beams. But Mrs. Marvish
text: seems oddly skittish.
speaker_heading: MRS. MARVISH
dialog: What’s the occasion?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: No occasion. I just love to bake.
text: Marlo reads Mrs. Marvish’s nervous expression.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Oh... You heard about... it’s fine.
dialog: I get it. No hard feelings about
dialog: Jonah or anything.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: In fact, I kind of made these as a
dialog: peace offering. You know, I’m going
dialog: to bring one to Mrs. Bell, since
dialog: she’s the one I...
text: Marlo plucks a cupcake from the tray as she stammers this
text: nervous apology.
speaker_heading: MRS. MARVISH
dialog: Okay. Thank you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Have a good day!
scene_heading: INT. SAINT VITUS SCHOOL (PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE) - DAY
text: Laurie’s office door is open; she’s discussing something with
text: her secretary, Dallas. Marlo knocks on the door frame. When
text: Laurie and Dallas see Marlo, they both BLANCH from fear. Poor
text: Dallas practically jumps a foot.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hi.
dialog: (off their expressions)
dialog: Don’t freak out. I’m here to
dialog: apologize for the other day. I
dialog: brought an olive branch of sorts.
dialog: Actually it’s a strawberry cupcake
dialog: with cream cheese frosting but who
dialog: wants a actual olive branch, right?
dialog: No thanks! Bleh.
text: She tentatively places the cupcake on Laurie’s desk.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Sorry I only brought one, Dallas.
dialog: Anyway, um, I was totally out of
dialog: line the other day. I had a little
dialog: touch of the “baby blues” and I
dialog: think my hormones just got the
dialog: better of me. But I have help now.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: I’m very pleased to hear that.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: And I understand about Jonah.
dialog: Sometimes it’s just not the right
dialog: fit.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: You'll find the right fit for him.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Public school. Free of charge, free
dialog: of Jesus!
text: She grins triumphantly. Laurie is not sure what to make of
text: Marlo’s manic humor, but she smiles back.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, you guys have a great day.
speaker_heading: LAURIE
dialog: You too!
text: Marlo exits cheerfully.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
dialog: (to Laurie)
dialog: I would not eat that.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Marlo, Drew, Sarah and Jonah eat a home-cooked meal. Marlo
text: wears Mia in a sling and chats animatedly about the day’s
dialog: events.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (rambling)
dialog: ...so then I stopped by the
dialog: Department of Education and they
dialog: told me the public schools provide
dialog: free occupational therapy for any
dialog: kid who qualifies! You just have to
dialog: get something called an I.E.P, but
dialog: the evaluation for that is free
dialog: too, and I already called Early
dialog: Intervention to schedule it. So
dialog: this could wind up being better for
dialog: Jonah than St. Vitus ever was.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Wow. You’ve been really busy.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m just energized, I guess. Craig
dialog: was right. Sometimes you just need
text: an extra pair of hands.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: And this is so delicious I want to
dialog: punch someone in the face. How did
dialog: you make it?
text: Marlo shrugs.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s so easy to roast a chicken.
dialog: You just stick some lemons in the
dialog: cavity, salt, pepper, and you’re
dialog: good to go.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Is the cavity the butt?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Gross, Sarah, no.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: It’s just a big, gaping hole where
dialog: the chicken’s guts used to be.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: That’s worse than a butt.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You’re right, Sarah, it’s murder.
text: Drew laughs. And Marlo smiles, too.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: It’s night again. Marlo cruises to the door in SLOW-MOTION,
text: dreamy, pulling it open. There she is, as reliable and
text: radiant as the sun: Tully.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (DEN) - NIGHT
text: We begin a MONTAGE, so positive in tone it’s nearly
dialog: ridiculous.
text: MUSIC UP: SOME HAPPY SHIT
text: Marlo and Tully sit side by side on the couch, watching The
text: Women on TCM. Marlo nurses Mia. She and Tully are deep in
text: conversation, laughing and chatting.
text: When Marlo finishes nursing, she rearranges her shirt. But
text: instead of handing the baby back to Tully immediately, she
text: keeps talking, engrossed.
dialog: 52.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT
text: Different outfits, different night. Tully and Marlo make
text: homemade BREAD together. Marlo wears Mia in the sling while
text: she and Tully talk and knead the dough. The clock on the
text: microwave reads 1:05 AM.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (TABLE) - MORNING
text: Marlo cuts the loaf of FRESHLY BAKED BREAD and serves it to
text: Sarah and Jonah with butter and jam.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (DEN) - NIGHT
text: Marlo fills out I.E.P. PAPERWORK for Jonah while Tully reads
text: a large REFERENCE BOOK called How to Advocate for Your
dialog: Special Needs Child.
text: Tully points out a passage to Marlo and they discuss. Marlo
text: reaches for a YELLOW MARKER and HIGHLIGHTS a sentence.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: It’s an unspecified time of night. Marlo climbs into bed next
text: to a sleeping Drew. She pulls the covers up to her chin and
text: snuggles into the pillow, a slight smile on her face.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BATHROOM) - DAY
text: Marlo is getting ready for the day. She’s looking less and
text: less like a zombie; her hair is brushed, and she actually has
text: a little color in her cheeks.
text: She reaches into a MAKEUP POUCH and takes out a BLACK LIQUID
text: EYELINER. She hasn’t work it in years, but she leans forward
text: and applies it in Tully’s signature cat-like style. It comes
text: surprisingly easily to her. She examines herself, satisfied.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (DEN) - NIGHT
text: Tully and Marlo sit with a pile of inexpensive BABY GIFTS
text: that have been sent to Mia. We see Tully writing a THANK YOU
text: NOTE on stationery that says “MARLO MOREAU” at the mast.
dialog: “Dear Aunt Lorene: Thank you for the...”
text: Tully glances at the GIFT again.
dialog: “,..glow worm toy for Mia. It is so cute! Love, Marlo.”
dialog: 53.
text: She adds the card to a pile. Marlo, who is also writing a
text: note, smiles gratefully.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
text: Marlo enthusiastically kicks a SOCCER BALL to Sarah while Mia
text: sleeps contentedly in the stroller.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT INTO DAY
text: Marlo is sound asleep again. The room goes from DARK to LIGHT
text: in time-lapse. Marlo rises, stretching, refreshed.
scene_heading: INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY
text: Marlo sipping her morning latte, takes a deep breath and
text: composes a TEXT to her old friend VIOLET.
dialog: “This is Marlo Moreau. Wanna be friends again?”
text: Then, she types.
dialog: “(I£ you'll have me.)”
text: A moment. An ellipses. And then:
dialog: “Welcome back to the land of the living.”
dialog: Followed by:
dialog: “Bitch.”
text: Marlo chuckles to herself, relieved.
scene_heading: EXT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (ESTABLISHING) - DAY
text: Craig and Elyse’s mansion looks even more impressive by day.
text: There are a bunch of PINK BALLOONS tied to the mailbox at the
text: end of the driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (BACK YARD) - DAY
text: It’s the perfect sunny spring day for GRETA’S BIRTHDAY PARTY.
text: Of course, Craig and Elyse have gone completely over the top.
text: There’s a dessert table, pony rides, etc.
text: A DRONE soars above the proceedings, taking video.
dialog: 54.
text: Jonah is playing with water balloons. Marlo is hanging out at
text: a folding table while Mia sleeps in the car seat.
text: Drew is a few yards away at the BAR. A costumed PRINCESS
text: swishes past him with an armful of PARTY PROPS (wand, bag of
text: dress-up clothes, etc.)She accidentally drops her tambourine.
text: Marlo watches as Drew bends over to help the princess pick up
text: her items. They chat for a moment. The princess is basically
text: a rough-looking stripper in a ball gown, but Drew is clearly
dialog: charmed.
text: Craig suddenly and conveniently appears next to Drew and
text: joins the conversation. It’s obvious the two guys are being
text: extra “on” for the princess, who’s laughing. Marlo can’t help
text: but notice how the girly costume and wig affect the two men.
text: Drew notices Marlo watching with a wry expression and heads
text: back over. Craig reluctantly follows. Marlo clocks Craig and
text: Drew's beers.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: It’s 11 a.m.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I know. It’s oatmeal stout. Did you
dialog: see Princess Hannah? She was a Miss

text: Greta does look happy as she and her friends, including
text: Sarah, run up to Princess Hannah. Shasta, the nanny, follows
dialog: after as always.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Greta should look happy. Look at
dialog: all this shit. Our wedding at the
dialog: Ritz wasn’t this nice.
text: Elyse walks over, spanking Craig playfully on the butt.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Yes it was!
text: She winks at Marlo.
speaker_heading: ELYSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Marlo, you look awesome! For real.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You’re not lying this time.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Ha ha. How are you doing?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m really, really good. Thank you
dialog: so much for the night nanny.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yes. That’s been a game-changer. I
dialog: mean, I can’t overstate--
text: Craig looks at them quizzically.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: You called her?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah. I decided to stop being
text: “Marlo the Martyr” and accept help.
dialog: Seriously, I appreciate it.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Isn’t it nice to have some help and
dialog: actually be able to enjoy your
dialog: kids?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Where are your kids, Elyse?
text: Taken aback, Elyse scans the yard.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Um... I don’t know. But I’m sure
dialog: they’re having the best time.
dialog: Right? I mean look at all this.
text: She takes a sip of wine, embarrassed.
text: Suddenly, Sarah appears, clinging to Marlo.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hey, Sarah. What's up?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Why don’t you go see what Princess
dialog: Hannah’s doing?
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don’t think she’s a real
dialog: princess.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Sure she is.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: No. Her skin looks like an orange
dialog: peel.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Sarah!
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: It’s orange and there’s like holes
dialog: in it.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Those are called pores.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Yeah, she has big pores.
text: Marlo pats Sarah’s shoulder with affection.
scene_heading: INT. CRAIG AND ELYSE’S HOUSE (PLAYROOM) - DAY
text: The party has moved into the PLAYROOM. Kids mill about,
text: making a mess and eating pifiata candy. Marlo and Sarah are at
text: the front of the room, singing a KARAOKE DUET together. Now,
text: both of their faces are painted as BUTTERFLIES. They’re doing
dialog: a shockingly good job at “Call Me Maybe.”
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hey, I just met you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: And this is crazy.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: So here's my number.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Call me maybe.
speaker_heading: SARAH AND MARLO
dialog: Before you came into my life I
dialog: missed you so bad. I missed you so
dialog: bad. I missed you so, so bad.
dialog: 57.
text: Sarah and Marlo are dancing around, enjoying a rare moment of
text: pure mother-daughter whimsy. Drew watches his wife, surprised
dialog: to see her being this outgoing.
text: Marlo struts to the front of the room, doing a crazy dance
text: solo, spanking her own ass and “riding the pony.”
text: Craig and Elyse appear at Drew’s side.
speaker_heading: ELYSE
text: Marlo seems really... awake.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: Ha ha, yeah, she’s got the pep back
dialog: in her step, as our Nana used to
dialog: say. I’m loving it.
text: Craig seems pleased, but Drew doesn’t recognize this person.
text: He looks slightly disturbed.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I mean, it’s actually kind of weir--
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Oh look, she’s doing the Nae Nae!
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELYSE
dialog: Go Marlo! Go Marlo!
text: Craig and Elyse are so entertained by “Fun Marlo” that Drew
text: manages to suppress the nagging feeling of of concern and
text: join the party, so to speak. He smiles tightly.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: (pleased)
text: There she is.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO’S CAR — DAY
text: Drew drives home. Jonah and Sarah are asleep in the back
text: seat. Marlo is passed out in the passenger seat. She’s
text: sweated off most of her butterfly makeup and looks slightly
text: deranged.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (DEN) - NIGHT
text: Tully, having just arrived for her shift, drops her
text: OVERSTUFFED BACKPACK on the floor of the kitchen and opens
text: the fridge like a hungry teenager. Marlo can’t help but smile
text: as she paws through the food.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: What’s that in the pitcher?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh, I made sangria since it’s
dialog: getting warmer. It always reminds
dialog: me of college.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You see? You are a homemaker.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Because I made sangria? People make
text: sangria in prison toilets.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I know. It’s called “pruno.” May I
dialog: have a glass?
text: This request surprises Marlo, coming from her baby’s
dialog: caregiver, but she
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Uh, sure. I guess I’1l have one
dialog: too. That’s polite hostessing,
dialog: right?
text: Marlo gets two glasses out of the cabinet.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: A-1. Let’s take the baby outside
dialog: and enjoy the evening.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: EXT. MARLO AND DREW’S HOUSE (BACK YARD) - NIGHT
text: Marlo and Drew’s back yard is small, weedy and unimpressive--
text: no Japanese soaking tub. But there are WHITE FAIRY LIGHTS
text: strung from the house to the detached garage, and it’s cozy.
text: Tully and Marlo (accompanied by Mia) sit on an outdoor couch
text: side by side, sipping their sangria.
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Am I ever going to meet Drew?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Sure, let’s wake him up right now.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I mean, isn’t he curious about the
dialog: person who’s ministering to his
dialog: wife and baby every night?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: He’s curious. He asks about you.
dialog: But he’s-- well, he’s not the most
dialog: social guy. Like, I love him, but
dialog: he’s a nerd. A real nerd, not like
dialog: a postmodern nerd. He’s the kind of
dialog: guy who went to high school wearing
text: a trench coat and a hat and not
text: even a little deodorant.
text: Tully nods.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyway, he works all day and then
dialog: he really does a lot with the kids
text: when he gets home. Homework, the
dialog: reading log, all of it. We make
text: their lunches together. And then he
text: just shuts down. He goes upstairs
text: and puts on his little headset and
text: then he’s just out.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Don’t you guys ever...
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Have sex? No. We haven’t had sex in
dialog: months. Maybe close to a year. He
text: does puts a sock on the door to
dialog: warn me when he’s masturbating.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: That’s considerate.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Are you in a relationship?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I’m in several.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Ha. I was like you back in the day.
dialog: I tried every horse on the
dialog: carousel. And then I met Drew.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Which horse was Drew?
text: Marlo tosses back the last of her drink.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Drew was the bench.
text: She pours out more sangria for her and Tully.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: But you love him.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah. Definitely. I chose the right
dialog: person; I know that.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Then why don’t you have sex?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Well, I hold the baby all day. It’s
dialog: me and her and it’s primal; we’re
text: just like two gorillas at the zoo.
text: Then nighttime rolls around, and
dialog: I’m just supposed to switch gears
dialog: and go, “Okay, now I’m sexy. Now my
dialog: boobs are supposed to be sexual,
dialog: instead of two bags of milk ina
dialog: Canadian grocery store. It’s like--
dialog: did you ever play Tetris? When I
dialog: was a kid I used to play Tetris for
dialog: hours and hours. I was addicted.
dialog: And when I'd go to bed, I’d close
dialog: my eyes and I’d still see those
dialog: stupid bricks falling. It’s like
dialog: that now, except instead of bricks,
dialog: it’s Mia. I go to bed and I just
text: see Mia. I smell her. I feel her. I
dialog: can’t turn it off.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Of course you do.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I like Drew. I like what I know of
dialog: him. And I want you guys to stay
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh, I do too. I don’t want my kids
dialog: to grow up like I did. I had three
dialog: stepmothers, can you believe that?
text: Krystal, Tricia, and Wei-Wei.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Then we need to fix this.
dialog: Does Drew have any sexual
dialog: fantasies?
text: Marlo is taken aback by this frank query.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Well, I mean, I’ve seen his browser
dialog: history. Pretty basic stuff. You
dialog: know, girls from Florida with stars
text: tattooed on their ribs.
text: Tully knows Marlo is holding back information.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Actually... there is one thing.
dialog: Drew worked at a diner when he was
dialog: in high school. Washing dishes. And
dialog: the waitresses, they all wore those
dialog: little outfits, with the hat? He’s
dialog: had a fantasy about it ever since.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: There’s a reason they call them the
dialog: formative years.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah. So I actually bought a
dialog: uniform a while back, thinking I
dialog: would wear it and surprise him. But
dialog: then I just never got around to it.
dialog: And now my legs have veins, my tits
dialog: have veins... my body’s a relief
text: map of a war-torn country.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Do you still have it? The little
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes, but even if it fits, it would
dialog: just be depressing.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 61.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: You, on the other hand-- you could
dialog: wear the shit out of it.
text: She gives Tully an awkward once-over. Tully raises an
text: eyebrow, inspired.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (STAIRS) - NIGHT
text: Marlo quickly tiptoes down the STAIRS holding a wadded of
text: clothing. Tully sticks her HAND out of the bathroom, dressing-
text: room style. Marlo hands her the dress, amused by the gambit.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Here. Never been worn.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: (behind the door)
dialog: There’s your trouble.
text: Marlo waits outside the bathroom. The door swings open. Tully
dialog: does, in fact, look very cute.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Patty melt?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You should keep that. Wow, you have
dialog: had zero children.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Do you think I should leave it on
dialog: when we get upstairs, or take it
dialog: off?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Upstairs?
text: Tully smiles expectantly and squares her shoulders.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: You're joking.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo opens the door a crack. Drew is sound asleep, curled up
text: on his side of the bed. The clock on the night stand reads
text: 12:10 AM.
text: Marlo opens the door fully. Tully walks in behind her.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Is this a Fifties diner? I want to
dialog: be accurate to the period.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s just a regular diner.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Am I sassy?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Maybe just keep the dialogue to a
dialog: minimum.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Okay.
text: Tully nods and walks over to the bed. She gently wakes Drew.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: Huh? Jonah?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Hi there. I don’t think we’ve met.
dialog: Will you be dining in today?
text: Marlo nods reassuringly. Drew, in shock, just stares at
dialog: Tully.
text: Tully climbs on top of Drew effortlessly.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: If you’re not familiar with our
dialog: menu, I recommend the egg cream.
text: Drew struggles, surprised.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: What the hell, Marlo?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s okay, Drew. This is for you.
dialog: Just go with it.
text: Tully begins KISSING Drew. Marlo walks to the side of the
text: bed. Drew resists for another moment, then surrenders. Tully
text: begins pulling up Drew’s T-shirt.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: We also have a wonderful selection
dialog: of pastries. And I’ve just put ona
text: fresh pot of hot coffee.
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (helpless)
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (to Tully)
dialog: I’11 tell you what he likes.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Why don’t you show me? I’m just a
dialog: trainee.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: All right.
text: Drew eagerly pulls off his shirt. Tully pulls down his pants.
text: Marlo gingerly creeps onto the bed and kneels behind Tully.
text: She unzips Tully’s waitress uniform-- if it’s possible to do
text: so tenderly, she does.
text: She looks into Drew's eyes over Tully’s shoulder. He gazes
text: back at her with LOVE AND GRATITUDE in his eyes, accepting
dialog: the gift without further question.
scene_heading: INT. DREW AND MARLO’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - MORNING
text: The next morning, over COFFEE. They can barely make eye
text: contact. Drew clears his throat. While embarrassed, he also
text: looks like the proverbial cat who ate the canary.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Should we talk about last night?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: We don’t have to.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: That was pretty kinky. Where did
dialog: the costume come from?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Just a uniform supply place. I was
dialog: really nervous you wouldn't be up
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Are you kidding?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I was afraid you’d think I was
dialog: crazy.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Why haven’t we ever done that
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s not like the opportunity ever
dialog: presented itself... Hi, Jo-Jo!
text: Before she can finish explaining herself, Jonah prances into
text: the room in his pajamas.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I had a dream about a camel.
text: Marlo pulls him onto her lap.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: A camel! Were you in the desert?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: No, I was in my house.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: That’s so silly. You want pancakes?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Let’s see if we can make Mickey
dialog: Mouse.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: But the last time we tried that, he
dialog: only had one ear.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Nope, this is a two-ear day. I can
dialog: feel it.
text: Drew stares at his wife admiringly, lovingly as she and Jonah
text: head to the refrigerator for eggs and milk.
scene_heading: INT. PARK (RUNNING TRAIL) - DAY
text: A running trail. Marlo, with earbuds in her ears, is ready
text: for her first workout since giving birth. She wears a sports
text: tank and sweats. She starts JOGGING with a slow gait.
text: There’s another RUNNER up ahead, a college girl with a
text: ponytail, a perfect ass, and perfect running skills.
text: Marlo runs faster. Soon, she’s gaining on the woman.
dialog: 66.
text: Determined, Marlo speeds up.
text: She keeps running, her cheeks red. She’s pushing herself past
text: the point of exhaustion, running like the T-1000.
text: We see Sarah riding her bike nearby. She pauses, watching her
text: mom fly by. She looks both impressed and confused.
text: Marlo finally PASSES the girl. She veers off the path and
text: practically collapses against a tree. She’s panting, red-
dialog: faced.
text: The girl slows up as she approaches.
speaker_heading: RUNNER GIRL
dialog: You okay?
text: Reveal Marlo, panting and red-faced, with two huge WET SPOTS
text: spreading over her breasts.
text: Marlo gives the girl the thumbs up. Her head drops between
text: her legs.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - NIGHT
text: It’s late. The time on the microwave reads 9:59. Marlo is
text: reading a book called “Parenting the Out-of-Sync Child.”
text: She hears the familiar KNOCK on the door and puts down her
dialog: book.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (ENTRY) - NIGHT
text: Tully enters, looking subtly different. Her usual T-shirt has
text: been replaced with a cute “going out” top, and her sneakers
text: have been traded in for lace-up boots. She wrings her hands
text: apologetically.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Marlo, I’m really sorry to do this,
dialog: but can I ask you a huge favor?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Of course. I mean, you’ve done so
dialog: much for me. What do you need?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I need a night off. Like
dialog: really bad.
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: No problem. You’ve been coming here
dialog: every night for weeks. Just let me
dialog: know when.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: Oh. Sure. You know, you could have
dialog: just called me. You didn’t have to
dialog: come here.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Well, that’s the thing. I want you
dialog: to come with me.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: TULLY
text: Out. To the city.
text: Tully’s energy is manic. Her eyes sparkle.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: The city-city?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Yeah. New York. Big Apple. City
dialog: that never sleeps.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: To do what?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Fun stuff. Go to a bar. Dance.
text: Marlo laughs at the utter absurdity of the idea.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Who’s going to take care of Mia?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Oh, I don’t know. It’s almost as
dialog: though there’s another responsible
text: adult at this address. Named Drew.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: But what if she--
text: Tully won’t even let Marlo finish a sentence.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Mia’s been sleeping through the
dialog: night for the last week. Drew won't
dialog: even know we're gone.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: God, I don’t know...
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Drew goes into Manhattan every
dialog: single day.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: For work. I can’t, Tully. You go
dialog: out and have a good time.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I can’t have a good time
dialog: without you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You know, I feel like I've been
dialog: very useful around here. In many
dialog: regards. And I don’t think this is
dialog: an unreasonable request. I don’t
dialog: have a lot of friends my own age,
dialog: due to the unusual nature of this
dialog: job, and I just need to get out.
dialog: And P.S.-- you do too! You can’t be
dialog: a good mom without adequate self-
dialog: care.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I don’t know if getting shit-
dialog: wrecked in Manhattan qualifies as
dialog: “self-care.”
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Okay. You're right.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We'll go to Brooklyn.
text: Her smile is irresistible.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO’S CAR - NIGHT
text: A newly made-up Marlo drives. She looks reasonably hip,
text: having traded her sweatpants for jeans and a T-shirt. Tully
text: rides shotgun, checking her makeup in a compact.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I still think maybe we should have
dialog: Uber-ed it.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I told you, I’1ll be the chauffeuse.
dialog: I’1l have one or two drinks and
dialog: then I’1l drive us home.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Why are you so nice to me?
dialog: (dry)
dialog: I mean, aside from the fact that
dialog: you're being paid.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I think you and I both know that
dialog: this is more than a transaction.
text: Marlo chuckles uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah, I’ve pretty much trusted you
dialog: with everything.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I’ve trusted you, too. Thanks for
dialog: not murdering me.
text: Marlo snorts.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Seriously.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I need bourbon.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Bourbon’s my drink.
text: Tully smiles and turns up the radio. Marlo’s worries start to
text: fade away as she becomes energized by their escape.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: Marlo’s Honda Fit crosses a bridge over a river that will
text: take them out of Rye and toward the city.
dialog: 70.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSHWICK, BROOKLYN - NIGHT
text: Marlo’s car cruises down Wyckoff Avenue in Bushwick. YOUNG
text: PEOPLE cross the street and converge on the corners, smoking
text: and talking. A GIRL wearing leg warmers makes out with her
text: BOYFRIEND. Marlo becomes excited, restless, as she looks out
text: at the passing scene.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: This is my old neighborhood. I
dialog: lived here for years.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Then this is where we should be.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It wasn’t always this nice. Look,
dialog: there’s a bakery for dogs.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: What did it used to be?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: A bakery for humans.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Whoa.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes. People ate flour in those
dialog: times.
scene_heading: INT. BUSHWICK BAR - NIGHT
text: Marlo and Tully walk into a crowded, popular bar. Marlo looks
text: more radiant than we’ve ever seen her. Younger. It’s like the
text: tension in her face has disappeared for the first time in
dialog: months.
text: Tully strides up to the bar. Marlo hangs meekly beside her.
text: They somehow get IMMEDIATE SERVICE-- Tully has that power.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Hi. Two Makers, neat.
speaker_heading: HOT BARTENDER
dialog: You want any water with that?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Do I look like I need a bath?
text: The young BARTENDER grins at Tully.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: HOT BARTENDER
dialog: You got it, babe.
text: The bartender disappears to fill the order. Marlo smiles
text: wistfully at the flirtation.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: That guy is obsessed with you.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Actually, he was looking at you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah, right. I have the sex appeal
text: of a binder clip.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You look radiant tonight.
text: Marlo looks at Tully with great affection.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Really? Go on.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: How long has it been since you had
dialog: a girls’ night?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: A year or ten.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Do you have a lot of girlfriends?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Not anymore.
text: She smiles uncomfortably, closing the subject. The bartender
text: pushes the drinks across the bar.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: Thanks, babe.
scene_heading: INT. BUSHWICK BAR (CORNER/TABLE) - NIGHT
text: Tully and Marlo settle in. Marlo looks around the room.
text: PEOPLE HAVING FUN. Youth. Energy. She can’t help but smile.
dialog: This is exactly what she needed.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: This used to be a different bar.
dialog: They must have taken it down to the
dialog: studs. I hardly recognize it.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Have you ever heard of the “Ship of
dialog: Theseus” paradox?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yeah, in college, I think. Which
dialog: one is that?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Let’s say you were to take a wooden
dialog: ship and replace one plank every
dialog: year. Eventually, the ship would be
text: made up of entirely new planks and
dialog: there would be nothing left of the
dialog: original ship. So is it still the
dialog: same ship? Or a new ship?
text: A buzzed Marlo thinks about it very briefly.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: New ship.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Because it just is! Nothing’s the
dialog: same. It’s a new ship, baby.
dialog: Nouveau bateau.
text: Her French accent is absurd as she takes a swig of bourbon.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Then what about people? When you
dialog: look at your baby pictures, clearly
dialog: you’re unrecognizable compared to
dialog: now. But it’s you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: If every part of me has regenerated
dialog: then I guess I’m not me anymore.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Well, humans can’t regenerate
dialog: completely. There’s actually one
dialog: part of us that doesn’t.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What’s that, Encyclopedia Brown?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: The hearing cells in our ears. They
dialog: can’t grow back. Once they’re dead,
dialog: they’re dead.
dialog: 73.
scene_heading: INT. BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT
text: We’re in a DIFFERENT BAR, where a ROCK N’ ROLL BAND rips
text: through a raucous song. Music BLASTS, killing those ear cells
dialog: dead.
text: Tully and Marlo dance wildly. Tully grabs Marlo’s hand. They

text: Marlo is drunk. She doesn’t care who’s watching.
scene_heading: INT. SMALLER BAR (BOOTH) - NIGHT
text: A thoroughly drunk Marlo and Tully settle into a more
dialog: intimate bar for “just one more.” There’s a newfangled touch-
text: screen JUKEBOX against the wall; a guy is plugging in some
text: songs. Tully clocks it, excited.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I want to play something.
text: Tully dashes off. Marlo checks out the cozy bar. A group of
text: PUNK GIRLS head to the bathroom en masse. Marlo stares at
text: them longingly.
text: Moments later, the song “Blue” by the Jayhawks begins
dialog: playing; we recognize it as one of Marlo’s favorites from the
text: beginning of the movie. Tully returns to the booth.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hey, this is one of my favorite
dialog: songs!
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Mine too. That’s why I picked it.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I used to listen to this with
dialog: Violet all the time.
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: I lived with her, here in Bushwick,
dialog: a long time ago. This was our
dialog: record.
dialog: (then, confused)
dialog: How did you get it to play right
dialog: away?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: It’s a secret.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You know what my daughter and her
dialog: friends say? ”
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Secrets, secrets are no fun.
dialog: Secrets, secrets hurt someone.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Well, if I tell you a secret, you
dialog: have to tell me one of yours. Okay?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Sure. Why not?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: We‘ll do it at the same time. Count
dialog: of three. Ready?
text: Marlo nods.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: One, two, three.
speaker_heading: MARLO TULLY
dialog: I’m gay. I paid an extra fifty cents.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Wait, what did you say?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I paid an extra fifty cents. You
dialog: can skip the line on these new
dialog: jukeboxes if you pay just a little
dialog: extra. I was feeling grandiose.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Thank you for sharing that, Tully.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Wasn’t it brave of me?
text: Marlo sits back in the booth, closing her eyes, her head
dialog: swimming.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSHWICK STREET - NIGHT
text: Tully helps Marlo walk down the street. Marlo is OBLITERATED,
text: stumbling. Tully somehow seems perfectly sober.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Wait... wait... stop. You’re not
dialog: going to drive, are you?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I’m fine. I promise.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: That’s not possible. You went round
dialog: for round with me. Let’s just leave
dialog: the car here and take a cab back.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: But Drew will be angry.
text: Marlo braces herself against a parking meter.
speaker_heading: MARLO
text: Drew doesn’t get angry. He just
text: gets very quiet.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: And that’s worse than angry, isn’t
dialog: it?
dialog: Right. As always.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: This is the last thing you’re going
dialog: to talk me into, Tully.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You're right. It is.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Oh, you’re quitting?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You knew this was temporary.
dialog: Besides, I think it’s time for me
dialog: to find another line of work.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: So what do you have lined up? I bet
dialog: you have big plans. Your twenties
dialog: are great. But then your thirties
dialog: come around the corner like a
dialog: garbage truck at 5 a.m. Yeah. You
dialog: gotta think long-term. What are you
dialog: going to do when that cute little
dialog: ass drops and your feet grow half a
dialog: size with each pregnancy, and the
dialog: whole “free spirit” thing stops
text: being charming and starts looking
dialog: ugly?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I’m not afraid of the future.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You should be. I’m it.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: What’s wrong with that? You know
dialog: what your problem is? You’re
dialog: convinced you’re a failure, but you
dialog: actually made your biggest dream
dialog: come true.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I know how bad your childhood was.
dialog: So now you’re giving your kids what
dialog: you never had. That sameness you
dialog: despise? That’s your gift to them.
text: Waking up every day, doing the same
dialog: things for them over and over even
dialog: though it grinds you down. Yes, you
dialog: are boring. Your marriage is
dialog: boring, your house is boring, and
dialog: that’s incredible. That’s the big
dialog: dream you had when you were young.
dialog: To grow up and be dull and constant
dialog: and raise your kids in that circle
dialog: of safety. You made it happen,
dialog: Marlo. You are a steady and elegant
text: mother. Day after day. Night after
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: But I don’t feel safe. I feel
dialog: scared.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: That’s what I’m here for. To keep
dialog: you safe, so you can doing your
dialog: job. We can’t afford to lose you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Stop caring so much. You’re such a
dialog: care lord.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You're a care lord.
text: Marlo looks at Tully. She suddenly turns and runs across the
text: street to a rack of CITI BIKES. Tully watches, confused, as
text: Marlo drunkenly wrangles a bike.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Marlo!
text: Marlo rides off into the night at full speed.
dialog: 77.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSHWICK STREETS - NIGHT
text: Marlo is riding as fast as she can toward her undisclosed
text: destination. Tully comes up next to her on a second CitiBike.
text: They both pedal like mad.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I need to go to my old place.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: But you don’t live there anymore.
text: Marlo stops. Considers this. Takes off again.
scene_heading: EXT. BUSHWICK RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
text: After riding for a few blocks, Marlo arrives at a big, old
text: industrial BRICK BUILDING. Panting and sweating, she hops off
text: the bike and drops it on the sidewalk. She approaches the
text: door. There’s a large SECURITY KEYPAD for entry.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (to herself)
dialog: Okay, what is this?
text: Tully comes up next to her.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: This didn’t used to be here.
text: She drunkenly punches in a few numbers, muttering to herself.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Unit 5...
dialog: Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck.
text: She repeatedly PUNCHES the key-pad in a rage.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Marlo, this is not your home.
text: Marlo’s nose is pressed up to the glass.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: There’s a fucking lobby now? With
dialog: furniture?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to the guy who sleeps
dialog: in the doorway? I used to step over
dialog: that guy every morning to go to
dialog: work. And he'd say “Good morning,
dialog: Margo.” Every damn day.
dialog: Me and Vi would bring hima
dialog: sandwich sometimes. Where is he? Do
dialog: you think he died?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Yes, I do. Let’s walk.
text: Marlo pulls out her cell phone, desperately.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: She still lives here. I’m texting
dialog: her. She’1l let us up. Do you like
dialog: coke? She always has it. You know,
dialog: you have not cleaned a kitchen
dialog: until you’ve done it Bolivian-
dialog: style.
text: Marlo is frantically typing a TEXT MESSAGE. Tully tries to
text: stop her, but she hits “send.”
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: I let her know we're here. She's
dialog: going to like you a lot. Like, a
dialog: lot.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: We have to go home. And I can’t
dialog: leave without you, Marlo. I wish I
dialog: could let you stay, and go up
text: there, but there is no “there”
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes there is. Look!
text: She pounds the brick with her fist. Tully just looks at her
dialog: sadly.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Come with me.
text: Marlo’s tone turns accusing.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: This was your idea. Why did you
dialog: bring me here in the first place?
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I was being selfish. We came too
dialog: far out. I have to bring you home.
text: Marlo rubs her BREASTS, wincing with discomfort.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Ow.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You're really full.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It hurts. I need Mia. I‘1l just go
dialog: home and feed her.
text: Marlo is massaging her sore breasts compulsively.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: No. Not yet.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I miss her.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You'll see her soon. Come on.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: She won’t the same tomorrow. That’s
dialog: what you said. I don’t want her to
dialog: grow!
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Yes, you do.
text: Tully beckons to Marlo. Defeated, Marlo stumbles toward
text: Tully. Tully takes her arm and leads her away from the
text: building. Marlo lays her head on Tully’s shoulder and cries.
text: As they walk off into the night, we suddenly hear a VOICE on
text: the intercom. It sounds hoarse and disoriented.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (0.S.)
dialog: Hello? Marlo, are you out there?
text: But Tully and Marlo are already out of earshot, disappearing
text: into the night.
speaker_heading: VIOLET (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Marlo?
dialog: 80.
scene_heading: INT. SEEDY DIVE BAR - NIGHT
text: Tully and a disheveled Marlo enter a SEEDY DIVE BAR they
dialog: definitely don’t belong at.
text: Tully guides Marlo toward the bathroom. The door SWINGS OPEN.
text: A truly DISGUSTING DUDE is walking out. We can see even from
dialog: this vantage point that it’s not an appealing place to deal
text: with the milk situation. But Marlo is desperate.
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Tully and Marlo enter the bathroom. It’s Trainspotting-
text: filthy, with grafitti on the walls. Tully takes off her
text: SWEATER and wets it in the sink under hot water.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I’m making a hot compress. It‘1ll
dialog: feel like a little baby mouth.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: This is really messed up.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: It’‘ll help get things going.
text: She hands Marlo the makeshift compress. Marlo puts it on her
text: boob dutifully.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Now milk yourself.
text: Marlo stands over the toilet and starts massaging herself.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: It’s not working.
dialog: (gagging)
dialog: Oh God, it smells like Spam in
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Think about Mia. Do you have a
dialog: photo? That might help.
text: She takes Marlo’s phone out of her purse and quickly pulls up
text: Marlo’s PHOTOS. She scrolls through, looking for a photo of
text: Mia. We glimpse a lot of weird SELFIES of Marlo.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Why do you have so many pictures of
dialog: yourself?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I keep thinking the next one will
dialog: look different.
text: Tully finds a photo of Mia and holds the phone in front of
text: Marlo’s face. Someone BANGS on the door.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: One second!
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’M PERFORMING A MIRACLE!
dialog: (then)
dialog: It won’t come out.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Let me. Do you mind?
text: Marlo tacitly agrees. Tully begins kneading Marlo’s breast.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: You have to use a rolling motion.
text: Marlo looks queasy. Tully rolls her hand back and forth.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: See? It’s like a wave.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I think I’m going crazy.
text: We hear a TRICKLING sound as Marlo’s milk finally lets down
text: into the toilet bowl below.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: There we go.
text: Marlo VOMITS. Tully holds back her hair. When Marlo comes up
text: for air, Tully is already there to gently wipe Marlo’s mouth
text: with a napkin.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Now we’ll go home.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO’S CAR - NIGHT
text: Marlo is slumped in the front seat. Tully is in the drivers’
text: seat. For the first time ever, she seems NERVOUS.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Try to stay awake.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I’m so tired.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: I know. But I need you to stay
dialog: with me. Let’s have a conversation.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: All we do is converse. We’re like
text: the people in a Spanish textbook.
dialog: Maria and Julio, they never shut
dialog: up.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What am I going to do without you?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You’re going to take care of
dialog: yourself. You’re going to shower
dialog: every day, nourish and exercise
dialog: your body, and maybe even send
dialog: yourself roses once in a while.
dialog: Promise me you will.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (drifting off)
dialog: That’s... so... corny...
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Look Marlo, it’s the bridge.
text: They’re approaching the BRIDGE that takes them back to Rye.
speaker_heading: TULLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look. You're going to be in a soft
dialog: bed in your little house before you
dialog: know it. Under the same roof with
dialog: your three babies, cozy and
dialog: crowded. That old carpeting in your
text: bedroom. World’s weakest shower.
dialog: Home.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Mmph.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: We're going home.
text: Tully begins to lose control of the vehicle. First subtly,
dialog: and then, it’s beyond saving...
dialog: 83.
text: In an instant, the car CRASHES into a guard rail. Marlo’s
text: eyes briefly open. Another car plows into them. Black water.
dialog: Silence.
text: A flashback to Marlo’s DREAM the first night she met Tully: A
text: vision of the TULLY-MERMAID in the pool, her back turned,
text: swimming away forever.
text: SIRENS, the groan of a TOW TRUCK. The surprisingly mundane
text: conversation of PARAMEDICS...
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC 1 (0.S.)
dialog: Can you pass me that gauze? Yeah, I
dialog: didn’t even know they had pizza.
dialog: But it wasn’t bad.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC 2 (0.S.)
dialog: Let’s get another blanket here.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Marlo lies asleep in a hospital bed. She’s BEAT UP. There are
text: cuts and lacerations on her face. She has a black eye, a
text: broken arm, and her leg is in traction.
text: Drew sits on a chair next to her bed, pale and gravely
text: concerned. The room is silent.
text: DR. SMYTHE, a middle-aged woman, knocks and enters.
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: Hi. You are Marlo’s husband?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Yes. I’m Drew.
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: I’m Dr. Smythe. I’m on the
dialog: psychiatric staff here. I’d like to
dialog: talk to you about Marlo.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: Not here. Let’s let her nap.
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Drew and Dr. Smythe are in an empty hospital room or office,
text: away from where Marlo can hear them.
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: Does she have a history of mental
dialog: illness?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: No. Well, yeah. She had some
dialog: depression after our son was born,
dialog: five years ago. It was pretty bad.
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: When you say “bad”...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: She didn’t want to hold him. She
text: couldn’t look at him. She just
dialog: wasn’t herself for months. She
dialog: actually, well, she did try to--
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Just tell me what’s going on.
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: We think she’s experiencing
text: something similar now, but on a
dialog: more extreme scale. This is what we
dialog: call “postpartum psychosis.”
text: Drew is flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Psychosis?
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: Yes. It’s a lot more serious than
dialog: just depression. It’s characterized
dialog: by hallucinations, delusions...
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: But she’s been amazing! She’s so
dialog: different this time. Her brother
dialog: got her a night nanny to help out,
dialog: and she’s getting sleep...
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: Actually, we believe she’s
dialog: suffering from extreme exhaustion
dialog: and sleep deprivation.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Oh. How?
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: I didn’t know. She seemed better
dialog: than she’s ever been.
dialog: (thinking)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, there have been a couple of
dialog: things that were out-of-character,
dialog: but I just... I just can’t believe
dialog: she would drive drunk like that.
dialog: And she just disappeared without
dialog: telling me. There was no one
dialog: watching the baby!
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: Weren’t you home?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Well, yeah, but...
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: What about the night nanny?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I don’t know where she was. I don’t
dialog: know anything about her; it was
dialog: Marlo’s thing. Can I go back in
dialog: there, please?
speaker_heading: DR. SMYTHE
dialog: They actually need you to finish
text: some of the paperwork at Admitting.
dialog: Then we’ll reconvene.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Marlo lies in bed, woozy and dreamy. She stares at the TRAY
text: next to her bed. Untouched food, a plastic pitches or water.
text: There’s a KNOCK. She manages to turn and look at the door.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Come in.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL (ADMITTING DESK) - DAY
text: Drew walks up to the ADMITTING area, where a female EMPLOYEE
text: surrounded by files taps away on a computer.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hi. Did you guys need some
dialog: information on Marlo Moreau?
dialog: 86.
scene_heading: HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
dialog: Moreau, yes. I have almost
dialog: everything I need. Do you have your
dialog: insurance card?
text: Drew digs the card out of his wallet.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yes, yes.
text: He hands the card over. The employee begins typing rapidly on
text: her keyboard, and asking questions in the familiar,
dialog: distracted tone of those who do such work.
scene_heading: HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
dialog: ..-And the patient’s date of birth?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: 6/7/77.
scene_heading: HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
dialog: (typing)
dialog: ..-Last four digits of her social?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Um, 8734.
scene_heading: HOSPITAL EMPLOYEE
dialog: And her maiden name?
text: Drew is distracted, checking his phone as he replies.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Tully.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: The door to Marlo’s hospital room swings open. It’s Tully,
text: uninjured. No worse for the wear. She smiles apologetically
dialog: at Marlo.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Hey. You’re a little beat up.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You should see the river.
text: Marlo’s voice is an exhausted croak.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: I didn’t tell anyone. About you.
dialog: They don’t even know you were
dialog: there.
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: You can tell them if you want to.
dialog: It’s okay. The people here will
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I don’t know if they will.
text: Tully sits down on Marlo’s bed.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: We can’t see each other anymore.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: This was supposed to be temporary
dialog: anyway. A few weeks. Just until the
dialog: smoke cleared.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What do I do now?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: What you’ve always done. And then
dialog: you'll do it again. And they’11l
dialog: grow, and you'll grow, and one day
dialog: you’ll rest and you’1l wish you
dialog: could do it all over.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: If I’m older, how are you wiser?
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Because I have lots of time to
dialog: think about stuff. Remember?
text: She smiles and smooths Marlo’s hair back from her forehead.
text: Marlo takes Tully’s hand and holds it.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Thank you for keeping me alive.
speaker_heading: TULLY
dialog: Same.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Drew is heading back to Marlo’s room. He passes Tully in the

dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Drew enters. He sees that Marlo is awake and stops in his

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Hi.

speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Um.
dialog: (choked up)
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Why are you sorry?
text: Drew is trembling.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I’m sorry I let this happen to you.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: You didn’t do anything.
text: Drew starts crying.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: I know. That’s the problem. I
dialog: didn’t know what was happening at
dialog: night! I was just overwhelmed,
dialog: between the baby, and work, and it
dialog: seemed like you were doing great.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I was doing great.
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Wasn't I great?
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Fuck that. I don’t need you to be
dialog: great. I just need you to be you.
dialog: We love you so much. I’m sorry if
dialog: you want to run away. I do too. But
dialog: I don’t, because I love us.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I love us too.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Am I in trouble?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah. You’re in trouble.
text: Marlo nods, painfully. Drew lays his head on her chest. She
text: touches him with her good hand.
speaker_heading: DREW (CONT'D)
dialog: Who were you with last night?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Nobody.
text: Tears slide down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT’D)
dialog: But next time I want to be
dialog: with you.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Yes. Let’s go out. Let’s talk.
dialog: There’s still a world out there. We
dialog: could go see it sometime. Even if
dialog: it’s just for a few hours.
speaker_heading: DREW
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (HALLWAY) - NIGHT
text: Weeks have passed. Marlo walks down the hallway of her house
text: with a CANE. Her bruises have faded to yellow, but her arm is
text: still in a sling.
text: She stops into Sarah’s room. Sarah is laboring over her
text: homework, aS usual. Marlo leans over Sarah’s desk, murmuring
text: guidance, then tousles her hair.
scene_heading: INT. MARLO AND DREW'S HOUSE (JONAH’S BEDROOM) - NIGHT
text: Marlo moves on down the hallway to Jonah’s room. Jonah sits
text: patiently in his pajamas, awaiting his treatment as he does
text: every night. Marlo is there to attend to him. She props her
text: cane against the wall and limps toward him.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Ready?
dialog: 90.
text: As in the beginning, we hear “Major Tom,” from Jonah’s
dialog: Langley Schools Music Project album.
text: Marlo reaches for Jonah’s WILBARGER BRUSH.
speaker_heading: MARLO (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s start with your feet tonight.
text: She begins sweeping the brush over the soles of his feet.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Mom, is this real?
text: Marlo pauses.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: Does it work? We do it every night
dialog: but I’m not sure what it’s supposed
dialog: to do.
text: Marlo thinks about it.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Well, honestly, I don’t know. Do
dialog: you like when we do it?
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: I like being by you.
text: Marlo smiles.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: I like being by you too.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: And it feels nice, I guess.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Well, maybe that’s all that
dialog: matters.
speaker_heading: JONAH
dialog: But we can just be together. We
dialog: don’t have to do the brush. I kind
dialog: of don’t think it’s real.
speaker_heading: MARLO
dialog: Okay. If you don’t think we need
dialog: it, then I guess we'll stop.
text: She puts the brush down and rests her chin in her hands.
dialog: gl.
