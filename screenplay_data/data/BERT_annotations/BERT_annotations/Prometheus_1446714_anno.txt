scene_heading: EXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.)
dialog: 
text: The world turns below us, vast and slow.
dialog: 
text: A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the
dialog: shadow. We cast the shadow.
dialog: 
text: Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:
text: river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.
dialog: No trace of civilization.
dialog: 
text: The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an
text: ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a
text: VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
dialog: 
text: They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white.
text: Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker
text: had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and
text: hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
dialog: 
text: Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
dialog: 
dialog: They are ENGINEERS.
dialog: 
text: Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
dialog: 
text: The third is naked.
dialog: 
text: One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:
text: inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
dialog: 
text: The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.
text: It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises
text: the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
dialog: 
text: BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his
text: lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
dialog: 
text: Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of
text: teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH ON:
dialog: 
text: A fevered glimpse of the microscopic: cells rupture and
text: bleed. Protein chains unfold. A DNA spiral unravels.
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ENGINEER
dialog: 
text: ...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
dialog: 
text: The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach
text: his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a
text: felled tree. Engulfed.
dialog: 
text: The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
dialog: 
text: Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
dialog: 
text: As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in
text: their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing.
text: Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
dialog: 
text: A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance.
dialog: 
text: A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement:
text: far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
dialog: 
text: A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep.
text: Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FLASH ON:
dialog: 
text: A microscopic invasion. Cells pierced and infused. DNA
text: strands twining and mating.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
dialog: 
text: Pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs.
dialog: 
text: She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab
text: lies in her palm.
dialog: 
text: As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away.
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON BLACK
dialog: 
text: Drifting motes of light against the dark: a starscape.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with
text: robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside
text: the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
dialog: 
dialog: This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many
text: disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
dialog: 
text: The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt
text: - and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
dialog: 
text: Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a
text: rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:
dialog: we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
dialog: 
text: The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The "stars"
text: are plankton shining in the floodlights.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A
text: sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Moving to survey site B... closing on
text: object four. The large oblong.
dialog: 
text: She watches the screen of a ground-penetrating radar system.
text: A bright signal return: something hidden in the cliff in
text: front of her. Something big.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm.
text: Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She
text: brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away
text: loose silt and stones.
dialog: 
text: The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
dialog: 
text: Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to
text: keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
dialog: 
text: In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its
text: outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
dialog: 
text: Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Martin. Here.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A second excavator glides out of the dark.
dialog: 
text: At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
text: genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the
text: rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
text: and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
dialog: 
text: He plays his floodlights over the obelisk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Look at that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
dialog: 
text: Watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk.
text: Scanning the alien text. Suddenly she stops. Grips the
text: obelisk with her excavator's arms to anchor herself in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: You need to see this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (V.O.)
dialog: Coming.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SEA TRENCH
dialog: 
text: Holloway pilots his excavator expertly up to Watts's. Mates
text: the two vehicles at their aft hatchways.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WATTS'S EXCAVATOR
dialog: 
text: Behind Watts, a hatch opens with a splatter of water.
dialog: 
text: Holloway climbs in. Squeezes into her cockpit. A tight fit.
text: He's distracted by her body, pressed so close - but she has
text: eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Same thing again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: What do you see?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
text: An ephemeris - a star map.
speaker_heading: (POINTING)
dialog: Radius, inclination, azimuth...more
dialog: data here...
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: If we can get epoch and equinox out of
dialog: that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Can we raise this thing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Hundreds of tons.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MEDITERRANEAN SEA - DAY
dialog: 
text: A research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. Bright sun.
dialog: 
text: In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon
text: is dominated by the VOLCANIC PEAK - the same peak we saw in
text: the distance in the prologue.
dialog: 
text: Aboard the research vessel, cranes lift Watts and Holloway's
text: excavators out of the sea and onto the deck.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - AFT DECK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Under an awning, PRINTS of the obelisk's faces are stretched
text: on the deck - fifteen feet long.
dialog: 
text: Watts and Holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in
text: hand. Parsing, translating, calculating.
dialog: 
text: They're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. The
text: Mediterranean coast in the distance. It's an idyllic way to
text: work. But they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AFT DECK - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They're still at it. Lights illuminate the workspace. The
text: obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations.
dialog: 
text: Holloway sits at a table. Watts sits on the marked-up prints.
text: Both working through calculations on electronic slates.
dialog: 
text: Holloway looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: I have a solution. A single match.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Me too. Checked it twice.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: You first.
dialog: 
text: Watts holds up her slate: it displays a set of stellar
text: coordinates. A detailed star map. Holloway holds up his own
text: slate: an exact match. They lock eyes in electric excitement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: What do we do now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: We go there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL (EARTH ORBIT)
dialog: 
text: A gleaming space station like a five-spoked wheel rotates
text: grandly against the Pacific Ocean a thousand miles below.
text: Black letters on the white metal read: WEYLAND'S WHEEL.
dialog: 
text: A round shuttlecraft approaches the station.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INT. SHUTTLECRAFT (ZERO GRAVITY)
dialog: 
text: A spacecraft no bigger than a private jet.
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs. The
text: only two passengers aboard. New to space travel, Watts tears
text: her eyes from the spectacle of Earth outside the window.
dialog: 
text: Holloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in
dialog: the zero gravity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: What's first? You do climate, I do
dialog: genetics?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Archaeology first. Let our ancestors
dialog: tell the tale.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: You think he's serious?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Serious enough to send his private
dialog: shuttle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Weyland can send his shuttle out for
dialog: pizza.
speaker_heading: (DELICATELY)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: Martin. If this meeting goes like the
dialog: others, maybe we should...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: It won't go like the others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 
text: Holloway plucks the pen from the air. He points out the
text: window, where the crescent Moon shines like a toothy grin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Heaven smiles on our enterprise.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
dialog: 
text: The shuttle docks with the Wheel's hub - a perfect fit.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - SPOKE ELEVATOR (ZERO GRAVITY)
dialog: 
text: A gleaming capsule elevator with windows to the stars.
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts float weightlessly inside, moving from
text: handhold to handhold. The door closes.
dialog: 
text: Watts grabs Holloway by the collar. Pulls them roughly
text: together. They kiss. Not for the first time. They have a way.
dialog: 
text: Watts's hair and clothing float free: she's a naiad in
text: Holloway's arms.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL
dialog: 
text: The elevator descends along the spoke to the rim.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. WEYLAND'S WHEEL - RIM - FOYER
dialog: 
text: A luxurious lobby. Tasteful lighting. Eames-era furniture in
text: wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future.
dialog: 
text: At the rim, the Wheel's rotation supplies gravity. An
text: elevator door opens. Watts and Holloway step out - Holloway
text: with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder.
dialog: 
text: The floor is the outer surface of the Wheel: in both
text: directions it curves upward out of sight.
dialog: 
text: The walls are all windows: on one side, Earth rotates lazily.
text: On the other, a wheeling field of stars.
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: DAVID, an android, stands waiting for them. He's cunningly
dialog: built, but no one would mistake him for a real human being.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Professor Holloway. Dr. Watts. My name
speaker_heading: is DAVID.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Hello, DAVID.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mr. Weyland's eager to meet you.
dialog: 
text: He strides off across the foyer. Watts and Holloway exchange
text: a wondering glance and follow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXHIBIT HALL
dialog: 
text: DAVID leads past models of planets, moons and asteroids.
text: Holographic labels and data swirl around them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: These are all the planetary bodies on

dialog: claims.
dialog: 
text: The end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of Mars.
text: Markings indicate widespread surface activity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: And Mars. Weyland's crown jewel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: How is that going? The terraforming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: They say you're getting diminishing
text: returns. It's not working.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's the greatest engineering project
dialog: ever attempted. Challenges are
dialog: inevitable. Mr. Weyland's a
dialog: determined man.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND'S OFFICE
dialog: 
text: PETER WEYLAND sits behind a mahogany desk. He's a Warren
dialog: Buffet type: a country sage, horse-sense and hard knocks. He
dialog: might be seventy years old, or a hundred and seventy.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Behind him stands DIRECTOR LYDIA VICKERS, a slim woman of 45
text: in a costly business suit. Shrewd and watchful. Once a great
text: beauty, she now trades in ruthlessness.
dialog: 
text: DAVID stands against the wall.
dialog: 
text: Watts and Holloway settle into chairs in front of Weyland -
text: Holloway holding the metal folio.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: Professor Holloway. Ms. Watts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Doctor Watts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: Forgive me. Peter Weyland.
dialog: 
text: He notices Watts looking curiously at DAVID. He smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah. DAVID here's a prototype. Our 80
dialog: series. One of a kind for now, but if
dialog: he performs, he will be legion.
dialog: (his smile fades)
dialog: What do you want here?
dialog: 
text: Holloway looks at him, startled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: We sent you a prospectus that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: Assume I know nothing.
dialog: 
text: Holloway swallows. Lays the metal folio on Weyland's desk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: I'm an archaeologist.
dialog: 
text: He touches a tiny remote. Holographs appear in the air over
text: Weyland's desk: the folio is a three-dimensional imager.
dialog: 
text: Pictures of a younger Holloway in the field: excavating ruins
dialog: in Egypt, China, Peru, Greece.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: In my studies I discovered a pattern I
dialog: couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred
dialog: years, sudden advances in agriculture,
dialog: tool use, technology. Inventions.
dialog: Something caused a great leap forward.
dialog: Every eleven centuries. The pattern
dialog: holds as far back as our data goes.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tens of thousands of years. I had to
dialog: understand this. It became the focus
dialog: of my work.
dialog: 
text: Weyland nods. Holloway glances at Watts and forges on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dr. Watts was a student of mine.
dialog: 
text: Watts touches her own remote. The holographic display turns
text: to scientific diagrams. Images of a very young and beautiful
text: Watts in the laboratory.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: I was analyzing historical changes in
dialog: human DNA. I found the same pattern.
dialog: Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new
dialog: information in the genome of the human
dialog: race. All over the world. Evolution
dialog: can't do that. Something was changing
dialog: us. Changing the DNA of our species.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Humanity's been visited. Visited
dialog: by...beings from somewhere else.
dialog: 
text: Behind Weyland, Vickers can't suppress a scowl of disdain.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: Lydia Vickers, Director of Operations.
dialog: Practically my right hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: They guided us to civilization. Lifted
dialog: us up, again and again. I call them
dialog: the Engineers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Once you know what you're looking for,
dialog: it's amazing how the evidence falls
dialog: into place.
dialog: 
text: Photographs flicker through the display: Holloway and Watts
text: in the field, excavating new sites. Intimately close.
dialog: 
dialog: Their finds: columns of writing on stone tablets in Egypt,
text: China, Cambodia, Peru. Patterns of lines, curves, and dots.
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: This is the writing of the Engineers.
dialog: We've found it on every continent. And
dialog: last year, we found our Rosetta Stone.
dialog: 
text: The display shows the Engineer obelisk under the sea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: The writing is a formula giving the
dialog: location of a single star in our sky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: Which star?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: We're keeping that confidential for
dialog: now. But that's where we want to go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: You want me to pay for an interstellar
dialog: research expedition!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: It's a chance to be part of a
dialog: revolution in scientific...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: Don't sell me, professor. You've been
dialog: turned down by every university and
text: government agency under the sun.
dialog: Nobody's going to gamble that kind of
dialog: money on your hunch.
dialog: 
text: Holloway deflates. Watts winces. This is a bloodbath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody but me.
speaker_heading: (HE GRINS)
dialog: I've read your research.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: That's impossible. Our research is-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: Quantum encoded on secure servers,
dialog: yeah. We have an A.I. division, you
dialog: should know. Doing impressive things.

speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: That's what I'm talking about. You
dialog: left out my favorite part. The piece
text: about Earth. DAVID.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For eons, Earth's climate swung from
dialog: hothouse to ice age. Explosions of
dialog: life, then mass extinctions. But
dialog: twelve thousand years ago the swings
dialog: stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a
dialog: period of anomalous tranquility. The
dialog: rise of civilization began only then.
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts stare at DAVID with new appreciation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: That's right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: And that change coincides with a visit
dialog: by the Engineers. They didn't just
dialog: change us. They changed our world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: That's the piece I mean. Engineering
dialog: Earth. God stuff.

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND (CONT'D)
dialog: My people checked your science. They
dialog: say it's solid.
dialog: 
text: He pulls a thick contract out. Drops it in front of Holloway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll give you your expedition. Ship
dialog: and crew, supplies, support. One
dialog: condition.
dialog: 
text: Holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man
text: double-checking a lottery ticket. His voice is husky:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND
dialog: You get the discovery. Control of the
dialog: site. But any technology you find?
dialog: Anything at all. That's mine.
dialog: 
text: Holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract.
text: Riffles the pages of small-print legalese.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WEYLAND (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
dialog: 
text: The ship's nerve center and control room. Six control

speaker_heading: HYPERSLEEP COMPARTMENT

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (O.S.)
dialog: Get out of there!
dialog: 
text: Holloway's voice cracks like a whip. The crewmen jump back.
dialog:

speaker_heading: STILLWELL
dialog: Just looking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Give us a moment, will you?
dialog: 
text: The crewmen file out: Stillwell sheepishly, Downs and Kamarov

scene_heading: INT. MESS ROOM
dialog:

text: Watts hunches over, shivering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Like you've done this before.

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: I've read all about it.
dialog: 
text: Two ship's officers enter the room wearing blue coveralls
text: with rank insignia: GLASSE, 45, a stocky man with thick black
text: hair, and BRICK, 50, a bald man with a bristling mustache.
dialog: 
text: They look at Watts and Holloway with little pleasure.

speaker_heading: WATTS

speaker_heading: GLASSE

scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - CAPTAIN'S WARDROOM
dialog: 
text: CAPTAIN JANEK, 45, sits at his desk. With his bristling beard
text: and powerful build he has a swashbuckling look, like the
text: captain of a whaling ship.
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts sit on a steel bench in front of him.
dialog: 
text: He sits scanning his orders: a plastic packet with Weyland
text: Industries logos, cracked open. Watermarked papers inside.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed
dialog: already. A hundred years ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
text: By an unmanned probe. Very crude.

speaker_heading: JANEK

speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: So what are you looking for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Proof of the Engineers' existence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Confirmation of Professor Holloway's
dialog: theories would change everything.
dialog: There'd be science before Holloway and
dialog: science after.
dialog: 
text: Janek rubs his face wearily with his hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: Your ticket. I'll put the ship where
dialog: you want. Run your scans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Captain, your crew's been up for a
dialog: week. We could've used the time. Why'd
dialog: you wait to wake us?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: Better for discipline.
dialog: (off their silence)
dialog: Men ship out as prospectors for one
dialog: reason: the percentage. Find a gold
dialog: mine or a habitable planet, and you're
dialog: set for life.
dialog: (he laughs bitterly)
dialog: But this contract says no percentage.
dialog: No bounty. Just triple pay. The men
dialog: aren't happy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: You unhappy too?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: I'm always unhappy.
dialog: 
text: He stands. Presses his palm against a wall panel. A safe

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SCIENTISTS' CABIN
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts take possession of their cabin: a simple
text: but spacious room with twin beds and a window to the stars.
dialog: 
text: They drop duffel bags on the bed.
dialog: 
text: Holloway surveys the arrangement. Frowns. He releases the
text: magnets that lock the beds down. Slides the beds together.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SCIENTISTS' WORKROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts set up their workspace - a central display
text: table and huge display surfaces on the walls. Fascinating
text: documents slide under their fingertips: an Engineer alphabet.
dialog: Ancient art. Climate and genetic data.
dialog: 
text: DAVID appears in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: DAVID. I wondered when we'd see you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I trust your database is in order. I
dialog: set it up myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: All's well, I think.
dialog: 
text: DAVID turns to go. Hesitates in the doorway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I should tell you: the time you spent
dialog: sleeping, I spent studying your
dialog: research.
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts look at the android, his words sinking in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: You studied our work for two and a
dialog: half years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's quite a data set.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: So you've seen everything. Well. What
dialog: do you think?
dialog: 
text: DAVID glances over the documents displayed around the room.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your hypothesis is...bold. The
dialog: audacity of it. Your climate data's
dialog: undeniable: the Holocene Epoch was
dialog: engineered. Dr. Watts, your genetic
dialog: studies are equally conclusive. Pulses
dialog: of cultural change are harder to
dialog: prove, but even there your case is
dialog: strong. I believe in your "Engineers."
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BREAK ROOM
dialog: 
text: A utilitarian sitting room. Steel benches and table bolted to
text: the deck. Seated here are two Weyland Industries technicians:
dialog: 
text: ANDREW CHANCE, 50, a stocky computer engineer with a genial
text: bearing and a bristling salt-and-pepper mustache.
dialog: 
text: MONA RAVEL, 45, a dour, rangy woman with a plain face, her
text: hair pulled severely back. A physicist and chemist.
dialog: 
text: They wear black Weyland Industries jackets. They radiate
dialog: intelligence and competence. These are pros.
dialog: 
text: DAVID leads Holloway and Watts past the break room. Holloway
text: spots the technicians. Strides in to greet them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Weyland Industries! Mr. Chance. Ms.
dialog: Ravel. You remember Dr. Watts.
dialog: 
text: Watts and the technicians exchange greetings.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: About the materials I gave you. Some
dialog: of the technical aspects...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: We'll handle our end of the job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAVEL
dialog: If there is a job.
dialog: 
text: Holloway blinks at her. Chance explains, not unkindly:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: We only have a job if you find
dialog: something.
dialog: 20.

speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts follow the imperturbable DAVID down a
text: steel corridor to Vickers's cabin door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS'S SUITE
dialog: 
text: An open-plan cabin like an urban loft apartment. Watts and
text: Holloway follow DAVID inside. Vickers rises to meet them.
dialog: 
text: The walls are industrial steel - but the floors are lushly
text: carpeted, the furniture opulent. A king-sized bed, a mahogany
text: desk, a dining table.
dialog: 
dialog: Gleaming machines ensure Vickers never need step outside: a
text: private hypersleep freezer, an autokitchen, a medical pod.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Is that a Pauling medical pod? There's
dialog: only ten of those things on Earth! I
dialog: guess nine, now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS
dialog: I told Mr. Weyland I wouldn't
dialog: compromise my standard of living. He
dialog: accommodated me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: I know, I had to cut my manifest. This
dialog: used to be the number four cargo bay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS
dialog: What can I do for you, Professor?
dialog: 
text: Holloway gestures with the slate he's brought with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: We're about to reach the system
dialog: periphery. I thought you'd want to see
dialog: the search protocols we -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS
dialog: No. I was set to be the next CEO of
dialog: Weyland Industries. Then you came
dialog: along and sold Mr. Weyland on...this.
dialog: So here I am. Out of the running.
dialog: I'll go where I'm told. But don't ask
dialog: me to play along.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: But when you get back...
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS
dialog: I'll be five years behind the curve.
text: Out of touch. Over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: You might make the discovery of the
dialog: ages.
dialog: 
text: Vickers looks at him as if she's dealing with a child.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't believe in what we're doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS
dialog: Mr. Weyland believes. That's enough.
dialog: 
text: She walks them toward the door. Interview's over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now we're out of communication, you
dialog: can tell the crew what we're doing.

speaker_heading: WATTS

speaker_heading: DOWNS
dialog: Aliens.

speaker_heading: GLASSE
dialog: You shitting me?
dialog: 
text: Stillwell is staring at the frightening images: gods and
text: titans towering over mortals.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: I think all our mythologies are race-
dialog: memories of the Engineers. Horus the
text: Sun God. Prometheus bringing fire from
text: heaven. A pillar of fire, a pillar of
dialog: smoke. The Engineers are the gods.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Kamarov stiffens, smelling blasphemy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KAMAROV
dialog: The mythology gods maybe. God is God.

speaker_heading: STILLWELL
dialog: Kamarov. Let him talk.
dialog: 
text: Stillwell's staring unhappily at the ancient images: gods
text: towering over mortals, inhuman and terrifying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STILLWELL (CONT'D)
dialog: So we're going to meet these things?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: We probably won't meet anyone. You'd
dialog: expect a star-traveling race to
dialog: generate radio or laser signals.
dialog: Fusion drives and gravity drives have
dialog: clear signatures. But Zeta Two
dialog: Reticuli is silent. And the Engineers
dialog: have gone missing on Earth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: By the pattern, they should've come to
dialog: Earth seventeen centuries ago. And
text: again six centuries ago. But no sign.
dialog: After twelve thousand years...they
dialog: stopped coming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRICK
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Exactly. Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
dialog: me?"
dialog: 
text: They turn. Janek grins at Holloway across the cargo bay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that the question you've come light-
dialog: years to answer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Only my first question. I have many.

scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
dialog: 
text: Outside the vast Bridge window, the star Zeta2 Reticuli

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXT. MAGELLAN (ZETA2 RETICULI SYSTEM)
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRICK
dialog: Closing on the major site...
dialog: 
text: The ship descends into clear air. A stunning panorama unfolds
text: before them: craters, hundreds of meters across, connected by
text: trenches. Like a pattern of crop-circles sunk in the rock.
dialog: 
text: In the middle of the central crater - a huge angular peak,
text: larger than the others. The Magellan circles the site. It's
text: awe-inspiring. Cryptic. Huge.
dialog: 
text: Holloway stares in rapture. Glances at Watts: she nods, eyes
text: shining. She's with him.
dialog: 
text: The crew's still skeptical - but starting to wonder. They
text: shake their heads and exchange looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: No radio. No heat sources. Cold as the

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CRATER COMPLEX - DAY
dialog: 
text: From the central crater, four canals extend outward like
text: points of the compass. Some connect to smaller craters.
dialog: 
text: One canal peters out, flush with the desert floor.
dialog: 
dialog: The Magellan lands at the end of this canal - half a

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
dialog:

dialog: 
text: The rovers' beds are loaded with gear; the explorers ride on

dialog:

dialog: 
text: The crew of the Magellan exchange uneasy looks. Still
dialog: uncertain what to think.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRY CANAL - DAY
dialog: 
text: The trench grows deeper as they follow it toward the central
text: crater - the pyramidal peak framed ahead of them like a
text: monument on a triumphal avenue.
dialog: 
text: They cross a perpendicular canal. Glancing left and right,
text: they see smaller craters with central peaks of their own.
dialog: 
text: They pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone
text: atop one bank of the canal.
dialog: 
dialog: We see - and they do not - that the far side of the
text: promontory has a Sphinx-like FACE of monumental size. So
dialog: eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL CRATER - DAY
dialog: 
text: The crater floor is a vast enclosed plain. The pyramidal
text: mount looms in the center - colossal in scale.
dialog: 
text: The rovers enter the crater, trailing plumes of dust. They
dialog: circle the pyramid.
dialog: 
text: On the south face of the pyramid, an IRIS DOOR of many blades
text: stands, easily fifty feet high. Seemingly made of the same
text: basaltic stone as the pyramid itself. A huge construction.
dialog: 
text: The explorers are transfixed in awe. All skepticism banished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Tell me that's a natural formation.
speaker_heading: (HE GRINS)
dialog: Undeniable proof of alien
dialog: civilization. You were here on this

dialog: 
text: Watts stares at the iris. Its bottom-most blade is broken; it
text: lies in rubble at the foot of the door. A dark knife-like
text: aperture leads into the pyramid.
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
text: The door's open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE
dialog: 
text: Janek and Vickers watch the explorers' progress in the main

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: Son of a bitch. They were right.
dialog: 
text: He turns to stare out the window at the pyramid's peak.
dialog: 
text: Vickers turns and slips out of the Bridge. Hurries away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS'S SUITE
dialog: 
text: Vickers strides through her quarters. On the far wall there
text: are two small doors.
dialog: 
text: She opens the first: steps into a luxurious bathroom. Washes
text: a pill down with a tumbler of water.
dialog: 
text: Returns to her cabin and opens the second small door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SECRET ROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A chamber walled with steel panels. A deep hum of ventilation
dialog: and power: there's a lot of technology here.
dialog: 
text: She turns to a console beside the door. Flips a row of
text: switches. The hum deepens. Hidden mechanisms stir to life.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PYRAMID - IRIS DOOR
dialog: 
text: On foot, explorers press inside - Holloway and Watts in the
text: lead. Their flashlights cut into the gloom.
dialog: 
text: The robotic rovers follow them: their six-wheeled chassis
text: with independent suspension trundling over the rubble
text: barrier, sure-footed as goats.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PYRAMID - ANTECHAMBER
dialog: 
text: Dark and cavernous. Weak daylight slants in.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The explorers press into the darkness on foot - the cargo

text: cathedral space, empty and bare.
dialog: 
text: DAVID looks around in fascination, his eyes raking the walls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Jocelyn. Here.
dialog: 
text: His voice trembles with urgency. He shines light on the rock.
text: Symbols engraved on the dark surface. Dots, lines and arcs.

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: The writing of the Engineers.
dialog: Conclusive connection.
dialog: 
text: DAVID stands beside them. Stares at the alien writing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Congratulations, Professor Holloway.
dialog: 
text: Watts passes her light over the writing, recording it. They
text: move on into the dark.
dialog: 
text: DAVID lingers. Reading.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: PYRAMID - VARIOUS PASSAGES
dialog: 
text: The interior is a labyrinth. Corridors big as railway tunnels
text: intersecting and diverging.
dialog: 
text: The explorers wend their way deeper. Several carry map units,
text: whose holographic displays render three-dimensional maps that
dialog: expand as they explore.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PYRAMID - MASSIVE CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: Holloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex. The
text: motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl.
dialog: 
text: DAVID trails the others, eyes raking the blank walls as if he
text: sees something there. He reaches out. Passes his hand through
text: the air as if grasping a cobweb.
dialog: 
text: A STRANGE RUMBLING NOISE sounds down the corridor, freezing
text: them. Holloway sweeps his light that way. The sound comes
text: again: a DEMONIC VOICE speaking some unearthly language.
dialog: 
text: Watts looks at Holloway - but his eyes are focused on the
text: dark ahead. He moves forward. A beat. The others follow.
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: An APPARITION appears before them. A PALE, LUMINOUS GIANT
text: fifteen feet tall, with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout. It
text: strides toward them. Speaks in a sonorous voice.
dialog: 
dialog: Pandemonium.
dialog: 
text: Watts backpedals involuntarily. Seeing Holloway stand his
text: ground, she reaches out to him in a panic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Martin. Martin!
dialog: 
text: But Holloway doesn't budge. Stares at the Apparition in
text: fascination. Everyone else scatters - except DAVID, who
text: stands stock-still by the wall.
dialog: 
text: Watts watches as the Apparition walks right up to Holloway.
text: Disappears with a sizzle of static as Holloway experiences
text: the creature passing through him.
dialog: 
text: Silence. Watts returns to Holloway's side. Stillwell and
text: Downs are huddled on the deck. Milburn and Fifield have
text: fallen back down the passageway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIFIELD
dialog: Christ. Christ!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAVEL
dialog: It wasn't real.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILBURN
dialog: We all saw it.
dialog: 
text: Unseen by the others, DAVID reaches out and repeats his
text: gesture in the air.
dialog: 
text: A rumbling sound down the corridor, as before. Moments later,
text: the Apparition appears round the corner again. They stand
text: their ground: the ghostly giant strides toward them, exactly
text: as before, and disappears with a crackle.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Recording?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIFIELD
dialog: No more. I'm out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Fifield. Get a grip.

speaker_heading: MILBURN
dialog: I should go with him. Buddy system.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
speaker_heading: (DISGUSTED)
dialog: Fine.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You can deploy the drones. Drop them

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIFIELD
dialog: Give us a rover.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: And half our gear? It's no more than a

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORE CHAMBER DOOR
dialog: 
text: Holloway and Watts lead their party up to a massive door,

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: This should lead to the core of the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHANCE
dialog: Maybe we can hack it. Has to be a

speaker_heading: MILBURN
dialog: Grand Central Station.
dialog: 
text: They open the case. CAMERA PROBES tumble out: spheres the

dialog: 
text: Tiny lights come on as the probes awaken. They roll off,
text: dispersing to investigate every passageway. Bumbling into
text: walls and pillars, reversing. Exploring by random walk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIFIELD
dialog: Let's check the feed. Gimme the map.

speaker_heading: CORE CHAMBER DOOR
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Looks like a three-state switch.
dialog: 
text: A deep BOOM, echoing inside the ancient walls. Nothing moves.

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: One moment...
dialog: 
text: He moves a control. BOOM. The immense door begins to rise.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: The vast central chamber of the pyramid. An immense space.
dialog: 
text: Holloway walks in, his flashlight searching. Watts hurries
text: after. The others follow, rovers tagging along.
dialog: 
text: A colossal structure stands in the center of the chamber,
text: convoluted and strange. A mechanism. Chasms yawn in the floor
text: all around it, their depths lost in darkness.
dialog: 
text: The explorers enter, rovers in train. They lift their eyes:
text: hundreds of feet above them they see the pyramid's apex from
text: within. A SHAFT OF DIFFUSE LIGHT penetrates the pyramid
text: somewhere near the peak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAVEL
dialog: This is something, now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. Yes, it is.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The android's awareness is keyed to a high pitch. He seems to
text: read meaning in the inscrutable structures all around them.
dialog: 
text: Holloway hauls a drone case out of the rover. Two dozen

text: dark. They are nimble, hopping curbs and skirting chasms.
dialog: 
text: Watts looks at her atmosphere sensor. Astonished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Martin. This air's breathable.
dialog: 
text: The core chamber brightens as the sun outside moves into
text: alignment. The shaft of light perfectly centered.
dialog: 
text: A vast SIGH as if the pyramid itself is breathing.
dialog: 
text: A fat drop of water falls on Watts's glove. She looks up in
text: surprise. Another falls on her visor. And then it's raining
text: inside the pyramid.
dialog: 
text: Water trickles into the chasms, inundating the mossy growths
text: that cling to the walls.
dialog: 
text: Holloway looks at Watts with a little boy's grin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Miracles and wonders!
dialog: 
text: The shaft of light moves on. The core chamber dims slightly.
text: The rainfall stops as suddenly as it started.
dialog: 
text: The explorers follow the main path around the periphery of
text: the chamber, past a gallery of mysterious machines.
dialog: 
text: There are marvels in the shadows. Cells in the dark apparatus
text: open on startling deposits of color: translucent alabaster
text: flutes. Honeycombs of pure gold. Matrices of crystal.

scene_heading: PYRAMID - CORE CHAMBER - RAMP
dialog:

text: curves downward - its floor segmented and saw-toothed.
dialog: 
dialog: A bafflement: it's not a staircase. Not an escalator. No
text: moving parts. No rails or tracks.
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
text: Space below us. A big space.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: How does this work?
dialog: 
text: She begins to descend on foot. Holloway behind her.
text: Stillwell, Downs, and Kamarov grudgingly follow.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CONTROL CONCOURSE
dialog: 
text: A passageway punctuated by alcoves as big as band-shells.

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: His head, lolling to one side, is severed from his body.

scene_heading: EXT. MAGELLAN - AIRLOCK LIFT
dialog: 
text: Holloway roars into the lift at speed, the rover skidding
text: almost into the opposite wall. Watts leaps down.
dialog: 
text: The storm wall catches up to them. Screaming winds rip
text: through the lift. Dust fills the air. Visibility plunges
dialog: toward zero.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Help me unload!

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She pulls at the tarp. It tears halfway free - and fills with
text: wind, snapping taut with such violence that Watts is hurled
text: out into the storm.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE GALE
dialog: 
text: Watts tumbles helplessly: a leaf in the wind. CRASHES into a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE LIFT
dialog: 
text: Holloway stares in shock at the place where Watts vanished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Jocelyn!
dialog: 
text: With inhuman reflexes DAVID reacts. Grabs a tether. Latches
text: it to his suit. Locks it to an anchor point on the wall.
text: Dives into the storm. A ballet nearly too fast to follow.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE GALE
dialog: 
text: DAVID lets the wind take him. Skids across the ground,
text: controlling his trajectory. He hits the stanchion where Watts
text: is lodged with a CLANG as if he were made of iron.
dialog: 
text: Watts stares at him in mute astonishment.
dialog: 
text: He locks her suit to his. Activates the tether unit's winch.
text: It whirs, reeling them in through the hurricane.
dialog:

speaker_heading: IN THE LIFT
dialog: 
text: Holloway and the other crewmen haul Watts and DAVID back

dialog: 
text: The core chamber of the pyramid, from DAVID's point of view.
dialog: 
text: It's apparent that DAVID's eyes see more than human eyes do.
text: He seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as
text: visible light; calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene.
dialog: 
text: The structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The core of the pyramid. You see.

speaker_heading: LABORATORY
dialog: 
text: A high-tech science facility behind glass. Watts and
text: Holloway, in lab gloves and smocks, open the dumbwaiter:
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: An ENGINEER'S HEAD rises into view, ghoulish and elephantine.
text: Vapor rises from it. A readout blinks: STERILIZED.
dialog: 
text: They lift it onto the steel table. It takes both of them.
dialog: 
text: They pass scanners over the skull. Images accumulate and
text: rotate on the laboratory displays. X-ray and ultrasound.
dialog: 
text: Holloway leans close to study an X-ray image. He almost seems
text: to see a ghostly second face...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Martin. Look.
dialog: 
text: She traces the head with an ultrasound probe: under the
text: vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face.
dialog: 
text: She gets a fingertip into the seam. Works with a probe. Pries
text: away the long-dead Engineer's mask. It comes free.
dialog: 
text: The visage revealed is human, except for its giant scale.
dialog: 
text: White-skinned. Earless. Hairless. Withered but beautiful as a
text: Greek statue. Eyes closed. An expression of suffering on its
text: face. Watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: They look like us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: We look like them. Genesis 1:27. "And
dialog: God created man in his own image. In
dialog: his own image created He him."
dialog: 
text: Vickers and DAVID stand outside the lab window, staring in at
text: the god's head. Vickers looks shaken. DAVID, fascinated.
dialog: 
text: Watts covers her nose in revulsion. A horrible stench: The
text: Engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them. Flesh
text: oozing, skin peeling. Accelerated decay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
text: It's breaking down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Formaldehyde!
dialog: 
text: Urgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms. Watts finds
text: a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents. Holloway drags
text: five-gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet.
dialog: 
text: DAVID watches through the window, almost amused.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mortal after all.
dialog: 
text: They lift the rotting head into the drum, retching. Fingers
text: skidding in putrefaction.
dialog: 
text: They pour formaldehyde over it. As soon as the head is
text: immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and
text: smocks, scrubbing their hands.
dialog: 
text: The god's head sits in its murky vat, shedding skin and tofu-
text: like chunks of white flesh. The noble face disintegrating.
dialog: 
text: Watts and Holloway stare at it, breathing hard from their
text: work. Vickers flicks on the intercom from outside the window.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS
dialog: Your cadaver's interesting. But I'm
dialog: more interested in the machinery in
dialog: the pyramid. The core chamber. What do
dialog: you think it does?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: How could anyone know...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: I know what it does.
dialog: 
text: Silence. Holloway looks at Vickers wearily, as if he's seen
text: this conversation coming. He glances at Watts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Think. What we've seen. What we know.
dialog: 
text: Watts rises to the challenge. Thinking on her feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
text: Twenty-four pyramids scattered around
dialog: the moon's equator. Massive power
text: supplies. Vents in the walls.
text: Atmosphere changes. Breeder tanks...
dialog: (she's got it)
text: The pyramids are terraforming
dialog: machines.
dialog: 
text: Holloway grins, exuberant. His theory playing out perfectly.
text: He doesn't see Vickers stiffen. Her hands curling into fists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: That's why Earth's ancient cultures
dialog: built pyramids: in imitation of the

speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Twelve thousand years ago, beings from

scene_heading: INT. CATACOMBS - INSECT CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: Milburn and Fifield have bunked down in a new chamber: they

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILBURN
dialog: Look at this!
dialog: 
text: A CENTIPEDE, three feet long and thick as man's thumb. Its
text: hard shell is gray. It has a hammer-head like a shark.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIFIELD
dialog: Jesus! Put it down!
dialog: 
text: He leaps back, wild-eyed.
dialog: 
text: Milburn laughs at him. Lets the eyeless centipede wind its
text: segmented body around his space-suited arm.
dialog: 
text: In the flat face, a white vertical slit appears. Changes
text: quickly to a horizontal position; opens enough to suggest a
text: mouth. Milburn doesn't notice this development.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILBURN
dialog: Relax. Your suit's bug-proof. Hell,
dialog: it's bulletproof.
dialog: 
text: The centipede spirals around his arm, glittering, its body
text: moving in fluid waves. The blind head quests between his
text: fingers. Milburn loses his nerve as the thing's mouth
text: suddenly gapes wide as a shark's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILBURN (CONT'D)
dialog: That's enough.
dialog: 
text: He tries to pull it off.
dialog: 
text: The centipede locks its segments together and digs in with
text: its body. It might as well be made of iron.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILBURN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (PANICKING)
dialog: Get it off! It's crushing me!
dialog: 
text: Fifield pulls out a utility knife. Cuts into the centipede's
text: body behind its head.
dialog: 
text: A gout of greed ACID spills over Milburn's glove. Smoke rises
text: as the acid quickly burns a hole through the material.
dialog: 
text: Milburn's shout of astonishment turns to a wail of agony.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MILBURN (CONT'D)
dialog: AHH! Help me! Christ!
dialog: 
text: The centipede snakes into the smoking hole in the glove.
text: Crawls upward into Milburn's suit - toward his head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - LABORATORY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Holloway stands studying the data displays: cross-sections of
text: the Engineer's skull.
dialog: 
text: Watts scrutinizes the head itself, her nose an inch from the
text: plastic tank. Not a pretty sight.
dialog: 
text: As she watches, a current in the formaldehyde peels away one
text: gossamer eyelid. The revealed eye is black as obsidian,
text: iridescent like opal. A jewel.
dialog: 
text: Fascinated, Watts pulls out a plastic case. Opens it to
text: reveal a high-tech control unit with a screen. She pops open
text: a plastic capsule: removes a tiny SEED PROBE, smaller than a
text: grain of rice. Drops it into the vat.
dialog: 
text: Under her guidance, the seed probe swims to the severed neck.
text: Burrows into the medulla oblongata toward the brain.
dialog: 
text: ON A SCREEN: In the probe's POV the medulla looks like a
text: tunnel. The probe climbs along neural channels.
dialog: 
text: Another screen shows the probe's progress through the skull.
dialog: 
text: Glasse enters. Stands beside Holloway to watch Watts at work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: You won't get anything. Tissue's too
dialog: degraded. Hmm. Brain chamber's
text: massive, even proportionately.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Neural paths are still conductive.
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The seed probe reaches the optic nerve of the exposed eye -
text: and its POV fills with a vision of glory: a beautiful woman's
text: face surrounded by a mystical nimbus of light. An angel.
dialog: 
text: Glasse and Holloway gasp. The woman in the blurry vision is
text: Watts - as seen by the dead Engineer's eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GLASSE
dialog: Incredible.
dialog: 
text: The image dissolves into noise. Error messages flicker across
text: the display. Watts sighs.

speaker_heading: WATTS

dialog: 
text: Watts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead -
text: the lenses lowering and rising at need.
dialog: 
text: She bisects the apple-sized eyeball carefully and extracts
text: the hard lens from behind the cornea. Holds the lens up to
text: her eye. It is opalescent, almost luminous.

speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: The lens is where the phase shift

dialog: darkness overhead.
dialog: 
text: DAVID, Chance, and Ravel are dismantling the hulking

dialog: 
text: DAVID operates a diamond-bladed hull saw, carving away the

speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: We found the tomb of the gods, and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: Let them scratch. This find's too big

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: The core activity of the complex was
dialog: down here.
dialog: 
text: They turn a corner. DEAD ENGINEERS lie scattered over the

dialog: 
text: Watts moves among them, fascinated. These Engineers all died
text: of explosive chest wounds: ribs bent outward from within.
text: They are otherwise unmarked.
dialog: 
dialog: Holloway's more interested in the mechanisms: high-tech iron
text: maidens, built to fit the bodies of giants. Some suggest

text: plunging down into darkness in front of him.
dialog: 
text: He stops just in time. Turns back...
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog:

text: His head inside his helmet is gnawed down to the bone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STILLWELL
dialog: What happened to him?
dialog: 
text: Stillwell removes the dead man's helmet. The CENTIPEDE
text: scuttles out onto the deck: doubled in size. Stillwell leaps
text: back with a cry.
dialog: 
text: Janek pulls his pistol. Puts three rounds through the bug. It
text: dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor.
dialog: 
text: Janek watches in astonishment as a pin-prick dot of acid eats

speaker_heading: DOWNS (O.S.)

speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got him!
speaker_heading: (TO HOLLOWAY)

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: After my fall, I woke up walking.
dialog: Delirious. My helmet wasn't right. I

text: of the galaxy. Floating in the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Are you okay? You sound...

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen. This star map had a marker

dialog: 
text: Watts stares at him, her eyes coming alight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Your heart's beating so hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY
dialog: That's your fault.
dialog: 
text: Vulnerability in his voice. Fear under the surface.

dialog: 
text: Suddenly Holloway tenses, muscles rigid. Shuddering. Watts
text: draws breath through her teeth with a hiss. Eyes open. Her

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS (CONT'D)
dialog: Martin!
dialog: 
text: A horrible CRACK. In the middle of Holloway's chest, beneath

dialog: 
text: Holloway goes into a massive seizure. Violently lashing out.

speaker_heading: HOLLOWAY

dialog: 
text: Acid HISSES. Smoke rises from the glass.

dialog: 
text: In the beam of her flashlight, the FACEHUGGER lies dead, legs

text: In each of these a NAVIGATOR - an Engineer - lies long dead.
dialog: 
text: But the real spectacle is overhead. The ORRERY:
dialog: 
text: The barrel-vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of
text: some exotic alloy, as if to trace celestial courses.
dialog: 
text: The air above the console is filled with spheres of light.
text: They are nearly still: but close study reveals them all to be
text: in motion, drifting with the movements of the cosmos.
dialog: 
text: Watts stares at the Orrery in amazement. Somewhere among
dialog: those heavenly spheres is Earth. Somewhere perhaps the
dialog: homeworld of the Engineers themselves.
dialog: 
text: A bizarre sound: a section of blank wall suddenly unravels

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: What's protocol two?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Under protocol two I was to make sure
dialog: that you and Holloway never spoke to

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: You're all so stupid.

dialog: Juggernaut, the chariot of Krishna,

scene_heading: INT. VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Watts slips inside and locks the door behind her. Turns,
text: holding her stomach. Moves across the suite to the Med Pod.
dialog: 
text: She thumbs the machine out of stand-by mode. Its screen fills
text: with menu items. Bewildering. Watts finds and touches a red
text: button labeled EMERGENCY.
dialog: 
text: A new, simpler list. Watts scans it frantically.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: (under her breath)
dialog: Come on...I need a Caesarean.
dialog: 
text: A spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet. She
text: throttles her scream into a hiss of air.
dialog: 
text: Watts struggles up to her knees, drenched in sweat and
text: shaking. One hand clamped over her mouth, elbow tucked
text: against her ribs. With the other hand she taps options...
dialog: 
scene_heading: SURGERY ... EXPLORATORY ... ABDOMINAL ... PENETRATING INJURIES ... FOREIGN BODY ... INITIATE
dialog: 
text: The Med Pod opens with a hiss.
dialog: 
text: Watts strips off her clothes. Struggling with fastenings
text: under a new wave of pain. Her hands shaking.
dialog: 
text: She's barely keeping her feet. She clutches the frame of the
text: Med Pod in a death grip. It's happening.
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Naked she staggers into the pod. Hits INITIATE.
dialog: 
text: The surgical apparatus swings into place. Scalpels, forceps,
text: scopes and suction tubes. A spraygun mists her torso with
dialog: yellow antiseptic.
dialog: 
text: The clear canopy descends over her.
dialog: 
text: Watts SCREAMS. A wail of indescribable agony.
dialog: 
text: An ARMORED PARASITE erupts from the deepening incision. Its
text: needle-toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood.
dialog: 
text: Arterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy.
dialog: 
text: The parasite slithers out of her. Drops to the floor of the
text: pod: a pale serpent with a demon's skull. It has a hard brow,
text: a horny hide. Very different from the soft white worm that
dialog: Holloway gave birth to.
dialog: 
text: It drops to the floor, thrashing and hissing in fury at its
dialog: confinement.
dialog: 
text: Watts convulses. Her eyes roll back. In shock. Dying.
dialog: 
text: The parasite tears through the grille of the drain. Escapes
text: out into Vickers's cabin.
dialog: 
text: In the pod, scanning beams and sensors probe Watts's horrific
text: wound. A nightmare list scrolls across the pod's screen:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COLLAPSED LEFT LUNG
scene_heading: PUNCTURED RIGHT VENTRICLE
speaker_heading: PERFORATED STOMACH
speaker_heading: RUPTURED SPLEEN
scene_heading: GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA...
dialog: 
text: Manipulators plunge lines into her veins - recharging her
text: body with artificial blood. An oxygen tube slips down her
text: throat. An epidural into her spine.
dialog: 
text: Watts moans around her tracheal tube. Her eyes flutter open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS'S POV
dialog: 
text: Through the blood-spattered glass, she sees the parasite
text: slither across Vickers's bed, tracking blood on the sheets.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON WATTS
dialog: 
text: As she slips into unconsciousness. Head lolling. Time passes.
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Manipulators reach into her wound. Re-positioning organs.
text: Suturing ravaged flesh. A nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant.
text: Hours grind by in bloody labor.
dialog: 
text: Watts's eyes snap open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS'S POV
dialog: 
text: Vigoda breaks into the cabin, a gun in his hand.
dialog: 
text: He scowls at the bloody track on the bed - and then freezes,
text: seeing Watts inside the Med Pod, a vivisected woman. The
text: autosurgeon hard at work.
dialog: 
text: The parasite crawls into view behind Vigoda. It has already
text: trebled in size. He does not see it before it leaps at him.
dialog: 
text: He dies in seconds. His throat ripped open. Lies staring at
text: nothing. His submachine gun lies beside him.
dialog: 
text: Watts's body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts.
text: She stares at the dead man in a fog of horror.
dialog: 
text: The parasite's skin splits, spraying the carpet with acid.
text: Limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches. Spines from its
dialog: back. Metamorphosis.
dialog: 
text: With a crack of carapace, its head swings down from its
text: serpentine position. It becomes a devil with an lethal,
text: elongated skull. An Alien.
dialog: 
text: The Alien turns its head. Looks at Watts inside the Med Pod.
dialog: 
text: Her breath catches. She passes out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MED POD - LATER
dialog: 
text: Watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth.
dialog: 
text: She looks down, bleary and hurting. Her star-shaped wound is
text: stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures.
dialog: 
text: The pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs.
dialog: 
text: She takes a deep breath. Looks out - and freezes.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS'S POV
dialog: 
text: The lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow.
text: They flicker and strobe.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Through the glass canopy - spattered with blood - Watts sees
text: a full-grown Alien crouching over Vigoda's body on the floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ON WATTS
dialog: 
text: Staring in horror.
dialog: 
text: The pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar. The

dialog: 
text: Watts realizes the pod is about to release her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Not yet...not yet...
dialog: 
text: Slowly she reaches out. With trembling fingers she grips the
dialog: canopy to hold it closed.
dialog: 
text: The Med Pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine.
text: Sprays liquid bandage over the puncture. Watts closes her
text: eyes. Grits her teeth as her nerves wake up. Jangling pain.
dialog: 
text: She opens her eyes.
dialog: 
text: The Alien hunches over Vigoda's body, tearing at his flesh.
dialog: 
text: The ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet. The canopy
text: pulls free of Watts's weakened grip. Swings quietly open.
dialog: 
text: Watts huddles in the open pod. Naked but for her bandages.
dialog: 
text: The Alien she gave birth to is ten feet away. Its spiny back
text: to her. Vigoda's gun lies on the floor outside the pod.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: VICKERS'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness. Lays
text: her hand on the gun. Drags it a few inches closer.
dialog: 
text: The Alien turns its pale eyeless head. Watts freezes.
dialog: 
text: For a moment time stops.
dialog: 
text: The Alien lunges. Watts snatches up the gun and FIRES. Holds
text: the trigger down. The Alien jerks and staggers - an eye-
text: twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes - and falls.
dialog: 
text: Watts empties the clip into the thing. Acid gouts from its
text: wounds and eats into the deck - until a section of decking
text: gives way and falls to the deck below, leaving a dark hole.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Watts collapses on the rug, cradling her stomach in pain.
dialog: 
text: She crawls to Vigoda's desecrated body. With her eyes half-
text: averted from the sight, she searches the body. Finds a spare
text: ammo clip and jacks it into the gun.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
dialog: 
text: Watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket. Leaning
text: on the wall, her face drawn with pain. One hand laid over the
text: fantastic scar on her abdomen. The gun slung on her shoulder.
dialog: 
text: Dark events have transformed the Magellan. The metal of the
text: walls is torn in some places; in others, blackened by fire.
dialog: 
text: Watts rounds a corner. Finds a workstation left in shambles:
text: lockers and chairs overturned. A pool of drying blood.
dialog: 
text: Wide smears of blood show where something man-sized was
text: dragged out of the puddle - across the floor - up the wall.
text: Into the darkness of an open vent.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COMMAND DECK
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Vickers staggers backward, gasping.
dialog: 
text: Stillwell drags Watts away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STILLWELL
dialog: What'd you do that for?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Protocol two.
dialog: 
text: Vickers stiffens in shock. Stares fearfully at Watts.
dialog: 
text: Watts frees herself from Stillwell's grip. Her jacket falls

dialog: 
speaker_heading: STILLWELL
dialog: Christ!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK
dialog: What happened to you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: DAVID exposed me to a parasite. He

speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: I threatened to make him leave.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICKERS
dialog: DAVID's brain is readable. We have the

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: It drops on him.
dialog: 
text: The bladed tail glances off his helmet, sparking. He jerks

dialog: 
text: But if they are impressed, Watts is thunderstruck.
dialog: 
text: She sees the Orrery in its full glory: a stunning panoply of
text: light and energy. Stars and planets pulsing with information.
dialog: 
text: Reluctantly Watts tears her eyes away. Leads the war party
text: through the second door - the door she saw DAVID open.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HIBERNATION CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: An immense mausoleum.
dialog: 
text: The war party enters stealthily, Watts in the lead.
dialog: 
text: An Engineer lies on his back on a complex mechanical table,
text: his body one with the machinery. Jacked in. Interpenetrated.
text: Fused with the slab of the table itself.
dialog: 
dialog: Unlike the other Engineer bodies the explorers have seen,
text: this giant is not withered or mummified. He's full-fleshed
text: and muscular. Sustained by the machinery he's fused with.
dialog: 
text: He is bare-headed - his face the face of an Adonis.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: DAVID stands before this giant Sleeper. To the naked eye, he
text: seems to be conjuring with his hands in the empty air.
dialog: 
text: But Watts sees a dazzling console of runes and mandalas,
text: pulsing with biological rhythms.
dialog: 
dialog: The Sleeper lives.

speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)

dialog: 
text: The Sleeper rises from his ancient bed.
dialog: 
text: The humans back off, terrified. DAVID watches with shining
dialog: eyes.
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper towers over them. A giant carved from ivory. A
text: bulky girdle around his hips, seemingly one with his body.
dialog: 
text: He stares at DAVID and the others. Eyes like black agates.
dialog: 
text: The soldiers and crew stand warily, guns tracking from DAVID
text: to the Sleeper, uncertain of their ground. Watts is in awe.
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper speaks. A low rumbling sound. Unintelligible.
dialog: 
text: Vickers is beside herself with terror. She takes Shepherd's
text: arm. Pulls him silently away. Back into the Navigation Room.
dialog: 
text: Behind the Sleeper, a raised platform of dark machinery is
text: accessible by one of the Juggernaut's odd curving ramps. The
text: Sleeper ascends - and the ramps' odd design is explained. The
text: ramp comes alive, reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms
text: and lifting him aloft like a sea-god borne by the waves.
dialog: 
text: Atop the platform the Sleeper moves from one device to the
text: next. Each comes alive: he is a wizard in his own kingdom.
dialog: 
text: Watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him.
dialog: 
text: But what he learns from his machines does not comfort him. He
text: grows distraught. Keening to himself in near-subsonic tones.
dialog: 
text: DAVID steps forward.
dialog: 
text: Calls to the Sleeper in the tongue of the Engineers.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper turns in astonishment. He looks down at DAVID and
text: answers in the same tongue. He is angry, accusing. He points
text: at DAVID, at the humans. Tones of accusation.
dialog: 
text: DAVID cajoles, soothes, pleads.
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper descends toward DAVID. DAVID spreads his arms in
text: welcome - undeniable emotion on his face. Joy.
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper lays his hands on DAVID's head as if blessing
text: him. DAVID is rapturous. The Sleeper speaks a single phrase -
dialog: 
text: - and tears DAVID's head off.
dialog: 
text: A gout of white artificial blood. DAVID convulses. His
text: severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak. His body
text: staggers a few steps, hands groping over its dripping neck.
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper tosses the head away. Seizes the body by the legs
text: and swings it against the ground like a flail. Again. And
text: again. Horrific power and violence. DAVID's arms come off.
dialog: 
text: DAVID's head tumbles. Caroms off a wall not far from Watts's
dialog: hiding place.
dialog: 
text: Ray rises from behind a stanchion. Snaps his rifle to his
text: shoulder. Fires a burst into the Sleeper's shoulder.
dialog: 
text: She Sleeper roars - though the wounds are pinpricks to a
text: being of his size. With startling speed be moves to a
text: sarcophagus against the wall. Steps into it.
dialog: 
text: The sarcophagus comes alive around the Sleeper, outfitting
dialog: him with a FLIGHT SUIT: the same living suit we've seen
text: bonded to dead Engineers throughout the pyramid.
dialog: 
text: But this suit is not withered. Its glossy goggle eyes and
text: elephantine breathing tube are functional - bulky apparatuses
text: thickening the Sleeper's chest, back, hips and arms.
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus - and Ray's next
text: burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the Sleeper's

text: Shepherd escorts Vickers toward the exit of the Juggernaut.
text: Turning a corner, they freeze.
dialog: 
text: Ahead of them in their headlamps, a space-suited figure
text: crouches in the middle of the passageway. Doing something
text: with its hands: smoke rises from debris on the floor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEPHERD
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
text: The figure turns.
dialog: 
text: The label stencilled on the space suit reads FIFIELD. But the
text: face is of no human shape. A hideous hybrid of the crewman
text: and a hard-shelled Alien, pale and horrific.
dialog: 
text: Its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate
text: skull. Spines have burst through the suit from within, down
text: the crewman's spine. Clawed fingers piercing his gloves.
dialog: 
text: Shepherd and Vickers scream. Shepherd's rifle comes up. But
text: Fifield leaps with inhuman agility, upward into the darkness.
text: Shepherd backs away, headlamp and rifle questing upward.
dialog: 
text: Fifield comes out of the darkness behind him. Claws tearing
text: deep. Shepherd screams and falls, mortally wounded.
dialog: 
text: Vickers runs. Pounding through the dark in blind terror.
dialog: 
text: Fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck.
text: She rolls over, gibbering and begging. The Fifield-thing
text: leans close to her faceplate. Its voice is a travesty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIFIELD
dialog: You.
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A ROAR of gunfire. The dying Shepherd empties his clip into
text: Fifield from forty feet away.
dialog: 
text: Acid sluices over Vickers as Fifield collapses on top of her.
text: She dies horribly, caustic liquid eating through space suit,
dialog: flesh and bone.

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I spoke to him. Spoke to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: An electric spasm convulses his face.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS

speaker_heading: WATTS

speaker_heading: NAVIGATION CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: The war party pursues the Sleeper - Ray in the lead now,
text: Watts right behind him - DAVID's inert head under her arm.
text: Glasse and Stillwell bring up the rear.
dialog: 
text: The Orrery is transformed - no longer a neutral star map, but
text: a flight plan laid in from LV-426 to Earth.
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper stands at the far end of the room, hands
text: gesturing. In Watts's enhanced sight, it's a vision of glory:
text: waves of energy dancing under the Sleeper's touch. Rivers of
text: information flowing. He finishes his work as they enter.
dialog: 
text: Ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: On me now. Go. Go.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: WATTS
dialog: Pilot's seat. This way.
dialog: 
text: They move toward the Pilot Chamber - and find it empty too.
text: The seat vacant. The door standing open.
dialog: 
text: As they stare inside, baffled, the wall across the corridor -
text: directly behind them - silently unravels. The Sleeper is
text: revealed, a towering gargoyle in his flight suit.
dialog: 
text: He steps forth. Obscure devices clutched in his fists.
dialog: 
text: Too late they perceive him. They spin. Raise their guns.
dialog: 
text: Vanity and foolishness. This is the wrath of an angry god.
dialog: 
text: It seems time slows down.
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The air roars in their ears. Their guns snap and bark
text: impotently. And then the Sleeper strikes.
dialog: 
text: The missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible. Neither
dialog: solid projectiles nor directed energy; more like knots tied
text: in the fabric of space itself.
dialog: 
text: The first missile crushes Ray like an invisible fist. The
text: second splashes Glasse against the wall like an insect.
dialog: 
text: Reflexively Stillwell reaches out for Watts. Wraps himself
text: around her protectively. The blow lands an instant later.
dialog: 
text: Stillwell and Watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a
text: staggering impact. Watts is dazed: Stillwell killed.
dialog: 
text: Woozy, she sees the Sleeper step into the Pilot Chamber.
dialog: 
text: The door begins to close.
dialog: 
text: Watts sees that DAVID's head lies just inside the door. She
text: scrambles for it. Too late. The door knits itself into a
text: featureless wall before her reaching hand.
dialog: 
text: Watts is alone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PILOT CHAMBER
dialog: 
text: The Sleeper settles into the pilot's chair: it fuses with

dialog: the fabric of reality in raw information.

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: On the bridge of the Magellan, Janek stares out. In the
text: distance the Juggernaut rises out of the ground to eclipse
dialog: the central pyramid.
dialog: 
text: Janek squints, trying to understand what he's seeing
dialog: 
text: A light races toward the Magellan down the canal: a rover.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CANAL - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Watts steers the rover recklessly, hands locked on the
text: controls. Rifle slung over her shoulder.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MAGELLAN - BRIDGE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Janek watches the rover come - and the Holloway Alien -
text: boneless and white - unfolds itself from the instruments over
dialog: his head.
dialog: 
text: Its goblin-shark jaw juts out. Sinks its horrific teeth into
text: Janek's right shoulder.
dialog: 
text: Janek howls in agony. His right arm is paralyzed by the bite.
text: He gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand.
dialog: 
text: The Alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat.
dialog: 
text: Janek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his
dialog: shoulder. Two, three rounds...
dialog: 
text: The bullets punch easily into the Alien - but the soft flesh
text: closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its
dialog: teeth tighten.
dialog: 
text: Watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy
text: rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact
text: wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils.
dialog: 
text: Watts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of
text: bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead.
dialog: 
text: Watts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the
text: bulkhead and helps Janek to stanch the bleeding of his
text: horrific wound. She gets the bleeding stopped. Wraps him in
dialog: bandages.
dialog: 
text: Janek will live - but his right arm is useless.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JANEK

speaker_heading: JANEK

dialog:

dialog:

dialog: 
text: A crushing wheel of death, big as a mountain.
dialog: 
text: She runs. Like a child in a nightmare.
dialog: 
text: The Juggernaut bears down on her.
dialog: 
text: She turns aside, trying to get out of its course. Even at a

dialog: 
text: The Juggernaut wobbles toward her. Slowing.
dialog: 
text: Exhausted, Watts collapses, gasping. The Juggernaut rolls to

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAGELLAN CRASH SITE - DUSK
dialog: 
text: Watts flees through the storm, across the burning debris
text: field. A wilderness of lightning, fire, and twisted metal. A

dialog: 
text: She looks back through the darkness.
dialog: 
text: In a strobe-light flicker of lightning, she sees a gray demon
text: approaching through the wreckage.
dialog: 
text: She scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull
text: fragment...running and clambering...
dialog: 
text: The Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of
dialog: the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered
dialog: compartments. Jetsam.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night:
text: searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer.
dialog: 
text: She stumbles into the remains of the Magellan's laboratory.
dialog: 
text: A hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground. Watts climbs
text: inside. Pulls the lid shut.
dialog: 
text: The Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the
text: plexiglass, holding her breath.
dialog: 
text: The Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's
text: head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the
text: head - GROWING as she watches.
dialog: 
text: Her suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING.
text: The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat.
dialog: 
text: Watts is paralyzed.
dialog: 
text: The Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With
text: sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer
text: flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs.
dialog: 
text: The Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase
text: through fragments of burning metal.
dialog: 
text: Watts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees
text: she's tripped over a HULL SAW - the same diamond-bladed tool
text: DAVID used to dismantle the terraforming engine.
dialog: 
text: She seizes the saw - straining to manage its weight. Hides in
text: the hollow of a massive girder.
dialog: 114.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Alien passes by. Scenting the air. She freezes. Her arms
text: trembling with the weight of the saw. Waiting for it to pass.
dialog: 
text: Almost it leaves. But a tiny rattle of metal from the
text: quivering saw brings it back.
dialog: 
text: Out of options, Watts powers up the saw. The blade whines up
text: to speed. They lunge at one another in the same moment.
dialog: 
text: The diamond blade shears off one of the Alien's claws.
dialog: 
text: The monster screams and recoils.
dialog: 
text: Its lashing tail sends Watts sprawling. She loses the saw.
dialog: 
text: The Alien comes after her, slinking low to the ground,
text: injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury.
dialog: 
text: Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She
text: rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh
text: with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground.
dialog: 
text: Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on
text: the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips.
dialog: 
text: The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her
text: faceplate. Its hideous jaws open.
dialog: 
text: With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her
text: leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt.
text: Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.
dialog: 
text: The Alien strikes - just as Watts GRABS the saw.
dialog: 
text: She meets the Alien's head with the buzzing blade.
dialog: 
text: IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL.
dialog: 
text: A gout of green acid onto Watts's helmet.
dialog: 
text: The Alien falls aside, thrashing its death-throes, the saw
text: still growling.
dialog: 
text: Watts sees ACID COMING THROUGH HER HELMET - fast.
dialog: 
text: With frantic haste she unlatches her helmet. Wrenches it off
text: as it crumples and melts.
dialog: 
text: She stands bare-headed in the toxic air. Desperate, she looks
text: around with tearing eyes.
dialog: 
text: In the distance she sees an intact module of the Magellan.
