scene_heading: INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY
text: It's grand and modern. Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched
text: on the wall in large gold letters. An old woman enters
text: carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages. She
text: seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly. The young receptionist,
text: dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Oh, hi.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought
dialog: I'd see --
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: I think he's in a conference.
dialog: Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: Would you just try him? You never know.
dialog: As long as I'm here. You never know.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Of course. Please have a seat.
text: The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her
text: lap. She stares politely straight ahead.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
dialog: (quietly into headset)
dialog: It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just
dialog: -- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's
dialog: old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry.
dialog: (to old woman)
dialog: I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now.
dialog: It's a crazy time of year for us.
text: The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the
text: corner. Its ornaments are holograms.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: This book -- It's essential that people
dialog: read it because --
text: (gravely, patting the
dialog: manuscript)
dialog: -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (nodding sympathetically)
dialog: Maybe after the holidays then.
scene_heading: INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY
text: The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway
text: hall. She stops to catch her breath, then continues and
text: passes several archway with letters printed above them. When
text: she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a
text: slot. A plastic molded chair drops into the archway. She
text: sits in the chair; it rises.
scene_heading: INT. TUBE -DAY
text: The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a
text: line of chairs shooting through a glass tube. The other
text: chairs are peopled with commuters. We stay with the woman as
text: she and the others travel over New York City in the tube.
text: There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the
text: skyline. The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap.
dialog: It's called:
dialog: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
text: This serves as the movie's opening title. The other credits
text: follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes.
text: Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
scene_heading: SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER
text: Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall,
text: magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic
text: seascape paintings on the walls. The receptionist, Mary, 25,
text: can be seen typing in the reception area. Behind her are
text: shelves and shelves of medical files. The door opens and
text: Clementine enters. She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a
text: faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt. She's
text: decidedly funky and has blue hair. Mary looks up.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (approaching reception area)
dialog: Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr.
dialog: Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right
dialog: with you.
text: Clementine sits. She looks tired, maybe hungover. She picks
text: up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest.
scene_heading: INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS
text: Mary pads down the hallway. She knocks on a closed door.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK (O.S.)
dialog: Yes?
text: Mary opens the door, peeks in. Howard Mierzwiak, 40's,
text: professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Howard, your one o'clock.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
text: She smiles and nods. It's clear she's in love. It's equally
text: clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue. Mary turns to
dialog: leave.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Mary...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Order me a pastrami for after?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Cole slaw, ice tea?
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Welcome, Howard.
text: She smiles and heads down the hall. Stan, 30's, tall,
text: spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Boo.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hi.
text: She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Barely seen you all morning, kiddo.
text: He leans in to kiss her. She cranes her neck to keep him
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (reprimanding whisper)
dialog: Stan... c'mon...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Sorry. I just --
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (somewhat guiltilly)
dialog: It's just...y'know... I mean...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I know. Anyway --
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Anyway, I've got to do my tap
dialog: dance here.
text: She indicates the door to the reception area. Stan nods.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: See you later, alligator.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: 'kay.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hey, if you're ordering lunch for
dialog: Mierzwiak, would you --
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I better do this, Stan.
text: Stan nods again and Mary opens the door to the waiting room.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ms. Kruczynski?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
dialog: Hi.
text: After a moment, Clementine appears in the doorway. Mary
text: leads her down the hall, not looking back.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (professionally courteous)
dialog: How are you today?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Okay, I guess.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (at Mierzwiak's office)
dialog: Here we are.
text: Mierzwiak steps out from behind his desk.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Ms. Kruczynski, please come in.
text: Clementine enters the office. Mary smiles at Mierzwiak and
text: closes the door, leaving them alone.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mierzwiak directs Clementine to a chair next to a coffee
text: table and a conspicuously placed box of tissues. Mierzwiak
text: sits across from her. He smiles.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: How are you today?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Okay, I guess.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: (nodding sympathetically)
dialog: Well, why don't you tell me what's going
dialog: on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
text: He indicates a tape recorder.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I don't care.
text: He turns it on, smiles at her, gestures for her to begin.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I've been having a bad time of it
dialog: with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you
dialog: guess you're having a bad time with hm?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What? No. I don't like the term
dialog: boyfriend. It's so gay.
text: Mierzwiak nods. He's attentive, pleasant, and neutral
dialog: throughout.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe gay isn't the right word. But,
dialog: anyway, it's been rough with him...
dialog: whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My
dialog: significant other... heh heh. And I
dialog: guess on a certain level, I want to break
dialog: it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
dialog: this constant questioning and re
dialog: questioning. Do I end it? Should I give
dialog: it more time? I'm not happy, but what do
dialog: I expect? Relationships require work.
dialog: You know the drill. The thing that I
dialog: keep coming back to is, I'm not getting
dialog: any younger, I want to have a baby... at
dialog: some point... maybe... right? So then I
dialog: think I should settle -- which is not
dialog: necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
dialog: a good guy. It's not really settling.
dialog: Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of
dialog: movies, y'know? That I have some
dialog: completely unrealistic notion of what a
dialog: relationship can be. But then I think,
dialog: no, this is what I really want, so I
dialog: should allow myself the freedom to go out
dialog: and fucking find it. You know? Agreed?
dialog: But then I think he is a good guy and...
dialog: It's complicated. Y'know?
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I think I know. I think we can help. Why
dialog: don't you start by telling me about your
dialog: relationship. Everything you can think
dialog: of. Everything about him. Everything
dialog: about you. And we'll take it from there.
text: She nods, thinks.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Um, well, he's a fucking tidy one --
scene_heading: EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION
scene_heading: SUBTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER
text: The platform is crowded with business commuters. Joel is
text: among them. He is in his 30's, gaunt, and holding a
text: briefcase. The platform across the tracks from him is empty.
text: Suddenly he turns and makes his way through the crowd. He
text: climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass to the empty
text: platform. Soon an almost empty train pulls up to that
text: platform. Joel gets on and watches the business commuters
text: through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the
dialog: station.
scene_heading: EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - LATER
text: Joel talks on a phone. The wind howls around him. He tries
text: to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi, Cindy. Joel. Listen, I'm not
dialog: feeling well this morning. No. Food
dialog: poisoning, I think. Sorry it took me so
dialog: long to call in, but I've been vomiting.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase. He
text: passes an old man with a metal detector. They nod at each
dialog: other.
text: Later: Joel looks out at the ocean.
text: Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook. He
text: opens it and writes with a gloved hand.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: January 13th, 2006. Today I skipped work
dialog: and took the train out to Montauk.
dialog: (thinks)
text: It's cold.
dialog: (thinks some more)
text: The sky is gray.
dialog: (thinks some more)
dialog: I don't know what else to say. Nothing
dialog: happens. Nothing changes. I saw Naomi
dialog: last night. We had sex. It was weird to
dialog: fall into our old familiar sex life so
text: easily. Like no time has passed. After
dialog: two years apart suddenly we're talking
dialog: about getting together again. I guess
dialog: that's good.
text: He has no other thoughts. He glances up, spots a female
text: figure in the distance, walking in his direction. She stands
text: out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded
text: sweatshirt. It's Clementine. He watches her for a bit, then
text: as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least
text: pretends to. Once she passed, he watches her walk away. She
text: stops and stares out at the ocean. Joel writes.
speaker_heading: JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: If I'm constitutionally incapable of
dialog: making eye-contact with a woman I don't
dialog: know. I guess I'd better get back to
dialog: Naomi.
text: Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the
text: season. He peeks cautiously in a dark window.
text: Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick.
scene_heading: INT. DINER - DAY
text: It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty. Joel sits
text: in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of
text: tomato soup. An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter.
text: Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood. Joel
text: glances at her bright blue hair. She picks an empty booth
text: and sits. Joel studies her discreetly. The waitress
text: approaches her with a coffee pot.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: God, yes. You've saved my life!
text: The waitress pours the coffee.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You know what you want yet?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Ain't that the question of the century.
text: The waitress is not amused.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You got grilled cheese and tomato soup?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Yeah. We're having a run on it.
text: The waitress heads to the grill. Clementine fishes in her
text: bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,
text: pours something in, then brings the cup back up.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (calling)
dialog: And some cream, please.
text: Clementine looks around the place. Her eyes meet Joel's
text: before he is able to look away. She smiles vaguely. He
text: looks embarrassed, then down at his journal. Clementine
text: pulls a book from her purse and starts to read. Joel glances
text: up, tries to see the cover. It's blue. He can't read the
dialog: title.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: Joel stares out at the ocean. Far down the beach Clementine
text: stares at it, too. Joel glances sideways at her then back at
dialog: the ocean.
scene_heading: EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train. Clementine
text: enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.
text: She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if
text: they're old friends. He waves back, embarrassed. She takes
text: a seat on a bench far down the platform. Joel stares at his
text: hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to
text: conceal his awkwardness.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER
text: Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the
text: slowly passing desolate terrain. After a moment the door
text: between cars opens and Clementine enters. Joel looks up.
text: Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding
text: where to sit. She settles on a seat at the opposite end of
text: the car. Joel looks out the window. He feels her watching
text: him. The train is picking up speed. Finally:
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (calling over the rumble)
dialog: Hi!
text: Joel looks over.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Why what?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, I didn't know if you were talking to
dialog: me, so...
text: She looks around the empty car.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Well, I didn't want to assume.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the
dialog: leap and assume someone is talking to you
text: in an otherwise empty car.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
text: Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't
dialog: have to scream. Not that I don't need to
dialog: scream sometimes, believe me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But I don't want to bug you if you're
dialog: trying to write or something.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really
dialog: think of much to say probably.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh. So...
text: She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she
dialog: came from.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down
dialog: here. I didn't mean to --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No, I don't want to bug you if you're
dialog: trying to --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's okay, really.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.
dialog: I have a long trip ahead of me.
dialog: (sits across aisle from Joel)
dialog: How far are you going? On the train, I
dialog: mean, of course.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Rockville Center.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: The weirder part is I think actually I
dialog: recognize you. I thought that earlier in
dialog: the diner. That's why I was looking at
dialog: you. You work at Borders, right?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Ucch, really? You're kidding. God.
dialog: Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's
dialog: me: book slave there for, like, five
dialog: years now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Really? Because --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: -- because I go there all the time. I
dialog: don't think I ever saw you before.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
text: Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as
dialog: much as is humanly possible. You have a
dialog: cell phone? I need to quit right this
dialog: minute. I'll call in dead.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't have one.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy
dialog: before me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I noticed your hair. I guess it made an
dialog: impression on me, that's why I was pretty
dialog: sure I recognized you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Ah, the hair.
text: (pulls a strand in front of her
dialog: eyes, studies it)
dialog: Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The
dialog: color. Snappy name, huh?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I like it.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were
dialog: wondering.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I can't remember.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Anyway, this company makes a whole line
text: of colors with equally snappy names. Red
dialog: Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.
dialog: That'd be a job, coming up with those
dialog: names. How do you get a job like that?
dialog: That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't really know how --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
text: Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You think that could possibly be a full
dialog: time job? How many hair colors could
dialog: there be?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (pissy)
dialog: Someone's got that job.
dialog: (excited)
dialog: Agent Orange! I came up with that one.
dialog: Anyway, there are endless color
dialog: possibilities and I'd be great at it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sure you would.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: My writing career! Your hair written by
dialog: Clementine Kruczynski.
dialog: (thought)
dialog: The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You sure? That doesn't sound --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I think. Anyway, I've tried all their
dialog: colors. More than once. I'm getting too
dialog: old for this. But it keeps me from
dialog: having to develop an actual personality.
dialog: I apply my personality in a paste. You?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, I doubt that's the case.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Well, you don't know me, so... you don't
dialog: know, do you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah, I got it.
text: There's a silence.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: My name's Clementine, by the way.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm Joel.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't
dialog: do that; you're trying to be nice.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know any jokes about your name.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Huckleberry Hound?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know what that means.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm nut nuts.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my
dialog: darlin' Clementine? No?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It
dialog: means "merciful", right?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a
dialog: vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: See, I wouldn't think that about you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (pissy)
dialog: Why wouldn't you think that about me?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't
dialog: know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other
dialog: adjectives? There's careless and snotty
dialog: and overbearing and argumentative...
dialog: mumpish.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, anyway... Sorry.
text: They sit in silence for a while.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I just don't think "nice" is a
dialog: particularly interesting thing to be.
text: The conductor enters the car.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Tickets.
text: Joel hands the conductor his ticket. The conductor punches
text: it and hands it back.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What is nice, anyway? I mean, besides an
dialog: adjective? I guess it can be an adverb,
dialog: sort of.
text: The conductor turns to Clementine. She fishes in her bag.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: It doesn't reveal anything. Nice is
text: pandering. Cowardly.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: And life is more interesting than that.
dialog: Or should be. Jesus God, I hope it is...
dialog: someday.
dialog: (to conductor)
dialog: I know it's here.
text: The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't need nice. I don't need myself
dialog: to be it and I don't need anyone else to
dialog: be it at me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
text: She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts
text: frantically through. Joel sees the book she was reading in
text: the diner. It's The Play by Stephen Dixon.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it. DAMN IT!
dialog: (there it is)
dialog: Oh. Here.
text: She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly. He
text: punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: Next stop Southampton.
text: The conductor heads into the next car. Clementine shoves
text: stuff back into her purse. Her hands are a little shaky.
text: She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket,
text: opens it, and downs it. Joel is watching all of this but
text: pretending not to. She looks out the window for a while.
text: The train pulls into the station. The doors open. Nobody
text: gets on. The doors close. The train pulls out.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Joel? It's Joel, right?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it
dialog: yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever,
dialog: I'm a little out of sorts today.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That's okay.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (stares out window)
dialog: My embarrassing admission is I really
dialog: like that you're nice. Right now,
dialog: anyway. I can't tell from one moment to
dialog: the next what I'm going to like. But
dialog: right now I'm glad you said, "that's
dialog: okay" to me. That was nice of you.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's no problem. Anyway, I have some
dialog: stuff I need to --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...
text: (stands, throws bag over
dialog: shoulder)
dialog: Take care, then.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (pulling journal from
dialog: briefcase)
dialog: Probably see you at the book store.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (heading toward other end of
dialog: car)
dialog: Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
text: Clementine sits and stares out the window.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - LATER
text: There are a few more people in the car now. Clementine has
text: inched a few seats closer to Joel. She watches him. His
text: head is immersed in his journal.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - LATER
text: It's dark out. The train is pretty crowded. Joel stares out
text: the window. Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING
text: The doors open and Joel emerges along with others. He heads
text: to the parking lot, arrives at the car. There's a big dented
text: scrape along the driver's side. He gets in.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER
text: Joel drives. He passes Clementine walking. She looks cold.
text: He considers, slows, rolls down his window.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You're sure? It's cold.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I don't want to take you out of your way.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's okay.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah?
text: He pulls over. She climbs in. They drive.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Where do you live?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You're not a stalker or anything, right?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were,
dialog: but no.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You can't be too careful. I've been
dialog: stalked. I've been told I'm highly
dialog: stalkable. I don't need that.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm not a stalker.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know Wilmont?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
text: Wilmont. Near the high school.
text: Joel turns. They drive in silence.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of
dialog: nutso. I'm not really.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's okay. I didn't think you were.
text: There's a silence.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: So you like bookstores, huh?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I like to read.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah? I can't remember that album very
dialog: well. I remember liking it. But --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent
text: most of the train ride trying to
dialog: remember. "Till you're full of rag water
dialog: and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill
dialog: out/Over the side to anyone who'll
dialog: listen." Remember?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Sort of, um...
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Remember? "And you take on the dreams of
dialog: the ones who have slept there/And I'm
dialog: lost in the window/I hide on the
dialog: stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in
dialog: your hat..."
dialog: (starts to cry)
dialog: Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in
dialog: your hat" makes me cry.
dialog: (pointing to a house)
dialog: Me.
text: Joel pulls over.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks very much. That was very nice of
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, I wouldn't want to be --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already
dialog: told you that.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Anyway. See Ya.
text: Clementine opens the car door.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Take care.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (turning back)
dialog: Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have
dialog: lots of drinks. And I could --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Um --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm
dialog: embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Joel stands in the living room, somewhat nervously. He tries
text: to calm himself by focusing on the surroundings. He looks at
text: the books on her shelves. Clementine is in the kitchen. We
text: see her as she passes by the doorway several times, preparing
text: drinks and chatting.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Thanks. I like it, too. Been here about
dialog: four years. It's really cheap. My
text: downstairs neighbor is old so she's
dialog: quiet, which is great. And the
text: landlord's sweet, which is bizarre, but
dialog: great, and I have a little porch in the
dialog: back, which is great, because I can read
dialog: there, and listen to my crickets and...
text: Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
text: Two blue ruins...
text: Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of
text: crows flying.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You like that?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Very much.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: This... someone gave that to me, just
dialog: like, recently. I like it, too. I like
dialog: crows. I think I used to be a crow.
text: She caws and hands Joel a drink.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Do you believe in that stuff?
dialog: Reincarnation?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription
text: on the back.
dialog: (takes it off the wall, reads:)
dialog: The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust
dialog: of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my
dialog: heart/A change of mood/And saved some
dialog: part/Of a day I rued.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Frost?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (impressed)
dialog: Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost
dialog: lover by any stretch. His stuff seems
dialog: strictly grade school to me. But this
dialog: made me cry for some reason. Maybe
dialog: because it is grade school. Y'know?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's pretty.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I miss grade school. I don't know why
dialog: I'm calling it grade school all of a
dialog: sudden. When I went we called it
dialog: elementary school. But I like grade
dialog: school better. Sounds like something
dialog: someone from the forties would call it.
dialog: I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore
dialog: hats. Anyway, cheers!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Cheers.
text: They click glasses. Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp
text: of her drink. Joel sips. She plops down on the couch and
text: pulls her boots off.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: God, that feels so fucking good. Take
dialog: yours off.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
text: Joel sits in a chair across the room. Clementine finishes
text: her drink.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ready for another?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, I'm okay for now.
text: She heads toward the kitchen with her glass.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Well, I'm ready. Put some music on.
text: Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What do you want to hear?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
dialog: You pick it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You just say. I'm not really --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (O.S.)
dialog: I don't know! I can't see them from
dialog: here, Joel! Just pick something good.
text: Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's. He picks up Bang On a Can
text: performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.
text: Clementine reenters with her drink.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, excellent choice.
text: She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player. The music is
text: dreamy and haunting and slow. Clementine falls back onto the
text: couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mmmmmmm. Way to go, Joel. You pick
dialog: good.
text: Joel sits down in his chair and drinks. There's a silence,
text: which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, I should probably get going.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No, stay. Just for a little while.
text: (opens her eyes, brightly)
dialog: Refill?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. I --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I know a man who needs a refill.
text: She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the
dialog: kitchen.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: God bless alcohol, is what I say. Where
dialog: would I be without it. Oh, Jesus, Mary,
dialog: and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think
dialog: about that.
text: She giggles. Joel looks around the room again. There are
text: several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade
text: costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher
text: potato, a housewife potato. Clementine returns with Joel's
text: drink and a refill for herself.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Drink up, young man. It'll make the
text: whole seduction part less repugnant.
text: Joel looks a little alarmed.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm just kidding. C'mon.
text: She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes. Joel watches
text: her, looks at her breasts. She opens her eyes, smiles
text: drunkenly at him.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
dialog: telling me I'm psychic. She should know.
dialog: Do you believe in that stuff?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Me neither. But sometimes I have
dialog: premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe
dialog: that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know,
dialog: you think something and then it happens,
dialog: or you think a word and then someone says
dialog: it? Y'know?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my
text: feeling about it. It's hard to know.
dialog: Like, okay, but how many times do I think
dialog: something and it doesn't happen? That's
dialog: what you're saying, right? You forget
dialog: about those times. Right?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I guess.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (dreamy beat)
dialog: But I think I am. I like to think I am.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's helpful to think there's some order
dialog: to things. You're kind of closed
dialog: mouthed, aren't you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Sorry. My life isn't that interesting.
dialog: I go to work. I go home. I don't know
dialog: what to say.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (considers this)
dialog: Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm
dialog: always anxious thinking I'm not living my
dialog: life to the fullest, y'know? Taking
dialog: advantage of every possibility? Just
dialog: making sure that I'm not wasting one
dialog: second of the little time I have.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I think about that.
text: She looks at him really hard for a long moment. Joel tries
text: to hold her gaze, but can't. He looks down at his drink.
text: Clementine starts to cry again.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled
dialog: at you before about it. God, I'm an
dialog: idiot.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I do have a tendency to use that word too
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I like you. That's the thing about my
dialog: psychic thing. I think that's my
dialog: greatest psychic power, that I get a
dialog: sense about people. My problem is I
dialog: never trust it. But I get it. And with
dialog: you I get that you're a really good guy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I
dialog: can tell. There's a lot of stuff going
dialog: on in your brain. I can tell. My
dialog: goal... can I tell you my goal?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (ala Paul Simon)
dialog: What's the goal, Joel?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
dialog: through me? Do you know what I mean?
dialog: It's like, there's all these emotions and
text: ideas and they come quick and they change
text: and they leave and they come back in a
dialog: different form and I think we're all
dialog: taught we should be consistent. Y'know?
dialog: You love someone -- that's it. Forever.
dialog: You choose to do something with your life
dialog: -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a
dialog: sign of maturity to stick with that and
dialog: see things through. And my feeling is
dialog: that's how you die, because you stop
dialog: listening to what is true, and what is
dialog: true is constantly changing. You know?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't
dialog: need any more reason to do it. Who knows
dialog: what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You're very nice. God, I have to stop
dialog: saying that. You're nervous around me,
dialog: huh?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm nervous. You don't need to be
dialog: nervous around me, though. I like you.
dialog: Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, not at all.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I don't either. I used to. But I'm
dialog: through with that. Y'know, if I don't
dialog: love my body, then I'm just lost. You
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: With all the wrinkles and scars and the
dialog: general falling apart that's coming
dialog: 'round the bend.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, I've been seeing this guy...
text: Joel looks slightly crestfallen.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (off his reaction)
dialog: Well, for the last week, anyway! He's
dialog: kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but
dialog: he's really stuck on me, which is
dialog: flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And
dialog: he's, like, a dope, but he says these
dialog: smart and moving things sometimes, out of
dialog: nowhere, that just break my heart. He's
dialog: the one who gave me that crow photograph.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, yeah.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: That made me cry. But, anyway, we went
dialog: up to Boston, because I had this urge to
dialog: lie on my back on the Charles River. It
dialog: gets frozen this time of year.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That's scary sounding.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Exactly! I used to do it in college and
dialog: I had this urge to go do it again, so I
dialog: got Patrick and we drove all night to get
dialog: there and he was sweet and said nice
dialog: things to me, but I was really
text: disappointment to be there with him.
dialog: Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff
dialog: comes in. Like, it just isn't right with
dialog: him. Y'know?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I don't believe in that soulmate crap
dialog: anymore, but... he says so many great
dialog: things. We like the same writers. This
dialog: writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
dialog: And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel,
dialog: you should come up to the Charles with me
dialog: sometime.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah? Oh, great!
text: She sits closer to him.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic --
dialog: night picnics are different -- and --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (shy)
dialog: Sounds good. But right now I should go.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: You should stay.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I have to get up early in the morning
dialog: tomorrow, so...
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Okay.
text: Joel puts on his overcoat. Clementine heads to the phone
text: table, pulls out a notepad.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I would like you to call me. Would you
dialog: do that? I would like that.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yes.
text: She scribbles her phone number, hands it to him. He puts it
text: in his pocket. He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
text: then forces himself to speak.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't think your personality comes out
dialog: of a tube. I think the hair is just... a
dialog: pretty topping.
text: She tears up, swallows, and kisses him on the cheek. He's
text: surprised and pleased and nervous.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (shyly formal)
dialog: So, I enjoyed meeting you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You'll call me, right?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Tomorrow?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Tonight. Just to test out the phone
dialog: lines and all.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay.
text: We stay with Clementine as she watches Joel tromping through
text: the snow and getting in his car.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Joel speeds through the suburban Rockville Center
text: neighborhood. There is no snow on the ground. He seems
text: different, somehow foggy and disoriented.
scene_heading: SUBTITLE: THREE DAYS EARLIER
text: He arrives at his apartment building and parks.
scene_heading: EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: Joel gets out of his car, spots a van parked across the
text: street. There are two dark figures inside.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Them.
text: He hurries inside the building.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel enters, dumps his overcoat on a chair, turns off the
text: lights, crosses to look furtively out the window. It's
text: snowing in large flakes which seem to fall only in the beam
text: of a streetlight.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: It was snowing.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: There are two of them. Couldn't make
text: them out. The orange glow of a
dialog: cigarette.
text: Joel squints to see inside the van. Two dark figures talk.
text: One sucks on a cigarette and s dim orange light momentarily
text: illuminates the interior. The figure in the driver seat
text: rolls down his window and gives a cheery wave to Joel.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I'm like a joke to them.
text: Joel pulls away from the window, his face blanched.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I guess they figure they can act like
dialog: they want. They don't have to worry
dialog: about me remembering.
text: He paces, mulling things over. As he does, the scene starts
text: to change, almost as if it is drying out.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I might be making a mistake.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just
dialog: need to learn to live with this. First
dialog: of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it
dialog: happened. Those who do not remember
dialog: history are condemned to repeat it. Who
dialog: said that? Churchill? I'm not sure.
dialog: But I don't care. She did it to me. I
dialog: have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Fuck you, Clementine.
text: The colors bleach, the surroundings become slightly vague.
text: Even Joel's persona and voice-over seem to alter, his
text: emotional intensity becoming diffused. Joel does not seem
text: aware of this. He stops pacing, takes a small vial from his
text: pocket, dumps the lone pill onto his palm. He looks at it.
text: It's pink. There's some illegible initials stamped on it.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Pink.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There was a number on it. I remember.
dialog: AL 1718?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I have to follow through with this. I
dialog: have no choice.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: The pill was pink, I remember. It had
dialog: some letters and numbers on it. What
dialog: were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four
dialog: digits. I don't like taking pills when I
dialog: don't know what they are. I have no
dialog: choice.
text: He swallows it, peeks out the window again, takes off his
text: clothes, slips into a pair of pajamas fresh from the store
text: packaging. He sits on the edge of the bed, dials the phone.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: We're sorry, the number you have
dialog: dialed...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Screw you, Clementine, for doing this ...
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE
dialog: We're sorry, the number you have dialed
dialog: is no longer in service. If you think
dialog: you have reached this recording in error
dialog: -
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Bye.
text: Joel hangs up and lies on his back on the bed. By now the
text: scene is lifeless, almost a husk. He hears the apartment
text: building door open. He hears footsteps.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's them.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
text: It's too late.
text: His eyelids are getting heavy. He closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: BLACK.
text: He hears a key in his apartment door.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Fuck.
scene_heading: INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
text: Joel sits in the bookstore coffee shop. It's a jarring
text: transition, visually and emotionally. Joel is in the midst
text: of some traumatic state of mind.
text: He fingers the vial with the pink pill in it as he watches
text: Clementine stack books on shelves. Her hair is bright orange
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I should maybe talk to you.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Clementine. I should just maybe talk to
dialog: her.
text: Joel rises and heads toward Clementine.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I love you and if you knew that... if I
dialog: told you what happened... I'll explain
dialog: everything, what we meant to each other.
dialog: I'll tell you everything about our time
dialog: together. You'll know everything again
dialog: and...
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Maybe if I just explain what happened, I
dialog: wouldn't have to go through this and I
dialog: could tell you everything and it would be
dialog: like you knew and we could rebuild and we
dialog: could be happy again and...
text: Right before Joel gets there, Patrick, a skinny young man
text: approaches Clementine. Joel stops, watches. The young man
text: seems out of breath. He glances over at Joel, then taps
text: Clementine on the shoulder. She turns, annoyed, sees who it
text: is and her face lights up.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Clementine.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: That's your look for me.
text: Clementine giggles, stands and pokes Patrick playfully in the
dialog: ribs.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the
dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You were not.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I was not.
text: Joel is mesmerized by their familiarity. As he stands there,
text: the scene starts to dry out.
text: Clementine and Patrick continue their flirtation but it's
text: turning lifeless, as if they are just reciting lines. The
text: bookstore start to lose its color and immediacy.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Come over after I'm done here?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You rat.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I really want to, but tonight's
dialog: important. Test tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: How could she have done this to me? How
dialog: could anyone do this to anyone?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (to Patrick)
dialog: You didn't say anything about my hair.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: It's so cool. You're by far the most
text: sensational person in the room.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: In the room?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: In the world.
text: Joel seems dazed, in some sort of dream confusion, as he
text: realizes the world around him is looking increasingly odd.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What's happening here?
dialog: (looks at watch; it's 9:30)
dialog: Oh, God! I have to go home. They'll be
dialog: there soon.
text: Joel turns to leave.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Joel drives fast, recklessly. The intensity is back. He's
text: weeping as he drives.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Gotta get home. How could she do this to
dialog: me?
dialog: How could she not care about what we
dialog: meant to each other. What a fuck! What
dialog: a fucking monster she is!
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe
dialog: she's with that guy now! I'm never going
dialog: to see her again. I love her so much.
dialog: What a fucking monster she is!
text: The scene is faded as he parks in front of his apartment
text: building, and gets out of the car. Joel spots the parked
text: van. We've seen this before, but it's dried out now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Them.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
text: Joel trudges along carrying two big trash bags full of stuff.
text: He's been crying. He looks behind him and finds himself
text: looking out the window of his apartment at the dark van on
text: the snowy street. He turns back to the New York Street and
text: spots the address he was looking for: 610 11th Avenue.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Joel sits in the small room with his bags. A woman across
text: from him cradles a box full of belongings in her lap. Her
text: eyes are red from crying. Mary, the receptionist, pokes her
text: head through her window into the waiting room.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hello again, Mr. Barish. Good, you've
dialog: got your stuff.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Joel walks with his bags behind Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (not looking back)
dialog: How are you today?
dialog: (at lab)
dialog: Here we are.
scene_heading: INT. LABORATORY - DAY
text: Joel enters. Mierzwiak stands there with Stan in his lab
dialog: coat.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Ah, Mr. Barish. This is Stan. He'll be
dialog: in charge of your procedure tonight.
text: Stan nods professionally.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Mr. Barish.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: How exactly is this going to work
dialog: tonight?
text: As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade,
text: Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry
text: and monotonous.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: We'll start with your most recent
dialog: memories and go backwards -- There is an
dialog: emotional core to each of our memories --
dialog: As we eradicate this core, it starts its
dialog: degradation process -- By the time you
text: wake up in the morning, all memories
dialog: we've targeted will have withered and
text: disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Is there any sort of risk of brain
dialog: damage?
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Well, technically, the procedure itself
text: is brain damage, but on a par with a
dialog: night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll
dialog: miss.
text: Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment. Suddenly
dialog: he gets it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's happening now! I'm already in my
dialog: brain.
text: Mierzwiak looks at the fading room.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Yes, I suppose you are.
dialog: (back in his faded memory
dialog: persona)
dialog: So, let's get started -- If we want the
dialog: procedure underway tonight, we have some
dialog: work to do.
text: Joel is sitting in a chair. Electrodes connect him to some
text: electronic machinery monitored by Stan. Mierzwiak watches
text: from the corner.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We use the articles you brought to create
dialog: a map of Clementine in your brain.
dialog: Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to
text: trace the map and erase.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: But you're tracing and erasing now. It's
text: already started. I'm home in my bed.
text: Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to
text: Joel. The equipment registers Joel's reaction.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Very good.
text: Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl. Joel
text: studies it. The machines register his response.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: We'll dispose of these mementos when
dialog: we're done here. That way you won't be
text: confused later by their unexplainable
dialog: presence in your home.
text: Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine
text: printed on it. Joel looks at the cup. The machines record
dialog: his reaction.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Good. We're getting healthy read-outs.
text: The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: Patrick, do me a favor --
text: Joel is watching Stan. Stan is not speaking, yet his voice
dialog: continues.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: -- and check the voltage levels, I'm not
dialog: wiping as clean as I would like here.
text: Joel looks up. Stan's voice seems to be coming from above.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas. His eyes are closed
text: and electrodes connect his head to several machines. The
text: machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes
text: and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly.
text: The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light
text: blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain.
text: Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the
text: lines. Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the
text: bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
text: The voltage looks fine.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Then check the connections.
text: Patrick fiddles with some jacks.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Does that help?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. LAB ROOM - DAY
text: The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat. Stan
text: pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages. Mierzwiak smiles.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Ah, your journal. This will be
dialog: invaluable.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: December 15th, 2004. I met someone
dialog: tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what
dialog: to do. Her name is Clementine and she's
dialog: amazing. So alive and spontaneous and
dialog: passionate and sensitive. Things with
dialog: Naomi and I have been stagnant for so
dialog: long.
text: The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: I think we got this one. Let's push on.
text: Joel looks up at the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large
text: plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with
text: Clementine. There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some
text: potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left
text: there, some CD's. He pulls a big clump of pages out of his
text: loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag.
text: He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes:
dialog: December 15, 2004 Nothing much happened today. I stayed
text: home. Naomi worked on her dissertation.
text: The scene is fading as he continues to write.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: Joel looks for an office number. He finds it. The plaque on
text: the door reads Lacuna Ltd. Joel enters.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: Joel enters the Lacuna waiting room. Mary sits in the
dialog: reception area.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: My name is Joel Barish. I have an
dialog: appointment.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Please have a seat. Dr. Mierzwiak will
dialog: be right with you.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE HALL - DAY
text: Mary leads Joel down the hall.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (without turning)
dialog: How are you today?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Not great.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (at Mierzwiak's office)
dialog: Here we are.
text: Joel glimpses Mary smiling coquettishly at Mierzwiak.
scene_heading: INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Joel and Mierzwiak are in the sitting area. Joel looks at
text: the tape recorder.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I'm sorry you saw one of our notification
dialog: cards. You never should have.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well... I did.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: We can help you through this. Why don't
dialog: you start now by telling me everything
dialog: you can remember about your relationship
dialog: with Clementine.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (thinks, then:)
dialog: It was a mess. I don't know how it got
dialog: this way...
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: It's kind of a dump, don't you think?
text: Joel looks up, trying to locate the voice.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Patrick is checking out the apartment. Stan monitors the
dialog: equipment.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (uninterested)
text: It's an apartment.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Not a dump, then, but kind of plain.
text: Uninspired. And there's a stale smell.
dialog: Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Patrick, let's just get through this. We
dialog: have a long night ahead of us.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah.
text: Patrick returns to the bedside, focuses on the machines for a
text: moment. He glances at the unconscious Joel.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: So who do you think is better-looking, me
dialog: or this guy?
text: Stan glances sideways at Patrick.
scene_heading: INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Mierzwiak sits with Joel in the sitting area.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: So we'll need you to go home and bring in
dialog: everything you ever received from
dialog: Clementine and anything that might remind
dialog: you of her...
text: The scene is faded and disappearing fast. It's gone.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Joel gets off the elevator and approaches the receptionist.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: So then she just stops calling.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I wasn't going to call her. Not after
dialog: the way she was.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Any messages, Carmen?
text: Carmen the receptionist shakes her head.
text: Next day: Joel approaches the receptionist.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Any messages for me, Carmen.
speaker_heading: CARMEN
dialog: Nothing, Joel.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: It's bullshit. She's punishing me for
dialog: being honest with her.
text: Joel is at his office desk on the phone.
scene_heading: PHONE MACHINE VOICE
dialog: You have no messages.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY
text: Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in
text: conversation with someone else.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Sorry, Carmen. Any messages?
text: Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel checks his machine: zero messages.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: That's it. I'm just gonna--
text: Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing
dialog: games and --
speaker_heading: RECORDED VOICE
dialog: The number you have dialed has been
dialog: disconnected.
text: Joel's eyes bug.
scene_heading: INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Why would she do that?
scene_heading: VAGUE RECORDED VOICE
dialog: -- If you think you have reached this
dialog: recording in error, please check your
text: number and dial again.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: She's punishing me for being honest. I
dialog: should just go to her house.
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: I don't think you should go there, Joel.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Maybe you need to look at this as a sign
dialog: to move on. Just make a clean break.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe
dialog: she'd be so goddamn immature!
speaker_heading: ROB
dialog: Joel, look, the thing is --
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: (agitated, interrupting)
dialog: Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog.
dialog: Would you just wait here? Just a second.
text: Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and
text: close the door behind them. Joel hears a hushed argument
text: ensue in the hall. He notices the dog asleep on the floor.
text: He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it
text: distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another. A
text: subscription card falls to the floor. He picks it up and is
text: about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not
text: a subscription card at all. It reads:
text: Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her
dialog: memory. Please never mention their relationship to her
dialog: again. Thank you.
dialog: Lacuna Ltd.
dialog: 610 11th Avenue, NY, NY
text: Joel stares at the card, incredulous.
text: Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You weren't supposed to see that.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: They can't erase memories. It's a joke.
dialog: It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Sweetie, we called the company.
text: Joel just stands there.
text: Close-up of a vague dictionary page.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
text: Lacuna: Noun. A blank, a missing
text: portion, especially in a manuscript.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel is on the phone pacing.
speaker_heading: CARRIE'S VOICE
dialog: You can't tell her, Joel. They explained
dialog: that. Like waking a sleepwalker. It
dialog: might have a devastating effect.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Joel drives past vague local landmark.
speaker_heading: CARRIE'S VOICE
dialog: Think about it: to be told you lived an
dialog: existence of which you have no
dialog: recollection.
speaker_heading: JOEL'S VOICE
dialog: But what am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: CARRIE'S VOICE
dialog: Move on, sweetie.
speaker_heading: JOEL'S VOICE
dialog: How can I? How can I move on when I know
dialog: I'm the only one to carry this love we
dialog: had? How do I do that?
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Joel in his parked car next to a fence surrounding a drive-in
text: movie closed for the season. He weeps. The windows fog up
text: until the outside is completely obscured.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
text: Joel looks for an address.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Joel gets off on the sixth floor. He searches for a room
text: number. As he turns the corner, he sees that the hallway is
text: faded, vague and mostly erased. He keeps walking, comes to
text: the door marked Lacuna and opens it. Inside he can see
text: vague, erased version of Mary the receptionist.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (dead monotone)
dialog: Hi, May I help you?
text: These degraded, faded memories allow Joel to detach himself
text: and hear what's going on in his bedroom.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: So, Mary's coming over tonight.
text: Joel looks up.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Stan works the joystick. Patrick sits on the bed with Joel.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Just wanted to let you know.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I like Mary. I like when she comes to
dialog: visit. I just don't think she likes me.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: She likes you okay.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend
dialog: over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You can if you want.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (re: memory on monitor)
dialog: This one's history. Moving on...
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: The thing is ... my situation is a little
dialog: weird. My girlfriend situation.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Patrick, we need to focus.
text: Stan aims the joystick.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel distractedly reads a book, checks the clock, goes back
text: to the book. The door opens. He looks up. Clementine is
text: staggering in, drunk.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yo ho ho!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's three.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Shit. The last time I saw you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I
dialog: kinda sorta wrecked your car...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I can't believe you wrecked my car.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: ...a little. I was a little tipsy.
dialog: Don't call me pathetic.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well it is pathetic. And fucking
dialog: irresponsible. You could've killed
dialog: somebody.
text: The scene is starting to degrade. The acting becomes anemic.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know, maybe you did kill
dialog: somebody.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's
dialog: just a fucking dent. You're like some
dialog: old lady or something.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Right! She called me an old lady here,
dialog: too! And I remember, I said...
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: And what are you like? A wino?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties?
dialog: A wino!
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Face it, Joel. You're freaked out
dialog: because I was out late without you, and
dialog: in your little wormy brain, you're trying
dialog: to figure out, did she fuck someone
dialog: tonight?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked
dialog: someone tonight. Isn't that how you get
dialog: people to like you?
text: This shuts Clementine up. She is stung and she starts
text: gathering up her belongings, which are strewn about the
text: apartment. Joel is immediately sorry he said this. He
text: follows her around.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry. Okay. I didn't mean that. I
dialog: just... I was just... pissed, I guess.
text: Clementine is out the door. Joel follows.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping
text: off in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Joel drives to catch up with Clementine. He rolls down his
text: window to talk to her.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Let me drive you home.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (without turning)
dialog: Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: Look at it out here. It's falling apart.
dialog: I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
text: She keeps clomping.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You did it to me. I can't believe you
dialog: did this to me. By morning you'll be
dialog: gone. Ha!
text: He stops the car, gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of
text: a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail
text: there is obscured in darkness. Joel wanders it. In the
text: distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop,
text: she doesn't get any farther away. It's lonely.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: See, remember that girl? The one we did
dialog: last week? The one with the potatoes?
text: Joel looks up, startled.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend. Was.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Stan watches the screen. Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at
text: the unconscious Joel.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I gotta tell you something. I kind of
dialog: fell in love with her last night.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: She was unconscious, Patrick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: She was beautiful. So sweet and funky
dialog: and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair
dialog: of her panties, is what.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Jesus, Patrick!
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: I know. It's not like... I mean, they
dialog: were clean and all.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: Look, just don't tell me this stuff. I
dialog: don't want to know this shit.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah, okay.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: We have work to do.
text: There's a click and Joel finds himself in --
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV.
text: It's hard to make out what they're watching.
text: They sit on opposite ends of the couch. They look bored.
text: The scene quickly degenerates. The room fades.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: Okay, but there's more.
text: Joel listens.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: After we did her, I went to where she
dialog: worked and I asked her out.
text: Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch.
text: She stares straight ahead at the TV.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: Patrick... do you know how unethical...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That must be the guy I saw you with.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
text: In the bookstore that night. The skinny
dialog: guy.
text: There's a click and Joel finds himself in --
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel watches TV. Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks
text: at the TV. She slips into a skirt.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: How can you watch this crap?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
text: I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
text: The scene starts to fade. Clementine puts on her shoes and
text: heads out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. ZOO - DAY
text: Joel and Clementine walk around unhappily. They barely look
text: at the animals. Clementine watches parents with babies.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh shit. I remember this.
dialog: (to Clementine)
dialog: Want to go?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (pissy)
dialog: I want to have a baby.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Let's talk about it later.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No. I want to have a baby. I have to
dialog: have a baby.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't think we're ready.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You're not ready.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Clementine, do you really think you could
dialog: take care of a kid?
text: She turns violently toward him, glaring.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (mumbly)
dialog: I don't want to talk about this here.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
text: Joel looks around. People are watching.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't fucking say something like that
dialog: and say you don't want to talk about it!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (screaming now)
dialog: I'd make a fucking good mother! I love
dialog: children! I'm creative and smart and I'd
dialog: make a fucking good mother!
text: The scene starts to fade. Clementine's rant continues but
text: becomes attenuated and vague.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oh, thank God. It's going.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: It's you! It's you who can't commit to
dialog: anything! You have no idea how lucky you
dialog: are I'm interested in you! I don't even
dialog: know why I am! I should just end it
dialog: right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo.
dialog: Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang
dialog: out with!
text: She's crying now, but it's almost animatronic, no real
text: emotion in it. The scene is a husk.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's going, Clementine. All the crap and
dialog: hurt and disappointment. It's all being
text: wiped away.
text: She looks up at him.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm glad.
text: Their eyes lock. She is fading before his eyes.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Me, too.
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
text: It's noisy and crowded. Joel and Clementine sit at a small
text: table. She is drunk and staring off, blankly.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: So, um --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
text: (swiveling head toward him)
dialog: Would you get me another, Joely?
text: Joel sighs, stands, and heads to the crowded bar.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanky! Thanky!
text: Joel is at the bar, trying to get the bartender's attention.
text: Joel is paying the bartender. He turns with the drink to
text: head back to the table. He sees Clementine flirting with a
text: man in Joel's seat.
text: Joel is at the table. Clementine looks from her
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Joel, this is Mark. He likes my boobs.
dialog: He came over special to tell me that.
dialog: Isn't that nice. He doesn't think I'm
dialog: fat.
text: The scene starts to fade. Mark rises.
speaker_heading: MARK
dialog: I didn't know she was with someone, man.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: S'okay, Mark. Joel doesn't like my
text: boobs.
dialog: (stage whisper)
dialog: I don't think he likes girls.
text: The bar gets quiet and vague.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You're drunk.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
text: Clementine keeps talking but there are no more intelligible
text: words, just a whisper -- like a breeze.
text: A doorbell buzzes. Joel looks up.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Patrick opens the door. Mary stands there in a winter coat,
text: carrying a backpack.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (coolly)
dialog: Oh, hey, Patrick.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Hi, Mary. How's it going?
text: She walks past him.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hey, you.
text: Stan and Mary kiss. She looks down at Joel as she takes off
text: her coat.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: It's freezing out.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You found us okay?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (re: Joel)
dialog: Poor guy.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Have anything to drink?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: We haven't checked.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, allow me to do the honors. It's
dialog: fucking freezing and I need something.
text: She heads into the kitchen. Stan turns back to monitor the
text: slivers of light.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Mary hates me. I've never been popular
dialog: with the ladies.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Maybe if you stopped stealing their
dialog: panties.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (guilty beat)
dialog: Okay, There's more, Stan --
text: Stan looks over at Patrick. Mary returns with a bottle of
text: scotch and two glasses.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hey, hey.
text: She pours the whiskey.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Nah, I don't know.
text: Mary hands a glass to Stan. She holds hers up in a toast.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Blessed are the forgetful, for they get
dialog: the better even of their blunders.
text: Mary and Stan click glasses.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found
dialog: it my Bartletts.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: That's a good one.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It
dialog: seems really appropriate.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (a little sulky)
dialog: It's a good one all right.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What's your bartlett's?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: It's a quote book.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill.
text: He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's
dialog: about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (trying to engage)
dialog: Yeah. Cool.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: "The quotations when engraved upon the
dialog: memory give you good thoughts."
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Very cool. Trippy.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I like to read what smart people say. So
dialog: many beautiful, important things.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don't you think Howard's like that?
dialog: Smart? Important?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Definitely!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
text: Stan focuses on the monitor. Mary pours herself another
dialog: drink.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Definitely.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It's dark. Joel and Clementine are in bed. The memory is
text: already in the midst of being erased. Clementine is talking
text: in a monotonous, robotic manner.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an
dialog: open book. I tell you everything. Every
dialog: damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No, it isn't that.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I want to know you.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I just don't have anything very
dialog: interesting about my life.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Joel, you're a liar.
text: The scene is faded completely now and Joel just lies there
text: for a moment, registering Clementine's statement.
scene_heading: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Joel and Clementine eat dinner in silence. Joel looks around
text: at other couples in the restaurant. Some seem happy and
text: engaged. Others seem bored with each other. He turns back
text: to his food.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: How's the chicken?
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Is that like us? Are we just bored with
dialog: each other?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Good.
text: He watches her as she downs her wine and pours herself
text: another glass. She holds the wine bottle up to Joel.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: More?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. Thanks.
text: There's a silence.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: How's the fish?
text: The scene is fading.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's good.
text: They continue to eat in silence as the scene dissolves.
speaker_heading: PATRICK'S VOICE
dialog: Hi, Clementine! -- Why, what's wrong? --
dialog: Oh, I'm sorry. -- Well, I'm not sure, I
dialog: kind of have to study for my test --
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Patrick is on the phone next to Joel's bed. Stan watches the
text: lights on the computer screen.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Hold on. Let me ask my friend.
dialog: (covering mouthpiece)
dialog: Stan, can I leave for a little while? My
dialog: girlfriend is very --
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Patrick, we're in the middle of --
speaker_heading: PATRICK
text: She's right in the neighborhood. She's
text: upset.
text: Mary is in the kitchen. She pokes her head out. She's got
text: some pie on a plate.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Let him go, Stan. I can help.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (sighing, to Patrick)
dialog: Go.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Mary hates me.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: I'll be right over, Tangerine.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Candles are lit. Joel and Clementine are under a blanket on
text: the living room rug listening to music.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Joely...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, Tangerine?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: It's my favorite book. Since I was a
dialog: kid. It's about these toys. There's
dialog: this part where the skin Horse tells the
dialog: rabbit what it means to be real.
dialog: (crying)
text: I can't believe I'm crying already. He
dialog: says, "It takes a long time. That's why
dialog: it doesn't often happen to people who
dialog: break easily or have sharp edges, or who
dialog: have to be carefully kept. Generally by
dialog: the time you are Real, most of your hair
dialog: has been loved off, and your eyes drop
dialog: out and you get loose in the joints and
dialog: very shabby. But these things don't
dialog: matter at all, because once you are Real
dialog: you can't be ugly, except to people who
dialog: don't understand."
text: She's weeping. Joel is stroking her hair. They kiss and
text: begin to make love under the blanket. It's sweet and gentle
text: and then it starts to fade.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: No! Jesus, No!
text: He looks down and Clementine's tear-streaked face is fading.
text: She continues as if she's still being made love to, even
text: though Joel is completely beside himself. He jumps up naked
text: and yells at the ceiling.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Please! Please! I've changed my mind!
text: (looks down at fading
text: Clementine, then at ceiling)
dialog: I don't want this. Wake me up! Stop the
dialog: procedure! Plea --
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still. Mary and
text: Stan watch the monitor and smoke a joint. After a silence:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift
dialog: Howard gave the world.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (a sigh)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: To let people begin again. It's
dialog: beautiful. You look at a baby and it's
text: so fresh, so clean, so free. And
dialog: adults... they're like this messy tangle
dialog: of anger and phobias and sadness...
dialog: hopelessness. And Howard just makes it
dialog: go away.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You love him, don't you?
text: Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught. She is silent for
text: a long moment.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Besides, Howard's married, Stan. He's a
dialog: very serious and ethical man. I'm not
dialog: going to tempt him to betray all he
dialog: believes in.
text: Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges
text: through the snow.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears. She's
text: crying. He makes his way up her front stairs. She swings
text: open the door and hugs him.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Oh, baby, what's going on?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
text: I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I
text: feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting
dialog: old and nothing makes any sense to me.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Oh, Tangerine.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes
dialog: any sense.
text: She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come up to Boston with me?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to
dialog: see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
text: She runs into the bedroom. Patrick is at the phone and
text: realizes he doesn't know Joel's number. After a moment's
text: thought, he *69's. The phone rings.
speaker_heading: JOEL'S VOICE
dialog: Hi, it's Joel. Please leave a message
text: after the beep.
dialog: Beep.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Stan, it's Patrick. Pick up.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, where are you?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I got into a situation with the old lady.
dialog: Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm
dialog: really sorry, man.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Stan is on the phone. He's really stoned and watches Mary,
text: stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft
text: and low on the stereo.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I can handle it. He's pretty much on
text: auto-pilot anyway.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
text: Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack. He
text: pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then
text: pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the
text: bedroom door. The handwriting is a woman's. He finds what
text: he's looking for. He reads:
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: I took Joel to walk on Charles River with
dialog: me last night. It was so beautiful and
dialog: charming. Joel was nervous about
dialog: stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to
dialog: please me so much -- he's so sweet --
text: that he came out after me. We lay down
text: right in the center and watched the
dialog: stars. He took my hand and said "I
dialog: could...
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT
text: Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen
text: river. They look up at the stars.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: ...die right now, Clem. I'm just...
dialog: happy. I've never felt that before. I'm
dialog: just exactly where I want to be.
text: Clementine looks over at him. Her eyes are filled with love
text: and tears. Then they get vague. The scene is being erased.
text: Joel is panicked.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Clem, no! This can't keep happening.
dialog: Please! Oh, fuck! Please!
text: Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed
text: scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the
text: beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled
text: cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her
text: sleep, them drinking at a bar. He arrives at a decayed
text: version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: We can help you through this. Why don't
dialog: you start now by telling me everything
dialog: you can remember about --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You have to stop this!
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: What? What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: I'm trapped in my head and everything I
dialog: love is being erased! Stop it now!
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Yes, but... I'm just something you're
dialog: imagining. What can I do? I'm in your
dialog: head, too.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Patrick reads the journal.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: ... and we made love right on the ice.
dialog: It was absolutely freezing on my ass! It
dialog: was wonderful.
text: Clementine enters, dressed for the cold. Patrick puts the
text: notebook away.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm so excited. Yay!
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to
dialog: give you this. It's a little... thing.
text: Patrick pulls the bracelet from his pocket, hands it to her.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
text: I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: It's gorgeous.
dialog: (slipping it on)
dialog: Just my taste. I've never gone out with
dialog: a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I
dialog: liked.
dialog: (kisses him)
dialog: Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Stan and Mary have sex on the floor next to Joel's bed.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
text: Joel and Clementine are hiking, Clementine in front.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Such a beautiful view.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (looking at her)
dialog: Yes indeed.
dialog: (snapping out of memory)
dialog: Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I hired them to. We're in my brain. But
dialog: I want it to stop, before I wake up and
dialog: don't know you anymore.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Wow. Um, well... can't you just force
dialog: yourself awake?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know.
text: He concentrates. Nothing happens.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Aaargh! It's horrible! I'm trapped!
text: He starts to have a fit, banging against trees, stomping his
text: feet, screaming. But even while he's doing this the memory
text: and Clementine are fading around him.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: It's raining out. Joel is reading, slouched in a chair. He
text: looks over at Clementine, stretched out on her belly in her
text: underwear. She's reading, too.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: She's so sexy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I loved you on this day. I love this
dialog: memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
text: Clementine looks over at him, smiles. Her brow furrows in
dialog: thought.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What if you hide me?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (formulating)
dialog: Well... if they're looking for me in
dialog: memories I'm in, what if you take me to a
dialog: memory I'm not in?
dialog: (proud)
dialog: And we can hide there till morning.
text: Joel ponders this. The scene and Clementine are beginning to
text: dissolve. Joel grabs Clementine's hand. She giggles with
text: glee. He pulls her out of the scene as it degrades.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Where? Where? Where?
text: He drags her through the landscape of already decayed
text: memories and turns off into:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: The kitchen is dated and vague. Joel and Clementine are in
text: an oversized playpen; they're adults but small. Joel wears
text: footsie pajamas with some vague little animals on them. He
text: holds a a red furry huckleberry hound doll. Clementine is
text: still in her panties and bra. An oversized woman in high
text: heels, seen from a low angle, hurries back and forth
text: preparing dinner.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Jesus. What's this?
text: Joel looks around at the kitchen, at his doll, at the woman.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I must be about two.
dialog: (oddly)
dialog: I want my mommy. She's busy. She's not
text: looking at me.
dialog: (back to himself, re: doll)
dialog: Look, my Huckleberry Hound doll! I told
dialog: you about this!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want my mommy!
text: He starts to cry. Clementine tries to comfort him. She hugs
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (crying still)
dialog: I want my mommy.
dialog: (adult, to Clementine)
dialog: I don't want to lose you, Clem.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm right here.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't
dialog: want to lose you. I don't want to
dialog: lose...
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading.
dialog: The memory. I think we're hidden.
text: Joel sucks in some snot. His mother scurries back and forth
text: clanging pots. The room is not decaying. Joel smiles.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Stan and Mary lie on the floor, their stoned minds wandering
text: after sex. Stan suddenly perks up. He looks at the monitor.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: It's stopped.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Listen, it's not erasing.
text: He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
text: It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: STAN
text: I don't know. He's not on the map.
text: Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze. He fiddles
text: nervously with the equipment.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know what to do! I don't know
dialog: what to do! Crap. Crap...
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Well, what should we do?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I don't know! I just said that!
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Sor-ry
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We have to do something. He can't wake
text: up half done.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Shit!
text: He jerks the joystick spastically. Mary, also naked, gets up
text: and looks over his shoulder at the screen.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (definitely)
dialog: We should call Howard.
text: Stan turns and looks at her. He's stoned and trying to
dialog: understand her motivation.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: No way. I can handle this.
speaker_heading: MARY
text: This guy's only half cooked. There's no
dialog: time to fuck around, Stan.
text: Stan tries to think. He paces. Mary watches him. Finally:
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (without making eye contact)
dialog: Okay.
text: He dials the phone, waits.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, Howard?
scene_heading: INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The room is dark. A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone.
text: His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Stan? What's going on?
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: The guy we're doing? He's disappeared
text: from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Okay, what happened right before he
dialog: disappeared?
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
text: I was away from the monitor for a second.
dialog: I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Well, where was Patrick?
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
dialog: He went home sick.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Jesus. All right, what's the address.
speaker_heading: STAN'S VOICE
text: 1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E,
dialog: Rockville Center.
text: Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad. He hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: He's coming?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: You better go.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hell no.
text: She starts getting dressed.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit, I'm so stoned. I don't want him to
dialog: see me stoned. Stop being stoned, Mary!
text: She hurries into the bathroom with her bag.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: God, I look like shit! God!
text: Mary slams the bathroom door. Stan puts his head in his
dialog: hands.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Joel and Clementine are in the playpen. Joel's oversized
text: mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the
dialog: head.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: How's my baby boy?
text: She's gone.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I really want her to pick me up. It's
dialog: weird how strong that desire is.
text: Clementine holds his hand. He looks over at her.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You know, we're okay. They're not
dialog: finding us. You'll remember me in the
dialog: morning. And you'll come to me and tell
dialog: me about us and we'll start over.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I loved you so much this day. On my bed
dialog: in your panties. I remember I thought,
dialog: how impossibly lucky am I to have you on
dialog: my bed in your panties.
text: She kisses him.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You remember what happened next?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I came over to the bed and you smelled so
dialog: good, like you just woke up, slightly
text: sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with
dialog: you and you said something like --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: -- another rainy day. Whatever shall we
dialog: do?
text: He laughs. She unbuttons his pajamas. They begin to make
text: love. Joel's mother hurries around the kitchen. Joel stops,
text: looks at Clementine.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: There's this guy!
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: There's this guy. I heard him talking in
dialog: my apartment. He's one of the eraser
dialog: guys. And he fell for you when they were
dialog: erasing you, so he introduced himself the
text: next day as if he were a stranger and now
dialog: you're dating him.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Really? Is he cute?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: He stole a pair of your panties while you
dialog: were being erased!
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Gross! You must remember to tell me this
dialog: in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked
text: out now.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S CAR - NIGHT
text: It's a rust bucket. Clementine drives through the snow.
text: She's crying and holding Patrick's hand.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What's wrong with me?
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Nothing is wrong with you. You're the
dialog: most wonderful person I've ever met.
text: She glances gratefully over at him then starts to cry even
dialog: harder.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Stan works on trying to get the signal back. His hair is
text: combed and he's dressed neatly, looking professional but
text: still stoned. Mary is pacing nervously to and from the
text: window, looking out into the night. She's dressed also, and
text: she's wearing more make-up now. Her hair is pulled up into
text: some sort of style. Suddenly she freezes at the window.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: There he is. Oh my God. Oh my God. Do
dialog: I look okay?
text: She doesn't say anything.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm still stoned. Are you? Crap.
text: She looks in the mirror.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Joel)
dialog: Your Visine didn't do shit, fella.
text: The doorbell buzzes. Mary lunges for the door, then calms
text: herself before opening it. Mierzwiak, holding an equipment
text: bag, looks surprised.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Mary. What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: STAN
text: She came to help, Howard.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I wanted to learn as much about the
dialog: procedure as possible, Howard. I think
dialog: it's important for my job...to help
dialog: comfort the clientele. You know.
text: Mierzwiak looks from Mary to Stan, nods, and enters. Mary
text: closes the door. Mierzwiak crosses to the equipment.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Let's get to the bottom of this. Shall
dialog: we?
text: He sits down in front of the computer and does some fiddling.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
dialog: Odd.
text: He fiddles some more. Mary looks on, fascinated.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I tried that already.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Did you try going through C-Gate?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Yeah. Of course.
text: Mierzwiak ponders. He unzips his equipment bag, pulls out
text: another laptop computer and plugs it in to the system.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I'm going to do a Spectrum search
dialog: throughout his memory, see if anything
text: comes up.
text: Mierzwiak presses some more buttons. The program starts up.
text: A much more complex and detailed human brain appears on this
text: screen. It rotates. Eventually Mierzwiak sees a small
text: distant light in the brain. He zeroes in on it.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, here it is. I don't know why it's
dialog: off the map like that, but --
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized
text: mother. Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing.
text: The mother doesn't seem to see her.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Little baby getting awwwl cleean. Awl
dialog: clean.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (to Clementine)
dialog: I love getting bathed in the sink. It's
dialog: such a feeling of security.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (giggling)
dialog: I've never seen you happier.
text: The elements of the scene flash explosively away: Joel's
text: mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the
text: kitchen, Clementine. Joel is thrown into:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in
text: movie theater. The movie on the giant screen is partially
text: obscured by a fence. Joel and Clementine drink wine.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Okay, we're back in.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That was beautiful to watch, Howard.
text: Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Well, thank you, Mary.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it
dialog: from here.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Yeah, probably a good idea.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what
text: the characters on the screen are saying.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
text: She starts to fade. The scene starts to fade. Joel
dialog: remembers their previous plan.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: They found us before. The plan didn't
dialog: work. I don't know what to do now.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (mouthing to woman on screen)
dialog: Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere
dialog: buried?
text: Joel grabs her. They run off just as the scene decays into a
text: husk behind them.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Stan is back at the controls. Mierzwiak's at the door with
dialog: Mary.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Howard, they've disappeared again.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Oh dear.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired.
text: He nods, distractedly. She smiles to herself as he heads
text: back to the equipment.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON
text: Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed
text: accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school
text: building toward the bike rack. Clementine is with him,
text: dressed as she was in the parked car.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the
dialog: shit out of me.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I'm terrified. I thought if I hung
dialog: around the art room long enough, he'd go
dialog: home and I could get my bike.
text: They head toward the bike rack. Joel's is the only bike
dialog: remaining.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Poor Joel.
text: They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including
text: giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner.
speaker_heading: JOE EARLY
dialog: Hi, Jill.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: He calls me Jill. Everyone calls me Jill
dialog: after this.
text: The other kids laughs.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Just shut up, Joe. I'm going home.
speaker_heading: JOE EARLY
dialog: I don't think so. We're fighting.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't want to fight you.
text: The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..." Joe Early
text: throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side. joel falls
text: and stays down, covering himself.
speaker_heading: JOE EARLY
dialog: C'mon, Jill. Get up, faggot. C'mon.
text: Joel doesn't say anything. He peeks humiliated at
text: Clementine. She's watching him. She's got a tear in her
text: eye. She kneels down beside him, puts her arm around him.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: I'm too scared to even throw a punch.
dialog: When I tell people this story I leave
dialog: that part out.
text: The scene flashes violently to white and is gone.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Mierzwiak is at the machine.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: We got him back. Stan, I think I'm just

dialog: manually. We're running late.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: It's cold. Joel and Clementine walk, all bundled up. She
text: points at a house up the beach.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Our house! Our house!
text: She runs ahead, laughing. The scene is decaying. Joel
text: chases after her.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Clem, c'mon, we've got to hide you.
dialog: Remember?
text: He grabs her arm and yanks and they are in:
scene_heading: INT. BOY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It's dark. Joel, junior high school size, is in bed
text: masturbating. Clementine is in there, too, in her winter
text: coat, still laughing from before. She realizes what's going
dialog: on.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (mock offended)
dialog: Joel!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (continuing to masturbate)
dialog: I don't like it either, but I'm just
dialog: trying to find horrible secret place to --
text: Joel's mother pops her head in the door.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Joel, I was just --
dialog: (sees what's going on)
dialog: Oh. Um... I'll ask you in the morning,
dialog: honey. Have a good night.
text: The mother backs out, closes the door. Joel cringes.
text: Clementine laughs, still in the mode of the memory she was
text: swiped from. Flash! It's all gone.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Joel and Clementine are laughing as she blows out the candle
text: on a slice of cheesecake in front of her. Joel hands her a
text: small wrapped box.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Happy Birthday.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (unwrapping the gift)
dialog: Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
text: She pulls out the bracelet. It's the same bracelet Patrick
dialog: gave her.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, Joel. It's beautiful!
dialog: (slip it on)
dialog: I mean, you're the first guy who ever
dialog: bought me a piece of jewelry I could
dialog: honestly say that about.
text: He notices she's starting to fade.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I scoured the city for it.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I love it!
text: She leans across the table to kiss him. He grabs her and
text: runs through the decaying scene and into the vague night.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY
text: Joel is one of a group of five year olds. He holds a hammer
text: and is poised to hit a dead bird in a red wagon. The other
text: boys are goading him.
speaker_heading: BOYS
dialog: C'mon, Joel, you have to. Do it already.
text: Joel doesn't want to. Clementine watches.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I didn't want to do this. But I had to
dialog: or they would've called me a girl.
text: Joel miserably smashes the bird repeatedly with the hammer.
text: Red jelly guts cover the hammer and the wagon bottom. The
dialog: kids hoot.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I can't believe I did that. I'm so
dialog: ashamed.
text: A live bird watches from a tree. Clementine, still dressed
text: for her birthday dinner (wearing her new bracelet), pulls
text: Joel away from the other boys. The two of them walk down
text: Joel's suburban street.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: It's okay. You were a little kid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is a great birthday present.
dialog: Getting to see you as a boy.
text: She kisses him and they walk holding hands.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: That's where I live. Lived.
text: Joel looks down at her hand. It's fading. The bracelet is
text: gone. Clementine is gone. His childhood house is gone.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Mierzwiak works the equipment. He has located a small area
text: of light in the brain imaging and eradicates them.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I'm getting the hang of it. I still
dialog: understand it. But I'm finding him
dialog: quickly enough. I'm hopeful there won't
dialog: be too much peripheral eradication.
text: Mary sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (a little giggly)
dialog: I like watching you work.
text: Stan sighs, grabs his coat.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I'll go out for a smoke. If no one
dialog: minds.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: That's fine, Stan.
text: Mary doesn't say anything. Stan huffs and is out the door.
text: Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light. Mary
text: gets up her courage to speak.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you like quotes, Howard?
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: How do you mean?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find
dialog: reading them inspirational to me. And in
dialog: my reading I've come across some I
dialog: thought you might like, too.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
text: Mary is thrilled, beside herself. She tries to calm down.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed
dialog: are the forgetful, for they get the
dialog: better even of their blunders."
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Is that Nietzsche?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was
dialog: thinking I could tell you something you
dialog: didn't know.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we
dialog: both know it.
text: He smiles at her. She's flustered, flattered.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (sputtering)
dialog: There's another one I like, I read. It's
dialog: by Pope Alexander.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Alexander Pope?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!
dialog: (puts hand over mouth)
dialog: Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't
dialog: going to say Pope Alexander and sound
dialog: like a dope and then I go ahead and do
dialog: it. Like I psyched myself out.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: It's no big deal.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You are such a sweetheart.
text: There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air.
text: Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the
dialog: blameless Vestal's lot! The world
dialog: forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal
dialog: sunshine of the spotless mind! Each
dialog: prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd".
text: She smiles, proud and embarrassed.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: That's lovely.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Really? I thought it was appropriate
dialog: maybe. That's all.
dialog: (beat, then quickly)
dialog: I really admire the work that you do. I
dialog: know it's not proper to be so familiar
dialog: but I guess since we're outside the
dialog: workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.
dialog: (blurting)
dialog: I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is
dialog: that terrible?
text: Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his
text: unflappable self.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: You're a wonderful girl, Mary.
text: She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I've loved you for a very long time. I'm
dialog: sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (suddenly weepy)
dialog: I wish I was your wife. I wish I had
dialog: your kids.
text: Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug. It turns into kiss. He
text: pulls away.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: We can't do this.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: No you're right. Once again. You're a
dialog: decent man, Howard.
text: He smiles sadly at her. She smiles courageously at him.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I want you to know it's not because I'm
dialog: not interested. If that means anything.
text: They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back
text: to locating and eradicating blips of lights.
scene_heading: EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
text: Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette. He has an
text: unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window. He watches
text: Mierzwiak and Mary. They're talking as Howard works. It
text: appears to be a very serious discussion. A car pulls up
text: outside. Stan turns to see. A middle-aged woman gets out,
text: checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only
text: lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside. Mierzwiak's
text: resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again.
text: This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and
text: falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel. The
text: woman in the window is transfixed. As Mierzwiak fumbles to
text: unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window.
text: He practically shrieks and jumps up.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
text: Joel and Clementine walking, hand-in-hand, look up
dialog: simultaneously.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Mary looks confusedly at Howard.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What?
text: She follows his eyes and sees the woman in the window, who
text: turns and walks off in a huff.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God!
text: Mierzwiak is already in his coat. He's out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
text: The woman is at her car. Stan watches from the van.
text: Mierzwiak is hurrying to the woman.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Hollis! Hollis!
scene_heading: HOLLIS (THE MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN)
dialog: I knew it, Howard. I don't even know why
dialog: I bothered to copy the damn address.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: It didn't start out to be this. I came
dialog: here to work. It's a one-time mistake.
text: Mary is right behind Mierzwiak now. Hollis is in her car.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (heroically)
dialog: Mrs. Mierzwiak, it's true. And it's not
dialog: Mr. Mierzwiak's fault. I'm a stupid
text: little girl with a stupid little crush.
dialog: I basically forced him into it. I swear.
text: Hollis turns, looks at Mary and then at Mierzwiak.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Don't be a monster, Howard. Tell the
dialog: girl.
text: Stan is out of the van now, listening. Mary shivers in the
text: cold, hugs herself. There's a long silence. Then:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Tell me what?
text: Hollis and Mierzwiak have locked eyes. Mary looks back and
text: forth between them. Hollis starts her car.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS
dialog: Poor kid. You can have him. You did.
text: She drives off. Mary watches Howard with increased
text: foreboding.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What, Howard?
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: We... have a history. I'm sorry. You
dialog: wanted the procedure. You wanted it
dialog: done... to get past. I have to finish in
dialog: there. It's almost morning. We'll talk
dialog: later.
text: He shuffles inside. Mary stands there, unable to digest
text: this, struggling in vain to remember. Stan watches.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Let me take you home.
text: Mary shakes her head "no." She walks off, dazed.
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT
text: Clementine and Patrick lie on their backs on the frozen river
text: and look up at the night sky.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: I could die right now, Clem. I'm just
dialog: happy. I've never felt that before. I'm
dialog: just exactly where I want to be.
text: Clementine looks over at him. Their eyes meet. She sobs.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I want to go home.
text: She hurries toward the shore, slips on the ice, gets up, and
text: continues, now running.
scene_heading: INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - NIGHT
text: Mary, in shock, sits in the empty fluorescent car. She tries
text: to look out the window but can only see her own reflection.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It's deathly silent as Mierzwiak and Stan work on completing
text: the job. Mierzwiak locates a light hidden very deep in the
text: map of Joel's brain. He targets it.
scene_heading: EXT. ROWBOAT - DAY
text: Joel, the size of a ten year old, sits fishing with his
text: oversized father. Clementine is naked and in the boat, too.
text: She's reading The Play by Stephen Dixon.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I love this book, Joel. Thank you so
dialog: much for telling me about it.
text: Joel is his father. The father is drunk and sullen. He
text: faces away from Joel, looks out at the lake.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Don't be like me, son. Don't waste your
dialog: life. You'll come to a point someday
dialog: where it'll be too late. You'll be sewn
dialog: into your fate...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It was horrifying, seeing my father like
dialog: that.
dialog: There was no hope for me if his life was
dialog: such a failure. And he saw failure in
dialog: me, too, written in my future.
text: Clementine watches the frightened, confused Joel.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Joel, you're not sewn in. He's wrong.
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: ...and there'll be nowhere to go except
dialog: where you're headed, like a train on a
text: track. Inevitable, unalterable.
text: The scene poops out of existence with a flash of light.
scene_heading: INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Joel finds himself eating Chinese food and sitting across
text: from Clementine. He is ragged and jarred.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride
text: it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I want to enjoy my little time left with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: This is our first "date" date.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Do you remember what we talked about?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Naomi, I guess.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What was I wearing?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: God, I should know. Your hair was red.
dialog: I remember it matched the wallpaper.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Egad, were you horrified?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No! I think you were wearing that black
dialog: dress, y'know, with the buttons.
text: She is wearing the black dress.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No, you were with me when I bought that.
dialog: At that place on East 6th. It was later.
scene_heading: INT. DRESS SHOP - SHOP
text: The scene has already been erased. It's just a decayed husk.
text: A vague Joel watches a vague Clementine model a black dress.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Clementine wears a generic black dress now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: Right. Something black though.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'll buy that. Black's always good.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: We did talk about Naomi.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sure, I said.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: But you weren't. I could tell.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't
dialog: think of anything to say. There were
text: long silences.
text: There is a long silence.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd
dialog: mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: So what. Infatuation is good, too.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: And I didn't have an argument.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Joel and Clementine pull up to Clementine's house.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I dropped you off after. You said --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (Mae West)
dialog: Come up and see me... now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's very late.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel and Clementine are in the midst of awkward shy sex.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: This was our first time.
text: The scene starts to fade. Joel watches Clementine disappear.
scene_heading: INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT
text: Mary enters the dark room, frazzled. She flips on the
text: fluorescent lights and searches the file folders, finds one
text: with her name on it. Her jaw drops. With a shaky hand, she
text: puts the tape into the player on her desk and presses "play."
scene_heading: MIERZWIAK VOICE
dialog: Okay, so just tell me what you remember.
dialog: And we'll take it from there.
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE
dialog: (shaky)
dialog: Um, I liked you immediately. At the job
dialog: interview. You seemed so... important
dialog: and mature. And I loved that you were
dialog: helping all these people. You didn't
dialog: come on to me at all. I liked that. I
dialog: was tongue-tied around you at first. I
dialog: wanted you to think I was smart. You
dialog: were so nice. I loved the way you
dialog: smelled. I couldn't wait to come to
dialog: work. I had these fantasies of us being
dialog: married and having kids and just...
dialog: (starts to cry)
dialog: ...and so... then... when...
dialog: that one day, when I thought you looked
dialog: at me back... like... Oh, Howie, I can't
dialog: do this? How can I do this?
scene_heading: MIERZWIAK VOICE
dialog: It's what's best, Mary. You know that.
text: Mary slumps to the floor. We move into her eyes.
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah, I know. Oh, God. Okay, well, I
dialog: was so excited...
text: A SERIES OF MURKY IMAGES. NO DETAIL.
text: A flirtatious look from Mierzwiak.
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...Remember you bought me that little
dialog: wind-up frog?
text: A vague shot of a wind-up frog.
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: And you said...
text: A vague shot of Mierzwiak mouthing to Mary's voice.
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: "This is for your desk. Just a little
dialog: token"
text: Back to Mary sitting on the floor, listening to the tape.
speaker_heading: MARY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew then... I knew something was going
dialog: to happen... something wonderful.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel sits in the quiet living room. The scene is fading.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Naomi.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
text: On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered
dialog: if I had made a terrible mistake. I
text: almost reached for the phone about a
dialog: thousand times. I thought I could take
dialog: it back, erase it, explain I had
dialog: momentarily lost my mind. Then I told
dialog: myself we weren't happy. That was the
dialog: truth. That what we were was safe.
dialog: It was unfair to you and to me to stay in
dialog: a relationship for that reason. I
dialog: thought about Clementine and the spark
dialog: when I was with her, but then I thought
dialog: what you and I had was real and adult and
dialog: therefore significant even if it wasn't
dialog: much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw
dialog: other people having fun and I wanted it.
dialog: Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one
dialog: is really having fun; I'm being suckered
dialog: by advertising and movie bullshit... then
dialog: I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then
dialog: I thought, as I always do at this point
dialog: in my argument, about dying.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - DAY
text: An elderly man sits.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I projected myself to the end of my life
dialog: in some vague rendition of my old man
text: self. I imagined looking back with a
text: tremendous hole of regret in my heart.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Joel sits.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I didn't pick up the phone to call you,
text: Naomi. I didn't pick up the phone.
text: The scene dissolves.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Namoi is red-eyed from crying. She is packing things in
text: boxes. Joel paces, steals glances at her, doesn't know what
text: to say. She holds up a book. The scene starts to fade.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Yours?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You take it. I don't know.
text: She tosses it in a box.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Naomi, I really value our relationship.
dialog: I hope it's possible for us to stay in
dialog: touch.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Joel watches out the window as Naomi stuffs a final box in
text: the trunk of a car. There's another woman down there with
text: her. They get into the car and drive off.
scene_heading: INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
text: Joel talks to Clementine. The scene is fogging over.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I told her today I need to end it.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Is that what you want?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I did it. I guess that means something.
text: Clementine shrugs. The scene fades.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
text: Joel walks with Naomi.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: So what's going on, Joel?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know, I've just been thinking,
dialog: maybe we're not happy with each other.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort
dialog: of, unhappy with each other and --
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I think maybe, we're both so used to
dialog: operating at this level that -- How can
dialog: one person be unhappy? If one person is
dialog: unhappy, both have to be... by
dialog: definition.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No. I just need some space, maybe.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you
dialog: think you have with this chick, once the
dialog: thrill wears off, you're just going to be
dialog: Joel with the same fucking problems.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's not somebody else.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I hate myself.
text: Naomi walks off. Joel watches her. The scene fades.
scene_heading: INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
text: Joel enters, looks around. There's no sign of Clementine.

speaker_heading: JOEL

scene_heading: MALE EMPLOYEE #1
dialog: (calling to another male
dialog: employee)
dialog: Mark, is Clem on tonight?
scene_heading: MALE EMPLOYEE #2
dialog: On my dick, bro.
dialog: (turns, sese Joel, embarrassed)
dialog: Oh, hey. Yeah, I think she's upstairs in
dialog: Philosophy.
text: Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi.
text: She turns.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I didn't think you'd show your face
dialog: around me again. I figured you were
dialog: humiliated. You did run away, after all.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Sorry to track you down like this. I'm
dialog: not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (seemingly uninterested)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'd like to... take you out or something.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Well, you're married.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: Not yet. Not married.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Look, man, I'm telling you right off the
dialog: bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not
dialog: going to tiptoe around your marriage or
dialog: whatever it is you got going there. If
dialog: you want to be with me, you're with me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: So make your domestic decisions and maybe
dialog: we'll talk again.
text: She goes back to stacking. Joel stands there helplessly.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I just think that you have some kind
dialog: of... quality that seems really important
dialog: to me.
text: The scene is disintegrating. Clementine's speech is
text: delivered without passion.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to
dialog: just keep that in your head. Too many
dialog: guys think I'm a concept or I complete
dialog: them or I'm going to make them alive, but
dialog: I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking
dialog: for my own peace of mind. Don't assign
dialog: me yours.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I remember that speech really well.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I had you pegged, didn't I?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You had the whole human race pegged.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Probably.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I still thought you were going to save
dialog: me. Even after that.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It would be different, if we could just
dialog: give it another go around.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we
dialog: can.

speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER

speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Hi, Rob and Carrie.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Go back to sleep.
text: The room is starting to decompose.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: In a minute.
text: Naomi turns over. Joel goes back to his writing.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: (more and more emotionless)
dialog: I don't know what to do about this. I've
dialog: been feeling so alienated and numb
dialog: lately. Forever. The thought of not
dialog: acknowledging my feelings again seems
dialog: self-destructive.
dialog: How can I continue on this path toward a
text: living death, a life filled with
dialog: obligation and guilt and responsibility
dialog: but joyless, hopeless? I need to speak
dialog: with Clementine.
text: The scene has turned to a husk.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
text: Joel is at his closet, putting on a sweater. Naomi is at the
text: dining room table, papers spread out before her, writing.
text: Joel turns and watches her for a moment.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: So you don't mind?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
text: The scene is fading.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay. I wish you could come.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: This is it. The night we met. My God,
text: it's over.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Me, too.
text: He approaches Naomi, kisses her on the top of the head. She
dialog: continues to write.
speaker_heading: NAOMI (CONT'D)
dialog: Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I hope you get your work done.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: (sighing)
dialog: Yeah.
scene_heading: INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT
text: Rob drives. Carrie fiddles with the radio dial in the front
text: passenger seat. Joel sits in the back.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You
dialog: okay? You seem quiet.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Just a little overworked, maybe.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: The trip to the party where I met
dialog: Clementine. My first memory of her is
dialog: now my last memory of her.
text: Joel looks out the window. Carrie turns around and says
text: something to Joel. She is backlit, her hair a halo of frizz.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I remember you turned around. Your face
dialog: was dark and your hair was backlit -- I
dialog: could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me
dialog: if things were okay between Naomi and me.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I did. You said, things were fine.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I remember.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: This is the night you met Clementine,
dialog: Joel. I remember watching you walk down
dialog: the beach with her and I thought, oh
dialog: shit.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, you told me that later.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I told you that later.
text: Joel looks out he window. He sees the husk of a memory on
text: the darkened roadside. It's Joel and Carrie in:
scene_heading: INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Faded. Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Who was the girl you walked off with?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: No one.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a
text: small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Is this the right way?
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER
text: Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire
text: down the beach. People and music can be heard.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - LATER
text: Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his
text: lap. People warm themselves at the fire. Joel watches
text: couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You were down by the surf. I could just
dialog: make you out in the dark.
text: Joel looks down to the water. There's Clementine, in her
text: orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Your back to me. In that orange
dialog: sweatshirt I would come to know so well
dialog: and even hate eventually. At the time I
dialog: thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I remember being drawn to you even then.
dialog: I thought, I love this woman because
text: she's alone down there looking out at the
text: black ocean.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: But I went back to my food. The next
dialog: thing I remember, I felt someone sitting
text: next to me and I saw the orange sleeve
text: out of the corner of my eye.
text: A shot of the orange sleeve. Joel looks up.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Hi there.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I was so nervous. What were you doing
dialog: there, I wondered. Your hair was lime
dialog: green. Green revolution.
text: A shot of her green hair.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You said...
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I saw you sitting over here. By
dialog: yourself. I thought, thank God, someone
dialog: normal, who doesn't know how interact at
dialog: these things either.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I can't tell you how happy I am to hear
dialog: that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy
dialog: you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm
dialog: such a loser. Every time I come to a
dialog: party I tell myself I'm going to be
dialog: different and it's always exactly the
dialog: same and then I hate myself after for
dialog: being such a clod.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Even then I didn't believe you entirely.
dialog: I thought how could you be talking to me
dialog: if you couldn't talk to people?
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: But I thought, I don't know, I thought it
dialog: was cool that you were sensitive enough
dialog: to know what I was feeling and that you
dialog: were attracted to it.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal
dialog: ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of
dialog: people do well at this stuff?
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: And I just liked you so much.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You did? You liked me?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You know what I did.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You said --
text: She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of
dialog: your chicken?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: And you picked it out of my plate before
dialog: I could answer and it felt so intimate
dialog: like we were already lovers.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I remember --
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: The grease on your chin in the bonfire
text: light.
text: Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh God, how horrid.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm Joel.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: No, it was lovely.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You mean, like...
dialog: (singing)
dialog: Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my
dialog: darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry
dialog: Hound? That sort of thing?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah, like that.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when
dialog: I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound
dialog: doll. I think your name is magic.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (eyes welling)
dialog: This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What do we do?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
text: She nods.
text: Joel and Clementine are walking near the surf.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So you're still on the Zoloft?
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: Next thing I remember we were walking
text: down near the surf.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel
text: like I was being artificially modulated.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I know what you mean. That's why I
dialog: stopped.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: But my sleeping is really fucked up.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't think I've slept in a year.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a
dialog: chemical and all, but it works... and it
dialog: works just having it around, knowing that
dialog: it's there. Like insurance.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: yeah?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'll give you a couple. See what you
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I love her.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Really? Me, too! I don't meet people
dialog: who even know who she is and I work in a
dialog: book store.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I think she's great.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Me too. There's this poem --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Did this conversation come before or
dialog: after we saw the house?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I think, before.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Seems too coincidental that way.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah, maybe.
text: Joel and Clementine wander near some beach houses closed for
dialog: the winter.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside
dialog: gusts of wind,/And a house in which we
dialog: don't live...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is
dialog: someone in this world to whom I could
dialog: send all these lines"?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my
dialog: heart. I'm so excited you know it.
dialog: (pointing to houses)
dialog: Look, houses in which we don't live.
text: Joel chuckles appreciatively.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish we did. You married?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Um, no.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Let's move into this neighborhood.
text: Clementine tries one of the doors on a darkened house. Joel
text: is nervous.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I do sort of live with somebody though.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh.
text: She walks to the next house, tries the door.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Male or female?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Female.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: At least I haven't been barking up the
dialog: wrong tree.
text: She finds a window that's unlatched. She lifts it.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
text: It's freezing out here.
text: She scrambles in the window. Joel looks around, panicked.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Clementine.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I couldn't believe you did that. I was
text: paralyzed with fear.
text: The front door opens and Clementine stands there beckoning.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's
dialog: coming here tonight, believe me. This
text: place is closed up. Electricity's off.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
text: He walks cautiously toward the door.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: As soon as you walked in. I knew I had
dialog: you. You knew I knew that, right?
scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Joel enters the darkened and Clementine closes the door
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I knew.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I knew by your nervousness that Naomi
dialog: wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to
text: criminally trespass.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: It's dark.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Naomi.
text: She's searching through drawers for something. She pulls out
text: a flashlight, shines it in Joel's face.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles,
text: matches, and the liquor cabinet.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I think we should go.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: No, it's our house! Just tonight --
dialog: (looking at envelope on
dialog: counter)
dialog: -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which
dialog: one do you want to be? I prefer to be
dialog: Ruth but I'm flexible.
dialog: (opens cabinet)
dialog: Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going
text: find the bedroom and slip into something
dialog: more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
text: She runs upstairs, giggling. The room is drying out, turning
text: into a husk.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (calling after her)
dialog: I really should go. I really need to
dialog: catch my ride.
speaker_heading: VOICE-OVER
dialog: I didn't want to go. I was too nervous.
dialog: I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you
dialog: were exciting. You called from upstairs.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (flat)
dialog: So go.
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: I did. I walked out the door. I felt
dialog: like I was a scared little kid. I
dialog: thought you knew that about me. I ran
text: back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my
dialog: humiliation. You said, "so go" with such
text: disdain.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (poking her head downstairs)
dialog: What if you stay this time?
speaker_heading: JOEL
text: I walked out the door. There's no more
dialog: memory.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Come back and make up a good-bye at
dialog: least. Let's pretend we had one.
text: Clementine comes downstairs, vague and robotic, making her
text: way through the decaying environment.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Bye, Joel.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I love you.
text: She smiles. They kiss. It fades.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I --
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: Joel finds himself hurrying back to the bonfire. This scene,
text: too, is disintegrating. It dries up and Joel is just
text: standing there on a faded beach at night, the bonfire frozen
text: in the distance like a photograph.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: Joel sits in the back seat, Rob and Carrie are in the front.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Did you have fun?
text: Joel nods glumly.
text: Carrie continues to talk, but her voice goes under as Joel
text: studies the faded husks of memories, piled like refuse
text: outside the moving car window. He sees dried-out version of
text: previous interactions with Clementine playing out in loops.
text: He looks back and sees the memory of his ride home from the
text: beach with Rob and Carrie. It, too, is decaying. Soon all
text: has crumbled into dust. Everything goes black.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
text: Howard watches the monitor. The last specks of light are
text: fading. It grows dark. He is tired, his eyes are hollow.
text: He turns to Stan, who is staring out the window at the dawn.
speaker_heading: HOWARD
dialog: Okay.
text: Stan turns and wordlessly begins the clean-up. He pulls the
text: electrodes off of Joel's scalp, coils cable, packs bags.
text: Howard dials the bedside phone. He waits as it rings.
speaker_heading: HOLLIS'S VOICE
dialog: Hi, you've reached the Mierzwiaks. We
dialog: can't come to --
text: Howard hangs up.
scene_heading: EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING
text: Stan and Howard load the last of the equipment into the back
text: of the van. He and Howard look at each other.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: So, I've got to drop the van off.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
scene_heading: INT. PATRICK'S CAR - EARLY MORNING
text: Patrick and Mary are heading home from Boston. Mary is
text: silent and depressed. Patrick tries to break the silence.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You want to stop for coffee or something?
text: Mary shakes her head "no." Long silence.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, it was sure beautiful on that
dialog: river. Thanks for sharing it with me.
text: Mary doesn't say anything. Silence.
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Well do it again soon.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNING
text: Stan pulls the van into space marked "Lacuna." He gets out,
text: crosses to his car. Mary is sitting on the hood.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you swear you didn't know?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I swear.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And you never even suspected? Never saw
dialog: us behaving in any unusual way together?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Once, maybe.
text: She watches him closely, waiting for him to continue.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
text: It was here. At his car. I was coming
dialog: back from a job and spotted you together.
dialog: You seemed caught. I waved. You
dialog: giggled.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: How did I look?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (beat)
text: Happy. Happy with a secret.
text: Mary starts to cry.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: And after that?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I never saw you together like that again.
dialog: So I figured I was imagining things.
text: Mary says nothing.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I really like you, Mary. You know that.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you remember anything else? What I
dialog: was wearing? Was I standing close to
dialog: him? Was I leaning against his car like
dialog: I owned it? How did he look at me when I
dialog: giggled? Tell me everything.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: You were in red. That red sweater with
dialog: the little flowers, I think. You were
text: leaning against his car.
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: He looked a little like a kid. Kind of
text: goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him
dialog: look like that before. Happy. You
dialog: looked beautiful. You looked in love.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (heading toward the levator)
dialog: Thanks, Stan.
text: She stops but doesn't turn to face him.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're nice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I love him. I knew I loved him. Now
dialog: I know.
text: He nods. She waves, heads to the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Joel awakens. The apartment is neat, like when he went to
text: sleep. He gets out of bed and heads into the bathroom.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING
text: Joel waits on the crowded platform. The platform across the
text: tracks is empty. Joel's train arrives. It's packed. He
text: squeezes on with all the other commuters.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Joel works in his cubicle over the light table. He seems
text: distracted. He dials his phone. He's nervous.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi... Naomi? Yeah, hi! How are you? I
dialog: know, I know. It's been a long time.
dialog: Not too much. You? Oh, that's great!
dialog: Congratulations! Maybe I could buy you
dialog: dinner to celebrate? Tonight? I'm free.
dialog: Okay, good!
scene_heading: INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY
text: Mary does paperwork at her desk. She looks through her
text: reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with
text: their bags of stuff.
scene_heading: INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits. He hangs up. Mary
text: enters with the papers.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I need this signed, Howard.
text: He takes it, unable to make eye contact. He signs it, hands
dialog: it back.
speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So... do we talk about this... or what?
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary.
dialog: I want to do the right thing here.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Do you love me? Did you love me?
text: Something. I listened to my tape. I
dialog: can't believe I've been sitting right in
dialog: front of it for a year. It's like
dialog: listening to someone else's story. I
dialog: mean, I hear myself talking about having
dialog: sex with you and I can't even imagine you
dialog: naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I have a family, Mary.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You made me have an abortion.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: It was a mutual decision.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: You made me have you erased! I loved
dialog: you. I love you! How could you --
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I didn't make you. You thought it best.
dialog: (off her stare)
dialog: But, look, I take full responsibility.
text: She looks at him for a long while. Then, out of frustration,
text: she screams.
scene_heading: INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Joel sits across from Naomi.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: (oddly cautious)
dialog: So... you haven't been involved with
dialog: anyone in all this time?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's been a pretty lonely couple of
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Well, it was my fault -- the break-up.
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both
dialog: ways. We were taking each other for
dialog: granted and --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I miss you.
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Miss you, too.
dialog: (awkward pause)
dialog: I have been seeing someone for a little
dialog: while.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (trying for enthusiasm)
dialog: Oh! Great. That's great!
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: A religion instructor at Columbia. A
dialog: good guy. He's a good guy.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I'm glad you called.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex. There are certain
dialog: sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost
text: immediately. She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way
text: that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to
text: him. They finish and lie there.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: So you think the dissertation will get
dialog: published?
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: I don;t know. I'm not sure there's a big
dialog: public demand for books on Calvinism and
dialog: Misogyny.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Clementine lies in bed with Patrick.
scene_heading: EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING

text: the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the
text: empty platform. An almost empty train pulls into that
text: platform. Joel gets on the train and watches the business
text: commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of
dialog: the station.
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING
text: Mary gets out of bed. She has been crying all night. She's
text: a wreck. She puts on some coffee then crosses into the

text: onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in. She

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Tomorrow?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: NAOMI'S VOICE

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: NAOMI'S VOICE

speaker_heading: JOEL

speaker_heading: NAOMI'S VOICE

speaker_heading: NAOMI'S VOICE
dialog: That's me.
speaker_heading: JOEL

dialog: Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall
dialog: back into this fast without considering
dialog: the problems we had...
speaker_heading: NAOMI
dialog: Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I had a good time last night. I really

speaker_heading: NAOMI

speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I just walked in.

dialog: Hmmm. Do you miss me?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Oddly enough, I do.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that
dialog: means we're married.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I guess so.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
scene_heading: EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT
text: Clementine steps out onto it. Joel follows nervously.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Don't worry. It's really solid this time
dialog: of year.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know.
text: She takes his hand and he is suddenly imbued with confidence.
speaker_heading: JOEL (CONT'D)
dialog: This is so beautiful.
text: She squeezes his hand.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Isn't it?
text: She runs and slides on the ice. Joel is by himself now.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know. What if it breaks?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: What if?
text: Clementine lies on her back and stares up at the stars. Joel
text: is paralyzed. He looks back at the shore.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I think I should go back.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Joel, come here. Please.
text: He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her. She
text: reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down. He lies on
text: his back beside her, their bodies touching. He wants to turn
text: to her, but out of shyness, doesn't. She holds his hand.
text: They look up at the stars. She smiles, doesn't say anything
text: and snuggles closer to him.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Listen, did you want to make love?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Make love?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Have sex. Y'know --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Oh, um...
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Because I just am not drunk enough or
dialog: stoned enough to make that happen right
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: That's okay. I --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that.
dialog: This seems like the perfect romantic
dialog: exotic place to do it and --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Hey, Joel --
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: -- and I'm just too nervous around you
dialog: right now.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I'm nervous, too.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Well, you obviously don't know me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm nervous because I have and enormous
dialog: crush on you.
text: She smiles up at the sky.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Show me which constellations you know.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila
text: envelopes. One by one they open the envelopes and pull out
text: tapes. We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as
text: people listen to their tapes.
scene_heading: EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Joel drops Clementine off. She kisses him.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: Joel enters with his mail. He opens a manila envelope, reads
text: the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo,
text: listens. Joel dials the phone.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Did you send this? Is it a joke?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: I probably got the same thing as you.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've
dialog: met you. Who would even know to do this?
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: (matter of fact)
text: Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on
text: the tape.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That's what you have to say? How could
dialog: it be true? I never even heard of any
dialog: procedure like this. It's a joke.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Maybe. Call someone who'd know.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone.
text: We hear over and over: "Is this true?", "Did this really
dialog: happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?"
scene_heading: INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Carrie is on the phone. She pauses nervously, then speaks:
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yes, Joel. It is true. We weren't
dialog: supposed to say anything. They say it's
text: like waking a sleepwalker.
scene_heading: INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Joel hangs up. He dials the phone.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: It's true.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
text: Joel is immersed in the several page document.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Look, I have to go. I have to think.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: Joel, we've fucked. We've made love.
dialog: Like a million times. And we were so
text: sweet and shy and inept with each other
dialog: last night. Isn't that lovely?
text: Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers. He just
text: stands there dumbly.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come over here, sweetheart. Please.
scene_heading: INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Joel and Clementine review their separate Lacuna packages
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Says you were closed off, non
dialog: communicative, never told me what you
dialog: were feeling.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Says you were a bully...
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: A bully? Moi?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: That's what it says. You drank too much,
dialog: you picked on me for being passive and
text: timid.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Says you were jealous and suspicious.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Says you would sometimes disappear all
dialog: night, then brag to me about your sexual
dialog: conquests.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or
dialog: is that your way of putting it.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Doesn't sound like me.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Says you were a slob, leaving trails of
dialog: panties and dirty socks in your wake.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Says you were constantly calling me a
dialog: slob.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: It's sexy that we were like a married
text: couple, griping and overly-familiar and
dialog: bored. Don't you think?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: (considering)
dialog: I sort of do. But I only see it as a
dialog: fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up
dialog: enough to be erotic.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
text: She smiles at nervous Joel.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know my body like the back of your
dialog: hand.
text: She unbuttons her blouse.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
text: Every curve, every freckle.
text: She takes off her shirt. He stares at her. He has clearly
dialog: never seen this body before.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You're so beautiful.
text: She approaches him, kisses him, his arms wrap around her
text: waist for the first time.
scene_heading: INT. LACUNA LTD. WAITING ROOM - MORNING
text: Stan enters the waiting room, now crowded with people holding
text: their files, a stunned-looking lot. There is a new woman in
text: the reception window. The file cases behind her are bare.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I work here. I used to work here. Stan.
dialog: Please just tell Howard I'm here to clean

speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Mr. Mierzwiak, Stan is here to -- Yes
dialog: sir.
dialog: (to Stan)
dialog: He says he needs to see you.
scene_heading: INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Stan enters. Mierzwiak is pale and pacing.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: She should not have done this, Stan. As
dialog: mad as she was... as justifiably --
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I don't know what you're talking about,
dialog: Howard.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: Mary has stolen our files and is sending
dialog: them back to people.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Jesus.
text: Mierzwiak turns up the volume on a small video monitor
text: looking in on the lab, where Patrick has clearly taken over
text: Stan's position. He is in the process of interviewing a sad
text: young woman.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: ... so I called everybody I know and
dialog: asked them to tell me everything. Now I
dialog: know my entire history with him, but it's
dialog: in the form of a story, I'm losing my
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: This is why people must never be told.
dialog: It's like waking a --
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: I don't know what to do. Before I
dialog: thought I was depressed for no reason.
dialog: Now it's like I've been assigned a
dialog: reason.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: This never should've happened, ma'am.
dialog: We'll take care of it.
speaker_heading: MIERZWIAK
dialog: I know you don't like me much, Stan, but
dialog: please talk to Mary. She of all people
dialog: should know this is a dangerous thing
dialog: she's doing.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - DAY
text: Joel works over his light box. His phone rings.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Hi, it's Joel.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I
dialog: can till I can see you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: You must have been crazy.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: Guess what I'm wearing.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I don't know. Panties and --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE'S VOICE
dialog: Your dried cum.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: You're still excited by my irreverence.
dialog: You haven't yet started to think of it as
dialog: my "gratuitous need to shock."
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: I can't stop thinking about you.
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
speaker_heading: JOEL
dialog: What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
speaker_heading: CLEMENTINE
dialog: I just wanted to say that. Come by my
dialog: house.
scene_heading: INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What do you want, Stan?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Can I... I brought some --
text: She steps aside for Stan to enter. He does, looks around,
text: sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor.
speaker_heading: STAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I know what it is.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Then why did you ask me?
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: I don't know. I just -- there are a lot
dialog: of really confused people showing up at
dialog: the office.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: They have a right to know. Howard is a
text: thief. He steals the truth.
dialog: (suddenly weeping)
dialog: I can't remember my baby! I can't
dialog: remember my baby. It existed and I can't
dialog: even remember. Do you understand that?
text: Stan doesn't know what to say. He stands there dumbly. Mary
text: slumps into a ball on a chair.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: I won't allow it. Those who cannot
dialog: remember the past are condemned to repeat
dialog: it. What do you think of that? That's
dialog: from my quote book.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: The office is filled with people who want
text: their memories re-erased.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (hysterically)
dialog: Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Mary... please. This is hurting people.
dialog: Long pause, then:
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: (small)
dialog: I don't want to hurt people.
dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: But these things happened! All these
dialog: little sadnesses, the big ones. What if
dialog: no one remembers? What does that do to
dialog: the world?
dialog: (beat, quietly)
dialog: Someone has to remember, Stan.
text: They look at each other.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: SAD WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: I was by myself in the park because my

dialog: a swing. There was this smiling man
dialog: walking a little bushy dog --
text: Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash.
speaker_heading: SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: The man said something like, "He's

text: Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the
dialog: woman's.
speaker_heading: SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
dialog: "-- he won't bite."
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: He won't bite. You can pet him if you

scene_heading: INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY

speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
dialog: I'm here for Dr. Mierzwiak. My name is
dialog: Helene Kernfeld.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, please have a seat. The doctor will

speaker_heading: MARY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SAD WOMAN'S VOICE

text: A soldier on a battlefield looking at his slaughtered

text: A couple fighting, from the woman's point of view.
speaker_heading: MAN

scene_heading: INT. COMMUTER TUBE - DAY
text: The old woman and her chair lift out of the line of
text: commuters.
scene_heading: INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY
text: It's modern and well-appointed. The old woman enters, sits
text: behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the
text: drawer. She takes some pills with water. An old man
text: enters.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: How are you today, Mary?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (MARY)
dialog: Let's see... Still dying, Howard.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (HOWARD)
dialog: You don't have to jump down my throat. I
dialog: was trying to be nice.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (MARY)
dialog: Well, don't try. It's unbecoming on you.
text: Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back.
text: Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc,
text: places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and
text: listens, somewhat wearily but attentively. We watch the
text: color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording.
text: Another old woman enters the office. Old Mary looks up,
text: seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (MARY) (CONT'D)
dialog: May I help you?
speaker_heading: SECOND OLD WOMAN
dialog: I'd like to make an appointment.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (MARY)
dialog: I think the doctor is free this morning.

scene_heading: INT. OLD MAN'S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

dialog: second old woman.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (MARY)
dialog: Dr. Mierzwiak, this is Clementine

speaker_heading: OLD MAN (HOWARD)
dialog: Hello, Ms. Kruczynski. Nice to meet you.
dialog: Please have a seat.
text: He indicates a sitting area. She sits. He joins her.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you mind if I tape our discussion?
text: She shakes her hear. He punches a couple of buttons on his
text: computer console. A tape recorder starts up and his computer
text: screen lights up so only he can see it. On it we see a whole
dialog: file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of
dialog: previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them
dialog: involving Joel Barish.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D)
dialog: So, why don't you begin by telling me why

speaker_heading: SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE)
dialog: Well, I met this man, Joel, three years
dialog: ago at a senior dance... We'd both been

scene_heading: INT. TUBE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)

text: An old man and the second old woman eat breakfast.
speaker_heading: SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
dialog: -- I said something like we should go

speaker_heading: SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
speaker_heading: (CONT'D)
text: He just stared at me as if I didn't

speaker_heading: SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.)
dialog: -- his eyes used to be so filled with
dialog: love. But it was gone. How can I go

scene_heading: INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
