dialog: Mickey was in here,.you and him were
dialog: arguin' with me, and I want to make
dialog: my point clear. You didn't give
dialog: me a chance last time. Now, I agree
dialog: that when it came to singin' and makin'
dialog: albums and performing, Elvis was
dialog: king. But I'm sorry, as a actor,
dialog: the guy was a lost cause.
speaker_heading: CLARENCE
dialog: Elvis was a great actor. He just
dialog: made some shitty movies.
speaker_heading: BILL

dialog: great actor. Michael Caine's a
dialog: great actor. Gene Hackman's a great
dialog: actor. You put Elvis up with those
dialog: guys?
speaker_heading: CLARENCE

dialog: about is the first movies he made
dialog: like “Jailhouse Rock” .-- which is
dialog: one of Mickey's all time favorites --
dialog: “Lovin' You", “King Creole", “Flaming
dialog: Star." He was so natural, so sexy,
dialog: so Elvis. He couldda been so great
dialog: He had a wonderful natural quality
dialog: about him. What fucked him up?
dialog: "Blue Hawaii.” That was the first
dialog: of the quote “Elvis Presley movies.”
dialog: Elvis singin' a bunch of lame songs
dialog: every minute. No story. Justa .
dialog: real dog shit movie all around. But the
dialog: fuckin' thing was a hit. So asshole
dialog: Tom Parker said, “Well, that's what
dialog: the people want.” So, any chance
dialog: of Elvis growing as an actor, vworkin'
dialog: with good directors and good scripts
dialog: got shot to hell. Then they did
text: “Kissin' Cousins” and they found out
dialog: they could crank ‘em out in thirteen
dialog: days. So, that's why ya had a
dialog: Elvis movie out every Christmas
dialog: and every summer.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Yeah, I remember every Christmas
dialog: and summer a new Elvis and Jerry
dialog: Lewis movie would come out. And
dialog: I'd keep goin' hoping they'd be

dialog: like that, too. There was never
dialog: any doubt in my mind if he got
dialog: himself some good material, and put
dialog: out one good album, he'd be right
text: back on top. As big as he ever
dialog: was. I knew it, and so did everyone

dialog: album was all it wouldda took. I
text: had a picture of him on the wall.

dialog: let alone one night. And what's
dialog: with this everyone seein' me naked
dialog: in the shower shit? You know, I

dialog: this . . . If you hadn't accidently
dialog: bumped me and knocked me into that
dialog: fat girl's banana split, there
dialog: wouldn't have been a diversion. If

text: sneak up behind him and slug him
text: with the gumball machine. That left
