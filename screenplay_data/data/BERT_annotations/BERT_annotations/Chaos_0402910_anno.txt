scene_heading: A1 EXT. PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT A1
text: CLOSE ON... A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET
dialog: BRIDGE."
text: ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
text: control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.
text: It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain. IN
text: THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: 1 EXT. PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT 1
text: THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and
text: FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.
text: POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
text: a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...
text: The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
text: bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
text: holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
text: his body. His left holds a GUN!
text: Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man. ONLY SEE THE
text: DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.
text: A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
text: burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
dialog: camera...
speaker_heading: KAREN CROSS
text: ... Police on scene are approaching
text: the suspect. They're at the center of
dialog: the Bridge now.
text: The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives. The
text: Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: SUDDENLY... THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING
dialog: OUT!
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 2.
speaker_heading: KAREN CROSS (OS)
dialog: We have shots fired. Shots have been

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: 2 INT. LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT 2
text: A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
text: HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
text: watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
dialog: TONIC, is...
text: DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
text: charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
text: trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
text: The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.
text: IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
dialog: most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)
speaker_heading: KAREN CROSS (OS)
dialog: After a two month investigation, Det.
dialog: Jason York has been relieved of duty
dialog: for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
dialog: shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
dialog: Curtis. Key testimony against York
dialog: came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was

dialog: Attorney's office. Criminal charges
dialog: are expected.
scene_heading: 3 ON A TELEVISION SCREEN-- 3
text: The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
text: MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
text: In a civilized society, the men and
dialog: women entrusted with serving and
dialog: protecting the community are to be held
dialog: accountable just like everyone else.
dialog: Simply put... Just because you are a

dialog: you. This is no longer the wild, wild

scene_heading: 4 EXT. SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING 4
text: A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms
text: in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While

text: FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...
scene_heading: 5 EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 5
text: An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC,
text: street and pedestrian, go about their business.
text: ACROSS THE STREET... A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.
scene_heading: 6 INT. BLACK TRUCK - DAY 6
text: LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,
text: merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -
text: HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!
text: Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.
text: Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...
scene_heading: 7 EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 7
text: Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,
text: heading for the bank! Each carries a LARGE BLACK BAG.
scene_heading: 7A INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 7A
text: PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the
text: corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on
text: COMPUTERS.
text: GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business
text: day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 4.
scene_heading: 7B EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 7B

text: Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER...
scene_heading: AT THE FRONT DOORS--
text: The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move

text: aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT
dialog: RINGS OUT!
speaker_heading: LOREN
dialog: Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden
dialog: moves!
dialog: (to the Tellers)
dialog: You! Hands on heads, drop to your
dialog: knees. Now! Do it!
text: PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED! Lorenz is in
scene_heading: COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.
text: BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
text: counters! One on one side, one on the other.
text: BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
dialog: them into the lobby!
text: BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
text: level, forces them downstairs.
text: From the corner of Lorenz's eye... The SECURITY GUARD's hand
text: creeps toward his gun.
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: That... you don't want to do.
text: The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
text: the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
text: drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.
text: Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to
dialog: Black Clad #2!
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: Y'all picked the wrong day not to use
dialog: the ATM.
dialog: (Beat)

speaker_heading: LORENZ (cont'd)
dialog: take your chances if you choose not to

text: BLACK CLAD #2, keys in hand, flies across the counter,

text: Lorenz gets the message, finds THE BANK MANAGER cowering
text: behind his desk.
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: You, up.
dialog: (the Bank Manager obeys)
dialog: You understood what I just said?
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: Your security system, you can
dialog: electronically lock all entrances...
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: Yes. Right-right away.
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: With that attitude, you and I are going
dialog: to get along famously. Now go.
text: The Bank Manager nods nervously.
text: BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the
text: CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.
scene_heading: 10A INT. BANK MANAGER'S OFFICE 10A
text: The Bank Manager taps on his computer keyboard.
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: It's done. We're locked down.

scene_heading: 10B INT. THE LOBBY-- 10B
text: BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around.
scene_heading: 11 INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY 11
text: Jenkins fastens his cufflinks. In the bed behind him...
text: HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon
text: with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Have you seen my watch?
text: Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
text: watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
dialog: love, this is a relationship of convenience.
text: Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
dialog: last check in the mirror...
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: This was fun. You should get out of
dialog: bed. You'll be late for work.
text: And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to
text: close, then collapses back onto the bed.
scene_heading: 12 INT. SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 12
text: PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety

dialog: the detonation device and...
speaker_heading: BLACK CLAD #2
dialog: (into his headset)
text: Fire in the hole.
text: He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM! AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH
speaker_heading: THE VAULT!
scene_heading: 13 INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 13
text: A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands
text: UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected.
scene_heading: BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS--
text: An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment. He reaches up and
text: PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON!
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 7.
text: BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his
text: weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS
text: profusely from his neck, not dead yet.
text: Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: What do you think you're doing?
speaker_heading: BLACK CLAD #4
text: Fucker pushed the alarm.
text: Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: It would've made more sense to shoot
text: him before he pushes the fucking alarm.
dialog: Not after.
dialog: (looks at the Eager Teller)
dialog: Jesus.
text: Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's
dialog: head and...
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: And... If you're going to do something.
dialog: (FIRES his weapon!)
dialog: Do it right.
text: The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead. Lorenz checks
text: his watch... 9:26 a.m.
speaker_heading: LORENZ

scene_heading: 14 INT. SHOWER/ MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY 14
dialog: There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel

text: the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off
dialog: screen, chimes!
scene_heading: 15 INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY 15
text: Teddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager. The

text: OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out!
text: HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the
text: CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things...
text: DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not
text: a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CALLO
dialog: (into his radio)
dialog: I want all points of entry identified
dialog: and covered. We need SWAT here now.
dialog: Have emergency crews standing by!
speaker_heading: OFFICER AT BANK

text: NASA is green with envy.
text: BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,

speaker_heading: DAX

speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: We're hot.
speaker_heading: CALLO
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.
dialog: Who am I speaking with?
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: No questions. It's time to set the
dialog: rules. I am in complete control of
dialog: this facility. No one gets in or out
dialog: without my say and I will execute every
dialog: last man, woman and child in here if my
dialog: needs are not met. Do not test me.
dialog: Today, I am a man of zero patience.
speaker_heading: CALLO
dialog: I'm listening.
speaker_heading: LORENZ

scene_heading: 20 INT. CONNERS APARTMENT - DAY 20
text: Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his

text: door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his
dialog: deck.
text: Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE
dialog: SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes
text: to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a
dialog: long beat...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Do you have a warrant?
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 10.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: I need to speak to you, Quentin.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: There's where your shit out of luck
dialog: because I don't need to speak to you.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: It's important.
text: Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
text: relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE
text: STACKS AND STACKS OF BOOKS.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Huh? You don't look like much of a
dialog: Detective.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Funny. I was going to say the same
dialog: about you.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Charming.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Shane just transferred in from Tacoma. His
dialog: father...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Save your breath. I really don't care.
text: Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND
text: WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.
text: The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
text: retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to
text: the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has
dialog: passed...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Why don't we can the chit-chat. Get to
dialog: what's on your mind.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: We've got a hostage situation, American
dialog: National Bank. The sonsabitches said
dialog: they wouldn't talk to anyone but you.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: No shit?
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 11.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: No shit. I need you to do this.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Why should I?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Because people's lives are at stake.
dialog: That takes priority over your ego.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (to Jenkins; re: Dekker)
dialog: You may want to put a leash on him.
dialog: (beat; thinks)
dialog: Saying I did want to help... I'm still
dialog: suspended or did that slip your mind?
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: The commissioner's office has ordered
dialog: me to reinstate you. As of now, you're
text: back on the force.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Just like that?
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Just like that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I won't, however, unleash you alone.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Always a catch.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Shane, here, is your new partner.
dialog: Consider him a younger version of me,
dialog: looking over your shoulder, watching
dialog: every move you make.
text: The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Don't think I endorse this. If it were
dialog: my call, you'd be with your partner...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You mean ex-partner.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
text: ... On the unemployment line with him.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: For a moment there, I thought you
dialog: cared.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 12.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: I care about those innocent people down
dialog: there. I hope to God someone hasn't
dialog: made a monumental mistake letting you
dialog: back in.
speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: CALLO

dialog: Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there?
dialog: Can we get you anything? Food, medical

speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,
dialog: I would've preferred not having the

dialog: planning to be here this long. But, since

speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: Theory... put to practice isn't always

speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: Don't worry, I have no plans until
dialog: sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's
dialog: going to be a long one.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Wait, we're talking here...
speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: Patience, Detective. We don't want
dialog: another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?
text: Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge.
text: Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: He's off.
scene_heading: 30 EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 30
text: THE CROWDS GROW. The MEDIA BUILD UP INTENSIFIES. THROUGH A
scene_heading: TELEVISION CAMERA... Karen Cross reports:
speaker_heading: KAREN CROSS
dialog: This standoff is approaching two hours
dialog: now. We've been told Detectives have
dialog: made contact with the perpetrators
dialog: inside the bank. Whether any specific
dialog: demands have been made, we cannot
dialog: confirm. As soon as we know something,
dialog: we'll pass it on to you. Reporting

text: Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys,
text: an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun.
text: #1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the
text: wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear,
dialog: repeats.
scene_heading: 31 POLICE TECH VAN-- 31
text: The Detectives huddle. Impatience level high.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (to Dax)
dialog: Try again.
speaker_heading: DAX
text: He's not picking up.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (stern)
dialog: Try again.
text: Dax, humbled, does as ordered.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (glances about)
dialog: Where's our fearless Captain?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
text: Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: So you're here in his place.
text: Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks
text: another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Nicotine gum.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (shock)
dialog: You quit smoking?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Caffeine, too, if you must know.
dialog: (Another shock)
dialog: What? A man's capable of change.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: A man, yes. You... I'm not so sure.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 19.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Don't worry, I still have a vice or two.
speaker_heading: DAX
text: Fifteen rings. No answer.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Try again in five.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: What are they doing in there?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Wasting our time.
text: Time. The word rings in Conners's head. He starts to put it
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Precisely. He knows police protocol,
dialog: not to mention the shit in our own
text: precinct. He's disguising his voice,
dialog: means he's got a record and has done
text: this before. He's heavily armed and
dialog: well-connected. He knows he's
dialog: surrounded. He hasn't asked for a
text: damned thing. He drops that hint about
text: sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.
dialog: He's buying time. Why?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (brainstorming)
dialog: To figure out his next move. He wasn't
dialog: expecting us.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,
dialog: he thought you were still suspended.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Probably thought it would take the
dialog: whole day for you to find me. Giving
dialog: him the time he needs.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
text: He's stalling.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: He almost has what he came for.
text: Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 20.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Or... he's got what he came for and he's
dialog: waiting for his ticket out of here.
dialog: (the decision)
dialog: We're going in.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
text: The bank has three points of entry.
text: Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team,
dialog: head to the West side. We'll have the
text: SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker,
dialog: you're with me. Where is the SWAT
dialog: Commander?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I'll find him.
text: Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (to Conners; concern)
dialog: That's a big call, Quentin. Thought
dialog: about what you're doing?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You questioning me, Teddy?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Unfortunately... yeah.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: I question how you can fuck that
dialog: asshole and still manage to look in the
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: I'm not going to get into this now.
dialog: And you're one to talk. I hear...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (interrupting)
text: The hostages are in imminent danger.
dialog: They've confessed to killing someone, an
dialog: automatic murder one charge - that's a
dialog: life sentence, maybe a needle for all of
dialog: them. So why keep witnesses around to
dialog: testify? Longer we wait, the greater the
dialog: risk. We need to go in. Now.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 21.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (beat; then relents)
dialog: Okay.
text: Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives
text: with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a
dialog: "Don't FUCK with me" attitude.
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: I got snipers up top and ten soldiers
text: on the ground.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: What's the best way in?
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: Tear gas, blow the doors...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Hold on. No explosives. I got forty
dialog: civilians in there, too great a chance. Any
dialog: other way?
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
text: There's no pussy way in. The doors are
text: locked electronically from the inside.
dialog: We ain't getting in without force.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (beat; thinks)
dialog: What if we cut the power? That will
dialog: disable the system and we can open the
dialog: locks manually, come in that way?
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: (thinks; concedes)
dialog: That'll work.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: So we'll take the pussy way, Commander.
dialog: We cut the power and go in at 11:15
dialog: sharp!
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: 32 EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:13 AM - DAY 32

scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 22.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: The bank's equipped with emergency
dialog: generators, which once the power's
dialog: down, will kick back on in
text: approximately 3-6 minutes.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: It will be over before that.
dialog: Commander, your men in position?
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
text: Standing by.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: I will call for the power to be cut.
dialog: Once down, wait for my signal and
dialog: enter. No one moves until I give the
dialog: "go", understood?
text: They all nod. They're ready.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You have done this before, right?
dialog: Wait... I don't want to know.

scene_heading: 42 INT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 42
text: Instantly... EVERYTHING BLACKS OUT! LIGHTS, COMPUTERS, etc.
text: THE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY. PANIC evident. Lorenz

scene_heading: 43 EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 43
text: Conners makes the call...

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (into radio)
dialog: Hold it. What just happened?
scene_heading: 45A INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 45A
text: Black Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached

text: They SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
dialog: then...
scene_heading: 45B EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 45B
text: SHOOT to the TOP OF THE WALL-LENGTH WINDOWS! They hang,

speaker_heading: DEKKER

scene_heading: DEKKER. CONNERS. SWAT. ONLOOKERS. Everyone in the

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: No. Do not go in. It's a trap!
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER (VO)
dialog: Stand down, Detective. This is my show

speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: SONOFABITCH!
scene_heading: 48 ON THE EAST SIDE-- 48
text: The SWAT Commander makes his own call...
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: On my count... One... two... three...
text: The SWAT TEAM bum rushes the bank, just as...
text: KABOOM! A FIREBALL BLASTS through the door, BLOWS off its

scene_heading: 48A EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 48A
text: THE FRONT WINDOWS BLOW OUT! AN EXPLOSION! FIRE SHOOTS IN

scene_heading: 50 FROM THE BANK-- 50
text: Conners peers up as... The HOSTAGES RUN OUT, SCREAM IN
speaker_heading: TERROR!
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 26.
text: Conners and Dekker head for the bank, pass two groups of FOUR
text: UNIFORMED OFFICERS...
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: (to the first group)
dialog: Round up all the hostages, anyone that
dialog: comes out, grab'em!
text: Conners glares at Dekker.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (to the second)
dialog: The rest of you, come with us.
text: The OFFICERS rush to protect the HOSTAGES, pull them to

dialog: opportunity.
text: Conners and Dekker lead the charge inside, guns drawn.
scene_heading: 51 INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 51
text: EMERGENCY LIGHTS BURN! GLASS CRACKLES UNDER FOOT as Conners,

text: The lobby's clear. Conners pulls the Officers close.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (whispers; to Dekker)
dialog: We split up.
dialog: (whispers; to the officers)
dialog: You two with him. You two with me.
dialog: (to Dekker)
dialog: Check the back.
text: Dekker nods, leads his group away. Conner proceeds...
scene_heading: 52 BEHIND THE COUNTERS-- 52
text: Nothing. Conners spots a DOOR in the back marked, "Bank
dialog: Employees Only."
scene_heading: 53 THE VAULT-- 53
text: Dekker checks it out, but it's empty. The remnants of the
text: explosion remain. Suddenly... THE GENERATORS ROAR TO LIFE!
text: THE POWER BLINKS BACK ON!
text: Dekker jumps, startled by the sudden blast of lights.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 27.
scene_heading: 54 EMPLOYEE'S ONLY OFFICE-- 54
text: ALL THE LIGHTS COME UP, as... Conners KICKS IN THE DOOR,

scene_heading: 55 A BANK CORRIDOR-- 55
text: Dekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS
text: CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly...
text: A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH,
text: carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy
text: EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker.
scene_heading: 55A INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 55A
text: Conners strides out from behind the counters...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (to Vincent)
dialog: See anyone come your way?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No. No one went by me.
text: The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK
text: MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR.
speaker_heading: SWAT COMMANDER
dialog: Detectives... We found these.
text: Conners takes one of the masks in his hands.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
text: We let them walk right past us.

scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
scene_heading: 56 EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:48 AM - DAY 56
text: An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE

dialog: control.
text: Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS
text: administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body
text: into their truck.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 28.
scene_heading: 57 INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 57
text: Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: We got the one Teller dead, the two
text: that were strung up are alive, but in
text: critical condition. A few SWAT
dialog: incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's
dialog: the worst of it. Now, depending on who
dialog: you talk to... there was anywhere from
dialog: five to nine perps. And nobody got a
dialog: good look at any of'em, wore their
text: masks the whole time. Dax is rounding
dialog: up the security tapes now. That should
dialog: give us a firm number.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: I want background checks on every
dialog: hostage. They're all suspects until
dialog: they're not.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You don't think one of them's still
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: After this, nothing would surprise me.
scene_heading: 58 EXT. TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 58
text: Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside
text: with them. Dekker approaches.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Excuse me... I need to listen to the
text: conversation between Lorenz and Conners
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: It'll have to wait.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: How long?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: Hour. Maybe more.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: (too long)
dialog: Show me how to play it myself?
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 29.
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: Look, this isn't how it works. I don't
dialog: take orders from you. I don't know you
dialog: and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're
dialog: going to have to wait.
text: Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds
text: into the van. Dax turns, notices.
scene_heading: 59 INT. TECH VAN 59
text: Dekker inspects the equipment, when...
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Along with whatever they stole and this
dialog: war zone they left behind... A man's
text: dead, and the killers are running free.
dialog: I don't have time to wait.
dialog: (looks at the equipment)
dialog: I'll figure it out. Thanks for your
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: (relents, demonstrates)
dialog: Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop,
dialog: rewind... It's just like using a tape
text: player. Headphones are jacked in.
text: Tape's already inside.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: 60 EXT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY 60
text: A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the
text: scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt.
scene_heading: 61 INT. SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 61
text: A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we
text: rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank.
text: The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the
text: monitors. Conners stands nearby.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (re: the eighth monitor)
dialog: What's with this one?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: That's the camera in the vault. It
text: blew in the first explosion.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 30.
text: The SEVEN DIFFERENT MONITORS all begin in sync.
text: ON SCREEN... TIMECODE burns in the corner. The HOSTAGES are
text: dragged across the LOBBY, where the Black Clads hook them up
text: to the pulleys. The Black Clads get into position.
text: Conners CAREFULLY scrutinizes the images.
text: ON SCREEN... THE TIMECODE CLOCK: Hits "11:15:00 AM" and...
text: STATIC FILLS THE SCREENS!
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: That's when you cut the power.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: So we can't ID them.
speaker_heading: DAX
text: There's a four minute, fifty-two second
text: gap, before the image returns. But...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: They're long gone by then.
dialog: (beat; thinks)
dialog: Go to the head of the tapes, from when
text: they first went in. Document each move
dialog: they've made for the two hours they
dialog: were inside.
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: You got it. Hey... Awful lotta news
dialog: cameras outside. Maybe one got a look
dialog: at them coming out?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (good idea)
dialog: Have Vincent check it out.
text: Teddy enters...
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Conners, you better come out here.
scene_heading: 62 INT. LOBBY 62
text: Conners and Teddy walk in to discover... Captain Jenkins

speaker_heading: CONNERS

dialog: Shit. Feds.
text: Jenkins turns to Conners, gestures him over.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 31.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Detective Conners, join us, would you?
scene_heading: 63 INT. TECH VAN 63
text: Dekker listens through HEADPHONES makes notes as he goes.
speaker_heading: CONNERS (VO)
dialog: (beat; stern)
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: LORENZ (VO)
dialog: Theory... put to practice isn't always
dialog: perfect. Can't expect to keep the
dialog: hostages in check if a bad deed goes
dialog: unpunished or they may... randomly
dialog: decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
dialog: order to it.
text: Dekker, hits STOP, then REWIND. He checks his...
scene_heading: IN HIS NOTEBOOK--
text: Several words and phrases fill the page. "Lorenz, sunrise,
dialog: Pro Theory, 40 hostages, Theory, Randomly Revolt, and Chaos."
text: DEKKER studies the words intently, figuring something out.
text: He presses PLAY on the DAT machine.
speaker_heading: LORENZ (VO)
dialog: Theory... put to practice isn't always
dialog: perfect. Can't expect to keep the
dialog: hostages in check if a bad deed goes
dialog: unpunished or they may... randomly
dialog: decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
dialog: order to it.

dialog: words, "Lorenz, Chaos, Theory."
scene_heading: 64 INT. LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 64
text: Conners, Jenkins and Teddy converse with AGENT VICTOR DOYLE,
text: 40's, and the BANK MANAGER still a bit rattled.
speaker_heading: AGENT DOYLE
dialog: Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the
dialog: wealthiest and least popular Arabs in
dialog: the Middle East. There's been
dialog: countless threats on his life and
dialog: fortune in the past. But for better of
dialog: worse... he is an ally to the United
dialog: States. The Prince keeps a safe
dialog: deposit box in twenty institutions
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 32.
speaker_heading: AGENT DOYLE (cont'd)
dialog: across the country. Along with this
dialog: bank, he also had a box at Eastern
dialog: Federal Savings in Charlotte, North
dialog: Carolina, which was hit last month.
dialog: Same M.O.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: What was in the box?
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
dialog: We don't keep records. The boxes are
dialog: private. Since 9/11, we screen for
dialog: live tissue, viruses or explosives, but
dialog: if it passes those tests, we don't ask.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: This is all real fascinating shit, but
dialog: what about the money? Bank robbers
dialog: still like cash, don't they?
speaker_heading: BANK MANAGER
text: The cash drawers don't appear touched.
text: Neither does the cash vault.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: So they broke into a bank and didn't
dialog: steal any money?
text: Odd glances all about.
speaker_heading: AGENT DOYLE
dialog: We believe the Prince's box was the
dialog: target. We're trying to reach him now.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Thank you.
text: Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Helluva come back, Conners. Are you
dialog: familiar with the term franchise-sized
dialog: fuck-up...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Depends, are we talking about your sex
dialog: life? Because I've heard shortcomings.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: You got played, Quentin.
dialog: Congratulations, you just topped Pearl
dialog: Street Bridge.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 33.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: That's not fair. It was by the book.
dialog: Everything was according to standard
dialog: procedure.
text: Jenkins ignores Teddy.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You came to me. I didn't ask for this.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
text: Commissioner's office is scrambling to
dialog: cover their ass. They need a
dialog: scapegoat... And I have zero problems
dialog: serving you up.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You wanted this to happen.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: No. But if it had to happen to
dialog: somebody.

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: I think this Lorenz was trying to tell
dialog: us something.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You don't say.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: The way he spoke... he paused before
dialog: certain words. Have you ever heard of
dialog: the Chaos Theory?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: What?
scene_heading: 65 INT. DINER NEAR THE BANK - DAY 65
text: A grade "B" rating, tops. CUSTOMERS dine, choke down coffee.

text: about work, goes over his notes.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 34.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.
dialog: You, however, have no reputation; a fact I

text: Dekker races towards the crash site.
text: Conners climbs out of the car.
text: Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from

scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 42.

speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Will do.
dialog: (To Dekker)
dialog: Detective... I didn't realize when we

speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Marnie, you're looking well.

text: Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: (to Dekker)
dialog: You, on the other hand... I gotta bike

dialog: sometime? Or maybe I can just ride
dialog: you.
text: Conners looks at both of them.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Can we get back to work?
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: We got passports, sun tan lotion,

text: She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside
text: the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Must be a fifty large there easy. His

speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: You'd think, right?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: It's not?
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Don't put words in my mouth, but...
dialog: Two things jump out here. First, each
dialog: bank branch has their own money bands.
dialog: This is not American National's. After
dialog: a little checking, it belongs to
dialog: Pacific Savings of Seattle.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: That sounds familiar.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: It should. Four months ago, a half
dialog: million dollars was stolen in an armed
dialog: robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
dialog: job. They caught the guys a day later,
dialog: recovering about $400,000. Those guys
dialog: have been in lock up since and their
dialog: trial's still pending. Which leads us
dialog: to point number two. Do you smell
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: (smells the bills; grimaces)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: When evidence is taken in, any physical
dialog: contact might affect the ability to
dialog: lift prints, so, to mark it, we now
text: spray a scented solution directly on
dialog: the bill.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Is that new?
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: Wave of the future. Gotta keep up with
dialog: the times, Conners.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 46.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: So this money's not from our bank.
speaker_heading: MARNIE
dialog: No. This is the money from the Pacific
dialog: Savings job and our evidence room.
dialog: (smiling; to Dekker)
dialog: Now... For a list of things you can

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: When you said it was your "family

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Don't worry about it.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Your father was a hero.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Yes he was.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: At first I thought maybe you were

speaker_heading: DEKKER

text: the corner, observing.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: We found the money.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: That money was Dwayne's...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: That money came from our evidence room.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: I told you. I don't know nothing about

dialog: into, I didn't know!
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: So, where were you going?
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: Vacation.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: This isn't possession or solicitation,

dialog: could get life.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: Me!? I didn't do nothing!
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 48.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't
dialog: do nothing" is a double negative,
dialog: infers the positive. The grammar in
dialog: this country sucks.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: Then I didn't do ANY-thing!
text: Conners takes a seat next to Gina. His EYES BURN through

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: This isn't going away. You want to

dialog: something... now.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: I swear I don't know. Now I'm done

text: Dekker lowers his head. Disappointed.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You sure that's what you want?
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll
dialog: make. The first will be to the public
dialog: defender's office. The second to
dialog: children's services.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: What?
text: Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears. Suddenly a scared and
dialog: lonely girl.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: It's simple... if you insist on a
dialog: lawyer, I take your kids.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Not like you cared about them anyway.
dialog: You were ready to fly the coop with

scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 49.
speaker_heading: GINA
dialog: No. You can't do that.
speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: GINA

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You believe her?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: I think for the first time in that

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You had to know, once she asked for a
dialog: lawyer anything she told us would have
dialog: been inadmissable.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Who would've known? It would've been
dialog: my word against hers. Who do you think
dialog: the jury would've believed?
speaker_heading: DEKKER

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: So what... He showed you a warrant?
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: He must've.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: You don't remember?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: You know how many times someone signs
dialog: shit in and out? I see the same guys

dialog: for it. Take it up with him!

speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Callo signed the money out of evidence
dialog: two weeks ago.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: $433,000.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: If it's Callo, it would explain how
dialog: they knew police protocol and how our
dialog: department operates.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Also explains why he was so pissed this
dialog: morning about being replaced by
dialog: Conners. He wanted to be the point so
dialog: everything went according to plan.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: He doesn't need another reason to be
dialog: pissed at me.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: What about motive? Do we have one?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Pressure might've been getting to him.
dialog: He's been getting the cold shoulder
dialog: from cops since he testified about
dialog: Pearl Street Bridge.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: No. Don't buy that.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He was also getting divorced.
dialog: This is news to everyone.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 53.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: About a month ago, he told me he and

dialog: I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him
dialog: out. I didn't think it was this bad.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: (conflicted)
dialog: Bernie Callo is a first rate cop. A
dialog: boy scout. This doesn't make any

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: They never do, Captain.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: Don't act like you're not enjoying
dialog: this, Conners. I know what you think

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Doesn't matter what I think. Facts
dialog: here speak for themselves.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: No they don't. We haven't asked the
dialog: question... Why, if Callo's involved,
dialog: don't they ask for him at the bank?

scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:

text: The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED
speaker_heading: by COP CARS.
scene_heading: 88 INT. BERNIE CALLO'S HOME 88

dialog: her.
text: In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD,

scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 54.
text: SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through

text: Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...
scene_heading: OFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE
dialog: Wife came home approximately forty-five
dialog: minutes ago. Found him here. None of
dialog: the neighbors heard anything. There's
dialog: no forced entry and no one saw anyone

text: Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: Blueprints from the bank, schematics,

text: Found it behind the furnace.
text: Conners nods.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Well, that's it, right?
text: Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers

dialog: UP...
speaker_heading: CALLO (VO)
dialog: You've reached the Callo residence. No
dialog: one can get to the phone right now.
dialog: Please leave a message.
dialog: Then... After the TONE...
speaker_heading: LORENZ (VO)

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: 89 INT. DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT 89

speaker_heading: LORENZ
dialog: Are you connecting the dots? Are you

dialog: Conners GRABS the phone...
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 55.
speaker_heading: LORENZ

text: Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: What they told Callo was the plan and what
dialog: the plan really was may be two different
dialog: things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan
dialog: Callo would've agreed with.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You'd think a cop would be smarter.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: As cops we come across every temptation
dialog: in the book. Money, drugs, power.
dialog: We'd all like to think we can resist
dialog: any urge, but... We're not saints.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: So, Callo was involved and now they're
dialog: dragging you into it. Why?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Man said he wanted vengeance.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Piss anyone off lately?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Me?
text: Both can't help but smile. Jenkins walks up.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: I just got off the phone with Agent
dialog: Doyle. After the Charlotte break in,
dialog: the Prince withdrew all his possessions
dialog: from every safe deposit box in this
dialog: country.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 56.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Let me get this straight, they didn't
dialog: touch the cash or the safe deposit
text: boxes. So, they... break into a bank,
dialog: blow it up, and steal nothing?
dialog: (to Conners)
dialog: Still make sense to you?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Nothing about today makes sense.
text: Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the

scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 57.
scene_heading: ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES

speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: I've been through these tapes twenty

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Shutup.

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Wait, hold on a second. Did you see it?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: See what?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Go back a little.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Notice the camera angles, they're all
text: fixed. They don't rotate or pan.
text: Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: There. Stop. Play it. Look closely,
text: camera five, the vault cam, dominates
dialog: our attention because of the explosion.
dialog: But while that's happening, check out
dialog: Camera two, customer service.
text: ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad.

scene_heading: SECURITY CAMERA.
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: Where'd he go?

scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 58.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
text: He moved it. Changed the angle. He
dialog: didn't want us to see something.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: What's in that corner they didn't want
dialog: us to see?
text: Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and
text: FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.
scene_heading: 93 INT. AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK 93
text: AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's,
text: carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints.
text: Dekker and Conners look on.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Are you at all concerned that there's
dialog: some whacko out there looking to get
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: If I worried about every threat made
dialog: against me, I'd never leave the house.
text: The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS
text: APPEAR ALL OVER THE KEYBOARD!
text: Conners looks to Dekker, impressed.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: (to the technician)
dialog: Those are priority one. If he's got a

speaker_heading: FORENSICS TECHNICIAN
dialog: I'm on my way.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Dax, can you hack in there and find out

speaker_heading: DAX

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: No, four. More are coming.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN HOST
dialog: Wonderful, wonderful. Who's this young
dialog: man?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: For all intents and purposes... he's
dialog: Big Brother.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN HOST
dialog: (confused)
dialog: He's your brother?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN HOST
dialog: No matter, no matter... I bring you

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: We're still on duty. No wine.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN HOST
dialog: (insulted)
dialog: No wine?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: A little wine.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN HOST
dialog: That's better.
text: They get to the table, Conners looks at it.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Last time I was here, you said that
dialog: table in the corner was the "best in
dialog: the house."
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 60.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN HOST
dialog: It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best

scene_heading: 95 LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT-- 95
text: A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy. PATRONS

scene_heading: AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE--
text: Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN
text: OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been
text: consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The
text: mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.
text: Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent
text: have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the
text: Detectives, admires in their closeness.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Shane, what was that thing you said
text: back at the house about "returning to
dialog: the beginning path" or something?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: It's a Buddhist story.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: We're all ears.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: One day the Buddha found his heart in
text: turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
text: to the earth, to the base of a great
dialog: tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
text: elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
dialog: doesn't like seeing him discouraged.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: He can talk to an elephant?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th
dialog: level of consciousness. He's capable
dialog: of communicating with plants, trees...
dialog: even rocks.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Rocks?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You asked.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 61.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Continue.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: The Buddha was troubled so he went back
dialog: to where he came from, the beginning,
dialog: to find the path, the answer. So when
dialog: you hit a dead end, go back to the
dialog: beginning to find your way. Or
dialog: something like that.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: We have a genuine philosopher in our
dialog: midst.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You're a Buddhist?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: No. Just something I picked up along
dialog: the way.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: But you're religious?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Not particularly.
text: Conners stares curiously at his new partner. Then excuses
text: himself to go to the men's room.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You're all pretty tight.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: We've been through a lot together.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: I guess I just thought... I don't
dialog: know. With all the trouble he's been
dialog: in lately, coming back from suspension,
dialog: everyone would treat him differently.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You can't believe what you read or see
dialog: on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners
dialog: is stronger. He's one of the best.
dialog: Even when things got pretty wild today
text: and everyone else panicked, he was in
dialog: control. That doesn't just happen.
dialog: He's just that good.
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: Excuse me.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 62.
text: Teddy heads for the ladies room.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What was the Buddha looking for?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: The divine in himself.
text: Art's confused. Dekker's cellphone rings.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: How long does it usually take to for
dialog: fingerprints to be ID'd?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Hours, maybe days. We could be waiting
dialog: a while.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: (answering)
dialog: Dekker./ Okay.
dialog: (Snapping the phone shut...)
dialog: They got a match.
scene_heading: 96 INT. BY THE RESTROOMS - ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT 96
text: LONG CURTAINS divide the rooms.
text: Conners exits the men's room, Teddy appears and before a word
text: can be spoken... SHE KISSES HIM HARD, PASSIONATELY ON THE
text: LIPS. Conners gives in for just a moment. He breaks the
dialog: embrace.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: TEDDY
dialog: I realized something today. Being
dialog: around you, all that's happened... I
dialog: can't... I think I made a mistake.
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: It's too late. You've made your
dialog: choice. Live with it.
text: This jab hurts Teddy and Conners knows it. Dekker parts the

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: We got a match.
text: Teddy separates from Conners.
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 63.
speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: Prick used to work for some big-time
dialog: software company until they caught him
text: dipping into the company's slush fund.
dialog: They didn't want the publicity so they
dialog: didn't press charges. Couple years
text: later, he was busted for looting the
dialog: pension plans of retired cops. For a
dialog: genius... he's a fucking moron.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: This was your case. You and York. You
dialog: made the bust. Why didn't it stick?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: His lawyer put us on trial. Said we
dialog: were crooked, abusive, that we planted
dialog: evidence... We were in the midst of
dialog: the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury
dialog: bought it. They let him walk and we
dialog: were the scapegoats.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Was it true?
speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: The guy was guilty. He was scum. That
dialog: was the truth.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's something they don't teach you.
dialog: The system breaks down. You have to
dialog: compensate to get results.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: That gives you the right to break the
dialog: rules?
scene_heading: SHOOTING SCRIPT MARCH 15, 2004 64.
speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: These are today's transaction records

dialog: there were over 3,000 pages.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: We've just witnessed the largest heist
dialog: in history. Somewhere in the
dialog: neighborhood of a billion dollars.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Come again?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: It's a computer virus. "The Computer
dialog: Virus." It randomly withdraws money
dialog: from all the accounts and deposits it
dialog: into the bad guys' account. If you
dialog: check the transactions, no two
dialog: withdrawal amounts are the same and
dialog: none of'em are over $100. Most
dialog: security systems work on the size of
dialog: the money, not number of transactions.
dialog: Wire out one million from a handful of

dialog: a less than a hundred from ten million
dialog: accounts, no flags.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Where's the money now?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: I tried following one of the
dialog: transactions. It took me an hour and

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: It's still moving the money around?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from

dialog: until the next business day. So it's
dialog: going to keep jumping around until it
text: clears at 9 AM tomorrow.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why
dialog: break in? If they're just wiring
dialog: money? Couldn't they do that from
dialog: anywhere?
speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: That's the regional manager's computer

dialog: access to it. There you have unlimited
text: entry to the bank's mainframe. No

dialog: in. It's all nice and clean.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: A billion dollars is missing and we're

speaker_heading: DAX
dialog: Ironically, when the power went out, it

speaker_heading: DEKKER

dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Lorenz... Curtis... Called me.
speaker_heading: JENKINS
dialog: He called you?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: He said he didn't kill anyone who
dialog: didn't deserve it. He said Callo was
text: insignificant. But without Callo he
dialog: wouldn't have had the knowledge of our

dialog: (grabs a clipboard)
dialog: ... He wouldn't have had the front

speaker_heading: JENKINS

dialog: How did he come at you, Harry? It's

speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: All day long we thought Callo was the
dialog: dirty cop. All day long we were wrong.
text: Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: That's the sign-out sheet from the
dialog: evidence room. Here's one of Callo's
dialog: reports. Here's another one... and
dialog: another --
text: The SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine
dialog: them. He knows.
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: They're not the same signature, Harry.
dialog: They're not even close.
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: (shrugs it off)
dialog: Maybe he had a cramp in his hand. I

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: (re: file #1)
dialog: This is your file... You were
dialog: reprimanded, a month ago after you
text: confronted Callo at the courthouse.
dialog: You punched him. That ring a bell?
speaker_heading: HARRY
dialog: And I'd do it again. Cops who testify
dialog: against cops shouldn't be breathing the
dialog: same air I do. There's a line you
dialog: don't cross!
speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: So you set him up! You forged Callo's
dialog: signature, you gave him the money and
dialog: you helped him with his plan because
dialog: you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl
dialog: Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry
dialog: cause I know.

speaker_heading: YORK (OS)

speaker_heading: YORK (OS)
dialog: I think Conners would be sorry that you
dialog: died. But not me.

scene_heading: 174 EXT. DOCK - NIGHT 174

text: BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground
text: beneath the water.
text: Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs. He
text: falls to the planks.
text: York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he

text: Dekker struggles to breathe. York SQUEEZES harder.
speaker_heading: YORK
dialog: I have come this far... I will not be
dialog: denied.
text: Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind

text: Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.
text: York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG. Still choking.
text: Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!
text: York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
text: He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You're a serial killer.
speaker_heading: CONNERS (VO)
dialog: Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington,
dialog: Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The
dialog: world's safer with them gone. The kid
dialog: at the bank... that was unfortunate.
dialog: But... you live with your decisions.
dialog: You choose to take this road... there
dialog: is no half way. It's all or nothing.

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You said they were all hoods... what

speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: DEKKER

speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: And because the "bitch that made her

speaker_heading: CONNERS

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: Why not kill me? You had plenty of

speaker_heading: CONNERS
dialog: This wasn't about killing, Shane. This

speaker_heading: DEKKER
dialog: You're not going to get away.
speaker_heading: CONNERS (VO)
dialog: I already have. I'm not even here now.
