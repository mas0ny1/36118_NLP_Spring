speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Called him first thing.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: MARLENE

speaker_heading: MARLENE

dialog: Sir? I have Mrs. Whitaker on line

speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

text: ONSCREEN: Joanne Woodward is becoming agitated. She starts
text: switching into another personality.
text: A dark-haired man is getting up from his seat and walking in
text: the direction of the Gentleman's Lounge. Frank notices him

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: I thought it was salad forks we

speaker_heading: CATHY

scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
text: A man on a ladder is replacing the letters on the theater

text: There's a trill of laughter from down the street and Frank
dialog: turns.

text: Frank squints, looking after. And with a frown of curiosity
text: and some unsteadiness, he begins to follow.
scene_heading: EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT
text: The two men are crossing the shadowy side-street. One of them
text: can still be heard as they approach a dark, inconspicuous

scene_heading: INT. FRAN'S - NIGHT
text: Fran's is a small, burgundy-walled “gentlemen's bar', with

speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Identification please.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (turning, startled)
dialog: What?
dialog: 27.
text: A thin man in his 50's with a pencil-thin mustache stands

scene_heading: MAN WITH MUSTACHE

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh. Sure.
text: Frank shows him his wallet
scene_heading: MAN WITH MUSTACHE
dialog: Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant

speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: SPANISH BARTENDER
dialog: Yes, sir? What can I get you this
dialog: evening?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just a Johnny Walker, please. Neat.
scene_heading: SPANISH BARTENDER
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Frank takes out a cigarette and lights it. He glances stiffly
text: across the room.
text: The plucked and coiffed patrons, seated mostly alone, glance
text: back with the same stiff, self-consciousness. The men from
text: the theater sit in some corner rapt in conversation.
text: Frank's drink is set on the bar and he takes a fast, deep
text: sip, shiny with perspiration.
text: Frank puts down a bill and takes a long, relaxing drag off
text: his cigarette.
speaker_heading: VOICE
text: One more of the same.
text: Frank looks over and sees a clean-cut BLOND MAN (early 30's)
text: at the bar. He exhales.
text: The blond man glances over and smiles cautiously. Frank

dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER

scene_heading: EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - DAY
text: We float out from a newspaper photograph of Frank and Cathy

text: Eleanor, reading aloud from the paper. The door to the house
text: is open as Cathy and her arriving guests, DOREEN and NANCY,
text: stand around listening, having obviously been stopped in
text: their tracks to do so. Cathy holds a lilac scarf under her

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: ‘So does the fabled maxim hold that

speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: Uh-oh!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, no! I love that scarf!
speaker_heading: DOREEN

speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Mr. Whitaker, Mrs. Whitaker. As
dialog: someone who's been around numerous

dialog: how difficult these things can be
dialog: at times, particularly at the

scene_heading: INT. DR. BOWMAN'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER
speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Today, the general attitude
dialog: regarding this sort, of behavior
dialog: is, naturally, more modern, more
dialog: scientific than it's ever been
dialog: before. After all, we're not living
dialog: in the dark ages. But for those who
dialog: do seek treatment, who possess the
dialog: will and desire to lead normal
dialog: lives, there still remains only a
dialog: scant, 5-to-30 percent rate of
dialog: success. For complete heterosexual
dialog: conversion. Interestingly, for
dialog: many, it's the treatment itself
dialog: that often changes the patient's
dialog: mind. One thing is certain. A
dialog: successful outcome is only ever
dialog: achieved when it's what the patient
dialog: himself desires more than anything
dialog: else in the world.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What does it - comprise of? The

speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Treatment is usually comprised of

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just - talking?
speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Yes. Though some patients have

dialog: behavioral methods.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Behavioral?
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: BOWMAN
dialog: Electro-shock aversion therapy, for

speaker_heading: BOWMAN

dialog: I suggest you take some time, think
dialog: over the various options we

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I - I already know - I want to

text: Frank tries to gather his thoughts.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I can't - let this thing destroy my

speaker_heading: CATHY

dialog: behavior.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: But how on earth did you hear about
dialog: this show?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Well I do read the papers.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Well of course you do. I just meant
dialog: - it was such a coincidence.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I know. I was just teasing you.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (slightly lower voice)
dialog: Because you know I’m not
dialog: prejudiced.
text: Raymond smiles at her.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (quite serious)
dialog: My husband and I have always
dialog: believed in equal right for the
dialog: Negro, and support the NACP.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Well I’m glad to hear that.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I just - I wanted you to know.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Well thank you.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Not at all.

text: As they start into the final room of the gallery we see Sarah
text: through the window outside, watching as the boys try
text: unsuccessfully to launch their paper airplane.
scene_heading: EXT. GALLERY - DAY
text: Close on Hutch's paper airplane as his friend, Tommy, gives
dialog: it a throw.
speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: Go!
text: The plane nosedives and Hutch goes to get it.
speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: Straighter, Tommy! You gotta throw
dialog: it straighter. And hard! One, two,
dialog: three - GO!
text: Tommy throws it hard but it sputters down once again.
text: Sarah giggles to herself.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: It's too heavy!
text: The boys stop and turn.
speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: On the end. Your airplane!
speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: Who asked you?! C’mon, Bobby.
text: Hutch motions to the others and the boys start back into the
dialog: gallery.
scene_heading: INT. GALLERY - DAY
text: Hutch and his brother return to their parents as Sarah
text: watches from outside, alone.
speaker_heading: MEANWHILE
text: Cathy and Raymond are looking at a Miro.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: So what is your opinion on modern
dialog: art?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It's hard to put into words really.
dialog: I just know what I care for and
dialog: what I" don't. Like this - I'm not
dialog: sure how you pronounce it - Mirra?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Miro.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Miro. I don't know why but I just
dialog: adore it. The feeling it gives. I
dialog: know that sounds terribly vague.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: No. It actually confirms something
dialog: I've always wondered about modern
text: art, abstract art.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: That perhaps it's just picking up
dialog: where religious art left off. You
dialog: know. Trying to somehow show you
dialog: divinity, put it up there on the
text: wall. The modern artist just pares
dialog: it down to the most basic elements
dialog: of shape and color. But when you
dialog: look at that Miro, you feel it just
dialog: the same.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Why that's lovely, Raymond.
text: We hear the brief shriek of a woman's laugh. Cathy turns to
text: Mona Lauder, Mr. Farnsworth and two other women, one stifling
text: her giggles, snickering amongst themselves over Cathy and her
text: Eleanor, who is standing listening to an ELDERLY WOMAN, also
text: notices the commotion.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: To tell you the truth, I was rather
text: shocked by the prices.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN(cont 'd)
dialog: But then I've always preferred the
dialog: work of the masters... Rembrandt,
dialog: Michelangelo -
text: Eleanor spots Cathy saying goodbye to Raymond and starting
text: off down the hall.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I'm terribly sorry - Would you
dialog: excuse me a moment?
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Certainly.
text: Eleanor starts after Cathy.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Cathleen!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: El, honey. It all looks just
dialog: marvelous -
text: Eleanor whisks Cathy to the side.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Cathy, who on earth was that man?
dialog: You have the whole place ina
dialog: clamor!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh for heavens sake, why? Because
dialog: of that ridiculous story?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (squinting off at Raymond)
dialog: Who is he?
text: Raymond is now introducing Sarah to a smiling, middle-aged
text: woman in a hat.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: His name's Raymond Deagan. He's
dialog: Otis Deagan's son.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Your gardener?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yes. He passed away very recently
dialog: and Raymond's taken over his
dialog: business.
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Well you certainly seem on familiar
dialog: terms with the man.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh what does that mean? Familiar
dialog: terms? He happens to have some very
text: enlightening views on Miro.
dialog: (glancing at her watch)
dialog: Oh, jeepers, would you look at the
dialog: time! El, I have to fly.
dialog: 
text: They start walking toward the door.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I'm having the carpets cleaned for
dialog: tomorrow.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What time are the caterers showing?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: They said four.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I'll come early too. For moral
dialog: support!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: You're a doll.

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - DUSK
text: Music accompanies a slow and stately ascent upon the Whitaker
text: house, trimmed with cars and bursting from inside with the
dialog: exuberance of the annual company party. We can even hear the
text: distant clamor of merriment and laughter churning from
dialog: within.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK
text: The house, impeccably decorated, is swarming with people in
text: evening dress, drinking, smoking, chatting, laughing. An
text: overstuffed Christmas tree glistens in the corner as an
text: endless parade of hors d'oeuvres are passed solemnly by the
text: all-black, formally uniformed, serving staff.
dialog: 66.
text: Cathy shimmers in a gown of sapphire blue, standing
text: surrounded at one end of the room, while Frank stands with
text: drink in hand, surrounded at the other.
text: We see various faces from the Magnavox office, including
text: Marlene. Cathy is listening to a middle-aged Elderly Woman.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Not to say that I'm against
dialog: integration mind you. I do believe
dialog: it's the Christian thing to. But I
dialog: still say what happened in Little
dialog: Rock could just as easily have
dialog: happened here in Hartford.
text: A stout, red-faced man answers.
speaker_heading: RED-FACED MAN
dialog: Nonsense!
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: And why is that?
speaker_heading: RED-FACED MAN
dialog: Well for one thing, there's no
dialog: Governor Faubus in Connecticut. But
dialog: the main reason - They're no
dialog: Negroes!
dialog: (laughs)
text: Two of the serving staff close enough to have heard his
dialog: remark continue serving.
text: DICK DAWSON, a tall, strapping man in his mid-30's, is
text: leaning on a chair beside Cathy.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: No, but I do hear there are some
dialog: rather dangerous pro-integration
dialog: types. Right here in Hartford!
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Dangerous?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Oh yes. Some very attractive ones
dialog: in fact. Noted, I'm told, for their
dialog: kindness to Negroes!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (slapping his arm)
dialog: Oh Dick, stop! Where on earth did
dialog: you hear about that?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Shirley read it to me.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I should have known.
speaker_heading: RED-FACED MAN
dialog: What's all this?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Absolutely nothing! Here, let me
dialog: freshen those.
text: Cathy takes Dick and the red-faced man's glasses and starts
text: off toward the bar. Frank is at the couch with Stan Fine,
text: Doreen and her husband RON. As Cathy passes, Stan calls out
text: to her.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: By golly there she is now!
dialog: Prettiest gal in the room!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, Stan! Liquor does bring out the
dialog: Texan in you. I just hope Eleanor
dialog: isn't listening.
speaker_heading: STAN
text: (putting an arm around
dialog: her)
dialog: So what if she is! I still say
dialog: Frank's the luckiest guy in town.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Here, here!
text: Frank is hunched over listening, noticeably intoxicated.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (thinking he's being
dialog: witty)
dialog: Smoke and mirrors, fellas! That's
dialog: all it is. You should see her
dialog: without her face on!
text: Frank laughs at his own joke and a few join in awkwardly.
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: Erank!
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No, he's absolutely right. We
dialog: ladies are never really what we
dialog: appear. And every girl has her
dialog: secrets!
speaker_heading: DOREEN
dialog: I'll say.
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: (thrusting his glass at
dialog: her)
dialog: Well how ‘bout this girl going and
dialog: getting her husband another drink?
dialog: How ‘bout that?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (still smiling)
dialog: You don't think you might have -
dialog: already had enough, darling?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I don't think I've already had -
speaker_heading: DOREEN
text: (interrupting, raising her
dialog: glass)
dialog: Well I'd just like to take a moment
dialog: to raise a glass to our marvelous
text: host and hostess and another
dialog: glorious Annual Party at the
dialog: Whitaker's! To Frank and Cathy,
dialog: truly Mr. and Mrs. Magnavox!
text: Everyone around them raises their glasses ‘To Frank and
text: Cathy’ and toasts. Cathy and Frank smile and nod at their
text: guests, but the strain is evident
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you... Now who can I freshen
dialog: up? Ron?
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: Me.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I think you're fresh enough.
text: Cathy starts off toward the bar. Sybil is crossing with a

dialog: Wonderful party, Cathleen.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Here, Mrs. Whitaker

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you, Sybil.
dialog: let me take

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Cathy?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Hi.
text: Eleanor pulls her aside, by a window.
dialog: him so
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Honey? Is everything alright?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Frank. I've never seen
text: soused.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, no. He's just been
dialog: hard lately. He's been
text: tremendous strain.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You sure that's all?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, yes.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: You'd tell me if there
dialog: more?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Of course I would.
dialog: - working so
dialog: under such
dialog: was anything
dialog: 70.
text: Eleanor puts a hand on Cathy's back as they start back into
dialog: the party.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: By the way, kid. I think we just
dialog: threw ourselves one class-A swanky
dialog: function.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It did turn nicely, didn't it.
text: A WOMAN calls out to Cathy.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Cathleen, darling. You've simply
dialog: outdone yourself - once again!
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Cathy stands at the door waving goodbye to the last guests
dialog: (probably Eleanor & Stan)
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thanks for everything! I'll call
dialog: you tomorrow! Goodnight!
text: Cathy closes the door and steps into the half-darkened house,
text: still strewn with party debris. She takes a deep breath of
text: relief, and notices Eleanor's serving-ware by the bar.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, shoot - I forgot to give
dialog: Eleanor her servers.
text: Frank sits in an armchair, rouged in shadow.
text: Cathy walks toward the stairs and stops, looking at him.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank?
text: He doesn't respond, and she continues on toward the stairs.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Well, if I do say so myself, I
dialog: think it was a very lovely party,
dialog: all considering.
text: She stops to gather her wrap at the foot of the stairs. She
text: looks off a moment, very still.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (quiet and level)
dialog: I just don't understand. Why it has
dialog: to turn ugly. In front of our
dialog: friends.
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Honestly, Frank. If you didn't
dialog: insist on -
text: She stops, hearing something, and turns - Frank is suddenly
text: approaching.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What is it - ?
text: But all at once he’s upon her - rolling into her arms and
text: kissing the side of her neck, music rushing. Cathy is
text: stunned, but gradually begins returning his affection.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh Frank...
text: They fold into the couch, kissing, and suddenly Frank is on
text: top of her. At first she’s unsettled by his strong urgency
text: but she allows it to continue, stroking his head and trying
text: to slow him down. But he becomes only more persistent
text: panting and thrusting and turning red from the effort. Cathy
text: closes her eyes and tries to weather it. Then with a sudden
text: half-choked cry, Frank surrenders, turning away from her and
text: muttering aloud in exhaustion and defeat
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh Jesus! Jesus, what’s happening!
dialog: I can’t even... Oh God!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank! Frank, it doesn’t matter,
dialog: darling! The important thing is to
dialog: keep... trying. Keep -
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: (sitting up suddenly, his
dialog: back to her)
dialog: Don’t -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank!
text: She puts her hand on his shoulder but he shakes it off.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t.
dialog: (silence)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: FRANK(cont 'd)
dialog: Because I’m sure - you know - Dick
dialog: Dawson wouldn’t mind... lending his
dialog: services every now and again!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, Frank.
text: She reaches for his arm again and he tries to wriggle free,
text: but she holds on.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I mean, you wouldn't mind that so
dialog: terribly much, would you? Good-
dialog: lookin’ guy like Dick. Maybe even
dialog: Stan would pitch in!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (holding tighter)
dialog: Frank, please. You're the only man
dialog: I'd ever -
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Let go!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: You're all men to me, Frank! And
dialog: all man!
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: STOPPIT!
text: Furiously he swipes her hand away and accidentally strikes,
text: her hard in the face with his cufflink.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (covering her face)
dialog: Oh, Frank!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm sorry. Cathy, I'm sorry. I
dialog: didn't mean to -
text: Cathy grabs a cloth napkin from the coffee table and presses
text: it to her head.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It's alright. I'm alright. It was
dialog: an accident.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is it bleeding?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Just the littlest bit.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
text: Frank just stands there, helpless.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Perhaps you could get me a little
dialog: ice, dear.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ice?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cathy, I'm...
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I know, dear. It's alright. I'm
dialog: alright.

scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - LATE MORNING

scene_heading: INT. LANDING - LATE MORNING
text: As Cathy passes an upstairs window she sees Eleanor's car

scene_heading: EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE DOORWAY - LATE MORNING
text: Eleanor is just ringing the doorbell when Cathy opens the

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Hey there, honey. Listen, I can't

dialog: the club.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: That sounds nice. I can't believe I

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: It's cute, your hair that way.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yea? I experimented. Here.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: It's adorable.
text: As Cathy hands the servers to Eleanor a serving spoon falls
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Whoopsie!
text: Cathy picks it up from the ground and puts its back in the
dialog: dish.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Thanks.
text: Eleanor smiles at Cathy. Suddenly she stops smiling.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Cathy?
text: Cathy's hair no longer conceals the bruise on her forehead.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What happened to your head?
text: Cathy's hand flies up to cover it
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Nothing, I - hit the door. It was
dialog: the silliest thing.
text: Eleanor continues staring with concern.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Cathy.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Did something happen - between you
dialog: and Frank?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Cathy I'm your best friend.
speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: ELEANOR

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (looking hard at her)
dialog: Cathy I'm your dearest and closest
dialog: friend in the world. You can call
dialog: me. Day or night. You hear?
text: Cathy nods.
text: Eleanor remains looking, worriedly at her friend. Then she
text: sighs and turns to go.
text: Cathy watches, unable to move. She can't contain it any
text: longer and starts after - but stops herself again.
text: Eleanor is climbing into her car. She shuts the door.
text: Cathy turns around facing her house, eyes flooding, as we
text: hear Eleanor driving off. Not ready to go back in, she
text: proceeds down the steps to the side of the house, under a
dialog: tree.
text: There in the shade she takes a few short breaths, trying to
text: gather herself. She begins to focus on something on the

text: It's a pair of black boots.
dialog: 76.
text: Raymond stands a couple yards away watching, not knowing what
dialog: to do.
text: She sees him and the tears spill from her eyes.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Oh - Mrs. Whitaker...
text: He takes a step toward her and stops.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Is there - anything I can do?
text: She shakes her head no, wiping the tears and trying to shield
text: her forehead from view.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You sure?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you, no. I'm fine, really.
dialog: It's just - been a difficult time.
dialog: With my husband.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: It does happen. Between married
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I know it does. I just...
dialog: (she turns away)
dialog: It's so embarrassing. Please
dialog: forgive me.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Forgive you for what?
text: He looks off for a moment, then back at Cathy.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Mrs. Whitaker, listen. I have to go
dialog: deliver some shrubs to a farmhouse
dialog: just out of town. Which means I
dialog: have to get a move on. why don't
dialog: you come on along for the ride?
dialog: Little fresh air, change of

dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No. I couldn't. But thank you

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you, Sybil! I'll be right in!
dialog: (back to Raymond)
dialog: I should get back.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Okay.

dialog: phone.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Hello?... Yes. How are you, Mrs
dialog: Barker... Not at all...
text: As Cathy talks she steps over toward her vanity and glances
text: at herself in the mirror. She adjusts her hair so that it
text: covers her forehead as before.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yes, I was planning to pick them up
dialog: at five... I see. So you'd like to
dialog: switch for Thursday? No, I don't
dialog: think that would be a problem...
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: CATHY(cont 'd)
dialog: Well I'm glad I could be of help...
dialog: Certainly... Bye now.

scene_heading: EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Well, wouldn't you know it. I just

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It's lovely. What is it?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND

dialog: just... what with everything that’s
dialog: been going on recently, it just - I
dialog: don’t know - feels at times like
dialog: there’s no one left in the world I
dialog: can talk to!
text: Cathy smiles to herself and looks back at him.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (lightly)
dialog: Except you!
text: Raymond smiles.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Well. Sometimes it's the people
dialog: outside our world we confide in
dialog: best.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Why? Just because they're outside?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: And because they may have had
dialog: experiences similar to ours.
dialog: Because they care to listen.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: And once you do. Confide. Share
dialog: those experiences with someone.
text: They're no longer really outside,
dialog: are they?
text: They've come upon a small wooden bridge under which a perfect
text: stream passes. They stop for a moment.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It's lovely, isn't it?
text: She kneels down and looks into the stream.
text: Raymond is looking down at her. There's a sadness in his eye,
text: and he squats down beside her, music waking.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (with great gentleness)
dialog: Did he cause that?
text: He is looking at the mark on her forehead.
text: Cathy puts her hand over it and stands, silent for a moment
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: He didn't mean to strike me.
text: She looks down at the stream and takes a step away.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No. Heaven knows we all have our
dialog: troubles. I'm sure you yourself...
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, I don't know. Ever since
dialog: running into you at the
dialog: exhibition... Well I just kept
dialog: wondering what it must be like.
text: Being the only one in a room.
dialog: Colored, or whatever it was. How
dialog: that might possibly feel. I'm sure
dialog: I've never -
text: She stops, glancing out again at the hills.
text: Raymond looks out as well.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Well, I suppose it's something you
dialog: sort of grow accustomed to. Over
dialog: time. Don't get me wrong. There is
dialog: a world - even right here in
dialog: Hartford - where everybody does
dialog: indeed look like me. Only trouble
dialog: is, very few people ever leave that
dialog: world. I just want what any father
dialog: wants for his child, the
dialog: opportunities growing up I never
dialog: had.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Naturally.
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: But I'll tell you something - If
dialog: you're really interested -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh I am.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (has a sudden thought)
dialog: Are you hungry? Could you eat
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (brief silence)
dialog: I suppose I could.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Tell you what. Let me take you to
dialog: one my favorite spots, not far from
dialog: here. On good days they got hot
dialog: food, cold drink, and just about
text: discernible music.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Well it's hard to beat that!
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: There you go!
text: Cathy smiles back as they start back up the path.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ERNIE'S BAR & GRILL - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Against the gray, industrial side of town, gleams the pink
text: and green neon of Ernie's Bar&Grill. We see Raymond's truck
text: just pulling into the driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR WASH - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Across the street at a Car Wash, a young black attendant
text: gives two short honks from a shiny black Edsel and looks
dialog: around.
text: A woman in a black feathered hat approaches. It's Mona
dialog: Lauder.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: Here I am! Yoo-hoo?
dialog: 84.
text: The attendant takes her ticket and escorts her to the
text: driver's seat but Mona tarries a moment, catching sight of
text: something across the street. The attendant looks off in the
dialog: same direction.
text: Outside Ernie's, Raymond is seen helping Cathy out of his
text: truck, taking her arm and escorting her into the club.
text: Mona remains devilishly fixed as she steps into the car and
text: the attendant shuts the door.
speaker_heading: MONA
dialog: (handing him a nickel)
dialog: Thank you... very much, indeed.
text: Mona starts her engine with a contented little smirk.
scene_heading: INT. ERNIE'S - LATE AFTERNOON
text: The front door opens and Cathy and Raymond step into the
text: entry way of the club.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (fixing her hair)
dialog: Well I'm hardly dressed for a
dialog: restaurant.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You look fine.
text: The main room at Ernie's is a smoky den of small square
text: tables and black booths, colored mostly by neon overspill and
text: Christmas lights. Most notably, everyone in the room is
dialog: black.
text: As Raymond and Cathy enter everyone in sight turns and looks.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Raymond.
text: Raymond contains a little smile.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Don't worry. It's a very friendly
dialog: place.
text: Raymond starts in and Cathy follows, reluctantly. A small
text: blues band is just setting up as an old jukebox plays and one
text: couple dances.
dialog: 85.
text: Raymond passes ESTHER, a dolled-up waitress in her late 20's
text: who scowls at him as he stops, glancing around the room for a
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Say there Esther, darling. what?
dialog: You don't say hello any more?
speaker_heading: ESTHER
dialog: (checking out Cathy)
dialog: Looks like you’re speakin’ fine for
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Oh, you’re just sore ‘cause I
dialog: haven’t been coming around like I
dialog: used to.
speaker_heading: ESTHER
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Now what do you say about bringing
text: us over a couple of drinks.
dialog: (to Cathy)
dialog: What would you like?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh. A daiquiri? If they -
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
text: One daiquiri, and a bourbon on the
dialog: rocks. Thank you, doll.
text: Esther rolls her eyes and turns.
text: As Raymond escorts Cathy to a table, a GLARING MAN stands up
text: from his table just as Raymond is passing.
speaker_heading: GLARING MAN
dialog: (to Raymond)
dialog: What d'you think you're doing, boy?
text: Raymond passes him without looking, continuing with Cathy to
text: a corner table below a mirror and helps Cathy into her chair
text: He sits down opposite her.
text: The glaring man stares after a moment, then takes off
text: adamantly toward the bar.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (a little tense)
dialog: Well I hope you find this very
dialog: amusing.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What do you mean? It's a very
dialog: welcoming place!
dialog: (spotting someone and
dialog: nodding)
dialog: How you doin’ Gus.
text: A middle-aged man at another table (looking fairly soused)
text: raises his glass to Raymond, then to Cathy.
text: Cathy smiles back at him.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: See what I mean?
text: Cathy watches as a second couple step up to the dance-floor.
text: Meanwhile Esther returns with drinks and menus.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Thank you, Esther.
text: She leaves.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (raising his glass)
dialog: Well. Here's to being the only one.
text: Cathy looks at him a moment and then smiles, shaking her
text: head. She toasts his glass and he laughs.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Really. We don't have to stay if
dialog: you're not comfortable.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No. As long I keep away from
dialog: Esther, I think I'll be fine.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Alright, then.
text: The jukebox song has ended and the band kicks into its first
text: number, a tender “I’1l Be Seeing You.” Raymond turns to
text: watch, smiling.
dialog: 87.
text: A few men in blue-collar uniforms are sauntering out of a
text: smoke-filled pool-room, beer bottles in hand. They also stop
text: to listen to the band, while two more couples head up to the
dialog: floor to dance.
text: Cathy looks over at Raymond, and smiles to herself.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you, Raymond.
text: He turns to her.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: For a lovely afternoon.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Well thank you, Mrs. Whitaker. I’ve
dialog: had one as well.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: ‘Mrs. Whitaker.’ Sounds so formal.
dialog: Would you -
text: She stops.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Would I what?
text: Brief silence.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Ask me to dance?
text: Raymond smiles and slowly stands.
text: Cathy does the same and turns, leading as Raymond follows
text: unhurriedly to the dance-floor.
text: The men in blue-collar uniforms watch Raymond pass with
text: contempt in their eyes, before finally turning and filing out
dialog: of the bar.
text: Cathy stops beneath a blossom of rosy light and turns
text: smiling as Raymond joins her. She takes his hand and they
text: begin to dance, tenderly, in the soft glow of Ernie's
text: surrounded by other dancers and other lovers.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE MORNING
text: We follow a vase displaying the golden Quaking Aspen branch
text: as Sybil carries it into the living room. Cathy is gathering
text: her belongings, getting ready to leave the house.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, doesn't that look lovely. Let's
dialog: see now, where should we put it...?
dialog: How about there, Sybil, by the
dialog: window?
text: Sybil places the vase on a high end-table near the window.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh yes, that's lovely.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: It certainly is.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (checking her purse)
dialog: Now where is that list you gave me -
dialog: Though I swore to Janice I wouldn't
dialog: be late for her recital.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: You can't miss that.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (finding the list)
dialog: Here it is.
dialog: (walking over to her coat)
dialog: You know, Sybil, I've been meaning
dialog: to ask you...
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Yes, ma’am?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What is the name of that church
dialog: group you belong to - the one
dialog: you've mentioned so often...?
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: You mean at Ebenezer? The bible
dialog: group?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (putting on her coat)
dialog: Yes, I believe that was it.
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Or was it South Green Baptist.
text: During the Fair Drive. The ladies
dialog: auxiliary?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I didn't realize there was more
dialog: than one.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Oh, yes. I always seem to be
dialog: signing up for something.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Well I think that's marvelous
dialog: Sybil. That you even find the time,
dialog: what with all you do for us.
dialog: (putting on her scarf)
dialog: We just have so much up in the
dialog: attic I've been meaning to go
dialog: through. I thought you might know
dialog: of a church or civic group that
dialog: could benefit from a donation.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Well - certainly, Mrs. Whitaker. If
dialog: that's what you're looking for.
dialog: Places in need are never too hard
dialog: to find.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (opening the door)
dialog: Well I suppose you're right about
dialog: that -
text: Cathy stops with a start.
text: A young black couple are standing in the doorway.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yes? May I - help you with
dialog: something?
text: Sybil looks on suspiciously, observing the couple's
text: conservative attire and officious clipboards.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Is this the Whitaker residence?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: Are you -

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Well - certainly, I'm familiar with
dialog: your organization - I just... May I
dialog: ask how you obtained our name and
dialog: this address?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: You gave it to us ma’am.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I did?
speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: When you signed our petition
dialog: supporting the funding initiative.
speaker_heading: CATHY
text: (thinks for a moment,
dialog: then)
dialog: Oh. Yes, I do remember signing for

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: YOUNG MAN
dialog: If you wouldn't mind signing

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Perhaps - Sybil, would you mind
dialog: signing for this? I'm terribly late

speaker_heading: CATHY

dialog: Whoever it is I'm gone! Thank you,
dialog: Sybil - I should be back by five!
speaker_heading: SYBIL

text: As Cathy scurries off the three look after, music hanging.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Cathy drives down Hawthorne street looking out her window
text: eagerly, music stirring softly.
text: The red-and-green Christmas decorations on the lamp-posts
text: only seem to accentuate the greyness of the neighborhood.
text: Then she spots it.
text: A small storefront with Christmas trees out front reads
scene_heading: DEAGAN GARDEN SHOP.
text: She smiles to herself as she continues on, picking up speed.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HARTFORD STREET - DAY
text: A wind whistles through downtown Hartford as Cathy hurries
text: out of the local Stop-&-Shop carrying groceries. She smiles
text: at a WOMAN passing on the street, and hurries on to her car
dialog: 92.
text: The woman stops and turns, looking back at Cathy as she goes.
text: Two ladies are passing down the street - the same two ladies
text: who stood snickering with Mona and her uncle at the art show.
text: One of them spots Cathy and whispers something to the other.
text: Cathy notices, stopping a moment before shutting the trunk of
text: her car, then rushes on.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DANCE SCHOOL - LATER

scene_heading: INT. DANCE SCHOOL - LATER
text: Inside the dimly-lit recital room mothers sit in rows of
text: folding chairs watching as a class of 10 and 11-year-old

text: Cathy steps into the main room, hushed in attention, and
text: stops to watch. Janice comes running over.
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Mother!
text: A ballet instructor turns and shh's them.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Hello, dear.

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Did the recital just begin?
text: Janice nods.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: So where are the other little girls
dialog: from your class?
speaker_heading: JANICE
dialog: Over there.
text: A queer fog of music forms as Cathy looks over to the other
text: side of the room.
dialog: 93.
text: All the other girls Janice's age are standing with their
text: mothers at the opposite end of the room.
text: The mothers all seem to be looking over at Cathy (or

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Janice? Janice?

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Sybil?
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY

dialog: out of a truck or some such thing -
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Cathy closes her eyes.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (cont'd through receiver)
dialog: The same colored man, she claims
dialog: you were talking to at the art
dialog: show!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: But that's - that's preposterous! I
dialog: mean yes I've spoken to Mr. Deagan
dialog: on occasion. But this makes it
dialog: sound like -
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (through receiver)
dialog: Cathy, believe me, I've been at my

dialog: it's been like around here - the

speaker_heading: CATHY

dialog: so absurd!
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (through receiver)

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: But what in the world can I do?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (through receiver)

text: Cathy suddenly turns.
text: Frank is standing in the shadows off the kitchen, looking

dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank! What on earth - I didn't
dialog: even hear you -
dialog: (to Eleanor)
dialog: Eleanor, Frank just walked in. Can
dialog: I call you back?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (through receiver)
dialog: Of course. You go ahead.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I'll call you later.

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank, what are you doing home? Is

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just tell me one goddamn thing.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is it true? What they're saying?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, Frank, I can't believe you even
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Because if it is, even the

dialog: Cathleen -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank I'm sorry you ever even had
dialog: to hear of such nonsense!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yea', well, Dick Dawson didn't seem
dialog: to think it was such nonsense when
dialog: he snuck away from his desk today
dialog: to phone me -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Good heavens -
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He says the whole friggin' town's
dialog: been talking!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank, Sybil will hear you.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I sent her out. - Christ, Cathleen!
dialog: Do you even have the slightest idea
dialog: what this means? Do you realize the
dialog: kind of effect this could have on
dialog: me and the reputation I've spent
dialog: the past eight years of my life
dialog: trying to build? For you and the
dialog: children and the company?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank, I swear to you, whatever
dialog: Mona Lauder saw or thought she saw
dialog: was entirely a figment of that
dialog: woman's hateful imagination! Yes.
dialog: I'd spoken with Raymond Deagan on
dialog: certain occasions - he brought his
dialog: little girl to Eleanor's art show!
dialog: But evidently, even here in
dialog: Hartford, the idea of a white woman
text: even speaking to a colored man is
dialog: more than any -
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Please! Spare me the Negro rights!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank, you know what that woman is
dialog: capable of. Besides I - I've
dialog: already given him notice. We won't
dialog: be seeing the man again.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Is that why you're home? Because of
dialog: what Dick said?
text: Frank just looks down at his drink, jiggling the glass.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank?

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What, Frank.

dialog: Did something happen at work?
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I guess you could call it sort of
dialog: an early Christmas bonus.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What do mean?
text: Frank takes his drink over to the couches and flops into it
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A month of rest and relaxation'!
dialog: Can you imagine? During the busiest
dialog: season of the year?! I mean what a
dialog: goddamn honor!! But I guess when
dialog: you consider the bang-up job I've
dialog: been doing, ever since good ole Dr.
dialog: Bowman entered the scene! And for
dialog: being, as Millstein put it - what? -
dialog: "years overdo'! -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: But Frank you do deserve a

dialog: them.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well, Palm Springs is supposed to

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Say! What do you know, pop's home!
dialog: What're you doing home, pop?

speaker_heading: CATHY

text: Through the large, Christmas-trimmed windows of Keller’s Drug-
text: store we see Cathy, wearing sunglasses and scarf, crossing
dialog: the street.
text: Raymond waits at the corner of the old-fashioned, seasonally
text: adorned establishment, moderately busy for the middle of the

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Hello.

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Hello.

dialog: Thank you for meeting me. I realize

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

dialog: counter where
text: Two women are glaring and whispering.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: You sure everything's alright?
text: Cathy exhales, closing her eyes. She shakes her head.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What is it?
text: The SODA JERK has been watching them from the other end of

speaker_heading: SODA JERK
dialog: Uh - Is there something I can do

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: RAYMOND

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It just isn't plausible, Raymond,

text: Raymond tenses.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: You've been so very kind. To me.
dialog: And I've been perfectly reckless
dialog: and foolish in return... thinking -
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What? That one person could reach
dialog: out to another? Take an interest in
dialog: another? And that maybe, for one
dialog: fleeting instant, could manage to
dialog: see beyond the surface - beyond the

text: Cathy sighs and thinks a moment
speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: TALL MAN

speaker_heading: TALL MAN

speaker_heading: CATHY

text: Sarah's attention has turned to a powder blue Chevrolet

text: in the car.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mother! Can I sleep over at Hutch's

text: and the car begins to pull out.
text: Sarah smiles as it approaches. But as she lifts her hand to

text: the window as they go.
text: Sarah watches as the car speeds off down the road. She looks
text: back in the direction of her group, but now her classmates
text: are a good block away. And the snow has begun picking up. So
text: she plunges her hands in her pockets and starts up after
dialog: them.
text: Up ahead where the block narrows, Hutch and two of his
text: friends stand leaning against the fence, sharing a cigarette.
text: Sarah notices them ahead.
text: Hutch is the first one to spot her, and he stares hard as she
text: approaches. A chill of music is felt as Hutch leans over and
text: starts whispering to the others. As they look back at her and
text: laugh the music picks up a jazzy beat.
text: Sarah approaches, tucking her head down sullenly.
speaker_heading: HUTCH

speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: Hey! Where ya goin’? We just want
dialog: to play!

text: She comes to a busy intersection and turns off into an alley.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY -AFTERNOON
text: Sarah tears around a trash dumpster only to discover that the

speaker_heading: HUTCH

speaker_heading: 2ND BOY

speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: Yep! She made a wrong turn alright!
text: He doubles back with his rock, pitcher style, as the music
text: explodes into wild rhythm, and the other two follow.
speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: Just like her daddy!
text: All at once their rocks go hurling at Sarah, with Hutch's
text: coming last and hard and hitting her in the head. It knocks

text: As they near their table they are intercepted by a large

text: the sparkling water, which is littered with swimmers and
text: children frolicking by the steps.
text: Frank is just finishing some laps and stops at the shallow
text: end to catch his breath. He sits down on a step, still half-
text: submerged, and smiles at the mothers of the splashing
text: toddlers. He notices something at the other end of the pool.
text: A few members of the blond family are just coming out
text: dressed in swimwear and robes. They grab a few lounges and
text: chairs and start to settle. The pretty son doesn't seem to be
dialog: among them.
text: Frank stands, stretches. He steps out of the water and
text: reaches for his towel just as a small black boy, age 4 or 5,
text: goes skipping past him into the first step of the pool.
text: His father, a HOTEL WAITER, is running over from the hut-

speaker_heading: HOTEL WAITER

dialog: Now what did I tell you about going

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Hello, there.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: And what's it doing there?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I’m waxin’ pop’s car! It’s gonna
dialog: look swell, pop.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: David! How many times do I have to
dialog: tell you children - you are not
dialog: permitted outdoors in this kind of
dialog: weather if you're not properly
text: dressed. It’s ten below zero
dialog: outside, they're expecting
dialog: flurries! Do you understand me?
dialog: David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes ma’am.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Because I give up. If you children
dialog: want to go and catch your death of
dialog: cold then so be it. I mean you try
dialog: talking sense to them, Frank
dialog: because nothing I say ever seems to-
text: All of the sudden Frank bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank!
text: Janice and David are stunned, staring at their father
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Frank! What's the matter - !
text: She gets up from her chair and starts over to him, a dark
text: mist of music forming.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh - God!
text: Janice begins to cry.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: Janice. David. Go upstairs to your
dialog: rooms.
text: Janice stands, sobbing. David remains, transfixed.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Now!
text: Janice runs up the stairs and David follows in a trance.
text: Cathy stands frozen near the foot of the stairs.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (crying)
dialog: Oh - Cathy...
text: She approaches him but slowly, with a strange foreboding.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What, Frank. What is it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Something happened...
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What?
dialog: (nothing)
dialog: What.
dialog: 
text: Frank cries almost like a baby.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’ve fallen in love with someone.
text: Cathy stares.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Who wants to be with me.
text: For a moment, just having said it sobers him some, and he
text: looks back at her. Then he crumbles again.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Oh Cathy, I think I might have to
dialog: go!
text: Music deepens as Cathy numbs, staring flatly, unable to move.
dialog: 122.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I just - I never knew... what it
dialog: was like - I know how cruel that's
dialog: sounds. But I'm not... - Oh God,
dialog: Cathy. I tried! I tried so hard to
dialog: make it go away... I thought I
dialog: could do it... for you and the
dialog: children... But I can't! I
dialog: can't!...
text: He buries his head in his hands.
text: After several seconds she responds.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (lifeless)
dialog: I assume then... you'll be wanting
dialog: a divorce?
text: Frank looks up at her, puffy-eyed. But suddenly the tears
text: seem to have stopped.
text: Cathy looks back at him like a stone.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Cathy I’m so sorry.
text: But all at once she turns, and picking up a glass from the
text: table walks straight-headed up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Cathy enters, closes the door and stands frozen, in the dark
text: for several seconds.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: We look down at Frank who stands alone in the empty living
text: room. He turns and walks over to the bar and limply pours
text: himself a drink. He stands frozen a moment, drink in hand, as
text: music gathers, softly. Then he throws it back, walks over to
text: his coat and hat and opens the front door of the house. He
text: turns back around for one last look - and closes the door
text: behind him.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING
text: Cathy stands outside her door looking out the landing window.
text: She hears the sound of Frank’s car starting off.
dialog: 123.
text: Filtered through a new snowfall, the red of his brakes tint
text: the dusky sky and rouge her silent profile. Music deepens.
text: Cathy walks to the window and stares hard at the telephone.
text: She lifts the receiver to her ear. She dials.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (quivery)
dialog: Eleanor? Eleanor it’s me, Cathy.
text: Music opens as we

scene_heading: EXT. FINE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A soggy snowfall continues as we glide through shiny branches
text: outside the Fine’s house toward the rosy glow of an upstairs
text: window. There we see Cathy in the glow of Eleanor's bedroom,
text: telling her friend the whole story.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Eleanor reaches for Cathy's hands, music settling.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Oh, Cathy.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: So you see, El. You see why I
dialog: couldn't tell you anything.
dialog: Anything at all.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Oh you dear, sweet kid. Ina
dialog: million years I couldn't have
dialog: imagined. Not Frank! I suppose
dialog: divorce really is the only option -
dialog: if only to keep it as far from the
dialog: children as possible.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I think that's what's been the
dialog: hardest of all. The endless
dialog: secrecy. Our entire lives just -
text: shut in the dark.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Are there savings?
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Nothing much to speak of. And
dialog: certainly not with Frank's job on
dialog: the line.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Well honey, you know, if there's
dialog: anything you need, anything at all -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh, El...
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I mean it. We're here. Alright?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Thank you, El. For always having
dialog: been.
text: Cathy reflects a moment and stands, walking toward the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: You know it's funny.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What's that.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: This whole time, the only person
dialog: I've been able to talk to. About
dialog: any of this.
dialog: (turning back to her)
dialog: Was Raymond Deagan.
text: Eleanor looks at Cathy in disbelief.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: It’s true. Well, not in the way
dialog: Mona intended - Nothing like that!
dialog: We would just talk! But... Somehow
dialog: it made me feel - oh, I don’t know.
text: Alive somewhere.
dialog: 
text: She glances out the window at the rain-dampened snow.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh Eleanor, I know it sounds
dialog: ridiculous and mad...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: CATHY(cont 'd)
dialog: But I do, I think of him. What he’s
dialog: doing, what he’s thinking. I do -
text: Cathy turns back to her friend with the wistful smile of a
dialog: girl.
text: Eleanor glances off.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: El?
text: Eleanor gets up and starts tending to the tray of empty cups.
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: What can I say? You’re so full of
text: surprises. I’m speechless.
text: Cathy looks at her.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: (little laugh)
dialog: Though I'm sure I must have looked
dialog: entirely the fool, crusading away
dialog: against Mona Lauder and all her so-
dialog: called inventions-!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Eleanor! - How can you say such a
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: I didn't say a word! who am I to
dialog: tell anyone how to lead their
dialog: lives?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: But El! Nothing happened between
dialog: us! I told you that!
speaker_heading: ELEANOR
dialog: Cathy it's none of my business. But
dialog: you certainly make it sound as if
dialog: something had.
text: A soft bed of music rises as Cathy looks back at her
text: disarmed.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 126.
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: Music continues as Cathy returns home, hanging up her coat
text: and stepping into the dark, silent house.
text: She walks toward the french doors, etched in silver, and
dialog: stops.
text: There, filtering moonlight through its gilded maze, the
text: branch of Silver-tip spruce still sits in a vase by the
dialog: window.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: (off)
dialog: Mrs. Whitaker?
text: Cathy turns toward the kitchen.
text: Sybil stands in the shadows near the kitchen door.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Sybil.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: I'm sorry to disturb you ma'am, I
dialog: just...
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yes, Sybil?
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: It's something I've been wanting to
dialog: tell you, ma'am, for some time -
dialog: Something I believe you'd surely
dialog: want to know - even if it isn't...
dialog: exactly my place...
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Sybil, what is it?
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: It's about the little colored girl,
dialog: ma'am. The one that got hit?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Yes. What about her?
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: I'm sorry, ma'am, but it was Mr
dialog: Deagan's little girl, Sarah -
dialog: 127.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What! Oh God, Sybil, it wasn't!
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: The neighbors tell me she's doing
dialog: just fine -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh that dear, sweet little girl.
dialog: (to Sybil, suddenly
dialog: incensed)
dialog: How in God's name, Sybil, could you
dialog: not have told me this? That was
dialog: weeks ago - !
dialog: 
text: She turns and marches to the entry hall, Sybil following.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Oh, Mrs. Whitaker, please don't be
dialog: cross with me! I didn't want to -
dialog: makes things any worse!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (throwing on her coat)
dialog: Sybil, Sybil do you have any idea
dialog: where Mr. Deagan lives?
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: I believe he's been at his father's
dialog: old place on 12th and Governor.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: 12th and Governor. Thank you
dialog: Sybil.
text: Cathy grabs her purse and opens the door, rain falling.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: You’re going there now?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Please just keep an eye on the
dialog: children for me. I won’t be long.
dialog: (she starts out)
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Mrs. Whitaker!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (turns back, hurriedly)
dialog: What?
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Would you like me to go with you

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No, Sybil. No. I’ll be fine. Thank

scene_heading: INT. DEAGAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Raymond is bringing a freshly made cup of hot chocolate into

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: And here we have it! Your daddy's
dialog: super-duper world-renowned hot
dialog: cocoa specially prepared for his
dialog: super-duper number one girl!
text: He hands the cup to Sarah who is stretched out on the couch
text: with pillow and blanket watching TV. A small, square bandage
text: on her forehead still marks her injury.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thank you, daddy.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: How you feeling, baby?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Fine, daddy.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: What's that you're watching,
dialog: anyway?
text: There's a knock at the door. Raymond stops.
dialog: 129.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Who on earth...?
text: He walks to the front.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Yes?
text: The door opens on Cathy, turning suddenly to face him.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Raymond! Oh Raymond I just heard.
dialog: Just this instant. I heard and I
dialog: got in my car.
dialog: (she stops)
dialog: How are you? How's Sarah?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: We're fine. Thank you.
text: A car passes and Raymond looks out nervously.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (semi-whisper, gesturing)
dialog: Meet me around the side.
text: Cathy nods and starts back down the steps as Raymond steps
text: back inside the house.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (grabbing his coat)
dialog: Sarah, everything's alright, honey.
dialog: I'll just be outside for a minute.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Okay daddy.
scene_heading: EXT. DEAGAN HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Cathy stands facing away, softly illuminated by an outdoor

text: Raymond stands near the corner of the house, looking at her.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh Raymond.
dialog: (taking a few steps
dialog: closer)
dialog: What you must have been through.
text: Raymond looks down and shuffles forward some as well.
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What's being done, to the boys
dialog: who-?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Nothing. I won't make her go
dialog: through it again. Not now. Not with
text: rocks coming through the window
dialog: every night.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Raymond, that's hateful.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: It's not white's throwing them -
dialog: it's coloreds.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Oh, yea - Seems to be the one place
dialog: where whites and coloreds are in
dialog: full harmony. Anyway, we'll be out

dialog: all.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: You're moving?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Yea.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I have a...
dialog: (emptying some flooded

dialog: brother in Baltimore. Says he
dialog: can find me work out there. So
dialog: we're packing up the house. Two
dialog: weeks Friday we'll be on the 4:30
text: train, heading South.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: But what about your business, your

speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: The business is through. No one's
dialog: gonna hire me.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 131.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND( cont'd)
dialog: So I'm selling the shop to a cousin
dialog: of mine. No...
dialog: (he looks off)
dialog: It's pretty well finished for me
dialog: here.
dialog: (a thought stops him)
dialog: I've never lived anywhere but
dialog: Hartford.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (all vulnerability)
dialog: Perhaps... sometime in the
dialog: future... after you're settled - I
dialog: could... perhaps come for a visit
dialog: See Baltimore? You see I... Well it
dialog: looks as if I'm to be single again.

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Please call me Cathy.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Cathy.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No one would know us there.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: I'm just not sure... it would be
dialog: such a wise idea. After... well,
dialog: everything that’s -
text: Cathy looks at him, feeling the first chill of an impending
dialog: loss.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: All that matters now - what’s got
dialog: to matter most - is what’s right
dialog: for Sarah. I’ve learned my lesson
dialog: about mixing with other worlds. And
dialog: I’ve seen the sparks fly...
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: All kinds.
text: Cathy turns away, hiding sudden tears.
dialog: 132.
text: Raymond puts a hand on her shoulder, which she covers with
dialog: hers.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Have a proud life. A splendid life.
dialog: Will you do that?
text: She closes her eyes.
text: He kisses her fingertips.
speaker_heading: RAYMOND
dialog: Goodbye Cathy.
text: His fingers slip from hers.
text: She stands a moment, the black, liquid sky continuing its
text: downpour, then starts walking, hurriedly, to her car. She
text: doesn’t look back.
text: Raymond watches gravely, then turns and starts slowly back
dialog: inside.
text: To which a rising music as bottomless as the sea suddenly
text: answers, spilling over and engulfing what follows.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: The curtains are drawn and Cathy lays across the shadowy
text: surface of her bed, sobbing. Everything she's kept inside
text: seems to spill from her now, as we move in gently through
text: aquanautic shadows.
text: Music fades, leaving us alone with her sounds - when the
text: phone starts ringing. Cathy stops, listening. Then sits up in
text: bed and looks over at it, wiping her eyes. Then she slips off
text: the edge of the bed and walks over to the writing table to
text: answer it. Outside, the rain appears to have stopped.

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No. I was awake.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (through receiver)

speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: No. Of course.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (through receiver)
dialog: How are they, by the way?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Fine. Just fine. They still ask
dialog: when you'll be coming home.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know. I know. I guess that's -
dialog: partly why I was calling...
text: Frank sits hunched-over a little table in the dark. Behind
text: him, spread out in bed with newspapers and a half-eaten box
text: of chocolates, the pretty blond boy watches a large Tv.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I, uh - I got a call from Dick
dialog: yesterday. Said everything was...
text: set, papers drawn up.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Cathy just listens. Expressionless.
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (through receiver)
dialog: He wanted to know... how Thursday
dialog: was for you. Three o'clock
dialog: sometime. I told him I thought you
dialog: might have carpool Thursdays but I
dialog: wasn't absolutely certain. So I
dialog: said I would check.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: (distantly)
dialog: You never could remember my carpool
dialog: days. And they've always been the
dialog: same, Wednesdays and Fridays, as
dialog: long as I can remember.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (through receiver)
dialog: Wednesdays and Fridays. Of course.
dialog: Same old absent-minded -
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: What time... did you say on

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (through receiver)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: The appointment? What time?
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: CATHY

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: CATHY

dialog: Now what is today...?
text: She glances over at her desk-calendar, turning the page to
text: the proper day. It reads: SATURDAY, MARCH 1.
text: She copies the date down in her checkbook, then stops a
text: moment. She looks back at the calendar as if trying to
text: remember something. Snapping back to business, she tears out
text: the check, places it in an envelope and seals it. She gathers
text: up her other mail and stands, glancing once around the room
text: before grabbing her purse and sunglasses and starting out the
dialog: door.

speaker_heading: SYBIL
text: It’s Friday.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I know it is, but... There’s just
dialog: so much more to do now. I can

dialog: the table every week.
speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: No reason not to keep things up
dialog: Mrs. Whitaker. No reason at all.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I know.
text: Cathy stops in front of the mirror to fix her hair and put on

speaker_heading: SYBIL
dialog: Don't forget the grocery list.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Oh! Thank you, Sybil -
dialog: (she starts checking her
dialog: pockets)
dialog: I don't know how in the world I'd
dialog: ever manage - Here it is.
text: She takes out the shopping list but finds something else in
text: the pocket. She pulls out a scarf - the lilac scarf -
dialog: forgotten there since her afternoon with Raymond. Music
dialog: whispers.
text: She looks at it a moment, then up at the mirror where it's
text: reflected in her hand. She puts it on over her hair and
text: glasses and stops a moment, looking at herself.
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: I shouldn't be long, Sybil.
speaker_heading: SYBIL

scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Say - Mother!
speaker_heading: CATHY
dialog: Go and gather your things, David.

speaker_heading: JANICE

speaker_heading: CATHY

scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM - DAY
text: Cathy emerges out of the stairway onto the platform, a jumble
text: of boarding and goodbyes. She looks back and forth anxiously,
text: then starts walking down the platform toward the front of the
dialog: train.
text: She hurries along, looking every-which-way, past all the
dialog: others.
text: Then suddenly she stops.
text: Raymond stands on the platform, gingerly helping Sarah up the
text: steps of the train while a black attendant loads their
text: luggage into an open compartment.
text: Cathy starts over to them, but Raymond slips inside the train
text: without seeing her.
text: Cathy just stares at the door, watching others continue

dialog: 139.
text: A CONDUCTOR is passing.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: All aboard! Southbound train to New

text: Raymond reappears, stepping out of the train and addressing
text: the young attendant, who hands him his baggage slip.
text: Cathy takes a few unconscious steps in his direction.
text: Raymond tips the attendant and shakes his hand and starts
text: back to the door of the train. He takes one step up and
text: stops, turning around again.
speaker_heading: CONDUCTOR
dialog: All aboard! All aboard!
text: He sees her.
text: She smiles for being seen. Raymond smiles warmly back.
text: And suddenly - cruelly - the train begins to move. Though for
text: one luxurious moment it actually sweeps them together - with
text: Raymond gliding toward Cathy and then crossing her - before
text: setting off on its inexorable pull.
text: Cathy lifts a tiny hand goodbye.
text: Raymond lifts his in return.
text: She smiles, tears starting, as Raymond continues shrinking
text: from view before vanishing entirely with the snaking engine.
text: Suddenly everything is still.
