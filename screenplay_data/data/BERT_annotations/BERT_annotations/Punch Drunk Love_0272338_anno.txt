speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten

speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Do you realize that the monetary

text: RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....
dialog: 
text: sees Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
text: for a moment....then it drives off....then:
text: A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
text: alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
text: and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
text: placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: If you wanted to call me back I
dialog: could...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: I'm fine, I have your work number.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Ok...because of the time difference

speaker_heading: BARRY

speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Not very well.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Can I ask you, can I trust to leave

dialog: you so that when they get here you
dialog: could give them to them?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Ok.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: You think it's ok where I left it,

speaker_heading: BARRY

text: ON THE STREET.
text: Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
text: both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
dialog: his business.....
text: He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He

dialog: probably will, but I doubt it.
text: There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box

speaker_heading: BARRY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LATISHA

dialog: I saw your picture and I really
dialog: wanted to meet you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I came to drop my car off there on

text: Barry leans a little bit out of FRAME.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: -..really? That's nice...are you
dialog: lying?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: ---I thought I should tell you. I
dialog: didn't want to get too far along on
dialog: going out and be hiding something --
text: BEAT. He leans slightly back in FRAME.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: That's very nice. Thank you. Thank
dialog: you for saying that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're friends with my sister?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: How long have you known her?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: About six months.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: You like her?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Yeah. Yeah we get along well.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You didn't get along with her very
dialog: well?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Did you really come to meet me on
dialog: purpose or are you lying about
dialog: that?
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: No, no. I did.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: That's nice. It's nice.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've been looking around a lot
dialog: lately at promotional giveaways,
dialog: cross promotional work by some
dialog: companies. Do you remember all that
dialog: pudding?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: So that pudding was bought, I
dialog: bought that pudding because of a
dialog: pretty interesting promotion that's
dialog: sponsored by Healthy Choice and
dialog: American Airlines. It's designed to
dialog: encourage airline travel and
dialog: obviously designed to encourage
dialog: buying Healthy Choice products.
dialog: They make frozen meals, deli meats,
dialog: pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
dialog: creams, this sort of thing.....
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: --..I'm sorry....I lost my
dialog: thoughts, what I was saying....
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: You were talking about the
dialog: promotion --
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: -- the promotion says: buy any 10
dialog: Healthy Choice products and get 500
dialog: miles of airline travel or 1,000
dialog: for purchases made with a special
dialog: coupon.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: BARRY (CONT'D)
dialog: So in the supermarket, you notice
dialog: their products, first you notice
dialog: they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner
dialog: at $1.79 - that's a pretty good
dialog: deal....but then I noticed they had
dialog: soup at 89 cents a can..... and you
dialog: start to do the math and you start
dialog: to notice that it's a really
dialog: amazing deal because I stumbled
text: across the pudding at 25 cents a
dialog: cup. Now the crucial thing is the
dialog: bar codes on the label. That's
dialog: those little bar codes, you know?
dialog: The universal product codes?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: That's what's used to redeem the
dialog: mileage, so in noticing the
dialog: pudding, each cup had an individual
dialog: bar code -- in other words: Two
dialog: dollars and fifty cents for ten
dialog: cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
dialog: in the coupon: it's one thousand.
dialog: You see?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: You see?
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Yeah, no, I see --
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars
dialog: on pudding you could earn over one
dialog: million frequent flyer miles.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: That's insane. That is really,
dialog: really crazy. That's just crazy if
dialog: you spend three thousand dollars on
text: pudding.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: -...yeah....
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: So that was your pudding?
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: -+-.NO....
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: I'm sorry. I thought you said --
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: No I didn't say that.
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: I thought you said you bought all
dialog: that pudding --
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: My friend Carlos is doing it who
dialog: works with me. It's his. It's his
dialog: pudding, he's doing it. It's not
dialog: mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
dialog: do it. He's the one who's insane.
dialog: He only spent about one hundred
dialog: dollars so far though --
speaker_heading: LENA
dialog: Your sister was telling me a pretty
dialog: funny story about you, when you
dialog: guys were kids and you were
dialog: building a ramp for your dog and
dialog: you threw a hammer through a
dialog: window? Is that right? You threw a
text: hammer through a sliding glass
dialog: door?
text: Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very quickly,
text: holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his nose, and
text: then he smiles;
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I don't remember that, she might be
dialog: lying. I have to go the bathroom.
text: He gets up and goes.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Barry walks in and goes a little crazy. He's mad at himself
text: and he HITS a stall....it seems loose already and falls
text: straight to the floor.
text: This makes him go crazier and he continues to BEAT and KICK
dialog: the shit out of the bathroom/stall.
dialog: 58.
text: HOLD. He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks
text: around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he
dialog: exits....
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RESTARAUNT - MOMENTS LATER
text: Barry comes back and sits down, seems a little better. Tries
dialog: to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before: the

speaker_heading: BARRY

speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: You're hand is bleeding.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I cut myself.
speaker_heading: MANAGER

speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: On my knife.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Sir, a young man saw you coming out
dialog: of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I didn't do that.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: Why? ...what?
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Your hand is bleeding.
speaker_heading: BARRY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
