speaker_heading: GANDALF
dialog: No, Gimli. I would not take the road

dialog: choice.
text: ANGLE ON: BOROMIR thrusts, catching PIPPIN on the hand. PIPPIN

text: ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS’ EYES are fixed on a DISTANT DARK PATCH which

scene_heading: INT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GIMLI
dialog: Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the

dialog: this a mine.
dialog: (snorting)
dialog: A mine!

text: battle ... the rusting armor and shields are peppered with
dialog: arrows and axes
speaker_heading: BOROMIR
dialog: (grimly )
dialog: This is no mine ... It's a tomb!

speaker_heading: BOROMIR

text: CREATURE ... retreating into the MORIA CHAMBER as many COILING
text: ARMS seize the large doors.
scene_heading: INT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT
text: With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,

speaker_heading: GANDALF
dialog: (ominous)

speaker_heading: GANDALF (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes ... Sméagol he was once called
dialog: Before the Ring came to him, before it

speaker_heading: FRODO
dialog: (grim)
dialog: It’s a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when
dialog: he had the chance.
speaker_heading: GANDALF
dialog: Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s
dialog: hand. Many that live deserve death,
dialog: and some that die deserve life. Can you
dialog: give it to them, Frodo?
text: FRODO frowns.
speaker_heading: GANDALF (CONT’D)
dialog: Do not be too eager to deal out death
dialog: in judgment ... even the very wise
dialog: cannot see all ends. My heart tells me
dialog: that Gollum has some part to play yet,
dialog: for good or ill before this is over.
dialog: The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of
dialog: many.

speaker_heading: GANDALF (CONT’D)
dialog: There are other forces at work in this
dialog: world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
dialog: Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In
dialog: which case, you also were meant to have
dialog: it ... and that is an encouraging
dialog: thought.

speaker_heading: MERRY

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, there's an eye opener and no

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BALIN’S TOMB, MORIA - DAY

text: corner sits a stone walled WELL. A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls directly

text: block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white
text: stone. GIMLI falls to his knees...
speaker_heading: GIMLI

speaker_heading: GIMLI sobs.

speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: EXT. GALADRIEL’S GLADE, LOTHLORIEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: GALADRIEL
dialog: Will you look into the mirror?
text: ANGLE ON: FRODO looks with apprehension at the silver basin.
speaker_heading: FRODO
dialog: (warily)
dialog: What will I see?
text: GALADRIEL pours water into the basin from a silver jug ...a
text: GLOW rises from the water.
speaker_heading: GALADRIEL
dialog: Even the wisest cannot tell. For the
dialog: mirror shows many things ... things
dialog: that were ... things that are ... and
dialog: some things that have not yet come to
dialog: pass.
text: FRODO slowly steps up to the PEDESTAL ... he peers into the
text: glossy surface. The night sky is reflected in the water ...
text: suddenly a figure takes form ... the bowed figure of an OLD MAN,

text: THE VISION SHIFTS ... FRODO gasps in horror! The SHIRE is in
dialog: ruins!
text: THE IMAGE SUDDENLY WIDENS TO FILL THE SCREEN ... buildings
text: burning ... bodies strewn about ... DARK SHAPES of ORCS looting

text: is hacked down.
text: ANGLE ON: FRODO reels back as the mirror seems to grow. The
text: nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely.
text: IMAGE: HOBBITON ... now an INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND. The fields and
text: trees destroyed ... replaced with BRICK FACTORIES belching
dialog: smoke!
text: IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled HOBBITS into the FACTORIES!
text: We see SAM ... MERRY ... and ROSIE COTTON. SOOT-STAINED and

text: SUDDENLY, the mirror goes dark ... and out of the black abyss a
scene_heading: SINGLE EYE GROWS.
text: CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable to move or cry out. The RING
text: dangles from his neck, inches above the water ... not shimmering
text: with curls of steam. FIRE erupts around the EYE.
text: WITH A YELL, FRODO pushes himself away from the pedestal and
text: collapses on the ground. Light instantly fades from the mirror.
text: FRODO comes to his senses ... he is shocked.
text: ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched
dialog: by the horror.
speaker_heading: GALADRIEL
dialog: I know what it is you saw ... for it is
dialog: also in my mind. It is the future,
dialog: Frodo. It is what will come to pass if

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
speaker_heading: GALADRIEL

speaker_heading: GALADRIEL (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: BOROMIR (CONT’D)

dialog: I’m sorry, Frodo ... Frodo...
text: FRODO suddenly finds himself on the stone steps ... he clambers
text: up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars.
text: FRODO cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of
text: mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around him.
text: FRODO peers out from the seat ... the world seems to shrink. In
text: all directions, VIEWS of far off lands TELESCOPE towards him
text: through the mist.
text: IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of holes in the MISTY MOUNTAINS ...
text: FLAMES rise from MIRKWOOD ... Grim faced EASTERLINGS march to
