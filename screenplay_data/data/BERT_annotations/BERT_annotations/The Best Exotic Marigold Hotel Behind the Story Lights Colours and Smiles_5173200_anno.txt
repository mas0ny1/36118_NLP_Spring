speaker_heading: (ON PHONE)
dialog: Thank you for your patience.
dialog: Your call is -
text: A slightly-accented voice finally interrupts.
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Mrs Greenslade, thank you for
speaker_heading: WAITING -
speaker_heading: EVELYN
speaker_heading: (OVERLAPPING)
dialog: Yes, now if you could stay on the
dialog: phone for a moment and talk to
dialog: me, just talk to me. I'm not
dialog: even clear, I don't actually
dialog: understand what it is I'm trying
dialog: to order. Is wireless the same
dialog: as wi-fi? And what do either of
dialog: them have to do with broadband?
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Mrs Greenslade, since the account
dialog: is not in your name, before we
dialog: can make any changes we need to
dialog: speak to the account holder. Can

speaker_heading: EVELYN

speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE

speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: We're late.
scene_heading: 4 INT. CORRIDOR. INNS OF COURT - NIGHT 4
text: Moments later. Graham and Giles walk down the corridor.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Bloody retirement parties. Hard
dialog: cheese, soft wine, and endless
dialog: speeches. Why do people do that?
dialog: No one ever said about any kind
dialog: of party: it was a wonderful
dialog: occasion, just a shame that the
dialog: speeches were so short.
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: it'll be you one day.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: One day very soon.
speaker_heading: GILES

scene_heading: 4A INT. HALL. INNS OF COURT - CONTINUOUS 4A
text: At one end of the hall, a very old JUDGE is giving a very
dialog: dull speech.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: An occasion such as this leads
dialog: one to cast ones mind back to the
dialog: days when I first entered my
dialog: pupillage. I had the very good
dialog: fortune of serving as a junior to
dialog: Mr Justice Stancombe
text: Graham's not listening any more. He's looking around the
text: room. At the old, tired faces.
speaker_heading: JUDGE (CONT'D)
dialog: . the unwelcome news that I
dialog: would transfer Chambers, bringing
dialog: to mind the old adage a fronte
dialog: praecipitium, a tergo 1upi
text: Everything seems to slow down, the judge's mouth moving
text: more and more sluggishly, though his voice remains the
text: same. The effect is strange .. then the sound of laughter.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: This is the day.
text: Everyone looks round at him. He's almost as surprised as
text: they are that he's spoken out loud.
speaker_heading: GILES
dialog: Graham?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: This is the day.
text: He turns and walks out.
scene_heading: 5 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 5

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Listen, young lady. I want a cup
dialog: of tea, and I want it now.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: The trolley will be along
dialog: shortly.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: How hard d'you have to fall down
dialog: before you get some proper
dialog: attention? Hours I've been lying
dialog: here, and not a single doctor has
dialog: come to see me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: KAREN

speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: A doctor did try and examine you,
dialog: and you sent him away.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: That one?
text: She looks up to the far end of the ward, where a doctor is
text: washing his hands. He's black.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: He can wash all he likes, that
dialog: colour's not coming out. I want
dialog: an English doctor.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: An English doctor? Why didn't
dialog: you say so? I'll get one right
dialog: away.
text: She goes away, comes back moments later with a tall,
text: handsome doctor. The bad news for Muriel is
speaker_heading: KAREN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Dr Ghujarapartidar. And

text: A young estate agent, EVAN, is showing DOUGLAS and JEAN
text: around a very small, and very beige bungalow.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: So as I say, what you're looking

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What if we fell somewhere else?
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: It's just that we might not
dialog: manage to plan our sudden fall in
dialog: the exact corner where the button
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: EVAN
dialog: Yeah. As I say -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: And would it be possible to get
dialog: the rail to go through the middle
dialog: of the room as well?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
speaker_heading: DARLING
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: To help us get across, not just
dialog: around?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
speaker_heading: (TO EVAN)
dialog: Could we have a moment, please?
dialog: Thanks. Thanks so much.
dialog: Evan goes.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Thirty years in the Civil Service
dialog: and this is all we can afford?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No. But try it anyway.

speaker_heading: JUDITH

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Judy, I know what you're asking -
speaker_heading: JUDITH
dialog: It's Judith.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Judith. And trust me, I've still
dialog: got it.
text: The bell goes; the signal for the women to get up and move
text: along to the next table. Judith leaves without looking
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I just can't find anyone that
dialog: wants it.
text: Another hopeful candidate arrives opposite Norman. And

speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: This is crazy. You're crazy.

speaker_heading: MADGE

text: She heads down the stairs. Craig and Jessica follow.
speaker_heading: MADGE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JESSICA)
dialog: It's one of the great mysteries

dialog: should choose to spend her life
dialog: with this fraction of a man.
speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: I still don't understand what's
text: going on.
speaker_heading: CRAIG
dialog: I just asked her to babysit. And

speaker_heading: JESSICA
dialog: But you love babysitting.
speaker_heading: MADGE

speaker_heading: LIAM

speaker_heading: KATIE
dialog: We had Chinese and stayed up

speaker_heading: LIAM
dialog: If you don't go, tonight we could

speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: It's tempting, my darlings, but
dialog: you know why I must leave.
speaker_heading: LIAM
dialog: We know.
speaker_heading: KATIE

speaker_heading: LIAM AND KATIE

speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: got worse.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 8A.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: So when do I have the operation?
speaker_heading: DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
dialog: I'm afraid you'll be on a waiting

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: At my age, I can't plan that far
dialog: ahead. I don't even buy green
dialog: bananas.
speaker_heading: DR GHUJARAPARTIDAR
dialog: There is another way. Our

dialog: to out-source you to another
dialog: hospital, where they can perform
dialog: the procedure almost immediately,
dialog: and at a fraction of the cost.

scene_heading: 22 INT. BOARDING GATE. AIRPORT - EVENING/NIGHT 22
text: The passengers from Flight 1045 to Delhi are seated at the
text: gate, waiting to board.
text: Muriel is wheeled up by an attendant and parked at the end
text: of the only remaining row of empty chairs. Douglas and
text: Jean are already sitting there.
text: Jean smiles politely as Graham sits down a couple of seats
dialog: away.
text: Norman arrives, carrying his battery radio, sees an empty
text: place between Jean and Madge, who is sitting at the end.
text: He smiles knowingly at Madge as he sits.
text: Finally Evelyn takes the only available space, between
dialog: Graham and Douglas.
text: And there the seven passengers wait patiently, unaware of
dialog: their common fate.
text: The sound of a jet engine, quiet at first, finally engulfs
dialog: them.
scene_heading: 23 EXT. RUNWAY. INDIA - DAWN 23

scene_heading: 24 INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL, DELHI - DAY 24
text: Evelyn, Douglas, Jean and Graham are descending on an

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Obviously one's read one's
dialog: Kipling, but we view this as an
dialog: opportunity to explore another
dialog: culture, as well as making new
dialog: friends. And a retired judge is
dialog: just the class of guest one was
dialog: hoping for, isn't it Douglas?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: (TO EVELYN)
dialog: And is this your first time in
dialog: India?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You don't seem like an
dialog: experienced traveller.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I'm not. Although one has read
dialog: one's guidebooks.
text: Jean blinks. Evelyn and Graham share a smile. Douglas
text: hides his. And Madge sees it all.
text: As they head towards the baggage carousel, they're met by
text: Muriel and Norman, emerging from the elevator. Norman is
text: pushing Muriel's wheelchair.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Norman Cousins.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Madge Hardcastle. A pleasure.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Play your cards right, it could
dialog: be.
text: Madge stares at him. A voice comes over the tannoy.
speaker_heading: AIRPORT ANNOUNCER

text: After a moment, Graham says
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Alright. Plan B.
scene_heading: 26 INT. DELHI AIRPORT - DAY 26
text: Moments later. They're all moving briskly through the hi-
text: tech, ultra-modern, beautifully air-conditioned building.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Of course it's a good idea. Who
dialog: can you trust if not a High Court
dialog: Judge?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: And this way we see more of the
dialog: country.
text: Norman is pushing Muriel's wheelchair.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: (leaning down, to
speaker_heading: MURIEL)
dialog: If anyone asks, say you're my
dialog: mother. I don't want people to
dialog: think we're together.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: In your dirty dreams.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Douglas, these are not words that
dialog: often pass my lips, but you may
dialog: actually be right. The country
dialog: seems to be rather more civilised
dialog: than one originally thought.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. DELHI BUS STATION - EVENING 27
text: Moments later. Our heroes are in the middle of an
text: extraordinary scene. Stifling heat, deafening noise; the
text: chaos, the bustle, the grime, the crowds, the life.
text: They're surrounded by taxi drivers, baggage
text: handlers,beggars etc. All clamouring for their attention.
text: Evelyn looks a little shocked. Jean is traumatized, a

dialog: 
dialog:

text: Graham, at the ticket booth, triumphantly holds up a

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (shouting over the din)
dialog: The bus will drop us in the
dialog: centre of town. We can take tuk-
dialog: tuks the rest of the way!
text: They follow him through the hordes. And see their bus.
text: It's absolutely rammed. People are practically hanging out
dialog: of the windows.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: There's not enough room.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: It's time to prove the first and
dialog: only rule of India: there's
dialog: always room.
text: He starts to fight his way to the door. Evelyn's at the
text: back. She stops, for a moment, looks around her.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What larks, Pip.
text: Douglas is just ahead of her. He turns, smiles.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Let's hope so.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING 28
text: Muriel's wheelchair is strapped to the back of the bus,
text: which is screaming down the six-lane highway. A huge tower
text: of luggage is piled precariously on the roof.
text: The road appears to be complete chaos; cars, buses, even
text: cows overtaking each other.
text: The bus pulls into the outside lane to follow a truck which
text: is overtaking some slower vehicles. As the truck pulls back
text: into the inside lane, it reveals a huge truck barrelling
text: towards them on the wrong carriageway.
text: Norman, sitting at the front, screams his last scream...
speaker_heading: NORMAN
scene_heading: NOOOOOOO... . U
text: At the last minute, the bus pulls back into the inside

scene_heading: 29 INT. BUS - EVENING 29
text: Norman is grinning from ear to ear.

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'm loving this!
text: Evelyn is sitting next to Madge.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: A few months ago I was organising
text: the church flowers.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Are you struggling with the
dialog: feeling you're not in control of
dialog: your circumstances?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: A little.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: You know what the shortest prayer
dialog: in the world is?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Fuck it.
text: Evelyn laughs.
speaker_heading: MADGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not doing the church
dialog: flowers any more. May as well
dialog: enjoy the ride.
text: Douglas is watching a nice Indian family. They're having a
text: picnic. The father notices Douglas looking, offers him
dialog: some food.
text: Douglas makes the namaste gesture, takes some happily.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Are you insane? "Avoid all food
dialog: not from a reputable vendor, it
dialog: will have been washed with impure
dialog: water."
text: Douglas keeps eating, with great enjoyment.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: It's just a sandwich.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Marvellous. Then I'll have the
dialog: ham, cheese, and streptococcus,
dialog: please. Or perhaps the bacteria,
text: lettuce and tomato.
text: Douglas turns to Muriel.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Would you like some of this? I
dialog: believe it's aloo ka paratha.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: If I can't pronounce it, I'm not
dialog: eating it.
text: The cacophony of horns continues. Jean screams, as another

scene_heading: 30 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 30
text: The last of the light. The bus moves on through a beautiful
dialog: landscape.
scene_heading: 31 INT. BUS - NIGHT 31
text: Everyone is asleep, or trying to sleep.
text: Except Muriel. She reaches into her bag, and carefully
text: removes a biscuit. She surreptitiously lifts it to her
text: mouth, and starts to chew.
text: Madge has fallen asleep on Evelyn's shoulder. But Evelyn
text: is still awake, as is Graham.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: How long since you were here?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Forty years.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: As long as I was married.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He died recently. My husband.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: D'you think we're going to be

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

scene_heading: 32 EXT. BUS - DAWN 32
text: The sun rises. A beautiful, pearly dawn.
text: The bus drives through the great gates of Jaipur. Below,

speaker_heading: EVELYN (O.S.)
dialog: What exactly is a tuk-tuk?
scene_heading: 33 EXT. JAIPUR STREET - DAWN 33
text: Our heroes are squashed into a pair of them, facing
text: forwards and backwards, attempting not to swallow too much
text: dust as they wheel crazily through the teeming morning
text: streets of the city. They stare in amazement at the world
text: racing past them.
text: A scooter overtakes. A young man is driving, his
text: girlfriend riding side-saddle on the back. Her sari
text: billows out behind her. Douglas and Evelyn both watch her,
text: struck by this image of beauty, youth and vitality.
scene_heading: 34 EXT. STREET/GARDEN PATH. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34
text: The tuk-tuks have pulled up, and our travellers emerge,
text: exhausted and dirty, staring through some garden gates at
text: the Marigold Hotel. Once a beautiful building, once
text: possibly even luxurious, it is clearly in the process of
text: being given at least half the face-lift it badly needs.
text: Parts of the building are freshly painted, some of the
text: ornate balconies are crumbling, and one wall is clad with
text: crazily skewed bamboo scaffolding. A huge old tree towers
text: over an untended garden, its branches poking into the
text: windows of the building.
scene_heading: 34A EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34A
text: A young man leans out from an upper balcony to see the
scene_heading: arrival below: SONNY KAPOOR (early 20's).
text: He deposits a paint pot and brush on a parapet, and races
text: off across the rooftop.
scene_heading: 34B EXT. GARDEN PATH/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34B
text: Dazed and horrified, the travellers wander up the pathway.
text: A cow standing in front of them is pushed into the garden
text: by a couple of young houseboys who then run to the tuk-tuks
dialog: to collect their luggage.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: 34C EXT. STAIRWAY/COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - MORNING 34C
text: Sonny clatters down the steep steps, and comes tearing out
text: onto a verandah, as the travellers arrive in the courtyard
text: below. He spreads his arms wide.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Welcome to India!!!
text: They stare up at him.
scene_heading: 35 EXT/INT. COURTYARD/HALLWAY.BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 35
text: The courtyard is not without charm, although somewhat
text: delapidated. A fountain at the centre does not look as if
text: it has seen water in years, and faded awnings are strung up
text: haphazardly.
text: Sonny is leading Madge into the darkness of the building,
text: towards her room.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: This is a building of the utmost
dialog: character, which means that
dialog: perhaps not everything will
dialog: function in the way you expect it
dialog: to. But as the manager and chief
dialog: executive supervising officer of
dialog: the Marigold Hotel, I can tell
dialog: you with great pride that the
dialog: building has stood for centuries,
dialog: and will stand for many more, in
dialog: 100% shipshape condition. Please
dialog: follow me, carefully avoiding
dialog: that naughty stone there
dialog: round this corner, leading us
dialog: most successfully all the way to
dialog: . your bedroom!
text: The room is very small, comfortable, and tastefully
text: decorated. But there's no door.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Here. In here.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: My dear man. Rooms have doors.
dialog: What you're showing me here is an
dialog: alcove.
speaker_heading: SONNY
text: The door is coming soon, most
dialog: definitely.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: How soon?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Let us not concern ourselves with
dialog: details, Mrs Hardcastle. Rather
dialog: than speaking of doors, we should
dialog: instead take pleasure in the
dialog: freedom to roam.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Does your room have a door?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Oh yes.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Then that's where I'll be
dialog: staying.
scene_heading: 36 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 36
text: Douglas and Jean arrive at their room. Douglas goes in
text: through the arched doorway, promptly comes back out again.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Bird in the room! Bird in the
dialog: room!
text: Jean pushes him aside, goes on in. Several pigeons are
text: flying around in some panic.
scene_heading: 37 EXT/INT. VERANDAH/BEDROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 37
text: Evelyn arrives at her room, goes on in.
text: The room is light and airy. And rather nice. But all the
text: furniture is covered in sheets.
text: As Evelyn stands there, Sonny comes rushing in, yanks all
text: the sheets off, and runs out again.
scene_heading: 38 EXT/INT. BEDROOMS/TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 38
text: Muriel wheels herself towards her room. Standing inside is
text: a male nurse, AJIT.
text: Muriel swivels her chair around. Graham is just going into
dialog: his room.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: There's an Indian in there!
text: Graham smiles, goes on into his room. Which is dusty, but

scene_heading: 39 EXT. STAIRWAY, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 39
text: Norman is laboriously climbing the stairs to his room. He

scene_heading: 40 EXT. TERRACE, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 40
text: Ajit is attempting to explain himself to Muriel.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: My what?
speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: Your physiotherapist. To help
dialog: with your recovery after the
dialog: operation.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You're not touching me.
speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: Traditionally that is how
dialog: physiotherapy is practised.
scene_heading: 41 EXT. ROOF, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 41
text: Norman comes out onto the roof of the hotel. His room is
text: right in front of him, a kind of penthouse cabin. A bed,
text: but not much else. The trees poke in through the open
dialog: window.
text: He walks through the room, hangs his battery radio on a
text: hook and leans out of the balcony, surveying the view.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: This'll do.
scene_heading: 42 INT. RECEPTION - DAY 42
text: Jean is confronting Sonny.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I want to stay at the other

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Mrs Ainslie, prepare to be
dialog: amazed. This is that very
dialog: building!
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You've Photoshopped it!
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I have offered a vision of the
dialog: future.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: SONNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course I had hoped that by now
dialog: it would be the present. But in
dialog: India we have a saying:
dialog: everything will be alright in the
dialog: end. So if it is not alright,
text: then it is not yet the end.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What will start to make this
dialog: alright is for you to give us a
dialog: refund.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Of course if that is what you
dialog: desire, you must have it.
dialog: Absolutely no problem, I will
dialog: refund you completely.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You will? Straight away?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Without question, Mrs Ainslie, I
dialog: most definitely will. Straight
dialog: away in three months.
scene_heading: 43 INT. GRAHAM'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 43
text: Graham is taking some things out of his bag: an old map of
text: Jaipur, sepia-tinted photographs of a British family during
text: the Raj, official documents yellowing with age.
text: He picks up a photograph, looks at it.
text: From outside, we can hear Ajit, the physiotherapist
speaker_heading: AJIT (O.S.)
dialog: a stay of five days and it is
dialog: done under general anaesthesia.
dialog: A hip replacement usually takes
dialog: only two hours
scene_heading: 44 EXT. TERRACE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 44
text: Ajit's explanation continues. Muriel is trying not to
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: Your surgeon will remove the top
dialog: end of the thigh bone, and insert
text: an artificial bone instead. A
dialog: most routine procedure.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Have you got a marker pen on you?
speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I want to mark it. So you don't

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Is everything alright?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I was just going to find the

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I'm afraid he's dealing with my

speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I promised I'd call my son, to

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: And the phone in your room

scene_heading: 45A INT. EVELYN'S ROOM. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 45A

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, did you try jiggling it a
dialog: bit?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, did that.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Did you kind of bang it lightly
dialog: on the desk a few times?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: That too.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Hmm.
text: He twists off the mouthpiece of the receiver, lifts the
text: receiver carefully. And blows on it.

speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: How did you come to be here? In
dialog: India.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I invested our - well, my -
dialog: retirement money in our
dialog: daughter's internet company. She
dialog: assured me that as soon as the
dialog: start-up actually started up, and
dialog: the conversion from virtual to
dialog: actual proved sufficiently
dialog: viable, then she would be able to
dialog: pay it all back.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I'm not sure I understand what
dialog: most of those words mean.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: It turns out neither did she.
text: Douglas has put the mouthpiece back on, holds the receiver

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are. Good as new.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: No, of course not. I've got no

speaker_heading: MADGE

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: SONNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Please, we must cover his face.

speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.)

scene_heading: 54 INT. HOSPITAL, JAIPUR - DAY 54
dialog: The hospital puts the NHS to shame. It's hi-tech, bright,
dialog: and spanking clean.

text: Sonny pushes Muriel through the doors of the lobby. The
text: reception area is a forest of dark skin. Muriel is rigid
dialog: with fear.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.)
dialog: Initially you're overwhelmed.
dialog: But gradually you realise: it's
dialog: like a wave. Resist, and you'll
dialog: be knocked over ...
text: Sonny is in discussion with some doctors.
text: Then he turns to see that Muriel has vanished. Through the

dialog: down the path...
speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.) (cont'd)

scene_heading: 58 EXT. STREET, JAIPUR - DAY 58

text: Evelyn approaches them, holding up a piece of paper.
dialog:

speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Please, can anyone direct me to

text: Evelyn's piece of paper gets passed around: none of the

dialog: there's lots of pointing.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: She goes to move, but the kids are still all around her.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't . I don't

text: She gives them the contents of her pockets.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright? Alright now? Goodbye.
text: She starts to walk, is surprised that the entire posse of

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Graham was talking about this

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: You'd really rather stay here all

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Given the alternative, yes.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: When I walk out in the morning,

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Because you give them money.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: One does this trick where he

text: Evelyn has somehow made it to the central reservation. She
text: takes a deep breath, and plunges into the maze of traffic,
text: heading for the other side.
scene_heading: 61 EXT. RICKSHAW. SUBURBAN ROAD, JAIPUR - DAY 61
text: Graham is in a rickshaw. The rickshaw driver, PRAVESH, is

scene_heading: 61A EXT. BUILDING SITE/STREET. JAIPUR - DAY 61A
text: Some kids playing cricket.
text: The rickshaw weaves its way through them and comes to a
dialog: halt.
text: Graham gets out, and stands in the street, dwarfed by a
text: huge modern building, some months away from completion.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: This can't be right, surely?
speaker_heading: PRAVESH
dialog: I am thinking so, saab.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: But there were houses all along

speaker_heading: PRAVESH
dialog: I can take you some other
dialog: place..?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: No. That'll do for now. Thank
dialog: you.
text: He hands over some money, and Pravesh pedals away.
text: Graham turns to look at the boys playing cricket. One of
text: them, SANJAY, is batting.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me. There used to be
speaker_heading: HOUSES HERE
speaker_heading: SANJAY
text: All knocked down.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Don't grip so tightly with your

text: Sanjay looks puzzled.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
text: On the bat. The right is just a

text: Ajit is wheeling Muriel through the hospital.
speaker_heading: MURIEL

speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: As soon as you can walk onto the

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: They must have got lucky.
speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: It's strange. I think the more

text: He glances down at Muriel, who betrays no signof getting
dialog: Ajit's joke.
scene_heading: 63 EXT. MARKET. BACK STREETS - DAY 63
text: Evelyn is still searching for the right address. She's
text: turned off the main road, and is heading down a narrow side
text: streets. The city has become denser, and the walls seem to
dialog: have closed in.
text: She pushes her way through the crowded market.
dialog:

scene_heading: 63A EXT. PASSAGE/COURTYARD - DAY 63A
text: Uncertain, Evelyn turns down a narrow alley, and suddenly
text: finds herself in an enclosed courtyard strewn with
text: makeshift washing lines. The atmosphere is faintly
dialog: threatening.
text: As she tries to find her way out, she becomes aware that
text: she is being watched: the walls are full of doorways, and
text: people have come out to stare at her. She has stumbled
dialog: into their home.
text: Evelyn tries to suppress her panic, turning from one face
dialog: to another.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I'm so sorry. I didn't realise -
text: She backs into a kind of flatbed trolley, piled high with

speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry...

speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SURESH

speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Is that yes you understand, or
dialog: yes you can help me?
speaker_heading: SURESH
dialog: Yes.
text: Some of the children who have gathered laugh at this, and

speaker_heading: EVELYN

scene_heading: 64 EXT. WASTELAND - DAY 64
dialog: Graham is playing cricket with the teenagers. He's good,
text: too. He whacks a ball off into the distance.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: (TRIUMPHANT)
dialog: YES!
text: A boy runs off to fetch the ball. Graham half-runs, half-
text: walks to the other end, then turns for a second run,
text: breathing heavily. Then walks back to the crease, gets
text: ready for the next delivery.
text: It's hot and he's tired, but he hasn't felt this good for
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: SANJAY
dialog: Give me the ball. I can take
dialog: him.
text: He turns cheerily to Graham.
speaker_heading: SANJAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Down is where you're going,
dialog: Uncle.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Come on. Do your worst.
text: They're both enjoying the banter, as Sanjay heads back to
text: the beginning of his run-up, then turns and sprints in to
dialog: bowl.
text: As Graham watches Sanjay running towards him, Sanjay seems
text: to slow, his movements becoming sluggish, never seeming to
text: reach the crease. He looks at the faces of the other boys,
text: frozen, waiting. The ball seems to take forever to leave
text: Sanjay's hand.
text: Graham steps back, completely fails to play a stroke, and
dialog: is bowled.
speaker_heading: SANJAY
dialog: That's what I'm talking about! I

speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You came for a job?
speaker_heading: EVELYN

speaker_heading: JAY

speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes. We dunk biscuits into it.
speaker_heading: JAY
dialog: You dunk?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: It means lowering a biscuit into

dialog: the exact moment just before it

dialog: mouth, and enjoy the blissful
dialog: union of biscuit and tea

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Why would you not go out?

speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Spectacular.
speaker_heading: (TO GRAHAM)
dialog: I went to the temple you told me

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: So spiritual, I bet you hardly

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
text: No elephants, sadly. Still none.
speaker_heading: (TO GRAHAM)

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Well, I've just finished telling

text: Evelyn registers the lie, but says nothing.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I'm sure she wouldn't mind

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I grew up here. Just a short

dialog: and we had servants, everyone
dialog: did. We knew their wives, their
dialog: children. One boy, Manoj, became
dialog: my friend. We played a lot of
dialog: cricket together, played anything
dialog: we could. And that's how it
dialog: stayed for years. Until one
dialog: night, he became something more.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: We had a few months, we had that.
dialog: There was a weekend in Udaipur,

speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: For me it was bad enough. But I
dialog: already knew who I was, and I
dialog: think my family had guessed. For
dialog: Manoj, the disgrace was absolute;
dialog: a double taboo. His father was
dialog: fired, they were sent away, all
dialog: of them. I don't know what I
dialog: could've done, but it should've
dialog: been more than nothing. I put up
dialog: no fight. I let it happen.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Soon afterwards I went to
dialog: England, to University. I always

text: From outside, Sonny's voicecan be heard.
speaker_heading: SONNY (O.S.)

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: .. the Best Exotic Marigold
text: Hotel can rise like a phoenix to
dialog: its previous state of glory. And
dialog: when I say small injection, I
dialog: mean small in the sense of medium-
text: sized. Possibly larger.
speaker_heading: MR MARUTHI
dialog: This hotel was never glorious.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Just the phoenix part then.
speaker_heading: MR MARUTHI
dialog: How many rooms will there be?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Many.
speaker_heading: MR MARUTHI
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: A great amount. Plenty of rooms,
dialog: no question.

speaker_heading: SONNY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MR MARUTHI

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Mr Maruthi, I present to you one
dialog: of our beloved guests. Dear Mrs

dialog: much detail as you desire your
dialog: experience of the ambience and
dialog: atmosphere of the Best Exotic
dialog: Marigold Hotel.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Kill me. Kill me now.
text: Sonny steers Mr Maruthi towards the reception, speaks
dialog: quietly.
speaker_heading: SONNY
text: The wheel is spinning. But the
text: hamster is dead.
text: He stops, as he sees an elegant older woman standing in the
text: doorway. This is the redoubtable MRS KAPOOR.
speaker_heading: SONNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Mummyji! What are you doing
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: You called. I came.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I couldn't have called. The
dialog: phones don't work.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: That's why I came.
scene_heading: 78 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 78
text: Moments later. Sonny closes the door behind him.
text: His mother starts going through the contents of his desk.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: Who was that man out there?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: The contents of this desk are
dialog: mine. Don't open the drawers. I
dialog: must insist you don't open the
dialog: drawer.
text: Mrs Kapoor opens the drawer.

speaker_heading: SONNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me why you have come.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: Do I need a reason to visit my
dialog: favourite son?
speaker_heading: SONNY
text: No. He is in his mansion in
dialog: Delhi.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: My second favourite.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: He went to Kerala to make his
dialog: fortune.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: But make it, he did.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: As I will make mine. I have a
dialog: dream, Mummyji. A most brilliant
dialog: one: to out-source old age. And
dialog: not just for the British. There
dialog: are many other countries where
dialog: they don't like old people too.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: Your brothers own a third of the
dialog: hotel each, they are entitled to
dialog: a third of the profits.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Success does not happen
dialog: overnight, Mummyji. This is blue
dialog: sky thinking, and it requires
dialog: long-term strategy and patience.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: How is your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I look forward to you meeting
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: And I look forward to you meeting
dialog: the woman you will marry. She is
dialog: from a good family in Delhi.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I can marry as I choose, Mummyji.
dialog: I need no permission.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: I presume it is your girlfriend
dialog: who teaches you such nonsense.
dialog: One reason not to marry her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: What if I love her?
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: An even better reason. Now send
dialog: Young Wasim to the car for my
dialog: luggage.
speaker_heading: SONNY

speaker_heading: MURIEL

text: Anokhi just smiles at her radiantly.
speaker_heading: MURIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I worked in service for years,
dialog: looked after a lovely house. I
dialog: kept it spotless. You need a bit
dialog: more pressure on that brush.
text: Graham walks past, on his way out.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: She won't speak English. She's
dialog: what used to be called an
dialog: Untouchable. An outcast, born

text: even her shadow is polluted.
text: He greets Anokhi in Hindi, and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Where d'you go every day? Is it
dialog: a woman? Nip round there for a

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I don't think so. I'm gay.
dialog: Although nowadays more in theory

text: He leaves. A moment later, Jean comes rushing out.
text: Immediately she realises two things; first, that Graham has
text: already gone. And second, that Muriel is watching her.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Good morning.
text: Muriel says nothing.
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Lovely day.

speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MR DRARUNA
dialog: The Viceroy Club was opened by

dialog: and many of the fixtures have
dialog: remained unchanged since then.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Yes, I see that. Perhaps you
dialog: could tell me a little about the
dialog: clientele? Any maharajahs?
dialog: Wealthy widowed land-owners?
speaker_heading: MR DHARUNA
dialog: It is not the policy of this club
dialog: to divulge details of our

speaker_heading: MR DHARUNA (cont'd)
dialog: Good morning, Your Excellency.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Where do I sign up?
speaker_heading: MR DHARUNA
dialog: The admission fee is 120,000
dialog: rupees, and thereafter 15,000
dialog: rupees each month.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: I wonder if I might get a little
dialog: discount. Owing to my status.
speaker_heading: MR DHARUNA
dialog: Your status, madam?
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Yes. One was rather hoping to
text: fly under the radar, but one is a
dialog: member of the Royal Family.
speaker_heading: MR DHARUNA
dialog: Which member, madam?
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: I'm Princess Margaret.
speaker_heading: MR DHARUNA
scene_heading: (BOWING SLIGHTLY)
dialog: It is most surely an honour to

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes, you did say that. You did.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MR CHIDAMBRAM
dialog: While it is most pleasant to see

speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: .You ring in the morning.
dialog: Let's assume the person answering
dialog: will be a woman. She will have
dialog: had her breakfast. Tea or
dialog: coffee. Semi-skimmed milk,
dialog: always. If she's under 50 she'll
dialog: be contemplating yet another
dialog: diet, over 50 she'll have more or
dialog: less given up, and be eating
text: toast. The radio may be playing,
dialog: or more likely daytime TV. A
dialog: chat show, or a programme with a
text: moderator speaking to a panel of
dialog: young women whose boyfriends have
dialog: all slept with their mothers.
dialog: The girlfriends' mothers, I mean,

text: Sunaina is in the audience. She calls out.
speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: I'm not surprised people hang up

text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: That's the point. When the phone
dialog: rings and it's this robot
dialog: nobody wants a machine, but it's
dialog: almost worse when it's a person
dialog: behaving like one. All these
dialog: sales cliches just strung
dialog: together. 'Your call is

dialog: then sound like it.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: 'Your custom is valuable'.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Right. That one. Don't ever say

speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: 'Service is our middle name'.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes, when your middle name is
speaker_heading: ACTUALLY
speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: Shantanu.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Which is beautiful. You people
dialog: are young, vibrant, real. I'm

dialog: one of you.
speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: Her morning sounds like fun.
dialog: What are you doing here?

speaker_heading: EVELYN

scene_heading: 85 EXT. VICEROY CLUB BAR - EVENING 85

speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Excuse me. Would there be any
dialog: wealthy single men in tonight?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: There is one.
text: Madge puts some money into his breast pocket.
dialog:

speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Perhaps you could seat me next to
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: This way, madam.
text: He leads her along across the terrace. Madge follows,

text: The barman reaches an ornate suite of furniture. There's

speaker_heading: BARMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: His Royal Highness Prince Michael
dialog: of Kent.

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: She doesn't need to meet you
text: Sunaina absorbs this.
speaker_heading: SONNY (CONT'D)
dialog: She knows you are not from Delhi.
dialog: That you have no family money,

dialog: are a part of a new India she
dialog: cannot welcome.
speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: Isn't this where you tell her
dialog: what you want?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: That conversation will be easier

speaker_heading: SUNANINA
dialog: Do you love me?

speaker_heading: SUNANINA

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: In business, if you stand still,

speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: You didn't answer the question.
dialog: Do you love me?
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: My feelings for you cannot be

speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: It's a nice word, Sonny. And

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Sunaina, please. My mother is

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Why must you mock? I just want

dialog: one night, one wonderful night.
dialog: Tell me you don't know how that
dialog: feels.

text: couple of seats away from the woman. Who is called CAROL.
text: She sits there a moment, then sighs, and starts to talk to
dialog: the barman.
speaker_heading: MADGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Rejected again. Many years ago,
dialog: that man over there gave me the
dialog: most extraordinary night of my
dialog: life. He may seem coarse and
dialog: uncouth, but that only disguises
dialog: a tenderness and an exquisite
dialog: sensitivity to a woman's needs

speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: So what brings you to Jaipur,

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Yes, Carol. What brings you to
dialog: Jaipur?
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I run a small boutique travel
dialog: agency. But I've actually lived

dialog: worked in the Foreign Office.
dialog: Another silence.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You're very fit.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Oh god.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I mean you look like you keep
dialog: yourself in shape. Physically.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well, I did join a gym last year.
dialog: It cost a fortune, and I didn't
dialog: get any fitter. Apparently you
dialog: have to actually go.
text: Madge laughs. Norman doesn't. Then realizes that it was a
text: joke, lets out a too-loud bray of laughter.
speaker_heading: CAROL (CONT'D)
dialog: And so what do you do, Norman?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Me?
speaker_heading: CAROL

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: Well look, it's been lovely
dialog: chatting.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: No it hasn't.
speaker_heading: CAROL
dialog: No. It hasn't. But I really
speaker_heading: MUST -
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Carol?
text: She was about to go, stops.
speaker_heading: NORMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Can we drop all this pretence?
dialog: And start again? I'm not
dialog: charming. I'm not good at
dialog: repartee. And I'm not a
dialog: plutocrat with the sexual
dialog: capacity of a rutting rhino. My

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: MADGE

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: We have a date next week.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: What is wrong with you?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I wanted to prolong the

dialog: with the knowledge that soon I'm
dialog: going to eat, drink, and laugh
dialog: with someone, hold her to me,

speaker_heading: EVELYN

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: And to you. Sorry to butt in,

dialog: you'll pay.
speaker_heading: (TO AKRAM)
dialog: She'll give you two hundred.
dialog: Absolutely no more, final offer.
speaker_heading: AKRAM
dialog: One thousand rupees.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Pity.
speaker_heading: (TO EVELYN)
dialog: Now walk away. Walk away.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
speaker_heading: BUT -
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I know what I'm doing.
text: Evelyn complies, and they turn and walk away.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Yes. The thing is, you see, I
dialog: did actually want to buy that.
dialog: To brighten up my room.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: He'll come after us.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Do you think so?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Absolutely. This is how the game

speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you carrying a tap?
scene_heading: 97 INT. MARIGOLD HOTEL, DOUGLAS AND JEAN'S ROOM - DAY 97

text: Then stands.
scene_heading: 98 EXT. SWEEPER COLONY - DAY 98
text: Ajit is now pushing Muriel through a poverty-stricken slum.
text: The people live on the streets, or in collapsing tin
text: shacks. Everywhere there is struggle and deprivation.
text: And yet the pervasive atmosphere is nowhere near as
dialog: depressing as we would expect. The colours are bright, the
text: smiles on the children's faces even brighter.
dialog: Not that Muriel can recognise the joy, of course. She's
text: horrified by her surroundings. And acutely aware of the
text: stares of the slum-dwellers.
scene_heading: 98A EXT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 98A
text: A primitive brick and cement hut, one of the few amongst

scene_heading: 99 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 99

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: How soon can I leave?
scene_heading: 100 INT/EXT. HARDWARE SHOP - DAY 100
text: Douglas is talking to JAMSHED, who works behind the
text: counter. Evelyn sits outside.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: You see what I think, and of
dialog: course I'm no expert, is that the
dialog: valve seat has eroded, so we'll
dialog: need the washer changed and a new
dialog: seat re-ground.
text: Douglas glances back at Evelyn. Who betrays not the
text: slightest scepticism.
text: Jamshed studies the tap.
speaker_heading: JAMSHED
text: The gland nut has come away from
text: the spindle.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Well of course, it could be that
dialog: too. Can you fix it?
speaker_heading: JAMSHED
dialog: Not cheaply. Not cheaply. Most
dialog: expensively indeed.
text: Jamshed takes the tap to a workstation at the back, starts
text: to fiddle with it. Douglas joins Evelyn.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I was in a tuk-tuk the other day,
dialog: didn't seem to be taking the
text: usual route back to the hotel.
dialog: It turned out that the driver had
dialog: decided to take me to another
dialog: hotel, that he was sure I would
dialog: prefer. And of course one wants
dialog: to believe that he genuinely had
dialog: my welfare at heart, and that it
dialog: wasn't run bg his brother-in-law.

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: One wants to trust, in general,
dialog: don't you think? But you never
dialog: really know, do you?
text: Jamshed stops fiddling with the tap. And takes a hammer to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: The day I met my husband was the
dialog: day the fair came to town. My
dialog: girlfriend and I went on the
text: carousel. Her horse was fine.
dialog: But when the ride began I felt
dialog: mine give a little, like it might
dialog: collapse. Then these strong arms
dialog: were around me, holding the horse
text: together. And a voice in my ear
dialog: said "Just trust me". And I did.
dialog: Without question. Until the day
dialog: he died.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: How wonderful.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: The sale of our flat went through
dialog: last week. I had to sell it to
dialog: pay off Hugh's debts.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I've been forced to get a job out
dialog: here. Which, in fact, I love.
dialog: But even at Sonny's rates, I
dialog: still couldn't make ends meet.
dialog: After what my own husband did to
dialog: our life savings.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: So no. You're right. You never
dialog: know.
text: Jamshed holds up the tap. Which is now in several parts.
speaker_heading: JAMSHED
dialog: No good. You must be buying
dialog: another.
scene_heading: 101 EXT. PATHWAY/GATE/STREET, MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 101
text: Jean walks down the path to the gate.
text: She stops, looks fearfully at the chaotic sea of humanity
text: outside. She's unable to move.
text: Finally, she steps out. And is of course immediately
text: assaulted by the assorted kids, beggars, street vendors,
dialog: etc.
text: As anxiety begins to engulf her, she quickens her pace,
text: brushing through them as best she can, until she is almost
dialog: running.

scene_heading: 102 INT. ANOKHI'S HUT - DAY 102
text: Muriel is still at the tea party.

speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: She wants to thank you for your
dialog: kindness.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I haven't been kind.
speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: You're the only one that
text: acknowledges her.
text: Anokhi brings out a plate of food.
speaker_heading: ANOKHI
dialog: Tarkha dhal. Chapati.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I'm not eating that.
speaker_heading: AJIT
dialog: You will insult her very deeply
dialog: if you do not.
text: Muriel looks up. They're all still watching, waiting
text: smiling.
text: She looks at Anokhi's grandmother, as dignified as she is
dialog: old.
text: Muriel reaches out, takes something off the tray. And has
dialog: a bite. It's not too bad.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I'd still rather a Scotch Egg.
text: Then she sees something through the open doorway: the
text: children have turned her wheelchair on its side and are
text: spinning the wheels.
text: She's on her feet in a flash.
speaker_heading: MURIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Get off! Get off it, you dirty
dialog: thieving bastards!
text: Several terrified faces turn.
text: One little girl starts to cry.

speaker_heading: MURIEL (CONT'D)
text: I didn't see. They were playing.

scene_heading: 104 INT. STAIRCASE/CORRIDORS/OFFICE. PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICE.104
speaker_heading: JAIPUR - DAY

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: In the office.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: But I've filled out that form.

speaker_heading: MR CHIDAMBRAM
dialog: There is a process. You are

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: But it's the same enquiry I make
dialog: every day.
speaker_heading: MR CHIDAMBRAM
dialog: And therefore the same form you

speaker_heading: JEAN

dialog: that I don't?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: Unutterable beauty. Everywhere.
text: In the light, the colours, the

dialog: so teach me something every day.
text: The waiter brings their tea.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Is this milk pasteurized?
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: Yes madam.
speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: GRAHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: It's a pleasant surprise to see

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Is it?
text: She looks at him.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Yes. That's progress. Where
dialog: were you going?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: To the bank. I . was going to
dialog: the bank. Not that there's any

dialog: changed. But our daughter, you

dialog: One has to. Otherwise
speaker_heading: OTHERWISE
text: Graham worries she might be about to break down. He

dialog: tightly.
text: Graham is startled. He tries gently to pull back, but she
text: holds on.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
speaker_heading: JEAN -
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Oh god. Is it possible you feel
dialog: the same?
text: She brings his hand to her mouth, kisses it.
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'm gay.

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)

text: that passes as his shower. Hanging from a nail in the wall,
text: the battery radio is pumping out a bizarre Indian cover
text: version of the Chic song "Le Freak".
text: Norman is naked, and singing along lustily.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Aaaaaah, freak out! Le freak,

scene_heading: 114 INT. SONNY'S OFFICE. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 114
text: Sonny is in his office, going through the accounts.
text: There's a strange ringing somewhere nearby. He pays no
text: attention, then stops and thinks for a moment. Then
text: realises what it is.
text: He sweeps the pile of papers off the desk, starts
text: frantically looking for the telephone.
scene_heading: 115 EXT. UPPER COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 115
text: Graham and Evelyn are having drinks.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I've been getting out and about

dialog: of course I'd love to see
dialog: Udaipur. The lake you talked
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: I'd love to take you. Perhaps -

scene_heading: EVELYN AND DOUGLAS
speaker_heading: (SIMULTANEOUSLY)

speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: Good evening, Mrs Ainslie.
dialog: Please allow me.
text: He pulls a chair out for her. She shoots him a look of

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You're very kind. But I rather
dialog: think I'll turn in early.
dialog: Goodnight everyone.
text: She goes into her room.
scene_heading: 116 EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - EVENING 116
text: Muriel is sitting outside her room, doing the crossword.
text: Madge is coming through the arch, stops dead.

speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: Is this it?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: You're not worried about the

text: Norman shrugs.
speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Progress, Mrs Donnelly, Mrs

scene_heading: 118 EXT. STREET, POOR NEIGHBOURHOOD. JAIPUR - EVENING 118
text: Graham, Evelyn, and Douglas are walking quickly up a quiet
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
text: It's a false alarm. There's no
dialog: way they could find anything in
dialog: that office. They probably just
dialog: picked an address at random, just
dialog: to keep me off their backs. I'm
dialog: sure that's what happened. It's
dialog: going to be nothing. Don't you
dialog: think it's going to be nothing?
speaker_heading: EVELYN

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

dialog: I'm very pleased to meet you.
dialog: And if you could, if you would

dialog: I'd appreciate that very much,
dialog: AND -
text: He breaks off. She's walked past him, looking to the other
text: side of the road.
text: He turns to look at the men playing cards. Gaurika calls in
dialog: Hindi.
text: A beautiful-looking man looks up. MANOJ.
text: He looks across at the house. Stands up slowly as Graham
text: walks across the street towards him.
text: Graham reaches him. The two men just stand there for a
text: moment. Then they hug very tightly.
text: From the steps of the house, Gaurika watches.
text: Evelyn looks at her, fascinated.

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: First time going in to London

dialog: He'd always been so extraordinary
dialog: to me, so unique. But there he
dialog: was standing on the station
dialog: platform, utterly

dialog: Hated it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Sorry, talking too much. Blame a
dialog: good dinner out.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What was she thinking?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: His wife. Manoj's wife. She
dialog: knew who Graham was. Had he told
dialog: her?
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: D'you think we'll find out
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: Not me, I'm heading up to the
dialog: Badi Mahal Palace. Very excited,
dialog: been reading all about it.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: DOUGLAS
dialog: I would, if I could remember a
dialog: word.
text: Evelyn laughs. Then Douglas suddenly grabs her. And pulls
text: her out of the way of a motor bike, zooming past them.
text: Sunaina hasn't realised she nearly hit them, and powers on
text: towards the Marigold.
text: Douglas and Evelyn stand for a moment, startled, holding
text: each other. Something passes between them that embarrasses
text: them both. Then they part quickly, guiltily.
text: They're outside a small restaurant, and with exquisite

scene_heading: 123 EXT. COURTYARD, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 123

scene_heading: 125 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 125

text: In a different bed, in a different room, Sonny wakes up.

speaker_heading: MADGE

scene_heading: 130 INT. CORRIDOR, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 130

scene_heading: 131 INT. BEDROOM, MARIGOLD HOTEL - NIGHT 131

speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry . I
dialog: don't know what your name is, but

speaker_heading: SONNY

speaker_heading: (TO SUNAINA)
dialog: You, get out.
speaker_heading: (TO MADGE)
dialog: And Mrs Hardcastle, I expected

dialog: but nevertheless -
speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: Mrs Kapoor, I'm Sunaina.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: Since I will not be paying for
dialog: your services, your name is of no
dialog: interest to me.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: How do you know mine?
text: Sunaina is shocked to realise that Mrs Kapoor doesn't know
text: her name. Sonny steps forward reluctantly.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Because this . is my Sunaina.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: The girl who my son described as

speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR (cont'd)
dialog: Is there anyone in this building

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Mummyji, do not get the wrong
dialog: idea. Sunaina was not here to be
dialog: with Mrs Hardcastle. She was
dialog: here to have sex with me!
text: Mrs Kapoor turns to Sunaina. Who is speechless.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: This is the sort of woman you

text: One trader is unloading some fruit. A few guava roll off
text: the edge of his wagon.
text: Someone picks them up for him. It's Graham, who smiles as
text: he puts them back. The trader gives him a fresh one.

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I have seen the top of the

speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: A man... .?
speaker_heading: GRAHAM

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Carry on.
speaker_heading: GRAHAM
dialog: (smiling, unperturbed)
dialog: I didn't know how he'd been in
dialog: the meantime, didn't want to
dialog: guess. I brought disgrace upon
dialog: him and his family, and imagined
dialog: he might hate me for it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: But we talked all night. He's
dialog: been happy. He's led a peaceful
dialog: life, married to a woman who
dialog: understood him and loved him
dialog: nonetheless. But he's never
dialog: forgotten me. That's what he
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I asked his forgiveness anyway.
dialog: He said he had nothing to forgive
dialog: me for. That instead I should
dialog: forgive myself.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: All that time. All that time I
dialog: believed I'd sentenced him to a

dialog: one in prison.

text: Norman on the stairs to his room.
text: He stops, catches his breath.
scene_heading: 137 EXT. GARDEN. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 137
text: Graham is watching a stunningly beautiful bird. A snow
text: crane; white and magnificent. It's on the grass in front
dialog: of him.
text: Then it opens its huge wings, takes off. And flies up into
text: the bright blue sky. It's an extraordinary sight.
text: As Graham watches the snow crane swoop and dip, it appears
text: suddenly to slow and stall, until it seems to hang in the
text: air, almost motionless.
scene_heading: 138 EXT. ROOFTOP. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAWN 138

speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: It's been rather an extraordinary

scene_heading: 139A EXT. COURTYARD. MARIGOLD HOTEL - DAY 139A
speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.)

scene_heading: 140 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 140

text: turns to look at him, and at Gaurika, Manoj's wife, who
text: sits beside him.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.)
dialog: We all know it'll happen, but few
dialog: of us know when. Graham died of
dialog: a heart attack, evidently not his
dialog: first. So he had a better idea
dialog: than most what was coming, he
dialog: just neglected to tell us. His
dialog: prerogative.
scene_heading: 142 EXT. LAKE - DAWN 142

speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.)
dialog: There was talk of sending the
dialog: body home, but Manoj felt he

dialog: together. Not a holy place.
dialog: Although for them perhaps it was.
scene_heading: 143 EXT. FUNERAL PYRE, RUINS - DAY 143
text: A ruined garden, surrounded by the waters of the lake,

text: Graham's friends stand watching the pyre, transfixed by the
text: flames. Manoj, dressed in white, stands with Gaurika. He
text: recites a Hindi prayer.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.)
text: A body takes a long time to be
dialog: consumed. Many hours for the

dialog: The fire must be lit at dawn, and
dialog: by sunset, there must be nothing
dialog: left but ash.
scene_heading: 144 EXT. LAKESIDE - SUNSET 144
text: Stripped to the waist, Manoj walks into the water, holding
text: a bowl.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (V.0.)
dialog: Where do our souls go? is that

dialog: Perhaps the most we can ask is
dialog: that when we do shuffle off, we

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: So there's a process, they call
dialog: it pickling. I have no idea what

speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: Mrs Donnelly, what are you doing

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: I'm helping her clean. If these

text: We're all up top, having a drink.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: I went to see Gaurika. Manoj's
dialog: wife. I wanted to ask her what
dialog: she knew. And the answer was
dialog: that she knew everything, that

dialog: always would. He told her when
dialog: the marriage was arranged.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: They had no secrets from each
dialog: other, none.

text: Douglas puts his arms around her, and holds her to him.
speaker_heading: EVELYN (CONT'D)
dialog: And that's right, don't you see?
dialog: That must be right. Because what
dialog: is the point of a marriage in

text: Her words hang in the air. They stand there for a moment.

speaker_heading: JEAN

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SONNY

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Many times.

speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No, you'll want to come after me.
dialog: Chase me to the airport and tell
dialog: me everything will be fine.
dialog: But please don't. Because the
dialog: truth is we both deserve more
dialog: than we've had. You're just too
dialog: kind and too loyal to admit it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 113A.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Mummyji? Mummyjit
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: Right here, you do not need to
dialog: shout.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Do you remember what my father
dialog: used to say? That nothing happens
dialog: unless first we dream. Like him
dialog: I have dreamt, Mummyji, and like
dialog: him, I have failed. The Marigold
text: Hotel is crumbling into dust.
dialog: And it turns out I can live with
dialog: that. But the one thing I will
dialog: not do is live without this girl.

text: Sunaina puts out her hand. Mrs Kapoor will not take it.
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: No. I forbid it. I forbid this
text: match. Utterly and completely.
dialog: Do you hear me, Sonny? This
dialog: cannot happen.
text: And then a low, rumbling sound comes from the corner. Like
text: a quiet volcano.
text: Young Wasim is speaking. It's a long, poetic and heartfelt
dialog: speech.
dialog: Unfortunately it's in Hindi.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: What is he saying?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: What he said to me, I imagine.
text: She turns to Sunaina.
speaker_heading: MURIEL (CON'TD)

speaker_heading: SUNAINA
text: He is saying . he is saying
dialog: that he has been with this family
dialog: as long as he can remember.
dialog: Given them a lifetime of service.
dialog: And that he remembers another

dialog: and their parents. And he
dialog: remembers the moment where the
text: young man stood up to his mother
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: . and said yes, I want to marry
dialog: this woman. Yes, she is from a
dialog: different community. But she is
dialog: smart, she is beautiful, and I

speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Depends how you read the
dialog: accounts.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: The accounts?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Turns out the original plan is
dialog: good, it works. Just not in the
text: hands of an imbecile.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: I knew that plan was good!
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: What the place needs is more
dialog: money.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: Unfortunately my investor, Mr
dialog: Maruthi has decided that while he
dialog: greatly admires my endeavors, he
speaker_heading: CANNOT -
speaker_heading: MURIEL
text: He's reconsidered.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: You spoke to him?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: So long as there is someone to
dialog: help the manager.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: The manager needs no help.
speaker_heading: SUNAINA
dialog: Sonny...
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: The manager needs a little help.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
speaker_heading: (TO NORMAN)
dialog: So will you stay?

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I'd like to.

speaker_heading: SONNY
speaker_heading: (TO CAROL)

speaker_heading: SONNY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MURIEL
speaker_heading: (TO MADGE)
dialog: Mrs Hardcastle ? You're staying.
speaker_heading: MADGE
dialog: On my own?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: You're off your game. Lost your
dialog: confidence, maybe. But you're a
dialog: thoroughbred. You'll be back.
text: Madge smiles.
speaker_heading: MURIEL (CON'TD)
dialog: And what about you, Mrs
dialog: Greenslade?
text: Evelyn has come down, unnoticed by all. Except Muriel.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: What about me, Mrs Donnelly?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: We haven't talked much, you and
dialog: I.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: My loss, evidently.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm not sure what I should do.
dialog: Nothing here has quite worked out
dialog: as I hoped.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: 117A.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Most things don't. But sometimes

dialog: morning?
text: Evelyn nods.
speaker_heading: MURIEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Besides, he'll be back.
speaker_heading: EVELYN
dialog: You don't know him. He's the
dialog: most loyal man I've ever met.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: 50,000 rupees says I'm right. At
dialog: your current salary that should
dialog: take you three months to pay off.
text: Muriel stands up. Everybody stares. She starts to walk
text: slowly but proudly across the courtyard. She reaches the
text: doorway, turns back.
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: If you'll excuse me, someone's
dialog: waiting to help me make mango
dialog: chutney. Why did no one tell me
dialog: about that stuff?
speaker_heading: MRS KAPOOR
dialog: Who is the new assistant manager?
speaker_heading: MURIEL
dialog: Why? Are you thinking of
dialog: applying for the job?
text: She gestures for her wheelchair.
text: Sonny rushes up with it. She sinks down.
speaker_heading: MURIEL (CONT'D))

speaker_heading: DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
dialog: (putting down his
speaker_heading: SUITCASE)
dialog: I had quite an interesting night,
dialog: actually. I met the same taxi
dialog: driver, but this time I let him
dialog: take me to his brother's hotel.
dialog: Which turned out to be less of a
text: hotel, and more of a brothel,
dialog: really. They gave me this pipe,
dialog: said it was apple tobacco, but
dialog: that's not what we called it when
dialog: I was a student. So I made my
dialog: excuses and left, wanted some
dialog: time to think. This city at
dialog: night is extraordinary.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Of course the apple tobacco
dialog: helped.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
