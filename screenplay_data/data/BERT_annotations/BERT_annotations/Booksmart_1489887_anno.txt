speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BROWN
dialog: Really? Can’t you just do it with

speaker_heading: MOLLY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: And it worked.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: But the irresponsible people who

dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: So we messed up! We didn’t have to

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: We’re not assholes! Let’s just have

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Are you kidding? No way.
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: I'M SO HAPPY YOU GUYS ARE HERE! I

speaker_heading: GIGI (CONT'D)
dialog: Oooh try one of these STRAWBERRIES!

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Just-- stop trying so hard. It’s

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: No thank you. Not a drug person.
speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: Not even pot? I feel like it’1l

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: GIGI
dialog: That’s crazy! I have the exact same

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: GIGI

speaker_heading: DOLL MOLLY

speaker_heading: DOLL AMY

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What? No. We have to stick to the

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Once we get to Nick’s, all of this

speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: GIGI (0.S.)

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Dude...?
text: Molly finally turns to her.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No! I don’t like him. Yes, maybe
dialog: he’s classically, traditionally

dialog: maybe my innate biology registers

speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: And some weaker people might call

dialog: You don’t have to shut anything

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Yes I do. Because I can’t like him.
dialog: Maybe my body likes him but my mind
dialog: knows that’s stupid, because he’s a
dialog: jock who only cares about being
dialog: cool and having fun and he doesn’t
dialog: even look at girls unless they look
dialog: like Triple A and he doesn’t even

speaker_heading: MOLLY
speaker_heading: WHAT the FUCK--
speaker_heading: AMY

speaker_heading: AMY

dialog: You remembered I’m going to Africa?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah. Uganda or something, right?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Botswana. They’d kill me in Uganda.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh. Cause that country’s not really

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (blushing, rolls her eyes)
dialog: It’s a purely ceremonial visit.

speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: And I’m here! To remind you! Of the
dialog: mess you left when you went away!
text: Amy sings her heart out, hitting every note, and it’s

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: How tall are you?

speaker_heading: NICK

speaker_heading: MOLLY

scene_heading: INT. NICK'S POOL - NIGHT
text: Underwater, Amy looks for Ryan, but can’t find her in the sea

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NICK'S AUNT'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Amy pushes her way through the crowd, trying not to cry,

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh my God THERE YOU ARE! How’s it
dialog: going? Did you find Ryan? Did you
dialog: go in the pool?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Molly--
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Molly, I think we should go home.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: What? No, just dry off!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I just think we need to leave right

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What is that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That’s bullshit!
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You don’t drag me, you force me to

dialog: 81.

dialog: emotional
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I take charge!
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: HOPE

speaker_heading: TRIPLE A
dialog: You know this is why people say I
dialog: gave guys “roadside assistance,”
dialog: right? I gave them a ride home.
dialog: That’s all.
text: Molly’s stunned. A beat.
speaker_heading: TRIPLE A (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay that’s not true I blew them.
dialog: But it wasn’t like they ran out of
dialog: gas and I showed up to suck their
text: dicks while they waited for help.
dialog: We hooked up in their cars. It
dialog: makes sense to hook up in a car!
dialog: I’m not gonna suck a dick in my own
dialog: home when my dad could walk in at
dialog: any moment! FUCKING SUE ME!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: That makes a lot of sense...
text: Triple A’s taken caught off guard by that. A beat.
speaker_heading: TRIPLE A
dialog: You know what the worst part is?
dialog: All the girls call me that, too. I
dialog: knew Max and Ben and Dicksplinter
dialog: would say stupid shit. But I didn’t
dialog: think the girls would do it.
text: Molly feels awful.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Amy never called you that.
dialog: (then, genuine)
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m really sorry.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: TRIPLE A
dialog: Just don’t call me Triple A at Yale
dialog: next year, okay? I want people to

speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Of course.
dialog: (very dramatically)
dialog: Annabel.
speaker_heading: TRIPLE A
dialog: NO! Not right now! That was so
dialog: cheesy!
text: Molly smirks at her. Triple A smirks back. Then--
speaker_heading: TRIPLE A (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait, where the fuck do you live?
scene_heading: INT. MOLLY'S APARTMENT - DAWN
text: Molly tiptoes inside her quiet apartment.
scene_heading: INT. MOLLY'S ROOM - MOLLY'S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Molly’s ALARM stirs her awake. She notices the time, curses,
text: and reaches for her phone charging on the bedside table. She
dialog: hasn't seen it since it died last night.
text: She rubs her eyes, then frowns when she sees -- 32 messages.
dialog: All about Amy: Is she okay? She’s our queen! Where’s Amy?!
text: Molly sits up and opens a link someone texted her -- it’s a
text: shaky SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO of Amy getting PERP WALKED from the
text: party into a police car.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: AMY (ON VIDEO)
dialog: All right, well. Just so you know I
dialog: know my rights. There are more
dialog: prisons than colleges in the US,
dialog: did you know that? And it costs
dialog: $71,000 to house an inmate in the
dialog: state of California. That’s more
dialog: than Harvard!
dialog: (as they put her in the
dialog: backseat)
dialog: This seems excessive. Shotgun. Just
dialog: kidding. I don’t have one.
dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Molly walks down the hallway of a CITY JAIL. Her eyes go wide
text: when she notices a FLYER pinned to the wall. We can’t see
text: what it says, but she surreptitiously snatches it off the
text: wall before she turns the corner.
scene_heading: INT. JAIL - DAY
text: Amy sits stoically behind a plane of plexiglass next to JAIL
text: VISIT PHONES. She’s startled to see Molly. Molly sits and
text: picks up the phone on her side. Amy stares at her. Then she
text: picks up her phone. A beat.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Oh, I’m actually here to see
dialog: someone else, I’m so sorry, my
dialog: mistake...
text: Amy can’t help it, she laughs.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Fuck you, dude...
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Dude, you’re in full-on jail.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It’s okay. I’m gonna have to pay a
dialog: fine and go before the judge--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: No, I’m sorry. I know women
dialog: apologize too much but in this case
dialog: I have real stuff to be sorry for.
dialog: I was so selfish--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I was being a coward--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: You called Malala--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I lied to you--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: And you were trying to save me from

dialog: Ryan!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Can you believe that, by the way?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: NO. Truly, no. I would’ve guessed
dialog: Nick hooked up with Theo before I
dialog: guessed he hooked up with Ryan.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Nick and Theo have great chemistry!
text: They both laugh. Then they get quiet again.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'm sorry I’m so...controlling. I
dialog: just literally can’t imagine my
dialog: life without you.
text: Molly puts her hand up on the glass. Amy puts her hand up
text: against Molly’s hand. Molly’s throat tightens. But then--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT’D)
dialog: You are the motherfucker who got
dialog: arrested the night before
dialog: graduation!
text: Amy laughs, then sits up straight as she realizes-—-
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Oh my God, graduation! Molly! What
dialog: time is it? It’s starting so soon!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Why do you think I’m here? You're
dialog: coming with me.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What? No! I’m stuck here but you’re
dialog: already gonna be late--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (dead serious)
dialog: Amy. I’m not graduating without
dialog: you. So I’m either getting myself
dialog: arrested so I can be in there with
dialog: you, or we're going together.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: But...how?
text: Molly slams the FLYER she took up against the glass: it’s a
text: WANTED POSTER with a POLICE SKETCH of the VALLEY STRANGLER...
text: and it’s PAT THE PIZZA DELIVERY GUY!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: We’re gonna trade some information
dialog: because we DO know this man.
scene_heading: EXT. JAIL - DAY
text: Molly and Amy race outside, struggling to put on their CAPS
text: AND GOWNS. Amy sees Jared’s MUSCLE CAR--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Is that Jared’s car?!
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: I'll explain later!
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Am I driving?
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Of course you’re driving!
dialog: (tossing her the keys)
dialog: Waze says 19 minutes, we can do it
dialog: in seven.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Let’s do this.
text: Amy turns the key and they ZOOM OUT OF THERE.
scene_heading: EXT. GRADUATION FIELD - DAY
text: The field is packed and abuzz as people start to find seats.
text: SENIORS in their cap-and-gowns fidget with excitement.
text: Onstage, Gigi plays the piano like a savant.
text: Principal Brown tries to corral the students--
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BROWN
dialog: Okay, everybody, let’s take a seat!
text: A few feet away, Miss Fine sees the back of Theo’s head in a
text: seat. She approaches and leans in, making a seductive noise--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MISS FINE
dialog: Rrrrrr--

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MISS FINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Ooooh. Heeeey, Evelyn.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I just wanted to say, “have a great
dialog: summer!” Have a great...ok.
dialog: (to herself)
text: Cool cool cool. Sickening.
text: She turns-- right into the real Theo, grinning.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Morning, my queen.
speaker_heading: MISS FINE
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: THEO
dialog: Last night was amazing. Can I see
dialog: you again?
text: Miss Fine grimaces, then gives him a tiny smile.
speaker_heading: MISS FINE
dialog: Good luck at Google next year.
text: She walks away. Theo’s in love. Triple A walks up, looking
text: between the two of them.
speaker_heading: TRIPLE A
dialog: Did you fuck Miss Fine?
scene_heading: INT. JARED’S MUSCLE CAR - DAY
text: Amy drives like a madwoman, barely able to control the car’s

scene_heading: EXT. GRADUATION FIELD - DAY
text: Principal Brown walks over to a group of STUDENTS.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BROWN
dialog: All right, we've got everybody?

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Jared steps forward.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Molly warned me she might be late
dialog: and tapped me to start her speech.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BROWN
dialog: Molly Davidson’s gonna be late to
dialog: graduation? That doesn’t sound like
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Well, she also asked me to remind
dialog: you that...
dialog: (remembering his script)
dialog: This sort of thing happens all the
dialog: time on the Senate floor, and if a
dialog: Senator isn’t present for a vote, a
dialog: proxy can call for a motion for the
dialog: vote to take place in his or her
dialog: absence.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BROWN
dialog: Okay yes that sounds like her.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So she tapped you?
speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: She tapped me.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL BROWN
dialog: (thinks, then)

speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: I am a woman. I am a powerful

dialog: status quo.
dialog: (can barely do it)
dialog: Straight white man,
dialog: your...time...is...u--
text: BAM! On the other side of the field the car bursts through a
text: gate and drives right onto the field. Everyone turns,
text: startled, as they swerve to drive right up to the stands.
speaker_heading: JARED (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, my God, my car is fucked up.
text: Amy and Molly stumble out, sprinting to the ceremony--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (running, out of breath)
dialog: I’m here! We’re here!
text: The crowd cheers as they run down the aisle. Amy starts to
text: go to her seat but Molly tries to keep her up on stage--
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, stay--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I’ll go to my seat--
speaker_heading: MOLLY

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Amy blushes, amazed. Jared hands Molly the speech, eager to
text: get off the stage, but Molly stops him, leans in and kisses
dialog: him! In front of everyone!
text: The crowd LAUGHS and WHISTLES. Jared floats off, dazed. Molly
text: turns back to the crowd and grips the podium. Despite all of
text: her planning, she’s suddenly frozen with nerves.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Okay, uh...it seems like Jared did
dialog: a pretty good job.
text: She just stands there, taking in her classmates.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT’D)
dialog: You know, I was so...scared of you
dialog: guys, I felt like I had to prove I
dialog: was better than you. But really, I
dialog: don’t know any more than you. All
dialog: I know is that we all have a lot
dialog: more to learn.
text: Molly locks eyes with Amy. Amy smiles at her, emotional,
text: proud. All of a sudden Molly’s about to cry.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT’D)
dialog: Because this part’s over. And
dialog: that’s so sad.
text: In the audience, Amy nods, tears in her eyes.
speaker_heading: MOLLY (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: CHARMAINE

dialog: good! You’re bringing Lingling!
text: Amy's SEX PANDA is poking out of her suitcase. Before Amy can

speaker_heading: CHARMAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: You give Amy these kisses for me
dialog: when she gets lonely, okay
dialog: Lingling? All the way from America!
text: She gives the bear little kisses. The girls recoil--
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: Make that stop--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Okay give him back now! I wanna zip
dialog: up my suitcase!
text: Doug walks in and brightens when he sees--
speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: MOLLY AMY

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: HOPE
dialog: Hey.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I just wanted to bring back your
dialog: clothes.
text: She hands Amy a plastic bag. Behind Hope, Molly freaks out

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Thank you. Thank you so much.
dialog: I don’t usually leave my underwear
dialog: places that...aren’t my room.
speaker_heading: HOPE
dialog: I figured.

speaker_heading: AMY (CONT'D)

dialog: that stuff yet.
speaker_heading: HOPE
dialog: Well, for someone who has no idea
dialog: what they’re doing...you kinda know
dialog: what you're doing.

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Really? Where?
speaker_heading: HOPE
dialog: I don’t really know. Anywhere I can

dialog: see some stuff before college.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That’s-- me too. Same. That’s why
dialog: I’m doing a gap year.
dialog: A nice moment. They weren't expecting that.
speaker_heading: HOPE
dialog: Well, have fun, nerd.
text: She hands Amy a slip of paper with her information on it. Amy

dialog: after her--
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: If you ever end up in Botswana,
dialog: you'd have a couch to crash on.
dialog: (can’t help herself)
dialog: Technically it won't be my couch
dialog: because I’m staying with a family
dialog: but I’m sure they'll be cool with
dialog: it!
