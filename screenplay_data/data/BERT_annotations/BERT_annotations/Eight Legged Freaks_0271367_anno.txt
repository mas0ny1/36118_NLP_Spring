scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
text: A rabbit hops across rough terrain.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
text: Three trucks from Chemical Technologies carry barrels of
text: toxic waste. They pass a sign: PROSPERITY, NEVADA, POP
dialog: 454.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT
text: A sleepy trucker called PIG PEN drives the third truck.
speaker_heading: SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
dialog: I will be self-assured and
text: confident around women.
speaker_heading: PIG PEN
dialog: I will be self-assured and
text: confident around women.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
text: The rabbit stops at the edge of the road. The first
text: truck speeds past. Then the second. The rabbit crosses
text: the highway in front of the third.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD TRUCK (HIGHWAY, DESERT) - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SELF-HELP TAPE (V.O.)
dialog: I will not fear the unexpected.
speaker_heading: PIG PEN
dialog: I will not fear the unexpected.
text: The rabbit appears in the road, frozen by headlights.
speaker_heading: PIG PEN
dialog: Ahhhhhhhhhh!
text: Pig Pen jams on his brakes and swerves to avoid the
text: bunny.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - NIGHT
text: The truck slews crazily. Missing the bunny by a whisker.
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD TRUCK (BRIDGE, DESERT) - NIGHT
text: Pig Pen sees a bridge ahead. If he doesn't regain
text: control, he will crash. At the last second, he gets the
dialog: rig together.
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE (DESERT) - THIRD TRUCK - NIGHT
text: The rim of a wheel tags the curb. One of those toxic
text: waste barrels falls out of the back and plunges to the
text: water below.
scene_heading: EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - NIGHT
text: A biohazard warning label is legible as the barrel slips
text: beneath the surface. Glowing toxic waste seeps from a
text: gash in its side. Spreading through the pool like neon
dialog: ink.
scene_heading: EXT. DRAINAGE DITCH - DAY
text: The ditch is littered with garbage. The DRONE of
text: INSECTS. No visible traces of toxic waste. A butterfly
text: net sweeps through the air to capture an oversized
text: horsefly.
text: JOSHUA TAFT (70s), scrutinizes the bug. This old codger
dialog: is more comfortable studying bugs than socializing with
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: Hey, Mike. Check this one out.
text: MIKE PALMER (12) steps over for a look. Puberty hit hard
dialog: and fast for this bright, little nerd.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He's huge!
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: They've been like this all week.
dialog: Must be something extra tasty in
dialog: the water.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
text: Dead coyote. Snake maybe. Back
dialog: in the 'Nam we'd eat python with a
dialog: dash of habanero sauce. Mighty
dialog: satisfying.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You ate snake?
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: When you're thirty klicks out from
text: the nearest firebase. Humpin'
dialog: through the wake-up with your
text: finger on the trigger. Charlie
dialog: doesn't give you time to stop for
dialog: cutlet.
text: As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a
text: familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly-
text: colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible.
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of
dialog: nowhere.
scene_heading: INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY
text: The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and
text: homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (V.O.)
dialog: Charlie, don't surf!
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: Quiet, bird. We're working.
text: Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen
text: aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a
dialog: specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: (dims tank lights)
dialog: The sun is going down, my
dialog: nocturnal hunters. It's time to
dialog: come out and feed.
text: Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Yeah. They're definitely getting
dialog: bigger.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: I've calculated a growth factor of
dialog: twelve percent over the last
dialog: forty-eight hours. But that seems
text: to be accelerating.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: All from eating these bugs? Maybe
dialog: I should try some.
text: Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search
text: for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged
text: den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the
text: cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond.
text: Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting
text: spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless
dialog: insects.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Run, little guys.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: They can't outrun the food chain.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I could get away.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: Imagine yourself the size of that
dialog: fly. A scytodes spitter would be
dialog: as big as a Cadillac. You'd be
dialog: spider chow, kid.
text: Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing
text: crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered
text: with a towel.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Are the new tarantulas in here?
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: Took me forever to get a breeding
dialog: set of Chilean reds. I must have
dialog: bribed every customs agent from
dialog: Vegas to Santiago.
text: Joshua unveils the tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow
text: entrances. Joshua pours in the bugs. A large, male
text: tarantula comes out of a burrow. It pounces on a bug,
text: then wraps its prey in webbing, turning the insect into a
text: mummy-like bundle.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That is too cool.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
text: Male tarantulas compete for the
text: female's attention.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOSHUA (CONT'D)
text: Each one tries to bring her the
dialog: best present. Bugs, rats, even
text: the occasional parrot.
scene_heading: CHARLIE SQUAWKS.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
text: The prey is cocooned alive so she
dialog: can eat them in her nest. You
dialog: know how women love breakfast in
dialog: bed.
text: Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of
text: subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas
text: scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: Take a look, the female of the
dialog: species is three times as big as
dialog: the male.
text: Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps
text: out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red
dialog: tarantula.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: Say hello to Consuela.
text: Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified
text: bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
text: She fills her prey with digestive
dialog: acid to liquify the internal
dialog: organs. Now watch... She'll drink
text: her victim from the inside out.
dialog: While it's still alive!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (looks queasy)
dialog: And you wonder why my mom doesn't
dialog: like me hanging out with you.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
text: Arachnids have been roaming the
dialog: earth for millions of years. And
dialog: they'll be here long after the
text: human race is dead and buried.
text: Suddenly Consuela lunges at the glass. Mike recoils.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Bad! Bad Consuela!
text: Consuela backs up, apparently she can be intimidated.
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: TARANTULA POV - MIKE
text: The multi-eyed spider's PANORAMIC VISION. Mike looms
text: large at the edge of the glass, wagging his finger.
dialog: BACK TO MIKE
text: Mike stares into the many eyes of Consuela.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Do that again and I feed you to
text: the parrot.
text: CHARLIE SQUAWKS hungrily. The sound of a CAR HORN.
speaker_heading: JOSHUA
dialog: There's your mom.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: See you tomorrow, Joshua!
text: Mike heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: The entrance to a mine shaft protrudes from a hillside.
text: A pickup truck is parked nearby. The faded logo on the
text: door reads: McCORMICK AND SON MINING COMPANY,
scene_heading: PROSPERITY, NV.
scene_heading: INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY
text: Rotten beams. Chipped walls. A GENERATOR POWERS a
text: string of lightbulbs. A lone figure works at the end of
dialog: the tunnel.
text: CHRIS McCORMICK (30s) has rugged good looks. Weathered
text: clothing. Dirt-stained face. Ripped muscles.
text: Chris chips at the wall with his pickaxe. As it makes
text: contact, the occasional spark flies up. Chris pauses to
text: scrutinize the target area with his helmet-light.
text: Something sneaks along the floor of the mine behind him.
text: Chris is oblivious to his unseen stalker. He chips away
text: a section of stone to reveal shiny minerals. Reflections
text: of silver and gold splash across his face. His smile
text: fades...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Damn.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Chris bends over, reaching for a bottle of water. A
text: large rat scurries out of hiding dragging away Chris's
dialog: sack lunch.
text: Chris grabs his pick-axe and goes after the rat. The
text: rodent dodges every hit. Sparks fly when the axe strikes
text: rock. These ignite a vent of methane gas.
text: A BRIEF EXPLOSION knocks Chris off his feet. He notices
text: a small hole in the floor is lit like the burner on a
text: stove. Chris pats out the flame as the rat scurries away
dialog: with lunch.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hope you like bologna!
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: A police car drives with a bicycle hanging out of the
dialog: trunk.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY
scene_heading: SAMANTHA "SAM" PALMER (30s) is the sheriff of Prosperity
text: and a confident, single mother. Mike is seated beside
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: You should see them, Mom. Each
text: one has a unique feeding behavior.
text: The spitters fire poisonous snot.
text: The tarantulas mummify their prey.
dialog: The jumpers can...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why does he have all those things?
speaker_heading: MIKE
text: He studies them. NASA uses spider
dialog: webs in outer space. And for
dialog: medicine. They've been here
dialog: forever, and they'll be here long
dialog: after we're all dead.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're givin' me nightmares.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Nightmares are cool.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: U.P.S. brought this to the
dialog: station.
text: Sam hands Mike a small package.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: It's from Dad! He didn't forget
dialog: my birthday. I told you he
dialog: wouldn't.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Better late than never.
text: Mike tears open the box to reveal a Cassiopeia PDA.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Rockin'!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is that the one you wanted?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Cassiopeia 2304 with 64 megs of
dialog: ram. Integrated modem. Voice
dialog: recording capability. This baby
dialog: is tight.
text: Mike can't turn on the gizmo.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: He forgot to send the batteries.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: I told him to send batteries.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
text: The ROAR of two off-road MOTORCYCLES tearing up the
dialog: desert.
text: BRET HALE (18) leads the way. A Kid Rock-punk with good
text: looks and FU attitude. Seated behind him is ASHLEY
text: PALMER (16). This milk-fed desert honey is a wannabe
text: Britney Spears. LARRY (17) is the wiseacre on the other
dialog: bike.
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: Hang on, babydoll!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They GUN their BIKES onto the highway. Slalom the yellow

dialog: lane.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Oh shit.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR (HIGHWAY) - DAY
text: Sheriff Sam watches intently as the bikes wheelie past.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hang on.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Why?
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY
text: The police car does an impressive bootlegger 180. Lights
text: ablaze. SIREN WAILING. The bikes pull over to the
dialog: shoulder.
scene_heading: EXT. SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY (DESERT) - DAY
text: The motorcycles stop with the cop car behind. Sam's
text: voice barks over the PA.
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Party's over, gentlemen. Off the
dialog: bikes.
text: Sam exits the car and approaches. The bikers dismount.
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: There is something very sexy about
text: an older woman in uniform.
speaker_heading: LARRY
text: Her nine-millimeter gives me a
dialog: stiffy.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Don't antagonize her, you guys.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I told you not to act like

dialog: unacceptable, Bret.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: I could always ride her from

text: Larry snickers. Sam steels her rage.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Can't you give 'em a break?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Get in the car, Ashley. Now.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: But, Mom!

speaker_heading: ASHLEY

speaker_heading: LARRY

text: Bret and Larry feel her resolve.
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: Relax, bee-otch. It's all good.

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: town.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
text: Sam climbs behind the wheel.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I read her her rights.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can always count on you, Mike.
text: Sam STARTS the CAR and drives toward town.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Do you get off on humiliating me?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This bad girl act doesn't suit
dialog: you, Ash.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Sam reaches over and opens the glove box. She pulls out

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I told you to keep this with you.
text: Ashley slides the zapper into her backpack.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You are so over protective.
text: Mike and Ashley lip-sync along with Sam's response.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A mother's job is to protect her
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You need to start trusting me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'd like to. But you keep
dialog: skipping classes to go to the
text: dunes with Bret.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Why do you hate him so much?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't hate him. I just want you
dialog: to have a future. I thought you
dialog: wanted to get out of town. Go to
dialog: med school.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Maybe I want to stay. I could get
text: pregnant by nineteen. Then
dialog: divorce with a couple of kids I
dialog: can't handle. Slap on a badge and
dialog: be a trailer trash sheriff.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (deeply hurt)
dialog: Thanks for the flashback.
text: They drive on in painful silence. Mike turns ON the
speaker_heading: RADIO.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Oh, great.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Thanks, Harlan. As I was saying,
dialog: Chemical Technologies has been

dialog: And Prosperity is lucky enough to
dialog: be on that list.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Lucky? I think most of us are
dialog: insulted that some outsiders think
dialog: our town is a perfect place to
dialog: dump toxic waste.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Right on.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET (TOWN) - DAY
text: Chris's pickup approaches... The entire town is not much
dialog: bigger than a few football fields. The kind of place
dialog: where everybody has known each other since childhood.
text: Some buildings date back to the 1880's gold rush.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Isn't this just your latest get-
dialog: rich quick scheme?
text: At one end is the Prosperity Mall. A huge windowless
text: rectangle in the sand. Permanent signs tout the many
text: outlet stores inside: Victoria's Secret, Home and Garden
text: Supplies, Sport Chalet, etc. Hand-painted signs reveal:
scene_heading: "GOING OUT OF BUSINESS SALE. EVERYTHING MUST GO. FINAL
text: CLOSE OUT." On the roof of the mall is a very tall radio
dialog: antenna.
speaker_heading: HARLAN (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY
text: Walls decorated with clippings about aliens, monsters,

text: WADE HALE (40s) is the mayor of Prosperity. A slick-
text: haired dandy who looks more like a Vegas lounge singer
dialog: than a Mayor.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: With one phone call I could put

scene_heading: INT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - DAY
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Think about it, Harlan, you could

speaker_heading: BRET

scene_heading: INT. PALMER HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
text: The garage is cluttered. Old station wagon. Bikes.
text: Skis. Sam leads Chris to a bag full of her ex-husband's
dialog: clothes.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I guess I should watch more
dialog: 'Oprah.' It must be a textbook
dialog: 'no-dad' kind of thing.
text: Chris shifts awkwardly. In shock. Sad. Sam holds up a
text: flannel shirt.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That one looks kind of scratchy.
text: Sam holds up a shirt that Chris approves of. He takes it
text: and proceeds to take off his old soot-stained shirt.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: All Jason cared about was getting
dialog: out and starting over. I guess
dialog: that included buying a new
dialog: wardrobe.
text: Sam turns to pass Chris a pair of Levis. He's buttoning
text: up the new shirt. Chris takes the pants. He doesn't

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Gladys thought I should sell...
dialog: but you know... I never wanted to

dialog: money, I would have sold out to
dialog: Wade a long time ago.
text: Chris moves behind the car and takes off his pants.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I think I just wanted to prove the
dialog: gold was down there. That my
dialog: family wasn't crazy to keep
dialog: looking. Even after we'd lost so
text: much. And now... she's gone, too.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry, Chris.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Do you know what I'm trying to
dialog: say?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It wasn't about spending the gold,
dialog: it was about finding it.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That's right. That's exactly
dialog: right.
text: Sam glimpses Chris through car windows. The poor guy's
text: struggling to pull on some 501s. Sam turns away, but
text: catches sight of him in a propped-up glass door.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Remind me never to let you do my
dialog: laundry.

speaker_heading: SAM

scene_heading: INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - SUNSET
text: A melancholy N'SYNC ballad plays over a BOOM BOX. Ashley

dialog: of Bret.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ashley doesn't notice the Great Dane-sized spitting

text: like a jungle predator.
text: It comes all the way into the room and then lingers among
text: Ashley's stuffed animal collection.
scene_heading: INT. MIKE'S ROOM - DUSK
text: Mike checks the phone. Still dead. He types at his
text: computer, entering the specification of the piece of
text: exoskeleton. A digital representation of a spider grows
text: on his monitor screen. Showing Mike exactly how big the
dialog: spider would be after shedding this skin. Mike is
text: distracted by the LOUD MUSIC coming from Ashley's room.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Can't you turn that down?!
scene_heading: INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - DUSK
speaker_heading: MIKE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm doing spider research!
text: Ashley stops ripping. She goes to the pile of animals,
text: oblivious to the spider. The beast doesn't move. Ashley
text: grabs a pink teddy bear with a heart on its belly. She
text: returns to bed and cuts the bear's heart out with
text: scissors.
text: The spitting spider sneaks up behind Ashley. As it
text: moves, so does Ashley. She scoops up the torn photos and
text: mutilated bear, dumping them in the trash. She turns
text: around to find the giant spider on her bed. She freezes
text: momentarily.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Spider... Mike... Spider...
text: Ashley sees her stun gun is on the dresser. She lunges
text: for it. She's almost got it. The spider squirts two
text: lines of gummy web at Ashley. The glop hits her int he
text: chest, carries her backward. Glues her to the wall.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT
text: Chris finishes dressing. He faces Sam. There is an odd
text: moment as they find themselves standing close. If the
dialog: circumstances were different they'd probably end up
text: kissing. And then they hear ASHLEY'S bloodcurdling
text: SCREAM.
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Mike pops out of his door. Sam and Chris run down the
text: hallway. Sam yanks open the door to Ashley's room.
scene_heading: INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sam, Chris and Mike stand in the doorway staring at a
text: giant spider menacing Ashley. The spitter fires another
text: webby blast, sticking the girl's legs to the wall.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Wow! A scytodes spitter!
text: Chris pushes past Sam and Mike. He grabs a chair and
text: shoves it at the spitter like a lion tamer. The spider
text: backs off. Sam takes off running down the hallway.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Where are you going?
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sam runs up to find a gun case. She tries to get a

text: Sam grabs objects in the room and smashes the gun rack to
dialog: pieces.
scene_heading: INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Chris has the chair in one hand to fend off the spider.
text: With the other hand he tries to get Ashley out of the

speaker_heading: MIKE
text: The scytodes spits a gooey
dialog: discharge to immobilize their
dialog: prey.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No shit!
text: The spider hits Chris's chair with a blast of webbing.
text: The chair is blown from his hand, and stuck to the wall.
text: Chris stands weaponless before the spider.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Use my stun g...
text: Ashley is nailed in the face with another blast of goo.
text: Mouth sealed shut. Chris reaches under the bed and

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (reads)
dialog: Watch its fangs! The spitter's

dialog: fires!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'll keep that in mind.
text: Chris grabs the spitter from behind and drags it off the
text: wall. The spider turns to fight. Chris wrestles it to
text: the ground. He sees the fangs begin to move from side to
text: side and rolls clear of a point-blank web shot.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Sam takes a purposeful step back and launches a spinning
text: roundhouse kick that snaps the shotgun out of its
text: binding. She grabs the bang stick and runs from the
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. ASHLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Chris puts himself between Ashley and the spider. He
text: looks for a weapon. Lunges for the scissors, but the
text: spitter nails him with a blast of glue. Chris is flung
text: across the room and stuck to the wall by the sleeve of
text: his shirt. He shrugs out of it and makes another grab
text: for his scissors. He gets them.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Get under it! Stab it in the
dialog: abdomen! They don't have any
dialog: armor down there!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How am I supposed to do that!?
text: The spider leaps at Chris... and EXPLODES in midair.
text: Bits of gore shower Chris. He stands to see Sam in the

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm gonna need some new pants.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Sam finishes loading new shells into her shotgun and then

scene_heading: SUMMER NIGHT.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's okay...

scene_heading: EXT. HARLAN'S TRAILER - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. STREET (TOWN) - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
text: A pack of rabid coyotes is loose

scene_heading: INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: This funky old couple relaxes in their LaZee-Boys.
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)

scene_heading: EXT. HANK AND EMMA'S HOME - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

text: Harlan has donned a vintage football helmet and pads.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your keys?
speaker_heading: CHRIS

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY (TOWN) - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: HARLAN

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What a shock! Try again!
text: The spiders are closing in as Harlan re-dials.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)
dialog: 911 Emergency.
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: There was a massive explosion!
dialog: Everybody's dead!
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (V.O.)

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Over here!
text: He faces off against more spiders coming through the Home
dialog: and Garden store.
scene_heading: EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT
text: Harlan is at the top. Chris is a bit lower. The spiders
text: are still coming. Chris SHOOTS at them. His GUN RUNS
text: DRY. He flips it around and butt-strokes an approaching
dialog: arac.
text: A spider fires a web at Harlan. Nails the poor guy. And
text: drags him off the antenna.
text: Harlan falls off the antenna, back toward the spiders.
text: Chris reaches out and grabs him. Holding Harlan's hand.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I've got you!
text: Harlan makes eye-contact with Chris. They're both about
dialog: to be killed unless...
speaker_heading: HARLAN
dialog: Defend the human race!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No!
text: Harlan jerks away from Chris's hand. He cannonballs down
text: into the horde of spiders. Splattering several of the
text: beasts along with himself.
text: Chris throws the useless shotgun at an approaching arac
text: and climbs even higher. He pulls out his machete and
text: begins hacking at the guide-wires that hold the antenna
dialog: upright.
text: The spiders close in. Chris slices one wire. The
text: antenna quivers. Chris slices another wire. The antenna
dialog: shakes.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - NIGHT

text: Floyd the barber confronts a spider with his chain-saw.
speaker_heading: FLOYD

speaker_heading: FLOYD
dialog: How about a little off the top!
text: He slices another arac.
scene_heading: EXT. MALL - ROOF - ANTENNA - NIGHT
text: Chris dodges a spider's webline. Several more come at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You're going down!
text: Chris cuts the last wire and hikes out over the skylight.
text: The antenna keels over. Chris hangs tight as he drops
text: toward the glass.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - NIGHT
text: Sam looks up to see Chris come crashing down through the
text: skylight on the antenna. The antenna tilts in at a sixty
text: degree angle. Chris hangs off the end. Orb weavers ride
text: their weblines down to the floor of the mall.
text: Mike peeks out from the top of the jungle gym. He sees a
text: hundred spiders coming in on webs. Flooding out of the
dialog: stores. The devil-spawned monsters are everywhere!
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Arac attack!
text: Chris leaps from the antenna to a nearby web. He slides

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We're on our own!

dialog: jumper.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - JUNGLE GYM
text: Ashley and Mike are hiding.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I can't stay in here!
text: Ashley starts to move out of the tube. She discovers the
text: end has been covered with web. She pushes it. Something
text: on the other side pushes back. Ashley scrambles back.
text: Mike is already moving. The kids flee through the tubes
dialog: to get away.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What are they doing?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: (checks Cassiopeia)
dialog: They're trapping us like ants in a
dialog: log! Once they have all the exits
dialog: blocked, they'll come in through
dialog: the last one!
text: They see a way out, head for that exit, only to find a
text: spider coming through it. Mike tosses one of his perfume
text: grenades at the spider, covering their retreat.
text: Another spider comes after them through one of the tubes.
text: Mike chucks another perfume bottle. The spider cowers.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: We've gotta go!
text: Ashley finds a hole that leads to the slide.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Here!
text: She starts down with Mike close behind. A large spider
text: looms at the end. Ashley tries to arrest her slide. But
text: it's no use. At the last second Sam's boot kicks the

dialog: 78.
scene_heading: INT. MALL - NIGHT
text: Ashley and Mike pour out of the slide. Chris and Sam

speaker_heading: HANK
dialog: It's tool time!
text: Floyd is still going crazy, slicing spiders with his
text: chain-saw, he lets out a victorious yell until a hungry

text: Chris passes a clothing store displaying Levi 501s. He

speaker_heading: SAM (O.S.)
dialog: Chris!
text: Chris continues on.
text: All of the survivors meet in the middle of the mall and
text: prepare for Custer's last stand. Spiders charge from all
dialog: directions.
text: Mike throws his perfume grenades. Sam and Chris SHOOT.
text: Others use their make-shift weapons.
text: Norman pulls out a joint and sparks it. Mike sees this
text: and gets an idea.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Where do you grow your weed?!
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Dude, if I tell you, I have to

speaker_heading: NORMAN

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

scene_heading: INT. MALL - ACCESS STAIRS - NIGHT
text: Norman leads the survivors down the tight hallway.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Where are you taking us?
speaker_heading: NORMAN

scene_heading: INT. MALL - BASEMENT POT ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: You aren't going to arrest me for
dialog: this are you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not today.
text: The group can hear SPIDERS BASHING at the upstairs door.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (to Norman)
dialog: Oh great! Now you've trapped us!
text: Chris moves to the bottom of the stairs.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We should be able to hold them off
dialog: for a little while.
text: Suddenly a loud BANGING ERUPTS on the wall behind them.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: They're coming through the wall!
text: The group tightens up. Back to back. Ready for the end.
text: Suddenly a human hand punches through the wall.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Bret Hale rips through the drywall. Filthy but alive.

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Don't waste your bullets.

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We can get out this way!
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Aren't the spiders in there?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Not until daylight.
text: The BANGING on the upper door gets more INTENSE.
text: Norman grabs a flashlight and a bunch of battery powered
text: grow lights from his weed farm. He passes them out to
dialog: the group.
text: Chris takes the flashlight and leads the way into the
text: mine shaft. Bret is shocked as the others follow him.
text: The group uses the grow lights, and flashlights.
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: You're going back in there?! Are
dialog: you all crazy!?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Come on, Bret!
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: No way! I'm not going!
text: Bret is alone in the room as the upper DOOR IMPLODES and
text: spiders flood downstairs. Bret dives through the
dialog: opening.
dialog: 81.
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: Bret runs past Sam and Chris. Sam FIRES her SHOTGUN at
text: the first spider that enters the tunnel. Her GUN CLICKS
text: DRY. She un-holsters her PISTOLS and FIRES.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Cover me!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you going to do?!
text: Chris uses the machete to cleave into the tunnel's upper
text: support beam. More spiders come into the tunnel. Sam
text: FIRES desperately. Chris keeps on hacking.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hurry!
text: Sam's GUNS CLICK DRY. Spiders charge. Chris swings the
text: machete hard. The ROOF COLLAPSES onto the attacking
dialog: spiders.
text: Chris and Sam leap back. Landing in a heap. Clouds of
text: dust swirl around them. They are tangled up for an
text: awkward beat. Their faces just inches from each other...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hold that thought.
text: They manage to disengage and move on.
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: Chris and Sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few
text: remaining survivors.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: We're trapped again!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: At least they can't follow us.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Which way do we go?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I think we're in one of the old
dialog: tunnels.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Can you get us out of here?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Don't worry, Sam.
text: Chris takes point with the others following nervously.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. MINES - JUNCTION - NIGHT
text: A boarded-up shaft entrance. Suddenly the WOOD
text: SPLINTERS. Chris and the others bash through. They file
text: into a slightly more open area with two branching
text: tunnels. The place is stacked from floor to ceiling with
text: barrels of toxic waste.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I don't believe it...
text: Mike recognizes the BioHazard warning label he saw on the
text: barrel in the drainage ditch.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I've seen one of these before!
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What are they?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Toxic waste.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where did you see it, Mike?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: The creek where Joshua gets his
dialog: spider food. There was one in the
dialog: water.
text: Chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We can get out this way!
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: No, we can't.
dialog: (turns to Wade)
dialog: Isn't that tunnel blocked off,
dialog: Dad?
text: Chris and the others look at Wade.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Uh... yeah... he's right. We

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: WADE

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I didn't have a choice! I was

dialog: grand!
text: Sam punches him. Knocking Wade to the ground.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think our lives are worth a
dialog: little more than that.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: We're wasting time.
text: Chris heads toward the only exit available. The others
text: follow. Wade staggers to his feet. Stumbling after
dialog: them.
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT
text: Chris leads the group down a tunnel. They come across
text: bits of vintage mining gear. A string of old light bulbs
text: runs along the roof into both tunnels.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: One end of these lights should be
dialog: connected to a generator. That'll
dialog: be near the entrance.
text: They continue down the tunnel. Entering...
scene_heading: INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT
text: A large cavern. Animal carcasses litter the ground.
text: Some human remains. Dead pets. Dead ostriches.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: My birds! You see, Sam? I wasn't
dialog: lying! That's what I can put on
dialog: the insurance form... giant

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Ewww... what's that smell?

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: Methane. This cavern is full of

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: One spark and we're all dead.
text: Norman swallows his glowing joint.
text: Chris shines his flashlight on a pile of mummy bundles.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: That's what I was talking about,
dialog: Chris. Presents from the male
text: tarantula to the female.
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: So the female's around here?
text: Bret looks around nervously.
text: The group moves closer. They sine their lights on a
text: horrifying sight. Joshua's corpse is a deflated flesh
text: balloon. Yellowed teeth sneer from a shattered skull.
text: He's completely desiccated. Every ounce of liquid
text: drained away.
text: Mike hides his eyes. Ashley comforts him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That one just moved!
text: Chris runs over and slices it open with his machete. The
text: web comes away to reveal a human hand.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: There's somebody in here!
text: Chris cuts away more web as the other survivors help.
text: They finally reveal Gladys.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Gladys!
text: The woman's body begins to spasm.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Gladys, please...
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Can anybody help her?!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Suddenly Ashley pushes her way forward.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: Her breathing is shallow. She's
text: going into arrest.
text: Ashley proceeds with CPR. Just like she saw on TV.
text: Suddenly Gladys snaps out of it. Gasping for air.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It's okay. It's okay.
text: Gladys starts to get a grip. Trying to focus on Chris.
text: From this angle Chris look like he has a golden halo.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Am I... dead?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You're okay.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: I'm not in heaven?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Then what's with all the gold?
text: Gladys points behind Chris's head to the wall of the
text: cavern. The group turns their lights on it. The
text: reflection is dazzling. Veins of gold criss-cross the
text: cavern walls.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Gold! Gold! Look! It's
dialog: everywhere!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is it real?
text: Chris checks it out.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Jesus... it's the mother lode...
dialog: He was right. My dad was right...
text: Chris helps Gladys to her feet. They share an emotional

speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: So were you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Wade chips away at the gold.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Get as much as you can!
text: Bret looks at Ashley.
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: Nice work, Doc.
text: Ashley acknowledges him. Bret chips gold with Wade. Sam
text: puts her hand on Ashley's shoulder.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You saved my life.
text: Ashley smiles.
text: Gladys leans over to Norman.
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: Have you got a smoke, kid?
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: The man says this cavern is full
text: of highly flammable methane gas.
dialog: I smoke to get high, not to die.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Spiders!
text: The group sees a cluster of normal-sized tarantulas
text: scuttling out of the shadows.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: What's the big deal?
text: Norman steps on the closest one, grinding it under his
text: boot. He stomps around, crushing as many as he can.
text: Mike watches this curiously. Taking a look at one of the
text: squashed bodies.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: I think you should stop.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They don't have hair. They aren't
text: fully grown tarantulas.
text: Chris and Sam look over.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: They're giant babies!
text: Norman freezes. He hears SOMETHING MOVING around in the
text: dark. And then a spine chilling... GROWL.
text: Chris reacts to the noise. He can guess what's coming...
text: The FEMALE TARANTULA steps out of the shadows. Consuela
text: has grown to be as big as a Volkswagen MicroBus. By far
text: the largest spider we've seen yet. Covered in hair.
text: Massive eyes. Her two fangs are the size of machetes.
text: Mike's eyes go wide at the sight of his old nemesis.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Consuela.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Consuela?
text: The fur on Consuela's back seems to undulate. There is
dialog: something weird there. A lot of weird things. In
text: fact... her entire back is littered with hundreds of baby
dialog: tarantulas.
text: As Consuela advances, she flicks several dart-sized
text: quills off her belly right into Norman. A dark stain
text: spreads across the drug dealer's shirt.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Bummer...
text: Consuela pierces Norman with her fangs, holding him
text: tight. Babies flood of her back and onto the doper,
text: chewing him to pieces like ravenous piranhas.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Go!
text: The group flees toward the opposite end of the cavern. A
text: male tarantula drops down to block their escape. Sam
text: BLOWS it away. Wade and Bret are still chipping away
text: bits of gold.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Leave it!
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: So you can keep it all!? Hell no!
text: Wade gets a nugget off the wall. He only has a
text: nanosecond to admire it before Consuela suddenly looms
text: behind him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: Dad!
text: Bret reaches out toward his father. Wade reaches for
text: him. Consuela's fangs suddenly protrude from Wade's
text: chest and he's hauled backward. The tarantula flings
text: Wade into the cave.
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Bret, come on!
text: Bret runs after the others. But he sees Consuela firing
text: more quills at the group. Directly at Ashley. Bret
text: leaps into harm's way. He's turned into a pin cushion.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Bret!
text: Ashley goes to his side.
speaker_heading: BRET
dialog: I'm sorry I...

scene_heading: INT. MINES - NIGHT
text: The survivors flee along the tunnel. Chris jumps up to

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We have to get out!
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: This is our chance to kill them
dialog: all.
text: Chris smashes the bulb at the end of the strand.
speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: will ignite the methane and torch
dialog: them!
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: GLADYS

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And the toxic waste...
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Will be buried under tons of rock!
dialog: Go!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I need to set the fuse as close to
dialog: the spiders as I can. That should
dialog: give us time to get clear.
text: Sam and Chris share a brief beat. And then Chris pulls
text: down the lights, dragging them back toward the
text: tarantula's den.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He has a cute butt. Don't you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: GLADYS
dialog: U.S.D.A. choice.
scene_heading: INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Bingo.

dialog: jet.
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I hate spiders.

scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNELS - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Hurry!
text: Sam lifts the MOTORCYCLE upright and climbs on. She
text: STARTS it and REVS the ENGINE. Ashley leaps aboard. Sam
text: accelerates along the shaft, away from the spider. The
text: bike's headlight illuminates their path.
text: The male tarantula scurries after the bike.
text: Sam rides the motorcycle along the shaft. Ashley hangs
dialog: on tight. They've put some distance between themselves
text: and the male tarantula. A dead-end looms before them.
text: Ashley screams as her mom stops on a dime and does a 180.
text: Sam rides back the way they came, heading straight toward
text: the male tarantula. Ashley looks over her mother's

dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY

dialog: the mines.
scene_heading: INT. MINES - TARANTULA DEN - DAWN

text: Sam looks back to see Chris running toward her. Consuela

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Chris!

text: The spiders retreat from daylight. Scuttling back into
text: the buildings. Heading down into the mine shafts.
scene_heading: INT. VARIOUS MINE TUNNELS - DAY

text: The EARTH BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.

text: shoots out of the nearby mine shaft. Consuela lives!
text: The spider is charred and bloody. But she's primed for
dialog: revenge.
text: Chris is yanked off his feet and hauled toward her. He
text: fumbles for his machete and hacks at the webline.
text: Cutting himself free just before getting impaled on
text: Consuela's fangs.
text: Consuela knocks away Chris's machete and lunges down at
text: him. Chris kicks her belly with both his feet. Consuela
text: begins to shudder. Jagged cracks appear in her charred
text: carapace. Chris kicks and tears at the failing armor.
text: He thinks he's harming the tarantula, but he's actually
dialog: helping it!
text: Mike and the others watch from the humvee.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Oh no... she's molting!
text: Consuela's blistered shell cracks as she shrugs the
text: damaged skin away from her body. Chris is amazed to see
text: the spider has grown a full size larger and become
dialog: totally rejuvenated!
text: Consuela comes after Chris. He defends himself with the
text: machete.
text: Shining steel makes contact with the dripping fangs.
text: Once again Consuela punts away the machete. She prepares
text: the death blow. It looks like curtains for Chris.
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Consuela! No! Bad! Bad
dialog: Consuela!
text: The massive spider stops in shock. Chris looks back to

dialog: BACK TO MIKE
text: He throws his Cassiopeia PDA at the spider's face...
text: Chris uses this moment of confusion to grab his machete
text: and drive it deep into the spider's unprotected
dialog: abdomen...
text: The tarantula screams.
text: Chris leaps up and runs, scooping up Mike. They dive
text: into the back of the humvee.

text: collapses in the dust. The TOWN EXPLODES in the b.g.
text: The earth itself begins to collapse.
scene_heading: INT. HUMVEE - DRIVING ACROSS DESERT - DAY
text: Gladys accelerates as the town sinks in the distance.
text: BUILDINGS EXPLODE. Jets of flame burst upward. The mall

text: The group smiles. Happy to be alive.
speaker_heading: MIKE
