speaker_heading: FADE IN ON:
scene_heading: EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN
scene_heading: Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN
dialog: We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known
dialog: World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.
text: In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.
text: Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
dialog: over a cliff:
text: AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.
text: Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
text: the ice. A human figure. This is:
scene_heading: JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.
text: Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
text: an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
text: backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
dialog: JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -
text: CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
text: below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
text: looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: There has to be an easier way to earn
dialog: a living.
text: Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -
speaker_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE -
text: He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a
text: toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -
text: THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -
text: BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -
text: And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of
text: water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached
text: to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.
text: Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and
text: forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.
text: At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other
text: pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:
text: THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
text: Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.
speaker_heading: RETURN ON BOND -
text: Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on
text: the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.
text: ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
text: Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally
text: frayed through.
speaker_heading: RETURN ON BOND -
text: One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
text: himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
text: ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,
text: he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely
text: holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -
text: Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -
text: through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.
text: As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he
text: smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -
scene_heading: THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -
text: Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.
speaker_heading: IN THE WATERBED -
text: A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,
text: he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)
text: Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:
scene_heading: BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -
text: On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled
text: down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
dialog: In other words: This was the only way in.
speaker_heading: RETURN ON BOND -
text: 007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
text: CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the
text: side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.
text: He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
text: slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.
scene_heading: EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES -
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -
text: Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
text: amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -
text: Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the
dialog: bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:
text: A ROCK OUTCROPPING.
text: Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He
text: unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a
text: HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:
scene_heading: A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)
text: 50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen
text: MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the
text: ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying
text: HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.
text: Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with
text: INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.
scene_heading: BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
text: Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.
scene_heading: THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -
text: He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining
text: over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.
scene_heading: THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON.
speaker_heading: BOND'S VOICE
dialog: (over a speaker)
dialog: Seven, in position.
speaker_heading: TANNER'S VOICE
dialog: Roger, Seven.
text: Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS,
text: including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK,
text: an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6.
text: M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: ... What were you saying, Admiral?
dialog: Something about this 'not being a job
text: for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing
dialog: playboy spy?'
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: - I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's
dialog: 'assistance' in my report to the
dialog: Prime Minister. But this is, still,
dialog: a naval operation.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: What do they say in Russia, General
dialog: Bukharin?
dialog: (asks questions in
dialog: flawless Russian)
dialog: The general chuckles. Translates:
speaker_heading: GENERAL BUKHARIN
dialog: 'In a joint operation, someone's nose
dialog: always gets put out of joint.'
dialog: M turns to Admiral Roebuck:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: I'm interested in success, Admiral.
dialog: Not who gets credit.
dialog: (turning to:)
dialog: Mr. Tanner: What have we got?
text: Tanner points to the video wall with a RED LASER PEN.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: A regular terrorist swap meet. Death
dialog: at discount: Two Chinese Long March
text: Scuds, a pair of Soviet A-17 attack
dialog: helicopters -
speaker_heading: BUKHARIN
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Stolen -
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: And the crates look like American M-16
dialog: assault rifles, Chilean antipersonnel
dialog: mines, six French Exocet missiles, and
dialog: 75 - no maybe a hundred - kilograms of
dialog: Czech made C-4 Semtech explosive.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Something for everyone. Fun for the
dialog: whole family.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (freezing him with a glance)
dialog: What about ID's?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: (pushes a button on a console)
dialog: One to seven: Deal the face cards.
scene_heading: THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
text: Bond adjusts a knob on the scope.
scene_heading: MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -
text: On the video-screen, the picture zooms to a CLOSE UP of one of the
text: arms traders. Tanner presses a button, and - almost instantly - the
text: man's bio and vitals appear on another video screen.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Gustav Meinholtz. Neo-Nazi, former
dialog: East German STASI agent. Ties to the
dialog: Beider-Meinhoff gang.
dialog: (pressing a button)
text: Aces high, seven. Bid to the east.
text: Bond shifts his aim, east. (Intercut as necessary) He zeroes in on
text: another face, and the man's stats appear in London.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Vilko Barkoviac. Bosnian war
dialog: criminal; thought to be operating
dialog: freelance out of Teheran.
dialog: (pressing a button)
dialog: Full house, seven. Bid to the North.
text: Bond complies. Another face, another set of stats:
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Sitoshi Isagura. Japanese religious
dialog: fanatic. Wanted for the Tokyo subway -
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: (impatiently, cutting him off:)
dialog: I've seen enough. Let's finish this.
dialog: (ordering M:)
dialog: Tell your man to drop back. We're
dialog: initiating plan B -
speaker_heading: M
dialog: But -
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: - Thank you, M. But this is more
dialog: than your man can handle.
dialog: (to Bukharin)
dialog: Are we in agreement?
speaker_heading: BUKHARIN
dialog: (hesitant, at first)
dialog: - Yes. Yes.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Admiral -
text: Moving swiftly, the Admiral has picked up a RED PHONE:
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK

dialog: I appreciate your assistance, M. But
dialog: this is now a military operation.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (urgently, to Tanner)
dialog: Bring up the tracking satellite. And
dialog: get 007 out of there.
text: Tanner hits a button - and a third video screen appears, displaying a
text: satellite view of the area, detailing the Cruise's path and progress.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: One to seven: Exit target area.
dialog: Repeat -
speaker_heading: BOND'S VOICE
dialog: Seven to one. Negative. Wait.
scene_heading: THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
text: Bond has taken his eye from the scope. He's peering at:
scene_heading: THE MIG-29'S - ("MiG-1," AND "MiG-2") -
text: A FORKLIFT appears from behind the TRUCK blocking the view of "MiG-l"
text: A TALL BALD MAN is riding the empty fork, with his back to us.
speaker_heading: BOND -
text: Puts his eye back on the scope, shifts the rifle -
speaker_heading: MI-6/VIDEO WALL -
text: Bond's scope view settles on THE BALD MAN. The forklift reaches the
text: back of the truck. HE STEPS OFF as the fork begins rising to unload
text: something. And as the man turns, FACING US to scan the area:
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Oh, no.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: (calling up his stats)
dialog: Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear
dialog: specialist.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Meaning there may be nuclear material
dialog: down there?
text: Tanner nods. A look passes from M, to Bukharin, to Roebuck.
speaker_heading: THE CRUISE MISSILE -
text: Hugging the surface, crossing from water to land.
scene_heading: MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -
speaker_heading: VOICE FROM WARSHIP
dialog: Time to target: Three minutes.
dialog: (sfx: Beep!)
dialog: Target acquired. Weapon armed.
text: Tension. Adrenaline. QUIET PANIC. On the SCREEN, the FORK LIFT has
text: pulled a RED BOX from the truck, a SHORT ROUND MAN appearing with it.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Who is that?!? What's in the box??
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: (punching buttons)
dialog: I don't know. He's not in the database -
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (to Bukharin)
dialog: What's in the box, General?
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: What's in the box???
speaker_heading: BUKHARIN
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: ... We usually... Transport...
dialog: Weapons grade uranium.
text: Shock sweeps the room. M turns on Tanner:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Will it go off?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Maybe. Maybe not.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Abort the cruise.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: It's too late -
speaker_heading: M
text: GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: One to seven - one to seven -
scene_heading: BOND - SQUINTING THROUGH THE RIFLE AT THE OUTCROPPING -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Negative, one. NOT YET.
text: THE TRUCK/MiG-l, ON THE GROUND/THROUGH THE SCOPE -
text: THE BALD MAN slaps the back of the truck obscuring MiG-1. THE TRUCK
text: PULLS AWAY, revealing MiG-l's WING. Hanging from the weapons pod: A
speaker_heading: NUCLEAR BOMB.
scene_heading: BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
dialog: Mutters a curse.
scene_heading: MI-6 SITUATION ROOM -
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield,

speaker_heading: M
dialog: Will the cruise set it off?
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: (to Bukharin)
dialog: Jesus. Can't you people keep
dialog: anything locked up?
speaker_heading: GENERAL BUKHARIN
dialog: We didn't know it was missing.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Get me the Prime Minister. Alert
dialog: NATO, the CIA, the Pentagon.
dialog: (presses a button:)
dialog: Seven: This is a direct order. I
dialog: want you out of there. Do you copy?
scene_heading: THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
text: Bond's headset lies on top of the rock, along with the telescopic
dialog: sight - still broadcasting.
text: Find Bond, crouching BEHIND the rock. Automatic rifle in one hand,
text: GRENADE in the other. He pulls the pin, hurls it 40 feet away.
dialog: Pauses. Waits, counting down time. Then -
text: BOND SPRINGS. SHOOTS at one of the CRATES. IT BLOWS UP, just as -
scene_heading: THE GRENADE EXPLODES.
text: There's PANIC ON THE GROUND. Men running everywhere as THE RADAR/
text: GATLING GUN spins, and SENDS A HAIL OF FIRE at Bond's diversion.
text: And with this, BOND is off, SPRINTING INTO THE CHAOS.
scene_heading: THE SAME SCENE - VIDEO SCREEN - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM.
text: Stoned silence. Disbelief. Tanner whispers:
speaker_heading: TANNER
dialog: God help him.
scene_heading: THE CRUISE MISSILE - FLYING THROUGH A MOUNTAIN RAVINE -
dialog: God help the rest of us.
scene_heading: THE SECRET AIR BASE -
text: As various factions shoot at each other (Who's the traitor?) Bond
text: streaks toward the action. Without breaking stride, he swings his
text: gun to the right: TWO BURSTS. THREE MEN DIE. Still running, he
text: swings to the left: ANOTHER BURST. TWO MORE DOWN.
text: Ahead, Bond sees the FLIGHT CREWS DASHING for the MiG's. He makes a
dialog: beeline for MiG-1.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE BALD MAN -
text: Slamming the gate on the RED BOX in a cargo truck. Rushing to the
text: passenger door. Climbing in. The SHORT ROUND MAN floors the

scene_heading: THE CRUISE MISSILE - STARTING ITS DESCENT DOWN A MOUNTAIN
scene_heading: MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - M, WATCHING HELPLESSLY -
speaker_heading: VOICE FROM WARSHIP
dialog: Time to target: Thirty seconds.
speaker_heading: WIDE ON MiG-1 -
text: The pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit. Running at full tilt,
text: BOND LEAPS, pulls the man down. They fall to the tarmac, FIGHTING.
text: Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him.
text: Kneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is
text: coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE
text: from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart.
text: ANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT -
text: Where the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's
text: not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH
text: THE HELMET. The copilot collapses into his seat, unconscious.
text: Bond settles into his seat, fires the engines, closes the double
text: canopy, and begins taxiing out.

speaker_heading: TONE -
scene_heading: INT./EXT. MIG-2

scene_heading: INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -

text: THE TWO HEAT SEEKING MISSILES FOLLOW HIM, LOOPING UPWARD.
scene_heading: INT. MIG-2 -
text: Bond's MiG has disappeared from the pilot's view: Not in front. Not
text: on the left. Not on the right. Where did he go? The pilot looks up:
scene_heading: BOND'S MIG APPEARS, FLYING INVERTED, COCKPIT DOWN, 10 FEET ABOVE MIG-2.
text: THE PILOT OF MIG-2 IS STUNNED.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG -
text: Fighting against the garrote, Bond strains to reach a RED BUTTON on

text: Bond finally taps it, and - THE BACK HALF OF THE CANOPY BLOWS OFF!
text: The COPILOT BLASTS OUT OF THE PLANE, DOWNWARD, directly into MIG-2's

speaker_heading: JENNY WU
dialog: Mandarin. You jerk.

speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY

speaker_heading: JENNY WU
dialog: Good afternoon.
dialog: (then to Bond)
dialog: Are you sure you can't stay for the

speaker_heading: BOND

speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE EVERHART, (early 30's, Belgian,) refers to video clips from

scene_heading: COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
dialog: To sum up: After analyzing the tire
text: inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6
dialog: video tape, NATO believes the "red
dialog: box contains approximately eighty
dialog: kilograms of U235 weapons grade
dialog: uranium - an incredibly hard,
dialog: incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal
dialog: substance.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: And that's enough enriched uranium to
dialog: produce how many nuclear devices?
scene_heading: COL. DQMINIQUE EVERHART
dialog: Depending on the builder's sophistication
dialog: - one crude bomb that could devastate
dialog: London, Paris, New York, Berlin - or all
dialog: four if they have the latest technology.
text: There's a pregnant pause in the room.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: And the participants?
scene_heading: COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
dialog: (pointing at the screen)
dialog: Kim Dae Yung. Moscow-trained North
dialog: Korean nuclear weapons specialist;
dialog: apparently fell out of favor with the
dialog: current North Korean regime after a

text: Another face appears on the screen:
speaker_heading: COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (cont'd)
dialog: And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as
dialog: Richard Stamper. Freelance mercenary,
dialog: Laos and Cambodia. His father was
dialog: from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con-
dialog: scripted by the British government to
dialog: fight in China during World War II -
dialog: after which the family settled in

dialog: was undoubtedly treated like a second
dialog: class citizen by both the Hong Kong

dialog: (beat, aside:)
dialog: We've all read about the signs at the

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Nothing like a little imperialism to
dialog: promote loyalty among the faithful.
scene_heading: COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART
dialog: (stifles a smile, then:)
dialog: In conclusion: Both these men have a
dialog: vendetta against the world. They are
dialog: nuclear armed, and dangerous. And
dialog: having failed to get the UZ35 through
dialog: the old opium route - the Khyber Pass
dialog: - it's NATO's belief that their next
dialog: attempt will be through Bulgaria -
dialog: where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force
dialog: will be there to stop them.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Thank you Colonel Everhart.
dialog: (stands, turns to:)
dialog: 007, I'd like to see you in my office.
dialog: Why don't you and the Colonel exchange
dialog: numbers if you need more information?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Yes, M.
text: M exits. Bond approaches Dominique. She smiles, warmly. There's a
text: mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Interesting presentation.
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
text: Interesting video tape.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: They point, I shoot.
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
dialog: (feels her pockets)
dialog: Do you have a pen? I just got promoted
dialog: and don't have my new cards yet.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Of course.
text: Bond hands her a PEN. She regards it cautiously.
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
dialog: ... Does this do anything?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Depends what number you write.
text: She gives him a wry look; starts to write. He notes her WEDDING BAND.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Married?
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
dialog: Happily.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Kids?
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
dialog: Three. You? Married?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I didn't think so.
text: For an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness? Re-
dialog: morse? Either way, she's scored a subtle victory.
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
dialog: Here. I gave you my assistant's
dialog: phone number. If it's urgent, she
dialog: knows where to reach me.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (beat, holding her gaze)
dialog: Take care -
speaker_heading: DOMINIQUE
dialog: You too.
text: With a Sphinx-like smile, she watches Bond leave.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Where Bond encounters MONEYPENNY, also walking to M's office.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting
dialog: like this. They may be on to us.
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: In the darkest moments, it's what I
dialog: live for. Especially since I've
dialog: heard how much you like to watch...
text: On the hidden camera.
text: Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique
text: leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them.
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: By the way, James: Ordinarily I would
dialog: never ask, but... Weren't you and
dialog: that Colonel once stranded on a raft
dialog: for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have
dialog: you ever known me to kiss and tell?
text: They've come to a security door. She punches in a code -
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: Actually, I've never known you to do
dialog: either... But -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: - We all want what we can't have?
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: Not all of us, 007.
text: The door opens. They go into:
scene_heading: INT. M'S ANTEROOM (MONEYPENNY'S AREA) - CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: What - no lust for adventure?
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: No, 007. It's just that I've learned
dialog: from personal experience - that when
dialog: we get what we want -
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Somehow the reality is never as...
text: Satisfying as the fantasy.
text: Bond scowls. Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door:
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY
dialog: Don't keep M waiting.
scene_heading: INT. M'S OFFICE - DAY
text: M is behind her desk; MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a high-
dialog: handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of
dialog: plutonium. They've been arguing.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Come in, 007. You know the Minister?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Of course.
dialog: (nods to)
dialog: Minister Johnstone.
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: 007.
text: Bond sits in an armchair. M presses a button, and a video/bio of
text: ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her. Mid-50's, regal.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Tell me, 007, what do you know about
dialog: Elliot Harmsway?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (quipping)
dialog: Only what I read in the newspapers.
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: (disdainfully)
dialog: His newspapers?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (glancing sideways)
dialog: Occasionally, yes.
dialog: (directly to M)
dialog: British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong;
dialog: controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable,
dialog: satellites; books, magazines, movies,
dialog: computer software. Theme parks.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (holding up a copy of:)
dialog: - Along with Tomorrow - the first
dialog: world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27
dialog: million. Daily. -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: 'Able to topple governments with a single
dialog: story' - as he says in his press.
speaker_heading: JOHNSTONE
dialog: (hurrumph)
dialog: Exactly.
text: Bond looks at Johnstone quizzically. Then a very tight-lipped M. He
text: senses he's about to enter a minefield:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... What's Harmsway done?
speaker_heading: M
dialog: It seems, 007, we've received a tip
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: A rumor - from an anonymous source -
speaker_heading: M
dialog: - that Sir Elliot may be involved
dialog: with Stamper and Yung, and the
dialog: missing Uranium.
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: Hearsay. Idle chatter from a source
dialog: you can't identify - who insists on
dialog: talking only to 007. Nothing but
dialog: loose talk and innuendo.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: That may be the case at present,
dialog: Minister Johnstone... But our own
dialog: sources suspect that Mr. Harmsway
dialog: used his considerable Russian media
dialog: - holdings to elect Valentin Zukofsky
dialog: President of the Ukraine - in trade
dialog: for the uranium.
text: (M has punched a button, and Valentin's video bio has appeared.)
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
text: More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Perhaps. But it does explain how an
dialog: ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms
text: dealer is suddenly portrayed as a
dialog: long-time friend of the people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If you believe what you read in the papers.
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Need I remind the two of you that
dialog: Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway
dialog: - is directly descended from the Earl
dialog: of Aberdeen? That his Scottish
dialog: ancestors practically invented Hong
dialog: Kong - and out of sheer gratitude,
dialog: Queen Victoria herself named the port
dialog: "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (long pause, then:)
dialog: ... No more than I need remind you,
dialog: Minister, that merely being a member
dialog: of the lucky sperm club - does not
dialog: preclude one from a life of criminal
dialog: activity.
text: Johnstone is reeling. M continues, to Bond, with aplomb:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: The reason I invited the Minister
dialog: here, 007, was to reassure him that
dialog: this investigation will be handled
dialog: with the utmost discretion.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Which is also why I've withheld this
dialog: information from NATO and our allies.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (nods, then, recalling)
dialog: ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Yes. 1988. He was furious at the
dialog: British plan to return Hong Kong, and
dialog: supposedly started his own negotiations
dialog: with the Chinese Government. The inquiry
dialog: went nowhere - but it did earn MI-6 a
dialog: rather powerful enemy -
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: Not to mention the chaos it caused at
dialog: Whitehall when his newspapers began
dialog: screaming for the recall of the
dialog: sitting government.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: (a beat, then:)
dialog: I'm sending you to Venice, 007.
dialog: You're to check out the source,
dialog: determine whether Elliot Harmsway is
dialog: involved with the enriched uranium,
dialog: and, if so, stop him.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How will I meet the informant?
text: She hands Bond a CARNIVAL MASK:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: You're to wear this mask at the Venice
dialog: Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: (standing, to leave)
dialog: There is one last thing, 007: Elliot
dialog: Harmsway is vital to the economic
dialog: interests of this nation. He's also
dialog: a major contributor to the party. I
dialog: expect him to be given every consideration.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Political considerations?
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: To the best of my recollection, Mr.
dialog: Bond, I suggested no such thing.
dialog: (beat, at the door)
dialog: In fact, I was never here.
text: And he exits. M, frowning, hits a button on her intercom:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Would you send in the new man from
dialog: equipment branch?
speaker_heading: MONEYPENNY (O.S.)
dialog: Right away.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: .... I hate to ask, but... Did you
dialog: ever think you'd miss Communism?
speaker_heading: M
dialog: We serve the interests of the British
dialog: people, 007. No matter who we may be
dialog: foolish enough to elect.
text: Bond is silent, chastised. M looks away, then looks back:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: But if Elliot Harmsway is involved
dialog: with that uranium, I want him
dialog: prosecuted to the ends of the earth.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Hopefully, it won't get that far.
text: M looks up: MALCOLM SAUNDERS, Q's successor, limps in, looking like a
text: mummy - plaster casts on his left leg, left arm; neck-brace, crutch.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Come in, Saunders.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: M. 007.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Okay, Saunders. What is it this
dialog: time? Rocket in the leg? Machine
dialog: pistol in the arm?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Q's retirement party. I'd just put
dialog: the knife into the cake, and -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Come on. I know better than that -
text: Bond thwacks the crutch against the leg. Saunders GRIMACES IN PAIN.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It must do something.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Well... If you insist.
text: Saunders flexes his broken arm; ARMORED SPIKES pop out of the it.
speaker_heading: BOND
text: The die is cast.
text: Saunders exchanges a beleaguered glance with M. He takes off the cast
text: and neck-brace, and places a BRIEFCASE on M's desk.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Now pay attention, 007. We haven't much
dialog: time to demonstrate your new Q toys.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How is old Q?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Gone fishing.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Fishing?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Big game fishing.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sonar torpedoes. Retirement gift
dialog: from his friends at the CIA.
text: Saunders has opened the briefcase. Bond tries to look inside, but
dialog: Saunders repositions it. Saunders continues:
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: In the meantime, perhaps this will
dialog: spark your interest.
dialog: (takes out a disposable lighter)
dialog: Cigarette lighter. Thumb here, press here -
text: A small flame appears. Bond, unimpressed, reaches for it -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Not from forty feet.
text: Saunders flips the lighter sideways and - WHOOSH! A burst of flame
text: shoots across the room.
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: The disposable lighter also contains
dialog: a small self-detonation charge
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Depending on who - or what - you
dialog: wish to dispose of.
text: Bond takes the lighter, begins to play with it...
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: Stop fidgeting, 007. Next -
text: He takes out a pair of SHOELACES.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Shoelaces?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
text: Plastique explosive shoelaces.
dialog: (holding them out at length)
dialog: Cut them to regulate the size of the
dialog: blast; totally harmless until you
dialog: attach the detonator hidden in the
dialog: heel of your shoe.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (examining them curiously)
dialog: Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty'
dialog: problem?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: Moving along -
dialog: (he produces:)
text: A typical plastic security card.
dialog: Name here, magnetic information
dialog: stripe here -
dialog: (pointing to)
dialog: And a code breaking microprocessor
dialog: here. Swipe it through any card
dialog: reader - anywhere - you're in.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Does it work on cash machines?
text: Saunders is suddenly stricken. Flustered. He blurts out:
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (amused)
dialog: I see...
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: (ignoring this)
dialog: Finally, your new watch: Blue laser
dialog: here for signaling or burning
dialog: through locks; press this button, the
text: sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (needling him)
dialog: If you can't do the time, don't do
dialog: the crime?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: (smirks at Bond, pauses, then)
dialog: Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last
dialog: thing: Before Q retired, he asked that
dialog: I give you one other protective device.
text: He hands Bond a WEDDING BAND.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: A wedding band??? What am I supposed
dialog: to be able to do with this?
speaker_heading: SAUNDERS
dialog: I believe Q's exact words were:
dialog: (imitating Q, emphatically:)
dialog: "Hopefully, nothing."
text: Bond turns from Saunder's devious grin to an amused M. Smiles:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...I'll give you a ring from Venice.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Good luck on your mission, 007.
text: He snaps the ring down on her desk.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Till death do us part.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE HARBOR/GRAND CANAL - NIGHT
text: A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge
text: tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.)
text: Tonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water...
text: Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed
text: partygoers and musicians in medieval garb.
text: Wearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond
text: alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT
text: A swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic
text: celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face:
text: NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue.
text: Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right,
dialog: anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it?
text: THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Buona sera, signore -
text: He's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Vino?
text: Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a
text: group of celebrants carrying a long banner.
text: Suddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the
text: EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square.
text: Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look
text: forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind.
text: He can only crane his neck to see/hear -
speaker_heading: MASKED WOMAN
dialog: I may have been followed. Meet me at
dialog: the Church in five minutes!
text: With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save
text: the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks
dialog: behind him.
speaker_heading: SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT
text: Five minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The
text: MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and
text: the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly -
text: Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Looking for someone?
text: Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS
text: removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007:
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Hello, James.
text: Bond reacts. He is not happy to see her.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Paris?!? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Is that any way to say hello?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I thought your specialty was good-bye.
text: Paris smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair -
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Oh, James. I've missed you -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (grabbing her by the wrist)
dialog: Is this another one of your games?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't
dialog: you just be nice?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I've got half the British government
dialog: breathing down my neck. I don't have
dialog: time for your nonsense.
text: She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Don't you even miss me? Didn't I
dialog: mean anything to you?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Nothing.
text: She turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is
dialog: this just another one of your stunts?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: (anguished)
dialog: No! He's crazy - he's insane. He
dialog: hates everybody. He's got these
dialog: plans -
dialog: (facing Bond, becoming hysterical:)
dialog: You've got to help me, James. I'm
dialog: sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I
dialog: know I was wrong - but you've got to
dialog: protect me. I know you still love -
text: BOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered:
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Do you feel better now?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (not giving an inch)
dialog: Do you?
text: She turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: What about the uranium?
speaker_heading: PARIS
text: It's on the boat. He's holding a
dialog: press conference tomorrow.
text: Bond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her
text: face in his shoulder.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll
dialog: never leave you again.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (patting her head)
dialog: Shhhhh...
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Just hold me.
text: Bond thinks for a moment, then gently pushes her away, a foot
dialog: backwards, to look in her eyes:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How do you know Harmsway?
text: Paris' eyes flicker at something over Bond's shoulder. She swoons:
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Kiss me.
text: She pulls Bond to her, kissing him - then HAULS OFF, BELTING him
dialog: across the mouth.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Bastard! Leave me alone!
text: She shoves him off, darts away. Bond is bleeding from his mouth -
text: and not altogether surprised at her behavior. He turns to see -
scene_heading: ANOTHER ANGLE - SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - (BOND'S POV) -
text: Paris running to FOUR MEN dressed alike in three-corner hats,
text: enveloped from head-to-foot in BLACK CAPES. Their faces are
text: completely concealed behind flat, bone-white masks covering all but
text: their chins. They look like messengers of death.
scene_heading: CLOSER ON PARIS AND THE MEN -
text: The leader is STAMPER; the others are locals, THUG #1, #2, #3. (THUG
text: #1 is built like a bank vault.) Stamper looks steadily at Bond
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Nobody. Just some drunk. Leave him
dialog: alone -
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: (to Thug #3)
dialog: Take her to the boat.
speaker_heading: RETURN ON BOND -
text: He sees STAMPER and the TWO HENCHMEN approaching. He turns and walks
dialog: quickly toward -
scene_heading: EXT. RIALTO BRIDGE - FIRST (UP) STAIRCASE - NIGHT
text: Pushing past carnival-goers, Bond rushes up the central staircase of
text: the bridge. At the top, looking onto the main span, he sees -
text: THE EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL PROCESSION, approaching like a tidal wave.
text: BOND throws a look over his shoulder, and SEES THE THREE MEN, rushing
text: up the stairs, knocking people out of the way like bowling pins -
text: completely unaware of the oncoming parade at the top.
text: BOND turns to face the men... And suddenly THROWS HIS CAPE UP,
text: dramatically, like Batman - blocking their view of the procession.
text: STAMPER AND THE TWO THUGS hesitate for a moment -
text: And BOND PULLS THE CAPE TO HIS BODY, just as the PROCESSION SURGES
text: PAST HIM, and spills down the stairs, overwhelming Stamper &amp; Co.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (to himself, flexing the cape)
dialog: So that's how he does it.
text: Bond disappears into the oncoming crowd.
text: Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but
text: Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.
scene_heading: RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT
text: As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:
text: THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing
text: carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -
text: But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes
text: right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,
text: pulling the men down, after him.
scene_heading: BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
text: Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:
text: A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -
dialog: and just beyond this -
text: A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.
text: BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the
dialog: picture for him.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Prego, prego. Permissio.
speaker_heading: TOURIST
dialog: Grazie.
text: Bond takes the camera. The tourists pose. And with perfect timing,
text: Bond turns, and - POP! - sets off the FLASHBULB in THUG #l's face
text: just as he comes around the corner.
text: Bond flips the camera back to the tourist -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Grazie -
text: And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the
text: thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.
text: The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart
text: stops on top of him, pinning him down.
text: BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.
text: Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS
text: in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed
text: off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -
text: 007 disappears down the sidestreet.
text: Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO
text: MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of
text: the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT
text: INTO THE CANAL.
text: RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -
text: Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug
text: #1 disappear onto the side Street.
text: Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course
dialog: along the canals toward -
scene_heading: THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT
text: Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close
text: to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.
scene_heading: ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -
text: Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.
speaker_heading: BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA
text: Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and
dialog: start looking for him.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -
text: Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:
text: THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast
text: move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing
text: it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from
text: under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.
text: (He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE -
text: Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the
dialog: courtyard of Il Bovolo.
scene_heading: RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -
text: Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he
text: pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the
text: cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -
text: The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,
text: hurling him against the opposite wall.
text: With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands.
speaker_heading: THUG #2
dialog: Marco - I didn't know -
speaker_heading: THUG #1
dialog: After him!
dialog: They charge off.
scene_heading: IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT
text: Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No
text: way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH
text: FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.
speaker_heading: THE SPIRAL STAIRS -
text: Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -
text: The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR
text: BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.
speaker_heading: THE BALCONY -
text: Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the
text: building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the
text: courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.
text: Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.
text: Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the
text: GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and
dialog: disappears from sight...
text: Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.
speaker_heading: FIRST ROOFTOP -
text: Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are
text: SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop
text: to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.
speaker_heading: SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -
text: 007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold
text: on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:
text: The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.
text: As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE BALCONY -
text: Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy
text: to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.
speaker_heading: FIRST ROOFTOP -
text: Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the
text: next building. He makes a running leap.
speaker_heading: SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -
text: Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They
text: grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the
text: roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.
text: AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the
text: skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.
text: 007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1
text: tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO
speaker_heading: BOND'S LEGS.
text: They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the
dialog: two of them fall -
text: CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -
scene_heading: VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.
text: They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the
text: Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the
text: collar, hauling him up on his feet.
text: Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up
text: on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:
speaker_heading: THUG #1
dialog: I owe you some pain.
text: With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his
text: gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just
text: clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.
text: The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,
text: and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.
text: As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally
text: (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.
text: With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.
dialog: He's having fun.
text: AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -
text: THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.
text: BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out
text: of the way, like a gnat.
text: Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from
text: the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.
text: Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,
text: and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword.
text: With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.
text: The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:
speaker_heading: A DISPLAY WALL -
text: filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.
text: (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.
text: Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.
text: THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug
text: #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE -
text: Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond
text: backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.
text: (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)
text: Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the
text: last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from
text: killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.
text: As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A
text: studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)
text: Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN
text: TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.
text: Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the
text: wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM
text: THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright. -
text: In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1
text: backwards, down onto the floor.
scene_heading: AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -
text: THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.
text: BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE:
text: THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM.
text: And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE
scene_heading: IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV -
text: The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE -
text: The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still
text: clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: He fought hard...
dialog: (holstering the gun)
dialog: But the case was terminal.
dialog: And on this note, we -
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY -
text: Under a beautiful blue sky, the gleaming white SEA DOLPHIN II sits at
text: dock, festooned with pennants and banners. There's a crowd onboard.
text: At the same time, however, 500 feet away...
scene_heading: INT. DOCKSIDE CAFE -
text: Bond meets with Signore DiGIACOMO, a middle-aged Italian Intelligence
text: official in shirtsleeves. Two underlings hover in the background.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You've confirmed all the legal
dialog: details with M?
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: Si. Bueno. She's very...
dialog: 'Competent.' ...For a woman.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Let's go over this one more time.
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: You will investigate the boat.
dialog: You'll signal us if you find the
dialog: enriched uranium. And then -
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Pardon.
text: He looks at a WOMAN who has appeared with a baby in her arms.
speaker_heading: ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY
dialog: Don Franco. I just want to say we're
dialog: voting for you in the election.
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: (teasing, re: the baby)
dialog: Both of you?
speaker_heading: ITALIAN WOMAN W/BABY
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: Grazie, grazie. Ciao.
text: She leaves. He turns back Bond:
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: So. You'll signal us if you find the
dialog: uranium -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: And you'll wait until after the press
dialog: conference - and everyone is gone -
dialog: before you board the boat and arrest
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: Perfecto. Then we turn him over to you,
dialog: and the English government puts him on a
dialog: military transport back to London.
text: Bond nods, looks over at the Sea Dolphin II.
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: Do not worry, my friend. I only want
dialog: what is best. For both of us.
text: Bond stands to leave. DiGiacomo smiles after 007 - as if he's
text: savoring some private secret. He snaps his fingers to an underling:
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: Rocco! Un Cappuccino!
speaker_heading: THE SEA DOLPHIN II -
text: As Bond makes his way up the gangplank -
text: ELLIOT HARMSWAY is holding a press conference near the bow, surround-
text: ed by dignitaries. He is a man with an EVIL EUPHORIA - showing off
dialog: all the charm and charisma that's made him one of the world's most
dialog: powerful media tycoons.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ...And so, it's somewhat fitting that
dialog: we are here today... To christen this
dialog: environmental research boat in Venice -
dialog: - 'Venezia' - the port where Marco
dialog: Polo sailed forth to explore the
dialog: world's great uncharted oceans...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That 2/3 of the earth's surface where
dialog: the sharks are not working members of
dialog: the press.
text: Laughter. Bond studies the man. Harmsway continues, pointing to a
text: LARGE DRILL/BORING OBJECT, the size of a jet engine, attached to a
dialog: long flexible hose/tube.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: With our six custom designed sea-bed
dialog: coring drills, we will probe the
dialog: long-term effects of pollution; our
dialog: sonars, radars, and research labs
dialog: will study the wind, the water, and
dialog: the sea life that so dearly feeds us.
text: Bond moves through the crowd. He spots a bulkhead, with a door.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: And so, in the spirit of international
dialog: cooperation - thanking my good friend,
dialog: Valentin Zukofsky - the newly elected
dialog: President of the Ukraine for all his
dialog: assistance -
text: He motions to Zukofsky, who nods to the audience...
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I give this boat to mankind - selflessly
dialog: - in pure charity asking nothing for
dialog: myself... But the cable TV rights.
text: Big laugh from the assemblage. Harmsway turns to a BEAUTY QUEEN:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Miss Venice? If you'll do the honors -
text: SMASH! She cracks a champagne bottle on the tip of the bow. CHEERS!
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Now I'll take some questions from the
dialog: press - even the few of you who
dialog: aren't on my payroll.
text: Laughter. Harmsway points to a reporter:
speaker_heading: REPORTER #1
dialog: Mr. Harmsway: Why did you name this
dialog: boat the Sea Dolphin II?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Actually, my first choice was 'No
dialog: Comment.' So if someone asked where
dialog: I was, I could truthfully respond 'No
dialog: Comment.'
dialog: (laughter; he points)
dialog: Over there.
speaker_heading: REPORTER #2
dialog: Sir Elliot: Is it true you're in
dialog: negotiations to move your offices
dialog: from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (impishly)
dialog: No comment.
text: Amidst more laughter, Bond disappears into the bulkhead door.
scene_heading: INT. SEA DOLPHIN II - BELOW DECKS -
text: Bond moves cautiously down a STAIRCASE...
text: And peers along a CORRIDOR. He sees a GUARD, checking doors, making
text: sure they're locked. Bond withdraws for a moment, looks back: The
text: guard is at the far end of the hall. He lifts a WALKIE-TALKIE:
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Level one, secure.
text: The guard exits, down another staircase. Bond moves stealthily down
text: the corridor, glancing at signs on various doors: FISH HATCHERY,
text: WEATHER STATION, CREW'S MESS, etc... Until he comes to:
text: METALLURGY LAB. There's a CARD READER by the door. Bond slips out
text: his Q-toy, swipes it. Click. He goes inside.
scene_heading: INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - CONTINUOUS
text: Bond clocks the lab: Power tools, test benches, a SECOND ENTRY
text: DOOR... And in the middle of the room -
speaker_heading: THE RED BOX.
text: Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard
text: through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking
text: for tamper-proof seals. Finds none. Gingerly, he opens it:
text: URANIUM SLUGS. They look like black tennis ball canisters.
text: BOND presses a button on his watch: THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS WILDLY
text: Bond pauses. Wants to make sure. He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER on
text: a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result.
text: Bond closes the box. He decides to check out the rest of the room -
text: examining gadgets, tools, chemicals. HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -
text: And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS, WITH ELONGATED TEETH.
text: (They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside
dialog: another )
text: Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight. He wonders what it
dialog: is used for. Just then -
text: THERE'S A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR. Bond quickly replaces the
text: cutting saw, moves to the first door -
text: And as the SECOND DOOR OPENS, Bond slips out the first, into the
text: CORRIDOR, down the hall, heading for the stairs.
scene_heading: BACK IN THE METALLURGY LAB -
text: YUNG enters, his hairless head shining under the lights. He looks
text: around, sensing something is wrong. Glances: Not the red box. Not
text: the Geiger counter. But then he notices it:
text: THE DRAWER is sticking out, maybe a sixteenth of an inch.
text: Yung picks up a telephone.
scene_heading: SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -
text: Bond emerges from the bulkhead door. The press conference wrapping
text: up. As Bond makes his way to the RAIL, looking out on the cafe -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: The maiden voyage begins tonight. I
dialog: have some business in London - but
dialog: the ship will sail down the Nile,
dialog: across the South China Sea, stopping
dialog: in Australia, winding up in San
dialog: Francisco.
text: Bond stands at the rail, AIMS HIS WATCH at the cafe -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (cont'd)
dialog: But having said that - let's get to
dialog: the real business - the only thing
dialog: that attracts newsmen faster than a
dialog: breaking story the free food and
dialog: beverage.
scene_heading: INT. CAFE -
text: DiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER. Motions his men to action.
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE -
text: Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain
text: ac inconspicuous as possible. A hand clasps his shoulder:
speaker_heading: VALENTIN'S VOICE
dialog: Mr. James Bond!
text: Bond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of
text: cheaply dressed goons.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: What is it that brings you to
dialog: Venezia, Mr. Bond? Business -
dialog: (sly glance to the thugs)
dialog: Or somebody else's business?
text: The goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks
text: a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck.
text: A WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She
text: is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Dimitri!!! You promised I could go
dialog: shopping!!
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: (sotto, to Bond)
dialog: New mistress.
dialog: (to her, impatiently)
dialog: So? Go!
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I need money.
text: Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Here. Take an inch.
text: Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond:
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's
dialog: free.
text: With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move
text: several steps to the bar.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: (to the bartender)
text: Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred.
dialog: (to Bond)
dialog: And you?
dialog: Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his
dialog: regular behavior might arouse suspicion.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: One.
dialog: As the bartender pours:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I must say, Valentin, capitalism
dialog: seems to be treating you well.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: (belting one back)
dialog: I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Off the record.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Of course. If you can't beat the
dialog: government, you might as well own it.
text: Valentin spots someone off-camera.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Wait - I want you to meet a friend of
dialog: mine.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Elliot! Elliot! Come here.
text: Harmsway appears. Ebullient as ever.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce
dialog: you to an old friend -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (putting out a hand to shake)
dialog: The name is Bond. James Bond.
text: Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Always nice to meet one of her
dialog: Majesty's fellow subjects...
dialog: (a nod to Valentin)
dialog: Especially one with such
dialog: distinguished friends.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You might say I've always been one of
dialog: Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: (chortling)
dialog: 'Biggest followers?' He's
dialog: practically made a career' of it!!
text: He laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot.
text: Practically glows in the dark.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I can tell you're a man with an eye
dialog: for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond.
dialog: (signaling off camera)
dialog: Darling! Come here.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want you to meet my wife.
text: A woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As
text: she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce
dialog: you to James Bond.
text: There is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming
dialog: his most insinuating smile:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: But then... I believe you two have
dialog: already met.
text: There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then -
text: POLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT!
text: The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the
text: gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI-
text: TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS.
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices
dialog: of the Italian government, I, Franco
dialog: DiGiacomo -
text: (pauses; smiles at a camera;
dialog: POP! A flash goes off)
dialog: Am arresting you for the illegal
dialog: possession of weapons grade enriched
dialog: uranium.
dialog: (to his underlings)
dialog: Seize the boat!
text: A set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway.
speaker_heading: VALENTIN
dialog: I think I suddenly remembered an
dialog: urgent meeting in Moscow.
text: To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: My friends, there's been a terrible mistake.
dialog: (putting his arm around DiGiacomo)
dialog: Come. Let me show you.
text: And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is
text: left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Paris -
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't
dialog: it in our files?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: (anguished)
dialog: He didn't want anyone to know. He
dialog: kept it out of the papers. He said a
dialog: third wife was bad for his image.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've got to protect me!
text: Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Go to my hotel room. I'll be there
dialog: in twenty minutes.
text: Paris looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she
dialog: wants to hear him say 'I love you.'
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Just - say it. Say it just once.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (pauses, discomfited)
dialog: One thing at a time. I'll see you
dialog: in twenty minutes. Go.
text: She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the
text: SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him.
scene_heading: INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II -
text: Harmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I believe this is what you're looking
dialog: for, Colonel.
text: He opens the red box. Hoists out a canister.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch -
dialog: (runs the Geiger counter over it)
dialog: It's depleted uranium! Completely
dialog: safe! A child could sleep on it.
text: Bond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I received it from the Russian
dialog: government - a by-product of their
dialog: nuclear arms program - in the hopes
dialog: that I could create tools for
dialog: oceanographic research.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's what I was talking about:
dialog: 'Swords into plowshares'! The Sprit
dialog: of International Cooperation!
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: Signore Harmsway. A thousand apologies.
dialog: (snaps his fingers to a lackey:)
dialog: Give him the video tape.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Please. No harm done, Don Franco. Go
dialog: upstairs, and enjoy the reception.
text: As the room empties, he calls -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Oh - Mr. Bond. One minute.
text: Bond approaches him. They're the only people in the room.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I hope you've enjoyed this little charade.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Which part? The Colonel's? Or yours?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (icily)
dialog: A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't
dialog: screw with a man who buys ink by the
dialog: ton.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's deadlier than uranium.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (staring him down)
dialog: We'll see about that.
text: Harmsway glances at his watch. Smiles coldly.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Aren't you late for a meeting?
scene_heading: EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II/HARBOR - DAY
text: Bond rushes down the gangplank, along the dock. Jumps in a gondola.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The Danielli. Presto!
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE METALLURGY LAB -
text: Harmsway closes the door. Yung is there.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: That was too close.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the
dialog: message. So will his boss.
text: Harmsway presses a button - and suddenly the red box lifts, and a
text: second red box appears underneath it, like shuffling a deck of cards.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I'm going to the plane. Tell the
dialog: captain to set sail at once.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DANIELLI HOTEL - DAY
text: Bond jumps out of the gondola, sprints into the lobby.
scene_heading: FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR -

scene_heading: INT. BOND'S HOTEL ROOM -
text: Bond enters the room. Looks around, calling out -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Paris? Paris?
text: He sees the French doors open onto the canal. The curtains billowing
text: outward. Bond rushes to the window and looks down:
scene_heading: EXT. GRAND CANAL - BOND'S POV
text: Paris Harmsway is dead, floating in the water.
speaker_heading: RETURN ON BOND -
dialog: Crushed. Devastated. And to make matters worse:
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO'S VOICE
dialog: Signore Bond?
text: Bond turns. A flashbulb goes off, capturing Bond and DiGiacomo.
speaker_heading: DiGIACOMO
dialog: You're under arrest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: THE CAPTAIN nods. Turns to the GPS OFFICER:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Position?
text: The GPS officer enters keyboard commands on console marked "GLOBAL

text: The first officer nods.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN (cont'd)
dialog: Inform the men, then run a surprise

speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN

speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER

text: And follow hand signals of STAMPER, who motions them THROUGH A DOOR,

scene_heading: INT. HARMSWAY'S INNER SANCTUM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - DAY
dialog: We're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a
text: James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile. Steel, glass, chrome.
text: The SIX men are seated around a giant conference table, looking
text: absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire.
text: Elliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein
text: that hangs in the lobby of CAA,) walks to the head of the table,
text: takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Good morning, Gentlemen. I'm sorry
dialog: to bring you here under these
dialog: circumstances, but
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Considering our meeting was already
dialog: scheduled, this was a happy coincidence.
text: The men nod. Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (cont'd)
dialog: Number One, your report?
text: A gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands.
speaker_heading: NUMBER ONE
dialog: Sir Elliot: The entertainment division
dialog: is releasing three new animated
dialog: children's movies this year.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: By the time we're finished promoting
dialog: them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper,
dialog: and magazine outlets -
dialog: (pause)
dialog: There won't be a parent in the universe
dialog: who won't feel guilty if they don't take
dialog: their children to our stores and theme
dialog: parks to buy the toys, books, video-
dialog: games and clothing featuring our
dialog: 'lovable little creatures.'
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion
dialog: dollars.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Excellent, Number One. Build a better
dialog: rat-trap, and the world truly will beat
dialog: a path to your theme park.
dialog: (turns to)
dialog: Number Two?
text: A young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates.
speaker_heading: NUMBER TWO
dialog: As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our
dialog: software division has introduced a new
dialog: computer operating system, Gates '99.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's deliberately filled with bugs -
dialog: so people will be forced to buy our
dialog: upgrades over the next five years.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The window on revenues is 2.8 billion.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Outstanding, Number Two.
dialog: (beat, remembering:)
dialog: By the way - Number Five - ?
dialog: (a man looks up)
dialog: Who's ahead in the American elections?
speaker_heading: NUMBER FIVE
dialog: The Democrat, sir. By nine points.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Maybe it's time to publish that story
dialog: about his sex life. Even things up.
dialog: A close race is always better for our
dialog: TV ratings.
speaker_heading: NUMBER FIVE
dialog: Consider him slimed, sir.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Splendid. Next...
dialog: (with noticeable reserve)
dialog: Number Three. Your report?
text: A SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands. Nervous.
speaker_heading: NUMBER THREE
dialog: I regret to inform you, sir, that
dialog: Saddam Hussein is still demanding a
dialog: bonus for his role in the Gulf War.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ...Haven't we already paid him for his services?
speaker_heading: NUMBER THREE
dialog: Yes, sir. But he still feels his
dialog: people should share in the increased
dialog: profits of our news division. He has
dialog: proposed an additional 500 million
dialog: dollar payment.
text: A pause. The other men in the room shift uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ... And there's no truth that 10% of
dialog: that money will go into your Swiss
dialog: bank account?
speaker_heading: NUMBER THREE
dialog: No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: You disappoint me, Number Three.
text: Harmsway presses a button. Stamper enters. Number Three assumes
dialog: this means death. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE:
speaker_heading: NUMBER THREE
dialog: Please sir. Please -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ...But because I am a just man, I've
dialog: decided to give Mr. Hussein what he
dialog: deserves.
dialog: Number Three is confused. Does this mean he's going to live?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane.
speaker_heading: NUMBER THREE
dialog: (overwhelmed with gratitude)
dialog: Thank you sir! Thank you!
text: Harmsway nods, watching him leave:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Good-bye, Mr. Azziz.
text: And the man is gone. Harmsway turns his attention back to the room:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Let's proceed with new business.
text: Harmsway presses another button. The room darkens. The CENTER OF
text: THE TABLE OPENS, and a 3-D MAP OF MALAYSIA rises into view.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we
dialog: are going to initiate phase one of
dialog: the word's most perfect crime: The
dialog: biggest theft in the history of mankind.

dialog: Right here. In the Strait of Malacca.
scene_heading: EXT. LIMOUSINE - MANOR HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. LIMOUSINE -
text: He seems relieved, until the doors lock, ominously. They drive off.
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLAND ROADWAY - (INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - MOVING) DAY
text: Number Three fidgets in the back... And notices Stamper smiling at
text: him in the REARVIEW MIRROR. He sees Stamper reach INTO HIS JACKET -
dialog: and PANICS! Is he going to get shot? Is it over? He winces, as -
text: STAMPER'S HAND SUDDENLY THRUSTS BACKWARD THROUGH THE PARTITION.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Gum?
text: Shaking his head, he pulls out a HANDKERCHIEF to mop the flop sweat.
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE MANOR HOUSE - FAVORING THE HNN HELICOPTER -
dialog: Amidst ad-libbed 'good-bye's" from the gang of six (now five,)

scene_heading: EXT. SMALL AIRPORT - SCOTLAND -
text: Stamper's limousine parks near a Gulfstream jet. He opens the back

speaker_heading: NUMBER THREE
dialog: Thank you! Thank you so much. You
dialog: must thank Sir Elliot for me.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: (producing a NEWSPAPER)
dialog: Here. Something to read on the plane.
text: Stamper TUCKS THE PAPER FIRMLY UNDER #3'S ARM - and gives him a
text: friendly pat on the back, sending him up the stairs.
text: At the doorway, Number Three looks back. Stamper smiles, waving:
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Bye-bye.
scene_heading: INT. GULFSTREAM JET - DAY
text: Number Three settles into his seat. The door closes; the engines
text: wind up for take-off. He sighs: He's safe. He casually picks up the
text: newspaper, snaps open the front page:
scene_heading: INSERT FRONT PAGE OF HARMSWAY'S "TOMORROW' NEWSPAPER:
text: Screaming headline: ISRAELI AGENT REVEALED. There's a FULL COLOR
text: PHOTO OF NUMBER THREE underneath.
text: Number Three lowers the paper, white as a ghost, and -
text: TWO ARABIAN GENTLEMEN (in full burnoose) sit down on either side of
text: him. They smile. And on NUMBER THREE'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE H.M.S. INDOMITABLE -
text: Moving through FOG in the STRAIT OF MALACCA, night.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
text: The room is bathed in blue light as the crew monitors the Indomita-
dialog: ble's command and control systems.
text: At the VERTICAL GLASS MAP, the ship's course has been charted from
dialog: Hong Kong, south, down around Singapore, then north, where the YELLOW
text: BLINKING dot indicates it's currently in the Strait of Malacca.
text: Standing in front of the map, however, THE NAVIGATION OFFICER seems
text: perplexed. He's comparing what's on the screen to a piece of paper
text: in his hand. Something is wrong.
speaker_heading: NAVIGATION OFFICER
dialog: ... This doesn't make sense. What's
dialog: our heading now?
text: THE HELMSMAN looks down at his compass/auto-pilot.
text: INSERT COMPASS/AUTO-PILOT - moving from West to North - then holding
dialog: on a North position.
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: Zero one three. Due north.
text: The two officers share a look. Something is odd, but -
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: We're on course again.
text: Just then, the FIRST OFFICER ENTERS from the exterior bridge.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: Can't see a damn thing in this fog.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Rating: What have we got?
text: He joins the RATING and COMMUNICATION'S OFFICERS at their scopes.
speaker_heading: RATING
text: A passenger ferry and two freighters
dialog: broadcasting on low-band -
speaker_heading: COMMUNICATIONS
dialog: And two small fishing boats about 30k
dialog: north. No radar, but we've
dialog: identified their engine signatures.
dialog: As the First Officer takes this in:
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN (O.S.)
dialog: Damn. It's doing it again.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: (joining him)
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: About every ninety seconds, the auto-
dialog: pilot jogs us to the west.
text: He points down to the compass/auto-pilot, SWINGING WEST...
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: Then re-sets us to the north.
text: The compass reaches dead west - then starts to swing back NORTH.
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN (cont'd)
dialog: The Captain wants us on the East side
dialog: of the channel. ...Cross current?
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: Not in the Strait.
dialog: (to the Navigator)
dialog: How's our position?
speaker_heading: NAVIGATING OFFICER
dialog: According to the satellite, we're
dialog: exactly on course.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: Did you check the auto-pilot?
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: The back-up does the same thing.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: Check it again. What about the global
dialog: positioning satellite? Could there be
dialog: something wrong with the signal?
speaker_heading: GPS OFFICER
dialog: Two words: Im-possible.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE -
text: As the earth turns below, a TINY SILVER DOT appears in the distance:

text: HNN. THE HARMSWAY NEWS NETWORK.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BRIDGE - INT. H.M.S. INDOMITABLE - NIGHT
text: THE HELMSMAN finishes fiddling with the auto-pilot.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: How is it now?
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: Seems to be back to normal, sir.
text: The First Officer nods... Then HEARS a SHRILL WARNING BEEP.
speaker_heading: SONAR OPERATOR
dialog: I have something off the port bow!
text: The First Officer rushes to join him at the screen.
speaker_heading: SONAR OPERATOR (cont'd)
text: 100 meters out, just below the surface.
dialog: (adjusts the controls)
dialog: A meter in diameter; ten - twelve
dialog: meters long. ...Floating vertically?
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
text: A dead head.
dialog: (off the others' quizzical looks)
text: Water logged timber. Floats straight
dialog: up. You sometimes see them on the east
dialog: side of the channel - from the logging
dialog: camps on Sumatra - but they don't
dialog: usually float this far west.
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Muncy! Engines to half!
speaker_heading: HELMSMAN
dialog: Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER

dialog: 200 yards? It's anchored in a cove!
speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER
dialog: That's impossible! We're in the

speaker_heading: FIRST OFFICER

speaker_heading: BRIDGE -

speaker_heading: SECOND OFFICER (on intercom)

speaker_heading: THE BRIDGE -

scene_heading: INT. SEA DOLPHIN BRIDGE -

speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (into microphone)

scene_heading: NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - PASSAGEWAY -

dialog: What kind of idiot loses -
dialog: (looks to the treasury officer)
dialog: What is it? The equivalent of ten

speaker_heading: TREASURY OFFICIAL
dialog: (sheepishly)
dialog: Give or take. Depending on today's

speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: What the hell was the gold doing on
dialog: that boat?
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: We were bringing it back from Hong
dialog: Kong. Under orders from the Treasury.
speaker_heading: TREASURY OFFICIAL
dialog: During the cold war, we stored a
dialog: third in America, and another third
dialog: in Hong Kong - in case of a nuclear
dialog: attack. And with the turn-over of
dialog: Hong Kong to the Chinese -
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: Why wasn't the ship protected?!?!
dialog: Why was it sailing without radar?
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: I resent your tone, sir. I have men

speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: And I have the entire British economy
dialog: to worry about.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (breaking in)
dialog: Minister -

text: Roebuck looks at Bond with great surprise. Bond continues:
speaker_heading: BOND (cont'd)
dialog: Electronic silence was the safest way
dialog: to move that gold. Otherwise, any
dialog: country - or individual - with the
dialog: crudest missile could just lock onto
dialog: our signals, and take out the boat.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's what happened to the Sheffield
dialog: in the Falklands.

speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: (frowns)
dialog: At least we know where the gold is.
dialog: When are the recovery ships due?
speaker_heading: ADMIRAL ROEBUCK
dialog: 36 hours. They've already sailed
dialog: from the Persian gulf.
speaker_heading: MINISTER JOHNSTONE
dialog: I expect to have that gold recovered
dialog: in 36 hours. Until then, I'm
dialog: imposing my own electronic silence:
dialog: For the sake of the economy, not a
dialog: word to NATO, the press, the CIA.
dialog: (beat, looking at:)
dialog: ...And so long as Commander Bond here
dialog: seems to be such an expert on these

scene_heading: AT THE STERN HOLD -

speaker_heading: HARMSWAY

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It doesn't quite add up.
text: They've come to a door. Pause as he opens it. He explains:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The infrared satellite images. No
dialog: heat, no flame, no explosion. If
dialog: that boat went down where they said
dialog: it did, there should have been some
text: residual heat reading on the surface.
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Sabotage?
speaker_heading: BOND

text: She nods and pushes through the door. He follows.
scene_heading: EXT. BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS -
speaker_heading: M
dialog: I've already contacted our station in

text: They've arrived at her car. The door is already open.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Didn't Elliot Harmsway just move

text: She turns, freezes Bond with a look:
speaker_heading: M
dialog: Contrary to what you may believe,
dialog: 007, the world is not filled with
dialog: mad-men who can hollow out volcanoes,
dialog: stock them with big-breasted women,
dialog: and threaten the world with nuclear
dialog: annihilation.
text: Bond reacts to the comeuppance. She continues:
speaker_heading: M (cont'd)
text: The case is closed. The Italian
dialog: authorities ruled the girl a suicide.
dialog: We had enough trouble keeping your

speaker_heading: YOUNG CHINESE LAWYER
dialog: Are you sure? If we waited -

speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: General Li: My young associate here
dialog: has just informed me that if I waited

dialog: (beat, wryly)
dialog: He has great faith in Hong Kong. As did

text: Nervous chuckles around the table, but the General is reserved.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (cont'd)
dialog: Yet to sell this building for more
dialog: money - to profiteer - would run counter
dialog: to the Chinese sprit of guanchi - mutual
dialog: trust and obligation; it would violate
dialog: the ancient principles of feng shui -
dialog: (beat)
dialog: - the reason we sign five documents

speaker_heading: HARMSWAY

speaker_heading: sign in RED INK -
speaker_heading: GENERAL LI

speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHEONG
dialog: In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat

dialog: to worry, Mr. Bond.
speaker_heading: BOND

dialog: and Burma want the ships.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHEONG
dialog: Sometimes kill the crew; other times -
dialog: (points to his eye)
dialog: Torture them.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN CHEONG
dialog: The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles
dialog: off-course that night. Captain blamed

speaker_heading: BOND

speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: This afternoon. Our boats practically
dialog: kissed in the harbor.
dialog: (holds out his hand to shake)
dialog: James Bond.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Sidney Winch.
text: The BARTENDER APPEARS.
speaker_heading: BOND
text: Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.
dialog: (to Sidney)
dialog: And another for you?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No. But you can buy a drink for my
dialog: friend, Taro.
text: She steps back REVEALING a huge SAMOAN, TARO, wearing a dark suit and
text: tie, sitting on a stool. Taro smiles menacingly at Bond.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Boyfriend?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Pity.
dialog: (to Bartender)
dialog: Bring him whatever he wants.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur,
dialog: Mr. Bond?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage?
dialog: Running from some poor little girl
dialog: with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in -
dialog: London?
dialog: Bond analyzes the situation: 1) She's with a thug. 2) She's in marine
dialog: salvage. 3) She went to the Harbor Master's office for the charts.
dialog: 4) She's a smart-ass. He decides to see if he can rattle her:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Actually, I'm here on business. You
dialog: might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (a chill in her voice)
dialog: And exactly what business are you in,
dialog: Mr. Bond?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Insurance. Lloyds of London.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (daggers in her voice)
dialog: The Strait can be a very dangerous
dialog: place, Mr. Bond. A few words
text: scribbled on a piece of paper in
dialog: London doesn't carry a lot of value
dialog: out here. Including life insurance.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'll keep that in mind.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (looking off)
dialog: I see my date is here.
dialog: (to Taro)
dialog: And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Nice to run into you again.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Let's not make it a habit.
text: She exits. Turning his back on Taro, Bond watches her cross the
text: room. Taro places a huge hand on Bond's shoulder -
speaker_heading: TARO
dialog: I think you should go -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Not quite yet, Taro -
text: And from BOND'S POV - Sidney greets HARMSWAY with a big hug.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Uncle Elliot!!
text: Watching this, Bond seethes with memory of Paris and his hatred of
text: Harmsway. Taro tightens his grip -
speaker_heading: TARO
dialog: I said you should -
text: But before he finishes, Bond spins, and: 1) slams Taro's head on the
text: bar, 2) snatches the ice-pick from the bartender, 3) yanks Taro back-
text: ward by his collar, 4) slams the ice-pick through Taro's tie into the
text: wooden bar, and 5) kicks the stool out from under the goon.
text: Taro is now hanging by his tie, from the bar, choking.
text: Bond takes a moment to straighten his own bow-tie. Wade appears,
text: jubilant, with a wad of cash:
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -
dialog: (seeing Taro)
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: He tied one on.
scene_heading: EXT. A DESERTED MARINA - MORNING -
text: Bond walks down a long dock towards a lone boat, moored at the end.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. BOAT AT MARINA - MORNING -
text: Bond looks around furtively, before climbing aboard the sleek ocean-
text: going craft. On the aft-deck, there's a large covered object.
text: As Bond reaches for the CABIN DOOR, it opens by itself - and a
text: succession of THREE YOUNG ENGLISH WOMEN in STRING BIKINIS emerge.
speaker_heading: GIRL ONE
dialog: Good morning!
speaker_heading: GIRL TWO
dialog: Good morning.
speaker_heading: GIRL THREE
dialog: (calling back into the cabin)
dialog: He's arrived.
text: Bond turns from the door to watch the women. He hears:
speaker_heading: Q'S VOICE
dialog: You're late 007. I've been expecting
dialog: you.
text: Q emerges from the cabin in a blazer and an ascot. He's irritated:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Q! How are you?
dialog: Q
dialog: Retired. I'm not getting paid to
dialog: help you save the world anymore.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
dialog: Q
dialog: That hardly makes up for the imposition.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now, for what I hope will be the very
dialog: last time - pay attention, 007.
dialog: (he unfurls a map:)
dialog: First, computer generated retrograde
dialog: analysis map. Body here, meteorolog-
dialog: ical influences here, likely vector-
dialog: ing of the ship's coordinates here.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Do you have any idea of what any of
dialog: that means? In English?
dialog: Q
dialog: Not a clue. I didn't lose the ship.
dialog: (reaches for a Filofax sized device)
dialog: Next, your new personal communicator.
dialog: (flips it open)
text: Picture-phone, fax, beeper.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (taking it)
dialog: Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
dialog: Q
dialog: I don't care who you dial, so long as
dialog: it's not me. Next -
text: Q walks to the large object on the aft-deck. Pulls off a tarp:
dialog: Q
dialog: Your new car. (Insert name)
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: - Four wheel drive?
dialog: Q
dialog: Yes. And do try to keep all four of
dialog: them on the road.
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: All the usual refinements: Smoke,
dialog: missiles, machine guns -
dialog: (shows him a key fob)
text: Fully operational remote control.
dialog: Drives forward, reverse -
dialog: (Bond presses a button,
dialog: opening a window)
dialog: Stop that!
dialog: (grabbing it away)
dialog: Plus infrared thermal imaging radar,
dialog: heads up instrumentation, and 17
dialog: beverage cup holders.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... 17 Beverage cup holders?
dialog: Q
dialog: Standard equipment. The world's
dialog: automobile manufacturers seem to be
dialog: in some kind of mad war to see who
dialog: can provide the most beverage cup
dialog: holders.
text: Bond nods, and LOOKS AT a distraction from the GIRLS IN BIKINIS.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I must say, Q, you seem to be doing
dialog: rather well in your retirement.
dialog: Q
dialog: Don't even think about it. 007.
dialog: They're my granddaughters.
scene_heading: STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -
text: Clear skies and blue water. The only vessel in sight is a thirty-
text: five foot SPORT FISHING BOAT underway at full throttle.
scene_heading: EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT, FLYING BRIDGE - DAY -
text: Wade at the helm; Bond next to him, near sonar, holding Q's map.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Slow down. We're close.
text: Wade pulls back on the throttle.
scene_heading: AERIAL - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/STRAIT OF MALACCA) - DAY -
text: The boat starts a wide turn -
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - (SPORT FISHING BOAT/ROCK OUTCROPPING/STRAIT) - DAY -
dialog: And we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The
text: SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches
dialog: and the lush green hills of Sumatra.
speaker_heading: FLYING BRIDGE -
text: Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out
dialog: here. How could they get this far
dialog: off course?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (concentrating on the sonar)
dialog: Who knows? Fog, night...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: They'd never sail this close to the shore.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Wait a minute -
dialog: (beat, pointing to the
dialog: screen)
dialog: I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
scene_heading: INSERT SONAR SCREEN -
text: The murky electronic outline of a ship.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE -
text: Bond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Cut the engines! It's about two-
text: hundred fifty feet down.
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) -
text: By Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You
dialog: should really be using mixed gases.
text: Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'll make a bounce dive. If I can
dialog: keep my bottom time short, I'll be
dialog: all right.
text: Bond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (only half teasing)
dialog: Keep your eye out for pirates.
text: Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I got you covered.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: That's reassuring.
text: Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER -
text: Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward,
text: handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER BOTTOM -
text: Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom.
text: Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel.
scene_heading: EXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER -
text: Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand.
text: Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color.
text: From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being
text: lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge.
speaker_heading: INSERT GAUGES -
dialog: Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE -
text: Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to
text: study the damage. Then enters.
scene_heading: INT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER -
text: Bond sees the damage on the passageway door. Swims through it.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY - UNDER WATER -
text: The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the
text: busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made
text: by the worm. He drops into the hold.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER -
text: The gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty
text: space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another.
text: As he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch.
text: He moves toward it.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - CLOSER -
text: A half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead.
text: Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold.
text: Just as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the
text: brace, baring its teeth.
text: Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into:
scene_heading: PASSAGE WAY -(INT. INDOMITABLE) - UNDER WATER -
text: where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling.
text: Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see:
text: THE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE -
text: Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll-
text: ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD
text: BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HATCH/DECK -
text: Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover.
text: He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs
text: it into his sack, and swims off.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: UNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR -
text: Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the
text: way, he glances at his gauges:
speaker_heading: INSERT GAUGES -
dialog: Depth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below RED LINE - empty. The ambient
text: light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS.
text: BOND LOOKS UP TO THE SURFACE -
speaker_heading: HIS POV -
text: A black HULL has blotted out the light... And SOMETHING LARGE AND
text: HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007.
speaker_heading: BOND -
text: kicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks
text: by. He looks up again:
text: THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER.
text: One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a
text: CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007.
speaker_heading: BOND -
text: Realizes his best chance is to take one of the men hostage.
text: Flashing his KNIFE, Bond cuts the cord to his gold/uranium sack,
text: STUFFS THE SACK INTO HIS BAGGY SWIM TRUNKS.
text: Bond rockets up, SLAMMING INTO DIVER #1. A confusion of bubbles.
text: And just as Bond overcomes the man - spinning him around, holding the
dialog: knife to the diver's throat -
text: DIVER #2 SHOOTS the HARPOON-TYPE GUN, and A DOLPHIN NET explodes out,
text: ENVELOPING BOND AND THE DIVER in a mesh. (Note: This is a real,
dialog: 'fish friendly' research tool.)
text: Diver #3 HOOKS THE CABLE he's been trailing onto the net, and -
scene_heading: EXT. SEA -
text: The net erupts through the surface, is hauled up into the air, and
dialog: deposited on -
text: THE DECK OF A SELF-PROPELLED SALVAGE BARGE.
text: (An old scow, with a large crane, two-story deck-house, and a crew
text: whose idea of 'cruise-wear' runs to tattoos and grotesque scars.
scene_heading: BOND'S POV - THROUGH HIS DIVING MASK -
text: As the water drains from his mask, Bond sees the mesh being pulled
text: away, and FIVE GOONS come into focus, training AUTOMATIC WEAPONS on
text: him. (Bond still has the diver from behind, knife to his throat.)
text: One of the goons reaches forward, ripping off Bond's mask. 007 sees:
scene_heading: TARO - (EXT. SALVAGE BARGE, DECK) -
text: Brandishing an UZI at Bond, with a malevolent smile:
speaker_heading: TARO
dialog: Uzi beats knife.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...Interesting point.
text: Bond sticks the knife into the deck, and releases the hostage.
speaker_heading: TARO
dialog: Get him up. Take his belt.
dialog: (motioning to Wade)
dialog: Take the two of them to the Captain.
text: The men grab Bond roughly, and shove him next to Wade.
speaker_heading: TARO
dialog: By the way. I almost forgot.
dialog: (smashing Bond)
dialog: I owed you one.
text: Bond and Wade are frog-marched to the bridge, passing under the gaze
text: of various cutthroat crew members. Wade is completely unfazed.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (sniffs the air)
dialog: Smell that Jimmy? Sea Kelp.
text: Bond gives Wade a look.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hey - it could be worse. At least
dialog: they speak English.
text: Bond glances up at a crew member, SHARPENING A MACHETE, smiling.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...Somehow, that's not reassuring.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE - SALVAGE BARGE - DAY
dialog: We're back in Bond-land: A high-tech control room, with lots of
text: monitors and white-suited TECHNICIANS. Bond and Wade are pushed
text: through the-door, followed by Taro and the two goons.
speaker_heading: TARO
dialog: Here they are, Captain.
text: The "Captain" turns from a monitor: IT'S SIDNEY.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Just give me one goad reason - Mister
dialog: Bond, from Lloyds of London - why I
dialog: shouldn't kill both of you, burn your
dialog: boat, and use your bodies for shark bait.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (chirping up)
dialog: So you two know each other!?! Small
dialog: world, ain't it? What happened?
dialog: Commitment problems?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Who is he?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sidney Winch, meet -
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Jack Wade. Citibank. Commercial
dialog: loan division. If you're ever lookin'
dialog: for a sweet refinance on the boat -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: - Shut up!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (to Wade)
dialog: You have to excuse Miss Winch: She
dialog: thinks she's on a 'seduce and
dialog: destroy' mission through life...
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: ...But she won't kill us.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: No. First, because I don't think
dialog: it's in your nature. And second,
dialog: because there's no gold down there.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: So charming! So suave!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Don't insult me. I'm not one of your
dialog: 'little London girls' who falls for
dialog: the lies.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: So it was commitment!
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong
dialog: knows what's on that boat and I'm
dialog: claiming it. One-third of that gold is
dialog: mine.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: That's fine, but - even a little
dialog: London girl knows that one third of
dialog: nothing is still nothing.
text: There's a flicker of doubt in her eyes. She turns to Taro:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Was he carrying anything?
text: Taro holds up the BOND'S DIVING BELT, indicating 'nothing'. Angrily:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Search him.
text: The men look at Bond - wearing only swim trunks. Nobody moves.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Do I have to do everything around here?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I hope so.
text: Frowning, Sidney moves to Bond. As she REACHES INTO HIS TRUNKS, we
text: cut to THEIR FACES. THEIR EYES ARE LOCKED ON EACH OTHER:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I hope you'll be gentle.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Think about mom.
text: BOND WINCES. She's goosed him.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Unusual technique.
text: Returning to the WIDE SHOT, she opens the sack. SHOWS THE GOLD:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: And what do you call this?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: - The family jewels?
text: She scowls, takes out the URANIUM TOOTH. Looks at it, blankly, and
text: holds it out to a TECHNICIAN, who examines it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What is this?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: ...I don't know. I'm not sure -
text: Just then, a CREWMAN BURSTS IN:
speaker_heading: CREWMAN
dialog: Boss! We got company - comin' up off
dialog: the starboard bow!
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (exiting, to Taro)
dialog: Bring them.
text: Taro motions with his Uzi for Bond and Wade to follow...
text: But BOND hesitates, LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the URANIUM.
text: 007 wants to get it, but Taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle.
scene_heading: EXT. MALACCA STRAIT - DAY
text: A BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN
text: WAILING, crew members in battle gear, FORWARD GATLING GUN manned.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: (on bullhorn)
dialog: Attention sea barge: Lay down your
dialog: weapons, and prepare to be boarded.
text: ON THE BARGE - Sidney and Co. stand, weapons ready.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and
dialog: prepare to be boarded.
text: Bond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: If I were you -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: - You're not.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (as she hoists the bullhorn)
dialog: Just remember: They think there's ten
dialog: billion dollars in gold down there.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (clicks it on, and:)
dialog: "Now hear this: Drop dead."
text: Bond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both
dialog: know what's coming next. There's a pause, then -
text: THE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO.
dialog: It's only a warning shot, but -
text: EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and
text: Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro,
text: cowering on the boards.
speaker_heading: BOND
text: Gatling gun beats Uzi.
speaker_heading: NEW ANGLE - (CUTTER/BARGE) - DAY
text: An ARMED BOARDING PARTY is coming across an aluminum bridge that has
text: extended from the Cutter onto the barge.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: (a tiny popinjay)
dialog: Who's in charge here?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I am. What do you want?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: You have precisely one minute to pull
dialog: up your anchor and be under way.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Forget it. No way. I got here first.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: Who's Wade?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: That would be me -
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: (snidely)
dialog: Thanks for your message.
dialog: (turns to)
dialog: And you're Bond?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Yes -
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: Guard! Arrest these men! Escort
dialog: them to the cutter!
text: Bond and Wade are stunned. The Marines move in. Bond struggles -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Wait a minute -
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: Get them out of here. If he says one
dialog: word, shoot him.
text: As TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the
dialog: folding bridge -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (demanding)
dialog: What's your name?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: Captain Morton.
text: Pause. She expects him to ask "And yours?" but he doesn't.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: My name is Sidney Winch, and -
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: Good for you, Miss Winch. You now
dialog: have exactly 30 seconds to get this
dialog: rust bucket out of here.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (furiously)
dialog: I know my rights. These are
dialog: international waters. The British
dialog: Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm
dialog: claiming it. Under international
dialog: law, I have the right to salvage
dialog: what's on that wreck.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should
dialog: consider hiring an attorney.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I was an attorney!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above
dialog: that profession.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: You leave me no alternative.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: (upholstering a walkie-talkie)
dialog: Cut her anchor.
text: As Sidney yells "NO!" - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life. One
text: short, bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You won't get away with this!
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: (stepping onto the bridge)
dialog: Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you
dialog: to get some steam up - before you run
dialog: aground.
text: As she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You bastards! Believe me - you
dialog: haven't heard the last of me!
scene_heading: EXT. DECK - THE CUTTER - DAY -
dialog: Bond, Wade and the Captain.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: - Nice trick with the arrest. Very convincing.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: It's no trick, Mr. Wade. I've got
dialog: half a mind to throw both of you in
dialog: the brig.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Don't you think you're overreacting?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: (with great sarcasm)
dialog: Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard
dialog: all about you, sir. You were under
dialog: direct orders to act as an observer -
dialog: and yet you had to go off, on your own,
dialog: like some half-assed CIA cowboy -
dialog: (Wade reacts)
dialog: Endangering the gold, attracting that
text: lunatic woman, and then putting in a
dialog: distress call for us to save your
dialog: bloody hide.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (Calmly)
dialog: ...That's all well and good, Captain,
dialog: save for one thing:
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's no gold down there.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: What are you talking about? We went
dialog: through all this and the ship isn't
dialog: even down there?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Yes, the ship is down there. But the
text: gold is gone.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN MORTON
dialog: That's absurd! It took two squads of
dialog: forty men fifteen days to load that
dialog: gold.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I know what I saw -
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: I don't care what you think you saw.
dialog: You're a damned amateur.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Just get off my ship. Go back to
dialog: your trench-coats and your code names
dialog: - and leave the job to professionals.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (exchanges a glance with Wade, then)
dialog: Aye-aye, Captain.
scene_heading: EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY -

speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Where to now, Jimbo?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (thinking)

speaker_heading: HARMSWAY'S VOICE
dialog: Hello, Mister Bond.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (with an edge)
dialog: Who is this?
scene_heading: INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -
text: Harmsway is perched on a desk. In the background, THROUGH HIS OPEN

text: someone coffee from a SILVER TRAY - but we can't see who it is.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Elliot Harmsway! I heard you were in

scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND - (INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING) -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (Cont'd, O.S.)
dialog: We seemed to get off on the wrong
dialog: foot back there in Venice.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: How did you get this number?
scene_heading: INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the
dialog: information age! Information is
dialog: currency - and with the right currency,
dialog: you can have any piece of information.
dialog: (Bond reacts, sourly)
dialog: Besides I own the phone company. What
dialog: do you say? Twenty minutes?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'm on my way.
text: Bond hangs up, and drives with renewed determination.
scene_heading: INT. HARMSWAY'S OUTER OFFICE -
text: Harmsway hangs up; STAMPER is standing nearby. Harmsway throws a
text: concerned glance at his office, then turns to Stamper:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Let's find out exactly what he knows.
scene_heading: EXT. KUALA LUMPUR - ROADWAY -(BOND CAR) - LATE AFTERNOON -
text: Bond's car approaches the camera, passes it, and heads for HARMSWAY
text: TOWERS, looming over Kuala Lumpur in the distance.
scene_heading: EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - STREET LEVEL - LATE AFTERNOON -
text: Bond's car passes the front of the building, and drives down a ramp
text: into an underground car park.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK - (HARMSWAY TOWERS) -
text: Passing NEWSPAPER LOADING DOCKS (with trucks displaying both the
text: "TOMORROW" and "HNN" logos, and HUM-VEES used by building security,)
text: Bond pulls into the VALET AREA -
text: Where a cheerful YOUNG PR WOMAN and VALET wait. Both wear the
text: colorful BLAZER used by all Harmsway Building service personnel.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (from inside the car)
dialog: James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway.
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: Yes. I'm to bring you right up. The
dialog: valet will take your car -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'd prefer to park it myself.
dialog: (off her questioning look)
dialog: Temperamental. Practically has a
dialog: mind of its own.
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: Don't they all?
text: She points to a spot near the loading docks. Bond drives off.
scene_heading: INT. BOND'S CAR -
text: Bond backs into the space, thinking about the (inevitable) quick get-
text: away. He looks through the windshield, surveying the area.
scene_heading: BOND'S POV - UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -
text: TWO BURLY SECURITY GUARDS (in Harmsway Blazers,) stand behind a
text: bulletproof security desk. There's a METAL DETECTOR by the door.
scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE (INT. BOND'S CAR) -
text: Reaching inside his jacket, Bond REMOVES HIS GUN, and HIDES IT in a
text: compartment under the dashboard.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK -
text: The PR WOMAN joins Bond as he locks the car with the REMOTE CONTROL.
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: Right this way.
text: Following her through the metal detector, Bond scans the security
text: devices at the guard's desk: Lots of cameras, sensors, and alarms.
scene_heading: EXT. PRESSROOM OBSERVATION ARCADE -
text: Bond and the PR Woman step off an escalator onto an open arcade with
text: GLASS WINDOWS looking down into a mammoth NEWSPAPER PRINTING PLANT.
speaker_heading: PR WOMAN
dialog: (moving to a door)
dialog: Mr. Harmsway is checking the afternoon
dialog: editions. If you'll just follow me -
scene_heading: INT. PRESSROOM BALCONY -
text: The NOISE FROM THE PRINTING PRESSES is deafening. Bond and the PR
text: WOMAN walk down a METAL STAIRCASE to the pressroom floor, where -
text: Harmsway (wearing a printer's smock and newsprint cap,) is joking
text: with SEVERAL PRESSMEN - a fresh issue of "Tomorrow" outstretched in
dialog: his hands.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (spotting Bond, yelling:)
dialog: Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sir Elliot.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Come. Let's get out of the noise.
dialog: (escorting Bond off)
dialog: - I'll give you a tour of the
dialog: building, then we'll talk.
scene_heading: INT. DRESSING ALCOVE - OFF THE PRESSROOM -
text: Harmsway is hanging up his smock in the short hallway that leads from
text: the press room to an elevator. There's a SINK in the room.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: It's funny, Mr. Bond. Of all the
dialog: things I own, nothing gives me as
dialog: much enjoyment as my newspapers.
text: He moves to the sink to wash his hands. Turns on the faucets:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (cont'd)
dialog: Ironic, isn't it? In the age of TV, I
dialog: still can't get the ink out of my veins.
text: Bond SMILES WRYLY, looking at Harmsway hunched over the sink:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Yes... A man with ink in his veins,
text: and blood on his hands.
text: Harmsway smiles to himself, acknowledging the jibe... But decides to
text: ignore it. He turns off the faucet, dries his hands -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: We print 31 newspapers here; another
dialog: two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite
dialog: plants around the world.
text: He pulls on his £2000 Saville Row suit-jacket.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... And how many of those newspapers
dialog: carried Paris Harmsway's obituary?
text: Harmsway turns, and presses the ELEVATOR BUTTON. The doors open,
speaker_heading: instantly. HE SMILES:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: All of them, Mister Bond...
dialog: (motioning inside)
dialog: After you?
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -
text: The doors close. Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling.
dialog: Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Before I became involved with Paris,
dialog: she was always involved with the most
dialog: inappropriate' men...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle
dialog: aged Peter Pans who only brought out
dialog: the worst in her.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I tried to save her. But she remained a
dialog: manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate
dialog: behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I wonder if it runs in the family.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (bursts out in a laugh)
dialog: The only difference between a
dialog: psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is
dialog: the degree of success.
text: He looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Still, I do miss her. I only wish
dialog: she could have lived to see all this.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I can feel your pain.
dialog: The doors open:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: By the way - what is it that brings
dialog: you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond?
speaker_heading: BOND
text: Sightseeing.
text: Harmsway motions for Bond to exit. They step out into:
scene_heading: INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY ("ROGUES GALLERY") - LATE AFTERNOON
text: A short hallway lined with OIL PORTRAITS of Harmsway's ancestors.
text: Double doors at both ends. (People passing through.) As they walk -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I call this the Rogue's gallery.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Yes. I can see: You've hung the
dialog: rest of your relatives.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (pointing to the first portrait)
dialog: My third great Uncle - the Earl of
dialog: Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of
dialog: Hong Kong from the Chinese.
dialog: (moving to)
dialog: His son-in-law - George Harmsway -
dialog: made the first family fortune,
dialog: running opium into Shanghai...
dialog: (moving to)
dialog: His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking
dialog: the opium...
dialog: And my grandfather Henry, who opened the
dialog: first telegraph station, and published
dialog: the colony's first English newspaper.
dialog: (pausing, wistfully)
dialog: It was a city of unlimited possibility.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: So why did you leave?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Because it's a dying city. Since the
dialog: Chinese take-over, who knows what can
dialog: happen tomorrow?
dialog: (moving to the last two portraits)
dialog: In any case, this is my father, Charles: A
dialog: royal bastard who started the first radio
dialog: and television stations. Said I'd never
dialog: amount to anything, but...
dialog: (passing his own portrait)
dialog: I turned it into this
text: He pushes through a door, into:
scene_heading: INT. HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON -
text: A cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity. At the center
text: is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK, (where a news broadcast is in progress,)
text: surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la CNN.
text: Around the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking out
text: on Kuala Lumpur. All are broadcasting: A Larry King-type chat show;
text: MTV; SPORTS; a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something flambeed.
text: With its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect
dialog: is overwhelming. Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.
dialog: (starting to walk)
dialog: Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his
dialog: legions; I have my divisions:
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: News, sports, business, entertainment.
dialog: And these are my foot soldiers:
dialog: (a wave of his hand)
dialog: 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed
dialog: 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87
dialog: magazines, and 29 different cable TV
dialog: channels - in 35 languages.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: And still not a thing to watch.
text: He glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM, with a NASA-type WORLD MAP.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...Although it must be fun to have
dialog: all those satellites.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: They're merely tools to disseminate
dialog: information.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (wryly)
dialog: Or disinformation... If you wanted to,
dialog: say, beam down a signal to send a ship
dialog: off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (guffaws)
dialog: Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I
dialog: should buy it for a book! It's
dialog: totally preposterous, but -
dialog: (off Bond's reaction)
dialog: You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I
dialog: can amuse you.
text: He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL. Begins to type.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Let's see... First we have this
dialog: James Bond... I believe he's a field
dialog: adjuster for Lloyd's of London...
scene_heading: INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S MI-6 COVER -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Then we have this James Bond.
scene_heading: INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S KGB FILE -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (reading from the screen)
dialog: ... Licensed to Kill...
dialog: (aside)
dialog: Not a bad title for that book...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Or perhaps you'd prefer this James Bond -
scene_heading: INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S CHINESE FILE -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Who I believe they call "007."
text: Bond is not amused. Harmsway is enjoying himself:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both
dialog: men of action. But your era is passing.
dialog: Words are the new weapons; satellites the
dialog: new artillery. And make no mistake about
dialog: it: In the right hands, they can be as
dialog: deadly as your Walther PPK.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...Words to live by?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Your choice.
dialog: (glancing at his watch)
dialog: Look at the time! Come. There's
dialog: someone I want you meet - about a
dialog: story I'm thinking of publishing.
text: As they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's "I don't care what
dialog: you think you know - I can crush you" attitude... And now, Harmsway
dialog: plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off
dialog: the one other loose thread in his perfect crime:
scene_heading: INT. HARMSWAY'S OFFICE -
text: The DOOR opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond. He calls to
dialog: someone we don't see:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Hello, dear. I'm sorry I took so long -
text: REVEAL: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: That's okay, Uncle Ell -
text: She freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond. Bond is equally surprised.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What is HE doing here?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I see you two have met.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Briefly.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (crossing to his desk)
dialog: Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him
dialog: here hoping he might shed some light
dialog: on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of
dialog: London.'
dialog: (sly glance to Bond)
dialog: ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: He's not going to tell the truth! He
dialog: was diving for the gold!
text: Harmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch
dialog: has told me the most incredible story: A
text: sunken British warship filled with gold;
dialog: a British cutter firing on her; billions
dialog: of dollars in bullion lying on the
dialog: bottom of the Strait.
dialog: Bond isn't enjoying this charade.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Obviously, the British government
dialog: denies all of this -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: - I told you! He was there! -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: - But as I've explained to Sidney,
dialog: without proof, there's just no story.
dialog: Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
dialog: Before Bond can answer -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: But I have proof! You ran out of here
dialog: so fast, I didn't get to show you.
text: Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway
dialog: wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him
dialog: the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill
text: both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (forcing a smile)
dialog: ...And what's that, my dear?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
text: Sidney cuts Bond off, DROPPING THE GOLD BAR on Harmsway's desk.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: He brought that up from the wreck.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ...I see.
text: Alarmed, Bond wants to stop Sidney from reaching into her bag again -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sidney, I wouldn't -
text: Too late. She drops the uranium tooth on his desk.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: And what about this? Any idea what this is?
text: Silence. Harmsway and Bond exchange a sober look. Then:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ... I believe it's a depleted uranium
dialog: drill bit, my dear.
text: HE PRESSES AN ALARM UNDER HIS DESK. Bond reaches for the DRILL TOOTH.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Why don't we just take these -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (blocking him)
dialog: No. I want Sir Elliot to keep them.
text: Harmsway stands, comes around the desk:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ...Well! I do believe this requires
dialog: further investigation!
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: No matter what the British government
dialog: says, I won't kill this story.
dialog: (his secretary appears in the doorway)
dialog: Miss Oxford will show both of you to
dialog: the elevator... And one of my people
dialog: will definitely be in touch sooner
dialog: than later.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I'm sure they will.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Good-bye, Mister Bond.
text: He reaches to kiss Sidney - and looks in her eyes a second too long.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Good-bye, darling.
text: Watching them exit, his smile turns hard and bitter.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR HALLWAY - DAY -
text: As the Executive Secretary escorts them to the elevator, Bond glances
text: out the PICTURE WINDOW, with its view of the other tower.
speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE SECRETARY
dialog: Thank you both for coming in...
scene_heading: BOND'S POV - EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS -
text: Five floors directly down is the GLASS-ENCLOSED SKY BRIDGE; just
text: above him, he sees TWO WINDOW WASHERS being pulled up on a TWO MAN
speaker_heading: SCAFFOLD.
dialog: BACK TO SCENE -
text: A CHIME SOUNDS; the elevator doors open. Bond and Sidney ad-lib
text: good-byes to the secretary and get in.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
text: Sidney presses the button for "1". Bond glances at the FLOOR INDI-
text: CATOR with reads "55" - clocks the SECURITY CAMERA - and starts
text: looking for an ESCAPE PANEL. Sidney watches out of the corner of her
dialog: eye, thinking he's nuts.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (glancing at the security camera)
dialog: ... Do you have a gun?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (yanking it down)
dialog: You heard me. A gun?
dialog: (disabling it)
dialog: I left mine in the car.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: That's funny: you struck me as the kind
dialog: of man who always carries protection.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Listen to me! I'm a British secret
dialog: service agent. And we have about two
dialog: minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
text: He glances up at the escape panel at the rear of the car.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Has anyone ever suggested that you're
dialog: a paranoid psychotic?
text: Bond ignores the insult, explaining as he moves under the panel:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Harmsway sank that ship and stole the
text: gold. It's on the Sea Dolphin II.
dialog: (boosting himself up)
dialog: And thanks to your little show and tell -
dialog: (straining to open the panel)
dialog: - giving him the evidence -
dialog: (popping it open)
dialog: We're the only ones who can tie him
dialog: to the crime.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Blood or Dutch?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: He was my father's best friend!
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: He's killed closer.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You are seriously deranged.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Maybe. But why are we going up
dialog: instead of down?
text: He nods to the FLOOR INDICATOR. She looks: 60, 65, 70. IT STOPS.
dialog: Bond reaches down to her -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sidney, come with me -
text: THE DOORS OPEN. She looks at his outstretched hand with disdain:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Not if my life depended on it.
scene_heading: INT. 70TH FLOOR -- DAY
text: Sidney comes out onto a floor still under construction. The elevator
text: doors CLOSE behind her. To the right, she sees STAMPER and a
text: Harmsway-blazered GUARD, with MACHINE PISTOLS.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Thank God! He's crazy!
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Does he have a gun?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No.
dialog: On Stamper's reply -
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Good -
text: He lunges for her, grabs her, spins her around, overwhelming her.
dialog: She struggles, yelling:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: This is a mistake!
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: (gun against her skull)
dialog: Shut up!
text: Using Sidney as a HUMAN SHIELD, Stamper marches her in front of the
text: closed elevator doors. The guard follows. THEY POSITION THEMSELVES
text: FOR A MASSACRE. Reaching around Sidney, Stamper pulls out his RADIO:
speaker_heading: STAMPER (into radio)
dialog: Open 14.
text: A beat. It opens. The men unleash a HAIL OF BULLETS, then realize -
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - (INT. ELEVATOR) -
text: The car is empty. Stamper perplexed. Pushing Sidney in front of
text: him, he enters the elevator, cautiously... When, suddenly:
text: BOND SWINGS DOWN OUT OF THE ESCAPE PANEL (like an athlete on a high-
text: bar) FEET FIRST - barely clearing Sidney's head as he KICKS Stamper
text: and the Guard in their faces. They go flying backwards.
text: Bond jumps down, grabs Sidney -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Need a lift?
text: And boosts her into the escape panel, following her up.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE THE ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) -
text: Bond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as -
scene_heading: STAMPER AND THE GUARD -
text: Recover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and START RAKING THE
text: CEILING WITH GUNFIRE.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR SHAFT -
text: Bond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to
text: SHIELD HER as BULLETS RIP UP THE FLOOR behind them. With his free
text: hand, Bond reaches up for the LATCH to open the door above them.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -
text: Stamper stops shooting. Moves to the rear of the cab, under the
text: escape panel. Peers up. Sees nothing. Turns to the Guard:
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Help me up.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR SHAFT -
text: Stamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have
dialog: disappeared into -
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - (ELEVATOR BANK) - 71ST FLOOR.
text: Squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately
text: close behind them,) Bond and Sidney encounter a group of STUNNED
text: OFFICE WORKERS, waiting for the elevator.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (to the office workers)
dialog: ... I'd try the stairs.
text: As Bond and Sidney scamper off -
scene_heading: RETURN ON STAMPER - IN THE ELEVATOR -
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: (rushing out)
dialog: The stairs!
dialog: (barking into his RADIO)
dialog: Attention all units! They're on the
dialog: 71st floor!
scene_heading: INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY - ANOTHER PART OF THE BUILDING -
text: Harmsway is striding towards the SECURITY CENTER, RADIO in hand:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Stamper! They're not to leave this
dialog: building alive!
scene_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY - (INT. HALLWAY) -
text: Moving cautiously toward a CORNER of ANOTHER HALLWAY.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: This has got to be a mistake.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: The only mistake is that they didn't
dialog: kill us in the elevator.
text: At the corner, Bond STOPS, SEEING A GUARD, farther down the hall (his
text: back to them) CHECKING DOORS.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Wait here.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No. I'm going with you.
text: Bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. They start doing a
text: "DUCK AND COVER" in and out of doorways TO SNEAK UP ON HIM.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY CENTER -
text: Harmsway bursts in on GUARDS watching a WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: I don't see them -
dialog: (scanning the monitors)
dialog: There!
scene_heading: INSERT VIDEO MONITOR - (SURVEILLANCE SHOT OF HALLWAY) -
text: Bond and Sidney have just come into frame, sneaking up on the GUARD.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (OVER)
dialog: Warn him!
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE GUARD - (INT. HALLWAY) -
speaker_heading: VOICE ON RADIO
dialog: Porter! They're behind you -
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: (lifting the radio to reply)
dialog: Roger! Over and -
scene_heading: BAM. BOND DECKS HIM.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Out.
text: Bond kneels, grabs the GUARD'S MACHINE PISTOL, and CLIPS, just as -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
speaker_heading: JAMES!
text: TWO GUARDS have entered from a STAIRCASE DOOR, hoisting MAC-10's. In
dialog: an instant: (1) Bond lets go a BURST. (2) The Guards SHOOT back,
text: diving for cover in the staircase door. (3) Bond rolls, (4) Pushes
text: Sidney into an open DOORWAY, and (5) returns A BURST, from -
scene_heading: INT. SMALL KITCHEN/COPIER ROOM -
text: Sidney is shaken. As Bond stands in the doorway, guarding them -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Okay. So it wasn't a mistake.
dialog: (Bond lets go a blast)
dialog: What do we do now? Offer them
dialog: dinner?!?!
text: Bond glances back at the KITCHEN SUPPLIES. GETS AN IDEA. He sud-
text: denly TWISTS, SMASHING the BUTT OF HIS GUN down on some GLASSWARE on
text: the counter, then TWISTS BACK, returning a BURST OF GUNFIRE.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Come here. You shoot. I'll cook.
text: She thinks he's nuts, but squeezes next to him. Handing her the gun:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Aim that way.
text: Sidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, BULLET HITS
text: RIP UP THE DOOR FRAME. She jumps, TERRIFIED.
text: Bond looks at her from the PHOTO-COPYING MACHINE, where he is YANKING
text: OUT the TONER CARTRIDGE. He offers a simple piece of advice:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Shoot back!
text: Sidney frowns... Turns... And as she LETS THE GUN RIP, we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING) -
text: Stamper, running up steps with the guard. They exit into:
scene_heading: A SHORT SERVICE HALLWAY - 71ST. FLOOR -
text: They rush though it, bursting through a door into:
scene_heading: THE ELEVATOR BANK HALLWAY -
text: Stamper and the Guard start hunting Bond.
scene_heading: RETURN ON SIDNEY (HALLWAY/KITCHEN) -
text: As she continues to exchange fire with the guards...
text: BOND, (having broken the toner cartridge open,) is DUMPING THE TONER
text: in a coffee can. He reaches for a BOX of sugar
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: One second -
text: And (with GUNFIRE SFX over,) Bond sweeps the BROKEN DISH into the
text: can, and drops his Q LIGHTER in the mix.
text: He moves to Sidney, in the doorway. Kneels. In-between shots:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... How did you get into marine
dialog: salvage?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (gun burst, then)
dialog: My father left me the business.
text: Bond glances at his watch, timing the bomb. The guards shoot; she
text: shoots back, then explains:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: I used to be a divorce lawyer in New
dialog: York City.
text: Bond nods, continuing to look at his watch. Glances at her:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Not a lot of difference.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What do you mean?
text: Bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Either way, you're taking the goods
text: from dead hulks.
text: He tosses the can, and PULLS HER BACKWARDS, covering her.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - THE HALLWAY -
text: The GUARDS spring from the door, rushing forward to storm Bond's
text: position - just as the COFFEE CAN rolls towards them, and EXPLODES.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Let's go -
text: Taking the gun, the two of them start for the door when -
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - OPPOSITE END OF THE HALLWAY - CORNER -
text: Stamper and the GUARD have arrived at the corner, BLASTING.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND AND SIDNEY IN THE KITCHEN -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Damn!
text: Swiftly, Bond grabs a JUG of CLEANER from under the sink, moves to
text: the door, and ROLLS IT DOWN THE HALL in Stamper's direction.
scene_heading: STAMPER AND THE GUARD - (HALLWAY CORNER) -
text: Anticipate a bomb. They move back.
scene_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY (INT. KITCHEN) -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What the hell does that do?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Cleans dirt. Let's go.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -
text: Bond and Sidney BREAK for the STAIRCASE DOOR. (Where the first Guards
text: were shooting at them from.) TWISTING AROUND, Bond lets a BURST go
text: in Stamper's direction, as he stoops to scoop up one of the dead
dialog: guards' MAC-l0's.
text: INSERT - BOND'S BULLETS RIP UP THE JUG OF CLEANER.
scene_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY ESCAPE FROM THE HALLWAY -
speaker_heading: STAMPER -
text: Cowers, waiting for the jug to blow up... Then realizes:
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: It's a trick! After him.
dialog: (into his radio, on the run)
dialog: They're in the south stairwell!
scene_heading: HARMSWAY, IN THE SECURITY CENTER -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Get more men up there!
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL - LANDING -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Down?
text: Bond leans over the railing. Sees GUARDS coming UP. SHOOTS.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Up.
text: They go up about three stairs, and Sidney sees GUARDS descending.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Down?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (shoots, then)
dialog: Up.
text: Bond and Sidney bound up the stairs through a METAL DOOR, just as -
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -
text: Stamper and the Guard bound down the hallway, heading for the door.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY CENTER -
text: Harmsway smiles, watching Bond on a monitor:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ... And so much for that.
dialog: (into radio)
text: They're on the 72nd floor set-back.
dialog: (explains to the guards)
dialog: Nowhere to go.
scene_heading: EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TERRACE SETBACK - TWILIGHT -
text: It's magic hour as Bond and Sidney rush out onto the setback. Bond
text: sees a WINDOW WASHER'S RIG. And although Sidney asks -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Now what?
dialog: Bond's first concern is to make sure Stamper can't get them. Amidst
text: a pile of CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, he spots a PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN. He
dialog: grabs it, and -
text: BANG. BANG. BANG. He fires 3 NAILS through the door into the frame.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: That should buy us some time.
text: Now, Bond moves to the WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - a two-man bucket-like
text: scaffold ON TRACKS, with TWO LEATHER SAFETY HARNESSES inside, and a
text: LARGE CABLE SPOOL/MOTOR that stays on the roof.
text: Approaching it, Bond looks over the side:
scene_heading: BOND'S POV - LOOKING DOWN FROM 72ND FLOOR -
text: Twenty stories below is the sky bridge. 50 stories below that, the
text: ground. It's a long, long, way down.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND - AT THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - TERRACE SET-BACK -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Help me move this.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL -
text: Darting up the few steps, Stamper and Guards arrive at the door. He
text: tries to open it. Won't budge.
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: I'll call for a battering ram -
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: No. Get the fire ax.
text: One of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET. He hands the
text: AX to Stamper, who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -
text: Bond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: We'll go down close to the sky bridge.
dialog: We may be able to swing over and use it
dialog: for cover.
text: As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No way. I sail. I do not fly.
text: BANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Sometimes, you just have to take
dialog: the plunge.
text: Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts
dialog: down, as fast as they can go.
scene_heading: EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL -
text: Bond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE -
text: Stamper gives the last few chops to the door. He kicks it open.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR -
text: Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge.
scene_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR -
text: Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: All I know is one thing: If we get
dialog: out of here alive, that gold is mine.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've earned it.
text: Looking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: One thing at a time.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT -
text: Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to
text: the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY -
text: And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of
text: cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS.
speaker_heading: THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) -
text: Swings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They
text: are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant
text: pendulum - although still descending.
scene_heading: RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -
text: Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it.
text: He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens.
scene_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) -
text: Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket.
scene_heading: STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX -
text: Finally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT.
speaker_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY -
text: are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (panicked, anxious, fast)
dialog: What now? And don't give me some
dialog: movie cliché like 'trust me.'
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (what the hell)
dialog: Trust me.
text: And with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Let's go -
text: But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY
text: DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW.
scene_heading: THE TERRACE SET-BACK -
text: Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose
dialog: from its moorings.
speaker_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY -
text: look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what
dialog: (she thinks) is certain death:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: We're going to bounce off that thing!
text: Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper
dialog: cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Hold on!
scene_heading: TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT -
text: Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT-
text: TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall,
text: and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING.
scene_heading: THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG -
text: Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall.
text: BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge.
scene_heading: THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS -
scene_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO -
scene_heading: INT. 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE -
text: Landing on the deck of the bridge. Bond rolls to his feet as -
text: Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck. Bond
text: yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as THE CABLE DRUM,
text: PULLEY, AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY.
scene_heading: 72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK -
text: Looking down, Stamper flips open his radio.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: (over radio)
dialog: They're on the bridge. Seal off the
dialog: 50th floor!
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY CENTER -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (looking at the monitors)
dialog: I should have hired this man.
dialog: (to his guards)
dialog: Get somebody up there!
scene_heading: INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -
text: Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What about the elevators?
text: He steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four
text: inch pipe. Bond begins to work feverishly:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: We tried that already. Remember?
text: Bond picks up the cable and the leather harnesses.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You know, this is as much your fault
dialog: as it is mine.
text: Bond is slipping the cable around the railing pipe. One loop.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sidney, we don't have time for this -
text: He pulls on the loop to test it. Good enough. Makes a second loop.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Sure! Just when I want to talk -
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Not that I would have believed you -
text: Bond tests the second loop. He's satisfied. Turns to her:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Put your back to the railing. Sit up
dialog: on it.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (doing it)
dialog: Are you listening to me?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Put your arms around my neck. Lock
dialog: your legs around my waist.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: ... We have time for that?
text: Just then, GUARDS APPEAR OUT OF FAR ELEVATOR DOOR. Running, THEY
text: SHOOT. BOND FIRES A BURST BACK as - A NEW ROUND OF BULLET HITS
text: BEGINS TO RAIN DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE.
text: BOND LOOKS UP: Stamper has commandeered a second window washer's
text: rig, and is descending, FIRING AT THEM.
dialog: Bond looks at Sidney -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sometimes you just have to -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Don't say it.
text: She locks her arms and legs around him, he snaps the leather harness
text: around her waist, and they roll over the railing Amidst gunfire.
scene_heading: EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - TWILIGHT
text: Bond and Sidney fall from the bridge - 50 stories up.
dialog: They go down,
dialog: And down,
dialog: And down -
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE RAILING - (INT. SKY BRIDGE) -
text: The cable looped around the railing is slowing their descent; the
text: PAINT ON THE RAILING IS BURNING OFF, and the STEEL itself is STARTING
text: TO SMOKE from the friction.
scene_heading: BOND AND SIDNEY - DROPPING -
dialog: Dropping -
dialog: And Dropping.
text: Looking to the ground, Bond sees the PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY
text: coming up fast from below. It looks like they're going to get
dialog: splattered on the tile floor, when -
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE RAILING - SKY BRIDGE -
text: The cable comes to the end of its run! It DRAGS THE SPOOL, THE
text: BUCKET, and all the other MECHANICS to the side of the bridge,
text: SMASHING AGAINST THE WALL, JAMMING AGAINST THE RAILING.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PRESS ROOM OBSERVATION BALCONY - TWILIGHT -
text: Bond and Sidney jerk to a halt. They're swinging about five feet
text: from the balcony. There's a pause...
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Is this - like - a normal day for you?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: It's a lousy job, but -
dialog: (reaching for the balcony)
dialog: The only reason I stay is for the
dialog: health benefits.
text: Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY.
scene_heading: INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT -
text: Stamper lands on bridge. He unbuckles his harness, runs to railing,
text: looks down and sees SIDNEY AND BOND climbing out onto the balcony,
text: going for the PRESS ROOM DOOR.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: (into his radio)
text: They're heading for the press room.
dialog: Stop them!
scene_heading: INT. PRESS ROOM -
text: Bond and Sidney enter at the top of the metal stairs Bond came down
dialog: earlier to meet Harmsway.
text: The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening.
text: At the "start" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond
text: sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE, about to be loaded.
text: Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where
dialog: Bond and Harmsway exited earlier. -
text: Coming out of that DOOR, Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway Blazers
dialog: carrying guns.
text: BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL.
text: It CRASHES TO THE GROUND, rolling backwards on the guards. As they
text: start scrambling around it -
text: Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc-
text: tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...)
text: They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN, with an oversized crowbar.
text: Bond and the Pressman square off. Bond tries to get around him. The
text: man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it. Bond tries to block the
text: descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.
text: Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing
text: each other against the side of the press...
text: Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and
text: pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,
text: Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -
text: And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops
text: him on the head with the crowbar.
text: Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -
text: But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out
text: from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.
text: Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard
text: as he comes to finish Bond off.
text: The Guard stumbles backward -
text: Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. (A large machine that
text: wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.)
text: Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the
text: BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that
dialog: as Bond turns -
text: The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.
dialog: Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond
dialog: ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) -
text: Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,
text: pulling Sidney away at the last moment.
text: The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...
text: The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: He was bad news.
text: Spotting more Guards coming down the far staircase, Bond grabs Sidney
text: and the gun, and runs to the NEWSPAPER DELIVERY CHUTE.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Down there!
text: They jump into it, sliding down, and around an ALUMINUM CHUTE into:
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - HARMSWAY TOWERS.
text: Bond and Sidney come out near a TROLLEY stacked with newspapers.
text: Hearts pounding - having left the pressroom's deafening noise -
dialog: they're ready for almost anything, except what they HEAR:
text: The SOUND OF ONE MAN APPLAUDING. A polite, almost bored clapping.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (O.S.)
dialog: Vert, very, good Mr. Bond. Outstanding
dialog: performance.
text: Harmsway is standing with TEN GUARDS, shoulder to shoulder, in a
text: straight line, all HOLDING WEAPONS on Sidney and Bond.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (continuing)
dialog: I'm the certain the British taxpayers
dialog: would be impressed by your efforts.
dialog: Don't you agree?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I think they'd rather know who stole
dialog: their gold.
dialog: Harmsway can't help his ego:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (chuckles)
dialog: Why, I did, of course. It's on the
dialog: Sea Dolphin II, twenty miles outside
dialog: of Hong Kong... Not that it will do
dialog: either of you any good to know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now both of you: Stand up. And toss
dialog: the gun out, Mr. Bond.
text: Bond SLIDES THE GUN several feet in front of him... And THROWS A LOOK
text: TO HIS CAR, noting THE GUARDS ARE LINED UP DIRECTLY IN ITS PATH.
text: Bond begins to scheme.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Uncle Elliot: How could you do this
dialog: to me?
text: Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Oh, please, Sidney. There's a
dialog: hundred billion dollars at stake.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Besides, I never really liked your
dialog: father that much. He cheated at cards.
text: Bond has removed the CAR REMOTE CONTROL. He palms it.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Are your guards really going to kill
dialog: a helpless girl?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: My guards are from South Africa, Mr.
dialog: Bond. This is their chance to get even
dialog: with the formerly 'Great' Britain.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now both of you. Put your hands on
dialog: your heads, and step forward.
text: Holding the remote control, Bond puts his hands on his head. He's
text: manipulating the control into the right position to use it.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (trying to buy time)
dialog: What did you do, Harmsway? Make some
dialog: deal with the Chinese government for
dialog: the gold?.. Was the radioactive
dialog: uranium I found in Venice part of it?
text: He finally has the remote control in the right position.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Questions, questions, Mr. Bond...
dialog: Which I'm afraid I've neither the
dialog: time, nor the inclination to answer.
dialog: (to the guards)
dialog: Take them out to the jungle and -
text: Suddenly, BOND'S CAR ENGINE STARTS WITH A ROAR. The GUARDS TURN, in
dialog: shock TOWARDS THE CAR, as:
text: BOND retrieves the gun he slid out, and pulls Sidney behind the
dialog: newspaper trolley, while -
text: THE CAR BEGINS TO MOVE, sending the guards scrambling.
text: BOND takes his position with Sidney.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I forgot to mention: The job comes
dialog: with a car.
dialog: 007 begins shooting, as -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Kill it! Shoot the damn thing -
text: THE GUARDS START BLASTING THE EMPTY MOVING CAR. They manage to shoot
dialog: out the headlights, while -
text: BOND is having trouble coordinating driving and shooting at the same
text: time. As bullets rip up the newspapers in front of them -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: ...You know, that's another reason
dialog: you're probably not in a successful
dialog: relationship.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Another reason??? Did I miss something???
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (taking the gun)
dialog: You insist on calling all the shots.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
text: Bond eyes her for one split second. Points at the guards:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Aim that way.
dialog: Sidney starts to shoot as -
text: THE GUARDS continue to blast away at the car... But:
text: THE WINDOWS DON'T SHATTER.
scene_heading: THE ARMOR-PLATED SIDE-PANELS ONLY DENT WITH BULLET HITS...
dialog: THE TIRES DON'T GO FLAT.
text: There's chaos; a cacophony of voices and wild gunfire as BOND STEERS
text: THE CAR TO THEIR POSITION, where the door opens automatically.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Ready? Now!
text: The two of them make a break for the car, DIVING INSIDE.
scene_heading: INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING - GARAGE -
text: - Bond guns the engine, slams the transmission into gear. Burning
text: rubber, GUARDS bounce off the front fenders.
speaker_heading: THE GUARDS -
text: Continue to shoot at the car.
speaker_heading: OTHER GUARDS -
text: Run for the HUM-VEES. Hop in and chase.
scene_heading: INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -
text: Bond flips open a hidden control panel. Flips a switch.
scene_heading: EXT. BACK OF BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -
text: The TAIL-LIGHTS DROP DOWN and MACHINE GUNS start to fire.
scene_heading: INT. BOND'S CAR - (MOVING) -
text: Bond glances at the REARVIEW MIRROR. Sees the HUM-VEES. Presses
dialog: another switch -
scene_heading: CLOSE ON BOND'S EXHAUST PIPE -
text: Whoosh! A MISSILE blasts out, trailing smoke as it hones in on -
scene_heading: THE FIRST HUM-VEE.
dialog: BOOM! It's decimated.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON HARMSWAY - ON HIS RADIO -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Seal the garage! Cut the power!
dialog: He's got no headlamps!
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - FIRST TURN -
text: As the car screeches around a corner, the overhead lights go out.
scene_heading: INT. BOND'S CAR -
text: Bond flips down the visor: A THERMAL IMAGING DISPLAY drops down.
scene_heading: INSERT "HEADS UP" IMAGING DISPLAY -
text: It looks just like the jet fighter videos from the Gulf War.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - SECOND TURN - UP RAMP -
text: Bond's car roars around a second turn, with sparks flying as it
text: scrapes the walls. AHEAD, a MASSIVE ONE-PIECE DOOR is FOLDING DOWN
text: FROM THE CEILING. A city street beyond.
scene_heading: INT. BOND'S CAR - MOVING -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: We're not going to make it!
text: Bond flips down a control panel from the RADIO. A DIGITAL DISPLAY
text: begins to run through a set of numbers. Bond explains:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: If it's radio controlled, it'll break
dialog: the code.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: If not?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (pointing to a button)
dialog: We blast through.
text: THE CAR APPROACHES THE CLOSING DOOR AT HIGH SPEED -
text: BOND SEES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT. HE PUNCHES THE MISSILE BUTTON.
text: TWO MISSILES ROAR OUT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR -
text: THEY EXPLODE AGAINST THE CLOSING DOOR - TO NO EFFECT.
scene_heading: BOND'S CAR GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER -
scene_heading: SIDNEY SCREAMS! BOND BRACES, AND -
text: BOOM! CRASH! SILENCE. BLACK. After a moment, we HEAR THE SOUND OF
text: FOOTSTEPS ON CEMENT.
scene_heading: INT. GARAGE -
text: The lights come on. The car is a twisted wreck, smashed against the
text: wall. Bond and Sidney are slumped forward, unconscious.
text: Harmsway KNOCKS TWICE ON THE GARAGE DOOR, to demonstrate:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: - Built to withstand a nuclear blast.
dialog: (to Stamper, checking
dialog: Bond's pulse)
dialog: Are they alive?
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Yes. Shall we kill them?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: No. I have a better idea. In fact,
dialog: Mr. Bond may have actually improved
dialog: my original plan.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Bring them both to Hong Kong. And
dialog: Make sure he has nothing else up his
dialog: sleeve.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR - HONG KONG - MORNING -
text: It is early morning in this strange harbor - a place where floating
text: restaurant rise out of the fog; where an old Chinese man wearing an
text: LA Laker's jersey practices tai-chi on the bow of an ancient junk;
text: where sampans cut through the chop filled with ducks, computer boxes
dialog: and women dressed in Chanel 1996, and Beijing 1256... While the
text: captains of these small water-taxis chatter away on cell-phones.
text: At the end of the harbor, dominating this scene, the CAMERA FINDS:
text: THE FIVE SMOKESTACKS OF THE ABERDEEN HARBOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.
text: Panning down this massive dockside facility, the image changes to:
scene_heading: THE SAME SCENE ON A 5" PORTABLE VIDEO MONITOR -
text: With one important difference: There's an HNN logo in lower corner.
speaker_heading: ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (VO)
dialog: As part of our continuing report on
dialog: terrorism, we're outside Hong Kong's
dialog: Aberdeen Harbor nuclear power plant...
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE (EXT. POWER PLANT, FRONT ENTRANCE, WATERSIDE) -
text: Two VIDEO CAMERAMEN are shooting an ASIAN HNN REPORTER interviewing a
text: middle-aged CHINESE MAN. We don't see the reporter's face; from the
text: "over the shoulder" news angle, he's WEARING A HAT.
text: (There's also HNN BELL JETRANGER HELICOPTER on the ground, and a
text: seemingly empty HNN BOAT moored to a nearby pier.)
speaker_heading: ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER (cont'd)
dialog: - Interviewing Mr. David Chin, senior
dialog: engineer in charge of security.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Tell me, Mr. Chin: How safe is this
dialog: plant from a terrorist attack?
text: He holds out a MICROPHONE to Chin.
speaker_heading: CHIN
dialog: Totally secure. Without codes, you'd
dialog: need a missile to blast through the
dialog: front door; you normally can't even get
dialog: this close (to the plant) without a full
dialog: security clearance.
speaker_heading: ASIAN MALE NEWS REPORTER
dialog: ...Could you say that a little closer
dialog: to the microphone?
text: He pushes the microphone closer to Chin's face:
speaker_heading: CHIN
dialog: Of course. You'd need -
text: Suddenly, A PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE EMERGES FROM THE MICROPHONE... And
text: CHIN COLLAPSES. The HNN reporter TAKES OFF HIS HAT: IT'S YUNG.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: (to the guards)
dialog: Now!
text: At once, the two cameramen turn: One AIMS his shoulder-mounted video
text: camera at a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA; the other aims at the FRONT DOOR.
text: BOOM! ROCKETS shoot out from their lenses, destroying both.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: Let's go!
text: As Yung and the cameramen rush forward -
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE HNN BOAT -
text: Harmsway emerges from the boat accompanied by two men carrying a box
text: of equipment. He calls back to TWO MEN who have appeared on deck:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Get the machine in the water!
text: They begin using a hoist to lift one of the "worms" from a hold.
text: (This one looks like an open-mouthed torpedo, with an antenna on top,
dialog: and no flexible tubing attached.)
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY/RECEPTION - POWER PLANT -
text: Yung and the cameramen turn a corner to the reception/security area:
speaker_heading: POWER PLANT GUARD
dialog: What happened out there?
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: A generator blew. Nothing to worry about.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I need one last shot of you. Why
dialog: don't you stand by the alarm?
speaker_heading: POWER PLANT GUARD
dialog: No problem.
text: The guard stands, and smiles, posing for the video camera... And Yung
text: pulls a pistol from his pocket and shoots him.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: (to the cameramen)
dialog: Up the stairs!
text: They follow Yung up a set of stairs leading to the reactor control
text: room. Meanwhile, back at the HNN boat:
scene_heading: INT. CABIN - HNN BOAT
text: Bond is at the porthole, wearing only shorts, trying to figure a way
text: out. He hears the door click open, and -
text: A Guard enters carrying a pile of Bond's clothing with his shoes on
text: top. Stamper is behind him, holding a gun on Sidney.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Put on your clothes.
dialog: (to the guard)
dialog: Cuff him.
text: The guard cuffs Bond's hands (in the front,) and we cut back to:
scene_heading: INT. POWER PLANT CONTROL ROOM -
text: Yung and the Cameramen sweep into the control room: Lots of con-
text: soles, with a window overlooking the REACTOR CORE, and its
text: surrounding blue COOLING POOL.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: (to the half-dozen engineers)
dialog: I'm sorry to interrupt again. But we
dialog: need one more picture for the story.
text: The engineers ad-lib replies: "Sure." "Okay." Yung smiles:
speaker_heading: YUNG (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't you line up against the
dialog: wall? Let's make it a group shot.
text: The engineers line up against a wall. The cameramen take positions
text: for a massacre. And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to:
scene_heading: EXT. ENTRANCEWAY -
text: Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Sleep well?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Next time, I do the driving.
text: Bond gives her a look.
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -
text: Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable
text: version of the "worm" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: The drill is in the water;
text: approaching the intake tunnel.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Excellent.
text: Harmsway looks up, hearing:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I see you're in your natural element,
text: Harmsway: A room filled with lethal
dialog: power...
dialog: (beat)
text: ...With a toxic core at its center.
text: Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at
text: gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney...
dialog: You're just in time for a nuclear
dialog: meltdown!
text: Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him -
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: You bastard -
text: Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage.
text: He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember
dialog: you fondly.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: (calling from the console)
text: Approaching the first gate.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Start the grinders.
scene_heading: UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL -
text: The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the
text: grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars.
scene_heading: RETURN ON CONTROL ROOM -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ...So that's what the weapons grade
dialog: uranium was for.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of
dialog: minutes, the boring device will
text: arrive at the core of the reactor...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And when the radioactive blades cut
dialog: into the plutonium -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: - Instant melt-down.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
text: Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
text: Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try
text: rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: We're through the first gate.
dialog: Approaching the second -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (demanding)
dialog: Why, Harmsway? Wasn't stealing the
dialog: gold enough?
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (to Yung)
dialog: Bore through.
dialog: (to Bond, chuckling)
dialog: ...They used to say living well was
dialog: the best revenge, Mr. Bond.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They're wrong.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Revenge is the best revenge.
speaker_heading: YUNG
text: Entering the main tunnel - ten
dialog: minutes to target -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (fiercely)
dialog: What could you possibly have to be
dialog: vengeful for, Harmsway? Still trying
dialog: to prove yourself to daddy?
text: This infuriates Harmsway. Bond moves closer to the gun.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: You have to leave -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (enraged, ignoring Yung)
dialog: A hundred and fifty years ago, my
dialog: ancestors took this island - a
dialog: barren, lifeless rock - and turned it
dialog: into the greatest city known to
dialog: modern civilization.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And now that I'm being forced to give
dialog: it back, I intend to return it in
dialog: exactly the same condition: A
text: barren, lifeless rock.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The gold is merely reparations -
dialog: payment from the spineless British
dialog: government who wouldn't listen.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (to Sidney, glancing at the gun)
dialog: ... I think Uncle Elliot is having
dialog: his own melt-down.
speaker_heading: YUNG
text: Approaching the third gate -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Smash through it!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but
dialog: you fit perfectly in to my plans.
dialog: (he reaches for a newspaper)
dialog: Here. This just in. Newsflash.
dialog: Read all about it.
text: He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as
text: Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear
dialog: meltdown... British agent found in
dialog: reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway
dialog: calls for British government to resign.
dialog: Harmsway smiles at Bond:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow
dialog: never lies.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: What about the gold?
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: You must go. Now. Otherwise the
dialog: boat won't be out of range -
text: Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Thirty seconds.
dialog: (then, to Bond)
dialog: That's the most brilliant part of the
dialog: plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy,
dialog: I'll let the new British government -
dialog: my British government - announce that
dialog: the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong
dialog: - where no one will be able to touch
dialog: it for a hundred years.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And just by coincidence:
text: He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
text: ...Gold mine opens in Vietnam.
dialog: (turns to Stamper)
dialog: Let's go. Put them in the airlock.
text: Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You'll never get away with it,
dialog: Harmsway. Too many people know.
dialog: Bond tenses, ready to spring -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the
dialog: crazies - the conspiracy theorists?
dialog: The Oliver Stones of the world?
dialog: (pausing, then, with great scorn:)
dialog: I'll publish their books, I'll make
dialog: their movies, I'll put them on my TV
dialog: shows!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: They're my bellboys. They carry my
dialog: luggage.
text: Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Now. Get them in the airlock.
text: Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And
dialog: the handcuffs. They'll give it away.
text: Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: No. I want to stay with him.
text: Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he
text: realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could
dialog: hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"...
text: But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's
text: running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (breaking the moment, cynically)
dialog: How sweet.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (satto, to Bond)
dialog: My timing always was lousy.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (cold and hard)
dialog: I'd rather die alone.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs.
dialog: We'll drown her at sea.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: (to Bond, sarcastically)
dialog: Enjoy the rest of your life.
text: As Stamper pushes Bond into the reactor room airlock, he hears:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: I'll meet you on the boat, south of
dialog: Lantau Island.
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK -
text: The door closes. Bond looks out the small window at:
scene_heading: HARMSWAY AND YUNG IN THE CONTROL ROOM -
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: Take the men. I can finish alone.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (to the technicians and cameramen)
dialog: You come with me -
dialog: (to the guard who handcuffed Bond)
dialog: You stay here.
dialog: As they exit -
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK -
text: Bond has yanked his shoes off. He pulls out the PLASTIQUE EXPLOSIVE
text: SHOELACES and opens the SECRET COMPARTMENT IN HIS HEEL, revealing a
speaker_heading: DETONATOR, and EAR PLUGS.
text: Moving quickly, Bond BITES OFF a 2-inch piece of shoelace, and wraps
text: it around the chain-link connecting his handcuffs, while...
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM -
text: Yung sits down at the worm control and explains to the guard:
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: We'll cut through the last gate, then
text: set it on auto-pilot.
text: He starts to maneuver the joystick, and -
scene_heading: UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL -
text: The worm turns a corner. We see -
scene_heading: THE WORM'S POV - (INT. INTAKE TUNNEL MOVING) -
text: 100 feet ahead: An iron gate. Beyond it, the blue lights from the
dialog: reactor cooling pool... And beyond that... THE REACTOR CORE, a
text: shimmering silver target.
text: Meanwhile, back outside, at -
speaker_heading: THE DOCK -
text: Water sprays violently as the HNN boat thunders out of Aberdeen
text: harbor with Harmsway at the helm. Junks and sampans are tossed in
dialog: his wake, as
scene_heading: INT. AIRLOCK -
text: Bond finishes pressing the SHOELACES AROUND THE DOOR LOCK... Then
text: TURNS UP HIS SHIRT COLLAR TO PULL OUT A WIRE that's been hidden
dialog: inside.
text: He connects it between the explosive on the handcuff chain and the
text: detonator, then steals a glance out the window at:
speaker_heading: YUNG -
text: still guiding the worm with the joy stick. His eyes are focused on:
scene_heading: THE CONTROL PANEL (INCLUDING VIDEO SCREEN, SHOWING WORM'S POV) -
text: Where Yung sees the gate looming ahead on the video screen. He
text: presses a nearby button marked "START GRINDERS"... And the video
text: goes black, replaced by the words "GRINDERS ENGAGED."
scene_heading: UNDERWATER -(INTAKE TUNNEL) -
text: The worm bares its lethal teeth; and revs up to speed. Meanwhile -
speaker_heading: BOND -
text: Closes his eyes, presses the detonator, and -
speaker_heading: YUNG -
text: HEARS a small BOOM from inside the airlock.
speaker_heading: YUNG
dialog: (to the guard)
dialog: Check it out. Be careful.
text: The guard picks up his machine pistol, starts to the door.
scene_heading: INSIDE THE AIRLOCK -
text: Bond (with his hands now free) is quickly rewiring the detonator to
text: the plastique explosive around the door handle.
scene_heading: YUNG MANEUVERS THE JOY-STICK, AS -
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER (INTAKE TUNNEL)
text: The worm's teeth are beginning to cut into the steel bars.
text: THE GUARD APPROACHES THE DOOR.
text: BOND BRACES HIMSELF INSIDE THE AIRLOCK.
text: THE GUARD PEERS INTO THE WINDOW -
text: And suddenly... BOOM! The door blows open with a shattering blast!
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - THE CONTROL ROOM -
text: The guard is blasted backward, dead. Bond rolls out, scrambling for
text: the weapon. Yung slams his hand on a button marked "AUTO-PILOT." A
text: caption appears on the video screen "TARGET LOCKED," and -
text: As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of
text: him. They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards
text: the window overlooking the blue cooling pool.
text: Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun. Yung takes a
text: shortcut - leaping on, and then over the console, as -
scene_heading: THE WORM (UNDERWATER - INTAKE TUNNEL) -
text: Chews through the last of the iron bars, and glides through the hole
text: toward THE SILVERY REACTOR CORE, 35 feet ahead.
speaker_heading: BOND AND YUNG -
text: have squared off in a short, brutal MARTIAL ARTS battle.
text: (The fight takes place in the space between the consoles and the
text: reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them.)
text: They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own,
dialog: Yung is every bit his equal.
text: Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick -
text: But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing
text: against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
dialog: Meanwhile, all through this...
text: THE WORM IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE CORE.
scene_heading: RETURN ON BOND AND YUNG -
text: As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher
text: from the wall. He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2.
text: In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond,
text: headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND
text: BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW.
text: THE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop
text: himself from falling backwards into the reactor room...
dialog: Yung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -
text: But at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's
text: momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into -
speaker_heading: THE REACTOR ROOM.
text: He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as -
text: THE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE.
text: SCREAMING, YUNG HITS THE WATER FEET FIRST, AND -
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER (REACTOR CORE) -
text: THE WORM BURROWS IN ON HIM.
scene_heading: RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -
text: Bond races to hit the "EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN" button. He pulls
text: a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an "EMERGENCY
text: DECONTAMINATION" system, spraying the room with a mist of water.
text: Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at:
speaker_heading: THE REACTOR POOL (BOND'S POV) -
text: There's a cloud of RED in the middle of the blue water.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE -
text: Bond goes to the dead guard. Gets the key, removes his handcuff
text: bracelets, then hoists the dead guard over his shoulder, and exits.
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER - (EXT. ABERDEEN HARBOR POWER PLANT) - DAY
text: With the sound of fire engines approaching in the background, Bond
text: straps the dead guard into the passenger seat, and takes off.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II - (AERIAL - SOUTH CHINA SEA) - DAY
text: The HNN boat has pulled alongside the Sea Dolphin II. The gang from
text: the nuke plant is boarding the larger boat.
dialog: (Note: From the air, we should notice that the "gold hold" is now
text: covered by a steel hatch, and the biggest worm is stored in the open,
text: hanging from a steel boom.)
speaker_heading: THE DECK -
text: Coming up the ladder first, Harmsway is greeted by the Captain.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Any news?
speaker_heading: THE CAPTAIN
dialog: The call just went out on the Hong
dialog: Kong police radio: Fire at the power
dialog: plant.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (ironically)
dialog: Alert the media!
text: Stamper and Sidney have climbed onto the deck.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: What do you want me to do with her?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: - Can't we make a deal? I won't say
dialog: anything -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (touching her cheek)
dialog: You're so cute, my dear.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But I'm afraid not.
dialog: (to one of the cameramen)
text: Put her in the storage room.
text: The cameraman takes her away. Harmsway turns to the captain:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll get rid of her when we're in
dialog: International waters.
dialog: (then)
text: Set sail, full speed, due south.
dialog: I'll be in my cabin. Let me know
dialog: when Mr. Yung arrives. We'll break
dialog: out the champagne.
scene_heading: INT. LOWER PASSAGEWAY/STORAGE ROOM - SEA DOLPHIN II -
dialog: Near the engine room (indicating we're near the bottom of the boat,)
text: the cameraman opens a door to a small, cramped room with a bench, and
text: SCUBA EQUIPMENT. He pushes Sidney inside.
speaker_heading: CAMERAMAN
dialog: Don't get any ideas.
text: Then locks the door on her.
scene_heading: EXT. BOND'S HNN HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY
text: Several hundred feet in the air, the helicopter is heading for an
text: island in the distance.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING -
text: Bond checks the compass, and adjusts his course. The COMPASS SWINGS
speaker_heading: DUE SOUTH.
speaker_heading: BOND'S POV -
text: The helicopter clears the island: Bright blue sea ahead. Bond sees
text: then passes over - the HNN boat, bobbing empty in the water...
text: Then, further ahead, he spots the stern of Sea Dolphin II, shimmering
dialog: in the instance.
scene_heading: REAR DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -
text: Looking north, off the back of the boat Stamper and a crewman see the
text: helicopter - a tiny speck in the air.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: There it is.
text: Stamper lifts a pair of BINOCULARS for confirmation.
scene_heading: STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -
text: He sees two figures in the cockpit.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE -
text: Stamper picks up his radio:
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: It's him. They both made it.
speaker_heading: THE BRIDGE -
dialog: The Captain replies:
speaker_heading: THE CAPTAIN
dialog: I'll tell Sir Elliot.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY'S CABIN -
text: Harmsway is working at a computer. A chime sounds.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN'S VOICE
dialog: He's approaching from the north, sir.
speaker_heading: CREWMAN
dialog: Fantastic. Invite the crew on deck
dialog: to celebrate, and I'll be up in a few
dialog: minutes.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER - FLYING - DAY -
text: Bond is about two miles out from the stern of the Sea Dolphin II.
text: Maybe 500' in the air.
text: Taking the machine pistol from the dead guard's lap, he opens the
text: small pilot's window, and balances it on his knees. Ahead, he sees:
scene_heading: BOND'S POV - DECK - SEA DOLPHIN II -
text: The crewmen are lining up on either side of the landing pad, near the
dialog: ship's railings.
speaker_heading: RETURN ON BOND -
text: Ready for war. He pushes the cyclic pitch lever forward, and the
text: Bell Jetranger goes into a screaming descent.
scene_heading: THE DECK/HELICOPTER LANDING PAD
text: Champagne bottles pop. Stamper is with a crewman, who looks up at
dialog: the chopper, about 1000' off the stern:
speaker_heading: CREWMAN
text: He seems to be coming in awfully fast.
text: Stamper picks up his binoculars.
scene_heading: STAMPER'S POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS -
text: He sees Bond.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE -
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: Get the guns! It's not him! It's
dialog: Bond!!!
dialog: He might have also added "It's too late," as -
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - REAR DECK OF THE BOAT/HELICOPTER -
text: Bond SWOOPS IN LOW on the port side of the boat, FIRING HIS GUN from
text: the pilot's window, and using the CHOPPER'S BLADES to threaten the
dialog: men on deck.
text: About half of them DIVE INTO THE WATER FOR SAFETY, only to be quickly
dialog: left behind.
text: Flying up the port side toward the front of the boat, Bond passes -
scene_heading: INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -
text: The windows rattle as Bond's chopper thunders by. Perplexed,
text: Harmsway stands, opens the porthole curtains. He cranes his neck,
text: but sees nothing. He presses an intercom button:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: What the hell is going on?
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE -
speaker_heading: THE CAPTAIN
dialog: (on a phone)
dialog: I don't know sir -
text: The helicopter suddenly appears in front of him. Shooting from the
text: pilot's window, Bond shatters the glass windows -
text: And the Captain slumps forward on the wheel, spinning it as he slides
dialog: to the deck.
scene_heading: INT. HARMSWAY'S CABIN -
text: The boat pitches wildly; Harmsway looses his balance, crashing into a
dialog: wall.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE CABIN -
text: Sidney is thrown from her bench, slamming against scuba tanks.
scene_heading: EXT. MID-SHIP - DECK -
text: Stamper bounces himself, handing out AUTOMATIC WEAPONS from an arms
text: cache hidden inside a DINGHY.
text: The two cameramen take their M-16's and rush forward, jumping up on
dialog: some machinery to climb onto -
scene_heading: THE ROOF OF THE BRIDGE -
text: They rush forward, and assume positions shooting at Bond.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON THE HELICOPTER -
text: Taking hits. Bond pivots and turns the chopper, heading straight for
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER) -
text: The men turn, and start to run as the chopper chases them -
text: CLOSE ON THE CHOPPER'S LANDING SKIDS -
text: BOND HOOKS BOTH OF THEM WITH THE SKIDS, BY THE BACK OF THEIR UNTUCKED
dialog: SHIRTS!!!! The man are flailing like crazy as -
scene_heading: BOND PULLS BACK ON THE CYCLIC PITCH LEVER -
scene_heading: THE HELICOPTER REARS BACKWARDS, AND UP -
text: And the men burst through their shirt buttons, FALLING, SHIRTLESS,
dialog: into the sea.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER -
text: Bond pushes the cyclic sideways to bank down, and in, on the boat.
dialog: But he doesn't see -
speaker_heading: WIDE - (BOAT/HELICOPTER)
text: A SMALL ROCKET STREAKING UPWARD from the boat. Stamper is holding a
text: shoulder mounted launcher.
speaker_heading: THE HELICOPTER -
text: BOOM! It hits the engine.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER -
text: The gauges go crazy; the alarms go berserk. The entire cockpit is
text: chattering as Bond struggles to remain in control.
scene_heading: EXT. LADDER LEADING TO THE BRIDGE -
text: HARMSWAY is trying to make his way up the ladder as the boat
text: continues to veer out of control. He pauses to look up at:
scene_heading: THE HELICOPTER, GYRATING WILDLY -
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER -
text: Bond forces the cyclic forward. The helicopter pitches forward -
speaker_heading: BOND'S POV - (INT. HELICOPTER)
text: He's heading straight for the hatch covering the gold hold. Whoever
text: is left alive is diving off the ship to get out of the way.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE -
text: Struggling with the wheel, Harmsway picks up the radio:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: What the hell is going on?
speaker_heading: STAMPER (O. S. )
dialog: It's Bond!
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Kill him! Finish it!
scene_heading: ANGLE ON STAMPER (EXT. MID-SHIP) -
text: With the worm dangling from a boom in the background, he watches:
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER/SHIP
text: With the chopper about 15 feet above the gold hold - just barely
text: under control - Bond opens the door.
text: He leaps out onto the hatch, and rolls off, disappearing as -
text: THE CHOPPER CRASHES onto the gold hold, in a GIANT BALL OF FLAME and
dialog: twisted metal.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT -
text: Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE -
text: Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead
text: captain, and pushes the body out.
scene_heading: EXT. PASSAGEWAY -
text: With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily
text: moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship.
dialog: (Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any
dialog: threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.)
text: Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the
text: passageway, then pokes his head inside -
text: And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown
dialog: against a railing.
dialog: Bond looks up:
text: STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his
text: head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached
text: to the boom by a thin metal cable.
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: You're mine now.
text: Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch.
text: With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him
text: against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck.
text: As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a
text: wall, and THE WORM comes to life.
text: Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm.
text: Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond
text: against the wall with his free hand as he -
text: MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD.
text: With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose -
speaker_heading: STAMPER
dialog: I'm going to do this slowly -
text: Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles
text: sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm -
text: But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is
text: rushing at Bond full force, with the worm.
text: Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews
text: into the wall.
text: Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same
dialog: action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond.
scene_heading: INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE -
text: With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in
text: the cable, on the ground.
scene_heading: RETURN TO SCENE -
text: Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in
text: the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain -
text: And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE
text: SIDE OF THE SHIP.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER -
text: The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull.
scene_heading: SIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) -
text: Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall.
scene_heading: HARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (barking into the radio)
dialog: Stamper! Report in!
scene_heading: EXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY -
text: As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY'S VOICE
dialog: (continuing, on Stamper's radio)
dialog: Report to the bridge!
text: BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing
text: taught as the worm wends its way underwater.
dialog: Stamper rushes Bond -
text: And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around
text: Stamper's neck.
text: Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and -
text: STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as -
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE CABIN -
text: THE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in,
text: pushing Sidney off to one side.
scene_heading: WORM'S POV - INT. STORAGE CABIN -
text: It's zooming at the door!
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY -
text: The door bursts open, sending tons of water into the passageway.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE -
text: The boat shudders violently, sending Harmsway crashing against a
text: wall, cutting his head.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DECK -
text: As the boat rocks, Bond steadies himself, then starts for the bridge,
text: using the same route as the cameramen lifted by the chopper:
text: First climbing up on some machinery, then up onto the bridge roof.
scene_heading: INT. STORAGE ROOM -
text: Sidney is thrashing for air, with only a few inches left between the
text: rising water and the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGEWAY -
text: 3/4 filled with water. Rising fast.
scene_heading: THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, INT. PASSAGEWAY)
text: The worm is heading for a door. We see the door disintegrate in
text: front of us, as the worm bursts into -
scene_heading: THE ENGINE ROOM.
text: With the water cascading over the camera, (as if we were riding
text: inside an ocean wave,) the worm heads for a tank marked "FUEL."
scene_heading: EXT. THE SEA DOLPHIN II -
text: The boat is sinking. Bond is running across the bridge roof, when:
text: THE BOAT SUDDENLY LISTS TO THE STARBOARD SIDE.
scene_heading: INT. BRIDGE -
text: Harmsway is thrown backwards. Gun in hand, he makes his way up the
text: incline, to the port-side door.
dialog: Just when he thinks he's made it -
text: Bang. Bond appears in the doorway, having jumped down from the roof
text: on the small exterior walkway. He's seething with rage.
text: Harmsway looks up at him. Blinks in disbelief.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I never believe what I read in the
dialog: newspapers.
text: Harmsway slowly brings up the gun.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: Pity you'll miss your obituary.
text: Bond smacks the gun out of his hand with contempt. Moves closer.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Where is she, Harmsway?
text: BOOM! The fuel tanks explode in the distance. The bridge rocks
text: violently; the room tilts to a greater angle.
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: You want to kill me, Bond? Go ahead.
text: With both arms, Bond pushes Harmsway backwards, flinging him downward
text: against the starboard wall. The water is rising on the bridge.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: (moving in on him)
dialog: Where is she Harmsway? -
text: He grabs Harmsway by the lapels, and throws him against the front
text: wall, crashing onto the instrument panel head first.
text: Harmsway laughs maniacally, face down on the gauges:
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: What is it, Bond? You haven't the
dialog: guts?
text: Boom! There's another explosion in the background! The front of the
text: boat tilts upward! The water is rushing in!
text: Bond grabs Harmsway by the shoulder -
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: You spineless paper tiger -
text: And yanks him off the instrument panel, flinging him backwards
text: against the rear wall of the bridge.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Where is she, Harmsway?!? Or did you
dialog: kill her like Paris?
text: Suddenly, THE BOAT GROANS. The BRIDGE RISES OUT OF THE WATER! AND
text: BOND loses his balance, FALLING ONTO HARMSWAY -
speaker_heading: HARMSWAY
dialog: (glaring, insanely:)
dialog: We all go down together!!!
text: Harmsway lunges for Bond's throat -
text: AND THE BRIDGE SLIPS UNDERWATER -
text: Where Bond breaks Harmsway's grasp in a violent struggle - then
text: punches him. Air bubbles break from Harmsway's mouth. He
text: frantically tries to break free for the surface -
text: But Bond pulls him back down, and holds him down, pushing down on
text: Harmsway's shoulders.
text: Harmsway is thrashing about, flailing in all directions, pounding at
text: Bond in a haze of bubbles...
text: Then falls still.
text: With his lungs aching, bursting with fire, Bond rockets up -
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -
dialog: through the bridge windows, up to -
speaker_heading: THE SURFACE.
text: He breaks through the water, gasping for air... And then, almost
text: instantly, dives down again.
speaker_heading: UNDERWATER - (BOND/BOAT) -
text: Bond dives for the boat - down, and down, chasing it, as if he could
dialog: just grab it, and stop it from sinking.
text: He goes deeper, and deeper, as it sinks further and further away,
text: just beyond his reach.
dialog: And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his
dialog: breath a second longer -
text: A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM.
text: Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She
text: puts her regulator in Bond's mouth...
text: And they share the air as they rise from the depths.
speaker_heading: THE SURFACE -
text: They break through the water. Sidney yanks off her mask. Teases:
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: What do you mean, you'd rather die
dialog: alone?
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: I didn't say when I want to die -
text: She splashes him. Turning away, Bond spots Stamper's 'arms cache'
text: dinghy floating nearby.
scene_heading: NEW ANGLE - THE DINGHY -
text: Bond climbs into it, then helps Sidney get in. They collapse in the
text: bottom of the boat, resting their heads against the gunwale.
text: After a beat, SIDNEY CLEARS HER THROAT. Bond is already amused:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Yes???
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Before we go any further here, Mr.
dialog: Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just
dialog: want to get two things straight.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: ... Yes?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: First, that boat is in international
dialog: waters. I'm claiming it for salvage.
dialog: One-third of that gold is mine.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: And number two?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: If you think we're going to have some
dialog: kind of 'life affirming' romance here
dialog: just because we cheated death, let me
dialog: be clear:
dialog: (pause)
dialog: We're going to have it where I want,
dialog: and when I want.
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: And when might that be?
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: Now.
text: He laughs. She falls into his arms. They kiss, and we cut to:
scene_heading: TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS -
text: With the dinghy reflected in the glass. In unison, they are both
text: lowered, revealing Q and Wade.
dialog: Q
dialog: ... As usual, I see the situation is
dialog: in 007's very capable hands.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Life is not fair.
dialog: Q
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: You're right.
text: A British naval officer appears.
speaker_heading: OFFICER
dialog: Excuse me, Major Boothroyd - the
dialog: message went to London.
dialog: Q
dialog: Thank you.
text: Q and Wade throw a glance back to the sea, then turn, waking off:
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Tell me, Q-ster. You do ever do any
dialog: gardening?
dialog: Q
dialog: ...The only thing I ever planted was
dialog: bugs.
text: CLOSE ON A PICTURE OF HARMSWAY ON A VIDEO SCREEN -
text: On the wall behind M's DESK. It's night. Moneypenny sits across

scene_heading: RETURN ON THE DINGHY -
text: Bond and Sidney break off a kiss. She lies nestled in his arms.
speaker_heading: SIDNEY
dialog: James... Is this really what a
dialog: typical day is like for you?
text: Bond replies with a wry smile:
speaker_heading: BOND
dialog: Yes...
dialog: (pause)
dialog: But some days... Are longer than
dialog: others.
text: And with this, he reaches up over his head, and pulls a tarp over the
dialog: two of them...
text: And the camera pulls back, and up, rising into the air to reveal:
text: The entire British Navy closing in on them from all points of the
dialog: compass.
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog: (save for one last line:)
dialog: James Bond will return.
