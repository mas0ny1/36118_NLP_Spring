speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: You need a new stopper.
speaker_heading: MR MARTINEZ
dialog: Oh is that it?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: See how it’s rotted around the
dialog: edges? It doesn’t make a seal, so
text: the water drips into the bowl. I
dialog: can bring you a new one tomorrow,
dialog: or you might want to consider
text: replacing the whole apparatus.
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: What do you recommend?
text: Lee starts putting away his tools and cleaning up.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Well, I could replace the stopper
dialog: first, and if that doesn’t work,
dialog: then I would come back and replace
dialog: the whole apparatus.
speaker_heading: MARTINEZ
dialog: But you don’t have a professional

speaker_heading: LEE

dialog: with my handyman. Is that sick? ...
dialog: Have you ever had a sexual fantasy
dialog: about your handyman? ... Well, it's
dialog: awkward because he is literally
dialog: like, cleaning the shit out of my
dialog: toilet bowl right now. And I don't
dialog: think I'm at my most alluring ...
dialog: Yeah, maybe you're right. It's not
dialog: like I met him socially ... Okay

speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN
dialog: How many times do we have to fix
dialog: these fucking pipes? Every time I
dialog: take a shower their entire

dialog: me insane.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I'll bring the plumber tomorrow but
dialog: I’d say we’re gonna have to break

dialog: the leak, because there was quite a
dialog: lot of water --
speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN
dialog: But how do you know it’s me? Why is
dialog: it automatically me?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Because if it was coming from
dialog: higher up you’d have water damage
dialog: on the ceiling too, and maybe in
dialog: your wall, and it’s all dry.
dialog: Lee looks
speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN
dialog: Great.
text: at the bathtub.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: It might just be the caulking. This

dialog: Did you take a bath or shower in

speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN
dialog: Yes...
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Well, it could actually just be
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN
dialog: OK. And how are you planning to

speaker_heading: LEE

speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN
dialog: You want me to take a shower now?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN
dialog: You want me to take a shower while

text: the water drips down into the
dialog: Friedrich’s apartment?
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: I don’t really give a fuck what you
dialog: do, Mrs. Olsen. I just want to find

speaker_heading: MRS OLSEN

text: He’s pretty drunk by now. He is looking at two BUSINESSMEN,

speaker_heading: LEE

scene_heading: EXT. LEE’S STREET. DAY.
text: It’s snowing. Lots of slow, heavy flakes, very pretty.
scene_heading: EXT. LEE’S BUILDING -- WINTER. DAY.
text: Lee is shoveling snow. The air is clear and cold. The whole

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Hello ... This is Lee ... Oh...
dialog: When did that happen? ... Well, how
dialog: is he? ... OK. Uh...No. Don’t do
dialog: that. I’1l come up right now ...

scene_heading: INT. LEE’S CAR (MOVING). DAY.
text: Lee sits behind the wheel, trying to get out of Boston and

dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. BEVERLY HOSPITAL. DAY.
text: We lead/follow Lee as he walks quickly through the halls
text: toward the ICU, easily navigating the twists and turns from
text: habit. He goes into the ICU --
scene_heading: INT. ICU -- NURSE’S STATION -- CONTINUOUS. DAY.
text: -- and approaches GEORGE, around 50, a big weatherbeaten guy,
text: and NURSE IRENE, 40s. They both react as Lee approaches.
speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Is he dead?

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: NURSE IRENE
dialog: I’m so sorry.

speaker_heading: GEORGE

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: DR MULLER
dialog: Well, you know his heart was very

speaker_heading: LEE

dialog: thoroughly well-meaning and decent.
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY
dialog: The disease is commonly referred to
dialog: as congestive heart failure --
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Oh my God!
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY
dialog: Are you familiar with it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No...!
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Then what are you sayin’ “Oh my
dialog: God” for?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Because what is it?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: She's tryin’ to explain it to us,
dialog: honey. I’m sorry, Dr Beth...uh...
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY

speaker_heading: JOE DR BETHENY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I can never get it Don’t worry about it. Not a

speaker_heading: JOE LEE
dialog: It’s Dr Betheny, Dad. Dr Betheny, Daddy, try to get

speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It’s a comedy routine!
speaker_heading: JOE STAN
dialog: Would you let her tell it? Elise, please...
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Oh my God: When am I gonna put one

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: ELISE

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Daddy...
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: What? She's fine. We're all upset.
dialog: We're all gonna listen, then we're
dialog: gonna ask everything we wanna ask,
dialog: and then we’re gonna figure out
dialog: what do to, together. Right?
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY
dialog: It's a gradual deterioration of the
dialog: muscles of the heart. It’s usually
dialog: associated with older people, but
dialog: in rarer cases it will occur ina
dialog: younger person. Some people can
dialog: live as long as fifty or sixty
dialog: years with just an occasional
dialog: attack. But most people suffer
dialog: periodic episodes, like the one you
dialog: had on Monday, which mimic the
text: symptoms of a heart attack and
dialog: which further weaken the muscle.
dialog: They can put you out of commission
dialog: for a week, two weeks. And you’1l
dialog: need to be hospitalized so we can
dialog: monitor your heart, because the
dialog: risk of cardiac arrest is elevated
dialog: for a week or two.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: STAN
dialog: (Pats her hand)
dialog: K..-OK...
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY
dialog: But in between these episodes, most
dialog: people feel perfectly healthy and
dialog: you can basically live a normal
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So...What do you mean that some
dialog: people live as long as fifty or
dialog: sixty years? You mean total? Or
dialog: from when they're diagnosed with
dialog: this, or what? And tell me the
dialog: fuckin’ truth.
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY
dialog: Total.
text: Everyone is stunned into silence, even Elise.
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY (CONT’D)
dialog: For approximately eighty percent of
dialog: patients your age the most common
dialog: statistical life expectancy is five
dialog: years or less.
text: Elise grips Stan’s hand. Lee looks at the floor.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY
dialog: But the statistics vary widely, and
dialog: they’re just statistics. You’re not
dialog: a statistic, you’re just one
dialog: person, and we don't know what’s
dialog: going to happen to you yet. But
dialog: it’s not a good disease.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What’s a good disease?
speaker_heading: DR BETHENY

text: They are bringing and loading THREE COVERED STRETCHERS

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: 1ST DETECTIVE
dialog: OK. Go on.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: Anyway, our bedroom’s in the
text: downstairs. The girls sleep
dialog: upstairs. So Randi makes everybody
dialog: leave around two o’clock, maybe
text: three AM, and she went back to bed.
dialog: So everybody leaves, and I go
dialog: inside. And it’s really cold
dialog: inside, so I go check on the girls,
dialog: and it’s fuckin’ freezing up there.
dialog: We sleep downstairs. The girls
dialog: sleep in the upstairs. But Randi
dialog: doesn’t like the central heat
dialog: because it dries her out her
dialog: sinuses, and she gets these
dialog: headaches. So I went downstairs and
text: built a fire in the fireplace, and
text: I sit down to watch TV, except
dialog: there’s no more beer. And I’m still
dialog: jumpin’ like a jackrabbit. So I put
text: a couple big logs on the fire so
dialog: the house would warm up when I was
dialog: gone, and I went to the mini-
dialog: mart...It’s about a fifteen minute
dialog: walk both ways. But I didn’t wanna
dialog: drive cause I was really wasted.
dialog: And I’m halfway there, and I
dialog: remember I didn’t put the screen
dialog: back on the fireplace. But I figure
dialog: it’s probably OK. So I kept going
dialog: to the store. And that’s it. One of
dialog: the logs musta rolled out on the
dialog: floor when I was gone. The girls
dialog: were all upstairs... And that’s it.
text: The firemen got Randi out. She was
text: passed out downstairs. And then
dialog: they said the furnace blew, and
dialog: they couldn’t go inside again. And
dialog: that’s all I remember.

speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: What do you mean? That’s it?
speaker_heading: FIRE MARSHALL
dialog: Look, Lee: You made a horrible
dialog: mistake. Like a million other
dialog: people did last night. But we don’t
dialog: wanna crucify you. It’s not a crime
dialog: to leave the screen off the
dialog: fireplace.
speaker_heading: LEE
dialog: So...What? I can go?
