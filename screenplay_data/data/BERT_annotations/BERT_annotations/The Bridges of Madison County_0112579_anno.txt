scene_heading: EXT. JOHNSON FARMHOUSE - DAY
text: CAROLYN, mid-40s, is standing in the doorway of the
text: farmhouse watching a car drive up the road towards her.
text: A LAWYER is unloading a briefcase from the trunk of his
dialog: car.
text: As the car approaches, Carolyn smiles. She steps out of
text: the doorway and heads for the car, out of which exit her
text: brother MICHAEL and his country girl wife BETTY, a stout
text: buxom chatterbox. Both boast Florida tans and fashion
dialog: styles.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Carolyn)
dialog: Explain to me again why we didn't
dialog: do this in Des Moines in an air
dialog: conditioned office?
speaker_heading: —~ CAROLYN
dialog: Mom's orders.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Is that the lawyer?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (nods)
dialog: I have some sandwich fixings if
dialog: you're hungry.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (proudly)
dialog: No, we just had lunch at the hotel
dialog: with my brother and his new wife.
dialog: She told me all the dirt. I.
dialog: forgot how interesting things can
dialog: get around here. It was so good
dialog: to see them. The last time we
dialog: visited they were in Europe. He
dialog: is doing so well. He ordered
dialog: champagne. For lunch! I nearly
dialog: died.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I nearly died when I had to pick
dialog: up the check.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: Michael doesn't understand.
dialog: People who make the kind of money
dialog: my brother makes don't carry money
dialog: on them. They keep it all in
dialog: various accounts.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Then we should have had lunch at
dialog: the bank.
text: Carolyn tries not to laugh. Betty shoots him a dirty
text: look, then stops take in the house and its surroundings.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Boy. It sure has been a long
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (correcting her)
dialog: We were here two Christmases ago.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, that's a long time.
speaker_heading: : MICHAEL
dialog: It's not that long.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (suddenly upset )
dialog: Well why don't I just say black so
dialog: you can say white!
dialog: (to Carolyn)
dialog: Don't be surprised to find your
dialog: brother hasn't changed an iota.
dialog: He hardly ever talks and when he
dialog: does it’s in that tone! You
dialog: should have heard him at lunch --
dialog: not two words until the bill came
dialog: and then he says, ‘Worth every
dialog: penny.’
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: So!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (angry)
dialog: i i onet Like
dialog: you were angry at me, at my
dialog: brother, at the world for forcing
dialog: you to eat a nice lunch!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, Jesus.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: I simply cannot stand that tone!
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (sympathetically)
dialog: Come inside. You're just tired
dialog: from the trip. :
text: She comforts Betty, who indulges in the attention.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I’ am so sick and tired of
text: apologizing and not knowing what
dialog: I've done!
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: I'm sure you haven't done
dialog: anything. Have some iced tea.
dialog: How are the kids? .
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: We dropped them off with Betty's
dialog: mom. Where's Steve?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (uncomfortably)
text: He's not coming.
text: Betty suddenly stops crying and abrasively focuses on
dialog: Carolyn's problems.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Aw, is he still cheating on you,
dialog: hon?
text: Carolyn suddenly loses sympathy for her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: LAWYER (CONT'D)
dialog: (as Michael does)
dialog: And this one, which clears the
dialog: bank of all further responsibility
dialog: for the contents.
text: Betty whispers to Carolyn.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: This is kind of exciting. You
dialog: think we'll find out your mother
dialog: had secret millions lying around?
text: Carolyn smiles weakly. Michael hands back the papers.
speaker_heading: ee LAWYER
dialog: All right. Why don't we begin?
text: He takes out Francesca'’s Last Will and Testament.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Your mother has been interred at
dialog: Cedar Heights Funeral Home until
dialog: arrangements can be made.
speaker_heading: - MICHAEL
dialog: (to Carolyn)
dialog: I thought everything was arranged.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Well, there's a problem.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What problem?
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Your mother left explicit
dialog: instructions that she wished to be
dialog: cremated,
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Cremated?!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Eeeww!
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: I know. I don't understand it
dialog: either.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: When did she decide this?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: (reading will)
text: Apparently just before her death.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, that's crazy. I don’t know
dialog: anybody who gets cremated.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Lots of people do.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, no one in my family did! Dad
dialog: bought cemetery plots at Prairie
dialog: Hills. One for him, one for Mom.
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: It clearly states in the will --
speaker_heading: . MICHAEL
dialog: I don't care what it says! Maybe
dialog: Mom was delirious, you know. She
dialog: didn't know what she was saying.
dialog: If she wanted to be cremated, why
dialog: the hell did she let Dad buy two
dialog: plots, huh?
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Well, she was very specific. She
dialog: wanted her ashes to be thrown off
dialog: Roseman Bridge.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: How bizarre!
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Mr. Peterson, are you sure Mom
dialog: wrote all this?
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Well, it was notarized and
text: witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney.
dialog: Maybe you can ask her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mom
dialog: told me years ago she died.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 2a
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3) 2
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, I don't care if it's legal or
dialog: not, we're not cremating her and
text: throwing her off some bridge where
dialog: we can't even go visit her because
dialog: she's going to be blown all over
text: the place like an ashtray.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Not to mention people driving over
text: her and doggies doing their
dialog: business -- °
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (interrupting) .
dialog: We're not doing it! I'm not even
dialog: sure it's Christian.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Maybe it's an Italian thing.
dialog: (to Lawyer) .
dialog: Their mother was Italian.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Doesn't matter. Move on.
text: The women dare not object. The lawyer raises his
dialog: eyebrows and continues:
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: Well, we'll come back to that.
dialog: Shall we open the box?
speaker_heading: JUMP CUT TO:
scene_heading: SAME SCENE - CLOSE ON SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX - MOMENTS 2A
speaker_heading: LATER .
text: A key is inserted and the lid is opened. There are many
text: papers, deeds, etc. Michael begins sorting through these.
text: Carolyn notices a manila envelope addressed to her mother,
text: postmarked 1965. She opens it up to find two letters and
text: a photograph -- Francesca standing near a covered bridge,
text: her hair wind-blown, her expression serene, beautiful and
dialog: sad.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Michael, look -- I've never seen
dialog: this picture of Mom, have you?
text: Betty and Michael look over her shoulder. He shakes "no."
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 2A
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: 2A
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: It was in this envelope from 1965.
speaker_heading: BETTY
text: She's not wearing a bra.
dialog: (takes bridge photo)
dialog: This is Holliwell Bridge, in case
dialog: anyone's interested.
text: Interested, yes, but no one thinks anything of it.
text: Michael returns to the other papers. Betty takes the
text: photograph for further examination. Carolyn opens one
text: of the letters and begins to read.
text: The following dialogue is heard 0.S., as CAMERA ANGLES
text: ON Carolyn reading one of the letters:
speaker_heading: BETTY (0.S.)
text: It's a beautiful picture of her.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (0.S.)
dialog: (to Lawyer)
dialog: Why are there two deeds here?
speaker_heading: LAWYER (0.S.)
dialog: One is for the original parcel
dialog: your father bought and this one is
dialog: for the additional acres he
dialog: purchased in '59.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL (0.S.)
dialog: And this?
speaker_heading: LAWYER (0.S.)
dialog: Those are bills of sale from the
dialog: equipment your mother sold in...
text: Their conversation continues 0.S. Throughout their
text: conversation, we FOCUS ON Carolyn as she reads and
text: her expression sinks into one of shock and confusion.
text: She flips to the last page of the letter to read who
text: it is from. She can't believe her eyes.
speaker_heading: BETTY (0.S.)
dialog: What's that?
text: Carolyn. jumps a little, so engrossed in her discovery.
text: She lies.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Oh, just an old letter from a
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2) 2A
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: No treasure maps, huh?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (laughs nervously)
dialog: No.
text: Betty starts inspecting knick-knacks around the house she
text: might be able to take. Carolyn looks to Michael.
speaker_heading: . CAROLYN
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (reading documents)
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Michael.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: What !?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Come here a minute.
text: Michael crosses impatiently to Carolyn. Carolyn looks
text: around to the others, then guides him 0.S. into the
text: kitchen for privacy. He protests.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What? Where are we going?
text: They exit. Alone with the impatient Lawyer, Betty
text: examines a vase as she pumps him for info.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Did she say anything in there
dialog: about me? Leaving me anything in
dialog: particular?
speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: No.
text: Betty prattles on as she examines each item, much to the
text: Lawyer's dismay, hiding her resentment and hurt.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 2a
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: (3) 2a
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I didn't expect so. She never
dialog: liked me. It's okay. I always
dialog: knew. Thought we married too
dialog: young. Nobody broke his arm --
dialog: that's what I said, but you know
dialog: mothers and sons. Also, she
dialog: never liked the fact of us moving
dialog: to Florida although that's where
dialog: the opportunities were. Couldn't
dialog: deny that. Suppose we should have
dialog: visited more but you know she
dialog: hardly ever made an effort to come
dialog: to Tampa. Not even to see her
dialog: grandchildren. She was a cold
dialog: woman. They say Italians are hot
dialog: blooded but not her. She was ~
text: cool as ice.
dialog: (picks up a
dialog: candlestick)
dialog: She leave these to anyone?
text: Michael and Carolyn reenter the living room. Michael's
text: expression now matches Carolyn in disbelief.
dialog: Grateful,
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Um... we were just wondering how
dialog: it might be better if Carolyn and
dialog: I went over the stuff by
dialog: ourselves. Not keep you two
dialog: waiting around. I'11l contact your
dialog: office about the legal work.
text: the Lawyer packs up to leave.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: I don't mind waiting.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Well, there's a lot of boring
dialog: stuff to do. Lists of people we
dialog: have to write to. Find Mom's
dialog: relatives' addresses in Italy --
dialog: stuff like that.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Well, I can help.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I said no!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: 2A
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: CONTINUED: (4) 24
text: That came out a bit aggressively. Betty is hurt.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why don't you go to your mother's?
dialog: Or back to the hotel. Sit in some
dialog: air conditioning. Take a bath.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: (near tears)
dialog: I do not need instructions from
dialog: you to bathe!
dialog: (gets her bag)
dialog: I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd
dialog: come all the way here and be shut
dialog: out as usual! I came to be here
dialog: for you! I didn't have to come!
dialog: (genuinely hurt)
dialog: Lord knows I was never much
dialog: welcome in this house before.
dialog: Apparently dead-or alive,
dialog: nothing's changed.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Aw, Betty.
text: Carolyn feels badly for her. An impatient Michael
text: refuses sympathy. Embarrassed, Betty starts to exit,
text: then stops at the mantle.
speaker_heading: BETTY
dialog: Carolyn -- you want these
dialog: candlesticks?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: No. I'd like you to have them.
text: Betty grabs them both and exits. Carolyn looks at
text: him disapprovingly. Michael takes the letter from her
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Now what's this about?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER 3
text: Sitting at the kitchen table, Carolyn is in the middle of
text: reading the letter to Michael.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: il.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: '... going over and over in my
dialog: mind every detail, every moment of
dialog: our time together and I ask

dialog: it together in a way that allows
dialog: me to continue knowing we're on
text: Separate roads. But then I look
text: through the lens of my camera, and
dialog: you're there. I start to write an
dialog: article and I find myself writing
dialog: it to you. It's clear to me now we

dialog: lives --'
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (rises)
dialog: I don't want to hear anymore!
dialog: Burn the damn thing! I don't want
dialog: to hear it! Throw it away!
text: Carolyn continues reading silently. Michael's curiosity
dialog: gets the best of him.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What's he saying now?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Well, he just goes on about how if
dialog: Mom ever needed him, she could
dialog: find him through the National
dialog: Geographic Magazine in Washington,
dialog: D.C. He was a photographer. He
dialog: promises not to write again. Then
dialog: all it says is...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I love you... Robert.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Robert! Jesus! I'11 kill him.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: That would be some trick. He's
dialog: already dead. That's what this
dialog: other letter is.
dialog: (takes letter and
dialog: skims )
dialog: From his attorney. He left most
dialog: of his things to Mom and
dialog: requested...
text: She stops.

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: : CAROLYN
dialog: That he be cremated and his ashes
text: thrown off Roseman Bridge.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: amn him! I knew Mom wouldn't
dialog: have thought of that herself. It
dialog: was some damn perverted...
dialog: photographic mind influencing her!
dialog: When did the bastard die?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: "82.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Wait a minute! That was three
dialog: years after Daddy. Do you
dialog: think...?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: I don't know. I'm completely in
dialog: the dark here. That's what I get
dialog: for moving away.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: This happened way before we both
dialog: got married. I... I can't
dialog: believe it.
dialog: (then, innocently)
dialog: You think she had sex with him?
dialog: Carolyn cannot believe he is this dense.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: My Lord. It must feel real nice
dialog: living inside your head with
text: Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Don't talk to me like that. She

speaker_heading: CAROLYN

dialog: week. How could she do that?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: How did she meet him? Did Dad
dialog: know? Anything else in that
dialog: envelope?
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: No, I don't think so. I --
text: She dumps it over and a small key falls out. Pause, as
text: Carolyn and Michael look to each other -- they grab the
text: key and run out of the kitchen, almost comically falling
dialog: ever each other in their obsession to put this puzzle
dialog: together.
scene_heading: SERIES OF JUMP CUTS 3A
text: FROM one lock TO another as they try to find the keyhole
dialog: that fits the key -- they try closets, attic doors,
text: jewelry boxes, night tables, vanity drawers... Finally --
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY 4
text: At the foot of their parents’ bed sits a walnut hope
text: chest, covered with a tapestry. Michael and Carolyn
text: look to each other first, before one removes the
text: tapestry and the other tries the key. It fits. They
dialog: open the chest to find:
text: Camera equipment, a chain with a medallion that reads
text: "FRANCESCA," three leather bound notebooks -- and a
text: sealed envelope with "Carolyn or Michael" written on it.
scene_heading: CAROLYN/MICHAEL
dialog: You read it!
text: Carolyn relents. She takes out the letter and reads:
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: "January, 1987. Dear Carolyn. I
dialog: hope you're reading this with
dialog: Michael. I'm sure he wouldn't be
dialog: able to read it by himself and
dialog: he'll need some help understanding
dialog: all this.’
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Insulted, Michael pulls the letter out of her hand and
text: defiantly attempts to read it aloud himself to disprove
text: his mother's claim. But after looking at a few lines,
text: he surrenders and hands the letter back to his sister.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: "First, and most of all, I love
dialog: you both very much and although I
dialog: feel fine, I thought it was time
dialog: to put my affairs, excuse that
dialog: word, in order.'
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I can't believe she's making
dialog: jokes.
speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: Sshhh. ‘After going through the
dialog: safety deposit box, I'm sure
dialog: you'll find your way to this
dialog: letter. It's hard to write this
dialog: to my own children. I could let
dialog: this die with the rest of me I
dialog: Suppose. But as one gets older,
dialog: one's fears subside. What |
dialog: becomes more and more important
dialog: is to be known -- known for all
dialog: -that you were during this brief
dialog: stay. How sad it seems to me
dialog: to leave this Earth without those
dialog: you love the most ever really
dialog: knowing who you were. It's easy
dialog: for a mother to love her children
dialog: no matter what -- it's something
dialog: that just happens. I don't know
dialog: if it's as simple for children.
dialog: You're all so busy being angry
dialog: at us for raising you wrong. But

dialog: That's it!

speaker_heading: CAROLYN
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: This is crazy. She waits ‘til

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: FRANCESCA
dialog: Michael, what did I tell you
dialog: about that door?
text: Richard enters after Michael, letting the door slam the
text: same way. Francesca is about to say something, but gives
dialog: up.
text: Carolyn enters and crosses to the kitchen RADIO. Leaning
text: on the counter, she turns the dial to a COUNTRY station.
text: This clearly irritates Francesca, but she knows there is
dialog: no point in arguing. ~
text: Everyone sits and begins eating -- in complete silence
dialog: except for the song.
text: When Michael can't open the ketchup bottle, Francesca
text: grabs it, palms the top skillfully and twists it off.
text: She hands it back to Michael, who makes no comment.
text: When Richard scans the table for something that obviously
text: isn't there, Francesca is up out of her seat before he
text: can ask, at the fridge, grabbing the sour cream, closing
text: the fridge and back at the table with incredible
dialog: swiftness.
text: When Michael moves his big arm to reach for the salt, he
text: knocks over his cup and saucer, which Francesca catches
text: with both hands before they hit the floor. Her reflexes
dialog: are like a trained athlete.
text: Finally, Francesca is able to sit and sip her coffee.
text: She watches her teenage daughter fill her plate with a
text: blank expression that lets nothing slip through -- no
text: indication of all the tempests of emotions that go
text: through a teenage girl.
speaker_heading: FRANCE“SCA
dialog: You excited about going, Carolyn?
text: Without looking up, Carolyn fakes a smile. Francesca

text: She crosses to the hi-fi and looks through several albums

text: Suddenly, the more distant the house becomes, the more
