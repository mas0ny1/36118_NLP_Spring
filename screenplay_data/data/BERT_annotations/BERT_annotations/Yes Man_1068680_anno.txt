dialog: 
text: It's New Year's Eve at Rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive.
text: People stream into the bar to celebrate. Outside, CARL
text: KENDALL (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend KATH are
text: having a quiet intense discussion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATH
dialog: You don't do anything more. You
dialog: used to be fun. Now you hardly
dialog: ever even leave your apartment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm here, aren't I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATH
dialog: That's because it's New Year's Eve.
dialog: You have to be here. Besides, it's
dialog: not only social stuff. You used to
dialog: have dreams. You wanted to go to
dialog: business school, you wanted to work
dialog: for the World Bank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: So I discovered b-school's not for
dialog: me. People grow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATH
dialog: Growing is "X is not for me so I'll
dialog: do Y." You went X is not for me
dialog: and so I guess I'll sit on the
dialog: couch for the rest of my life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
speaker_heading: (ACQUIESCING)
dialog: Well, look, this sucks, but I
dialog: understand where you're coming
dialog: from.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATH
dialog: This is the problem. You don't
dialog: even care that I'm breaking up with
dialog: you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Of course I care. But I also
dialog: understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATH
dialog: You shouldn't just understand. You
text: should be mad. Or upset. Or sad.
dialog: Or something.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We're at different places in our
dialog: lives. I get it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATH
dialog: Your girlfriend of two years breaks
dialog: up with you right before New Year's
dialog: Eve and all you can say is "I get
dialog: it?" It is completely within your
dialog: right to call me a bitch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: That would be inappropriate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATH
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: I can't believe I've been dating

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Rooney might throw up.

scene_heading: INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOBBY

speaker_heading: BANK CUSTOMER
dialog: Hey, I need to speak to a loan

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Sorry. Today I'm officially a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK CUSTOMER
text: But there's no one around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Someone might come. And if I'm not

dialog: 
speaker_heading: BANK CUSTOMER
dialog: You're really not going to help me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Until I'm relieved as a greeter, my
text: hands are tied.
dialog: 
text: The Bank Customer sits down in the sectioned off waiting area
text: as Carl stands in the middle of the floor. It is very
text: awkward. No one comes in. Carl slowly moves so a column
text: blocks the customer's view of him.
dialog: 
text: Now that Carl's behind the column, he has a clear view of the
text: entrance of the bank. Through the floor to ceiling windows,
text: he sees the handsome NEW PRESIDENT OF SOUTHWEST BANK, CHRIS
text: PARKER, tear up in a Mercedes. He steps out of the Mercedes
text: with a hot girl on his arm. He and the girl walk into the

speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: Definitely.

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (clearly jealous)

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What's wrong with Crate and Barrel?
dialog: They have adorable stuff at

speaker_heading: CARL

dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Lifestyle? You have to have a life
dialog: to have a style of life. You never

dialog: I hate meeting people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You've become a complete cave

speaker_heading: CARL

dialog: other day, we all went to
dialog: Summerfest and snuck backstage and
dialog: you bet me I wouldn't steal
dialog: something and so I stole a

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just the other day? That was seven

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: But that's not possible -- I was
text: already working at the bank by

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You had started there three years
dialog: earlier. Why you've worked at that

dialog: shouldn't be a teller. You should
dialog: be the guy who tells the guy who
text: tells the teller what to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
speaker_heading: (SHOCKED)
dialog: I've been a teller at Southwest

dialog: 
text: Carl looks around. Everyone is nodding along with it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI (cont'd)
dialog: From the external. And the

speaker_heading: SANJI (cont'd)

speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: Come on up, Future Yes Man!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: That's OK. I'm just auditing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: You can't audit life! Now get on
dialog: up here!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm cool right here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: Then I will come to you!
dialog:

speaker_heading: SANJI (cont'd)
dialog: What is your name?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Carl.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: Let me guess, Carl. This was not
dialog: your idea to come here, Carl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I wouldn't say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: You can tell me, Carl. We are all
dialog: alone, Carl.
dialog: 
text: The crowd laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It wasn't exactly my idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: That's what I thought, Carl. And
dialog: you think this is all bullshit,
dialog: Carl, isn't that right, Carl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Honestly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: Is there any other way?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: This whole thing seems retarded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: But you are stuck in your life,
dialog: Carl? Am I right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I wouldn't necessarily --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: You once had a dream? You wanted
dialog: to own a boat? A house? A fancy
dialog: car? You wanted to a doctor, a
dialog: lawyer... a business man?
dialog: 
text: Carl nods, surprised at Sanji's incisiveness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI (cont'd)
dialog: You wanted to be more than you are.
dialog: And yet you have suddenly woken up
dialog: to find life is passing you by. Am
dialog: I right, Carl?
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sanji's suddenly getting to Carl. As Sanji talks to him, the
text: moment between them becomes more and more intimate. It
text: should feel like the rest of the crowd has disappeared.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: A little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: It's odd that ten years can pass
dialog: just like that.

speaker_heading: SANJI (cont'd)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: It is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: I want you to do something for me,

dialog: For one day, Carl?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I'm not sure --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: Please, Carl. Do it for me and you
dialog: will be doing it for yourself. If
dialog: you don't have the best day in ten
dialog: years then I am the uncle of a
dialog: monkey. Will you do it for me
dialog: Carl? Just for a day?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Yes?

speaker_heading: CARL

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL

dialog: She only wants five.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I don't make the rules, I just
dialog: break `em.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I don't break them. I just wanted

speaker_heading: SANJI

speaker_heading: (EXPLAINING)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: (reading the document)
dialog: 3) If someone discovers you are a
dialog: yes man, you do not have to say yes
dialog: to them. 4) To avoid yes, you
dialog: cannot avoid contact. Therefore,
dialog: you must always answer your phone,
dialog: the door, your postal mail, your
dialog: email, etc and so on and so forth.
dialog: 5) You must choose a yesponsor to
dialog: keep you on the straight and
dialog: narrow.
dialog: (to Sanji)
dialog: Who should that be?
dialog: 
dialog: 43.

dialog:

dialog: (to Sanji)
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SANJI
dialog: If someone asks you "do you want to
dialog: go to the art museum" and you do
dialog: not want to, you may not use this
dialog: lack of desire as an excuse to not
dialog: go. And finally, a warning.
speaker_heading: (SPOOKILY)
dialog: If you say `no', even once, even
dialog: for a cup of coffee, be prepared to

dialog: you've gained.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: So what do you say, Carl?
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)

speaker_heading: CARL

speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: I'm not asking for sympathy. My
dialog: voice is way too high-pitched, my
dialog: pottery looks like poo, and my
text: photos are blurry and subjectless.

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: CARL

dialog: there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Because... it's actually not lame.
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: I just gave the answer I've

dialog: first time maybe ever. I started
dialog: this pilot program that gives out
dialog: microloans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RENEE
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Like say you need three hundred
dialog: bucks to pay for paint so you can
dialog: start a house painting business.
dialog: Rather than paying a loan shark who
dialog: charges you 300%, now you can come
dialog: to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS PARKER
dialog: How do you explain yourself?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I've started a microloan project.
dialog: I figure that if someone needs less
dialog: than ten grand why should they go
dialog: to a loan shark when they can come
dialog: to a legitimate banking
dialog: institution?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS PARKER
dialog: Because the paperwork makes any
dialog: profit moot. Unless you're raiding
dialog: our coffers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: No. I wouldn't do that.

speaker_heading: CHRIS PARKER

speaker_heading: CHRIS PARKER (cont'd)
dialog: But then I looked closer at the
dialog: numbers. 85% of the loan
dialog: recipients have been paying them
dialog: off according to the bank's
dialog: schedule. Not just that, but 72%
dialog: of that group have returned as
dialog: regular full loan customers. This
