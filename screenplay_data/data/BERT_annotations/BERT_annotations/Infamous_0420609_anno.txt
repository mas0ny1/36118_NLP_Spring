scene_heading: EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
text: The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty
text: Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At
text: the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The
text: girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting
text: in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs,
text: motions for her to go inside.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: The girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen,
text: the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the
text: open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS
text: She walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The
text: door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high
text: school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the
text: bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope,

scene_heading: INT. SMALL, PACKED NEW YORK APARTMENT/KITCHEN - LATER
text: The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot
dialog: of his book, and he says to me: the
dialog: writing's going well, but I just
dialog: want to make sure it's not one of
dialog: those problem novels. I said: Jimmy,
dialog: your novel's about a Negro homosexual
dialog: who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't
dialog: you call that a problem?
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: CHRISTOPHER
dialog: Susan's father had a minor heart
dialog: attack, so she's writing more erotic
dialog: poems about death and sex.
speaker_heading: BARBARA
dialog: It's so tiresome.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: Hmm. What rhymes with angina?
text: Laughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON
text: notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues
text: talking, we come closer, hear their conversation.
speaker_heading: GRAYSON
dialog: How's your writing?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Oh, I've got a million ideas of what
dialog: to write next -- I just have to choose
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: GRAYSON
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Too fat.
speaker_heading: BARBARA

scene_heading: EXT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE/BACK PATIO - MORNING

scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - DAY
text: C/U of article being snipped out of PAGE 39 of the Times,
text: November 16, 1959. As the page gets turned around with each

text: glasses, with the caption: "FOUND DEAD: Herbert W. Clutter,
text: a wealthy Kansas farmer..." We read the headline: "WEALTHY

scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: Truman on the phone, on a long cord, travels between the

text: of the room as he says each bit.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: ...never had anything like this happen

scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - CONTINUOUS
text: Truman opens the door. Inside the cabin his childhood friend
dialog: from Monroeville, Alabama, NELLE HARPER LEE (yes, that Harper

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: I figured you'd missed it.
text: Nelle is a year younger than Truman, dowdy in dress, but
text: smart, tough, sensible. Truman smiles.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: God I'm glad you agreed to come.
dialog: You're the only one I know with the

speaker_heading: PORTER #1

dialog: sir?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: That one up there and that one on

text: He tips them.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: What all did you bring?
speaker_heading: PORTER #2
dialog: Thank you greatly, sir. It's an honor

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You're sweet.
speaker_heading: PORTER #2
dialog: Just when you think they've gotten

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Thank you. You're very kind.
speaker_heading: PORTER #1

dialog: Ma'am.
text: The PORTERS leave. Nelle is stunned. Truman fiddles with the

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: You're pathetic.
text: Truman doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: You're pathetic.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: You paid them to say that.
text: Truman won't look at her. She whacks him.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: You paid them to say that!
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (squealing)
dialog: How'd you know? How did you know?!
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: "Just when you think they've gotten
dialog: as good as they can get."
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You think that was too much?
dialog: (laughter)
dialog: I thought that was a good line.
text: More laughter. More smacking of Truman. Then it is quiet.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Pathetic.
scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - MORNING

text: Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is
text: office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on
text: the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the
text: background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED
text: ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as:
speaker_heading: CHURCH
dialog: The wife said no more smoking in the
dialog: house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's

dialog: I'll stay with him and Dorothy till

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Mr. Dewey. Truman Capote from the

text: Silence. The Agents stare at him.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: NYE
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: NYE

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Thank you.

dialog: I wonder when we could arrange an

text: Dewey stubs out his cigarette.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: We're not looking for any inside
dialog: information -- I don't care one way
dialog: or another if you catch whoever did
dialog: this -- I'm writing an article not
dialog: about the Clutter killings, but how
dialog: they're affecting the town, how you
dialog: all are bearing up --
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I care.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I care.
text: (puts on his hat,
text: pulls out another

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Yes --
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: As do a lot of folks around here.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Of course.

dialog: New Yorker?
speaker_heading: CHURCH

speaker_heading: NYE
dialog: What's the New Yorker?
speaker_heading: CHURCH

text: Truman and Nelle stand in the back.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I'll talk facts but I won't speculate.
dialog: The main fact here we need to be
dialog: clear on is not one, but four people
dialog: were killed. A lot of folks say Herb
dialog: Clutter had to be the main target
dialog: because he was dealt with the most
dialog: brutally --
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #1
text: Had his throat cut.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (a moment)
dialog: Yes. We'd all like to know why. But
dialog: it could've been any one of the family
dialog: they were after. We just don't know --
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #2
dialog: You've identified the murder weapon?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: Wounds indicate a shotgun, close-
text: range, but no casings were found.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #1
dialog: Twelve-gauge, hunting --
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #1
dialog: They were all shot in the face?
text: Dewey looks at the journalist. Then, evenly:
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: No. Nancy in the back of the head.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #2
dialog: Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry,
dialog: sexual molestation of the women?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #2
dialog: Anything else stolen?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
text: Kenyon's radio seems to be the only...
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #3
dialog: The boy was sixteen?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #2
dialog: It's her friend that found them?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Laura Kinney.
speaker_heading: JOURNALIST #2
dialog: Spell that?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I assume you're okay with the Laura
scene_heading: part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave
dialog: her be.
dialog: Lots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself
dialog: heard above the rest:
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans,
dialog: a whole bunch of Mexicans...
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (standing, stubs out
dialog: cigarette)
dialog: George, it's good to see you again.
dialog: I do have an opinion whether this
dialog: was the work of one man or a whole
dialog: bunch, as you said, but it doesn't
dialog: matter a whole lot whether it was
dialog: Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.
dialog: We're going to find whoever did this.
dialog: Four good people from our community
dialog: are dead. Let's remember that. Okay
dialog: with you?
dialog: (holds up a notice)
dialog: The West Kansas Farm Committee's
dialog: offering a thousand dollar reward
dialog: for information leading to an arrest.
dialog: Please print that.
dialog: (moving to the exit)
dialog: Thank you all for coming.
text: The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Nelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back,

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Mr. Dewey's protective of the
dialog: Clutters. I wonder how well he knew
dialog: them...
text: Nelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: He was foxy with that old man.
dialog: (turns to Nelle)
dialog: Are you ever gonna let me drive?
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Truman, you're a menace. You can
text: barely see over the wheel.
text: Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: This make you miss Alabama?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (rolling window down,
dialog: shakes his head)
dialog: Not even a little bit.
text: He leans his head out, closes his eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET
text: Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which

speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
text: A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Hello.
text: Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up
text: to a group of THREE GIRLS.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Morning.
speaker_heading: GIRL #1
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Can any of you tell me where I'd

speaker_heading: GIRL #1
dialog: Oh, um...
text: The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY
text: (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall,
dialog: 17).
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Is that her? With the tall boy?
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: Yeah. With Danny Burke.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Danny Burke?
dialog: (Girl #2 nods)
dialog: Thank you.
text: As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend:
speaker_heading: GIRL #2
dialog: Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.
text: Nelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out --
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Truman. Truman --
text: Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura
text: backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman,
text: looks at him for several moments.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: These folks live their lives in a
dialog: particular way. You need to consider
dialog: adapting yourself to that fact.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: What --
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: -- I'm gonna find out where those

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET, GARDEN CITY - DAY

scene_heading: INT. GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: Warm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed
text: conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into
text: the back room.
scene_heading: INT. BACK ROOM, GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the
text: room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to
text: make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the
text: caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy-
text: blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of
text: white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance --
text: like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: He drinks, standing at the window.
speaker_heading: JACK (OVER PHONE)
dialog: I think I scared a friend of yours
dialog: this morning. He came looking for
dialog: you while I was writing.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You hate my friends.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I wouldn't say hate. So long as they
dialog: don't knock on my door.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I saw the bodies today.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Which?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: The Clutters. I looked inside the
text: coffins.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: That's horrifying.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: It comforts me -- something so
dialog: horrifying it's freeing. It's a
text: relief. Normal life falls away.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But, then, I was never much for normal
dialog: life --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: No, you weren't.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: People here won't talk to me. They
dialog: want someone like you, like Nelle.
dialog: Me they hate.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I can't think of a single quality I
dialog: share with Nelle.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Well --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe manliness.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: My point exactly.
speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That's why I ran off.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I've been getting a lot of that

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: It's fine talking to you all.

speaker_heading: NELLE
text: Folks have been through a rough patch.

speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: She was my best friend.
text: They're quiet for a few moments.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: How has Danny been?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible
dialog: ever happened to him before. Nancy
dialog: just started wearing his ring again
dialog: after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter
dialog: was trying to get her to end it 'cause
dialog: Danny's Catholic.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: What were the Clutters?
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Methodist. Danny was the last person
dialog: at the house that night. That's why
dialog: Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him --
dialog: they don't think he had anything to
dialog: do with it -- just to see if he
dialog: remembers anything unusual and all.
speaker_heading: NELLE
text: People in town seem to wonder if he
dialog: was involved.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: That's been real hard for Danny.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Oh, it's the hardest -- when people
dialog: have a notion about you and it's
dialog: impossible to convince them otherwise.
dialog: Since I was a child folks have thought
dialog: they had me pegged because of the
dialog: way I look and the way I talk. They're
dialog: always wrong.
dialog: (looks at her)
dialog: Do you know what I mean?
text: Laura stares at him and nods. He's clearly struck a chord.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: I want to show you something.
text: She goes in the door to the GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT. They see
text: her through the LACE CURTAINS getting something from her
text: DESK, which is stacked with books. Truman whispers to Nelle:
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Not one person here understands her.
text: Laura returns. She hugs a SMALL BOOK to her chest. After a
text: moment, she holds it out to them.
speaker_heading: LAURA
dialog: Maybe you'll get a better picture of

speaker_heading: NELLE

dialog: I hate that you're better than me at

text: She turns back to the typewriter. She types. Truman lies

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Don't you dare close your eyes on my

text: No answer. She keeps typing.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Stand up and walk out that door. Go

speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: INT. WALKER HOTEL, BREAKFAST ROOM - LATE MORNING
text: Truman drinks coffee alone, sleepy. He takes a SMALL BOTTLE

speaker_heading: NELLE

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: You know something -- Alvin pretends
dialog: he doesn't know who you are, but the
dialog: minute you came to town he read your
text: books. He had one of his men pick up
dialog: "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas
dialog: City 'cause it's banned from the
dialog: library here.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: What did Mr. Dewey think?
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: He liked it more than he's willing

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: How very foxy.
text: Marie smiles at that word used to describe her husband.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN

scene_heading: INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I was writing the script as they
dialog: were filming, all that time in Italy.
dialog: I'd work like mad all day long and
text: then dash down to the bar around
dialog: midnight to hand in the next day's

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (whispers to Alvin)
dialog: Humphrey Bogart.
dialog: Alvin knows.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: -- where he and John drank every

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (to Alvin)
dialog: John Huston.
dialog: Alvin knows.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: -- and I mean drank, like famished
dialog: water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only
dialog: just handed them the final scene
dialog: when the bellhop told me I had a
dialog: phone call. It was my stepfather,
dialog: Joe Capote, calling to say that my
dialog: mother had died. I flew home to New
text: York -- terribly distraught -- but
dialog: when I got to the apartment I could
dialog: see that Joe was in even worse shape
dialog: than I was. He grabbed my hands and
dialog: sat me down at the kitchen table,
dialog: and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about
dialog: anything, any subject in the world.
dialog: Don't worry whether it will interest
dialog: me or not. Just talk so I won't break
dialog: down." And I did. He couldn't bear
dialog: to be alone with his thoughts. It
dialog: was too painful.
text: It's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: It's been a hard couple weeks for
dialog: Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good
text: friends. From church.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Marie --
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: Oh come on, Alvin. These are good
dialog: people.
text: Finally, Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle.
scene_heading: INT. DEWEY HOME, STUDY - NIGHT
text: Alvin shows Truman and Nelle the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from the
text: Clutter murders. We see the four corpses, BOUND and SHOT,
text: the bloody footprints in the Clutter basement. Truman and
text: Nelle stare at the photos of Nancy and Kenyon. Then, quietly --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Who would put a pillow under the
dialog: boy's head just to shoot him? Why
dialog: would they tuck Nancy in?
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (surprised by the
dialog: insight)
dialog: I want to know the same thing.
text: Truman hands Nelle one of the photos. She looks at it --
speaker_heading: NELLE
text: Twisted notion of tenderness.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT

dialog: So many of my friends would love to

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: That'd be fine --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (to Dewey)
dialog: You don't have to worry. I'm not
dialog: going to write about this until
dialog: everything's over.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I'm not worried. I know what room

speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: (re the apples)
dialog: I'd of picked them up but I haven't

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: How long have you worked here?
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: 1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too,

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was
dialog: wonderful.
speaker_heading: HOLT
dialog: (ignoring this)
dialog: She had a hard job after what all
dialog: happened. Cleaning. I burned most of
dialog: the rest -- mattresses -- too far of

dialog: (then, looks at them)
dialog: I've asked around some -- if anyone's

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You're celebrating.

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Alright.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Right. I'll let you go.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: I had no idea what a homosexual was.
dialog: But I knew whatever they were, you

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (quickly, as if

speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I can't believe you got this whole

speaker_heading: ALVIN
dialog: Impressive.
text: He walks out. Silence.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: I'm sorry. He's upset.
dialog: (stubs out cigarette)
dialog: -- smoking three packs a day.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Two men did it. They know who. One
dialog: of them used to have a cellmate who
dialog: gave him up for the thousand dollar
dialog: reward. They passed through Kansas
dialog: City last week writing bad checks --
dialog: by the time Alvin's boys got up there

speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE, GARDEN CITY - LATE AFTERNOON
text: OVER BLACK SCREEN we hear the voice of a RADIO ANNOUNCER.
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...This is KERG radio, Garden City.
text: A friendly broadcast from a friendly
dialog: place. Our lead story:
text: Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.
text: FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front
text: seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people.
text: Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the
text: headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob."
text: The CAR RADIO is on.
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: ...newsmen from six states have joined
text: scores of Kansans as they await the
dialog: arrival of confessed killers Perry
dialog: Smith and Richard Hickock. KBI
text: officers have been driving the Clutter
dialog: family's brutal killers nonstop
dialog: from...
text: Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies;
dialog: ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists
text: INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom
text: of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as
text: we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a
text: MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in
text: an overcoat CRYING silently.
text: Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together
text: at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the
text: photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Hey.
text: We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A
text: CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to
text: the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the
text: lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens
text: the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers
text: get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and
text: lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.
text: Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence.
text: They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG,
text: ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American
text: Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As
text: he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as
text: if they are arthritic. Truman stares.
speaker_heading: MARIE
dialog: (whispers to Truman)
dialog: Motorcycle accident. He broke them
dialog: and they never healed right.
dialog: (Truman looks at her)
dialog: Alvin told me.
text: Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of
text: the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd.
text: His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look
text: at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the
text: steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) -
speaker_heading: MORNING
text: FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and

speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Truman Capote.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd
dialog: be left alone this morning by that
dialog: hard-working husband of yours.
dialog: (holds up bag)
dialog: So I have breakfast.
dialog: (holds up paper)
dialog: I have news.
dialog: (book)
dialog: And I have literature. My friend
dialog: Jack mailed me the book you wanted.
text: He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the
text: inscription inside.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: "For the maiden of the Midwest, the
dialog: priestess of the plains, the queen
dialog: of the kitchen: my first novel.
dialog: Truman."
text: It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of
text: it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily
text: on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: You're too much. Go on into the living
dialog: room, lemme grab that -- it's been
text: ringing all morning.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS
text: Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen;
text: to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy --
text: she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen.
text: On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the
text: cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)
text: Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his
text: head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth.
text: The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely
text: kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several
text: moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Oh. Truman. I meant in there.
dialog: (points to living
dialog: room)
dialog: I... um...
text: Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: It's the women's cell. It's hardly
dialog: ever used. But they wanted to, um,
dialog: separate... Please. Let's sit in the
dialog: living room. I'll set up in the living
dialog: room.
text: She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Come.
text: She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: They put you in the women's cell.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Among other indignities.
text: Perry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are
text: precisely enunciated.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Well... she's a good cook.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: She's scared of me.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I think so am I. A little bit.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Are you?
dialog: (a moment, then:)
dialog: You have any aspirin? My legs --
text: Dorothy's in the doorway.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Um. Truman? All set.
text: Truman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel.
text: The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the
text: defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their
text: aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).
text: Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at
text: the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece
text: of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a
text: LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (murmurs)
text: His feet don't touch the floor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TATE
dialog: In the matter of the State of Kansas
dialog: v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry
dialog: Edward Smith this Court has been
dialog: informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks --
dialog: that defendants wish to waive their
dialog: right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr.
dialog: Hickock, is that your wish?
text: Hickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Yessir. Yes.
text: Hickock sits. Truman whispers to Nelle --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Why are they doing that?
speaker_heading: JUDGE TATE
dialog: Mr. Smith.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (stands... then:)
dialog: I ask that the waiver be effectuated.
text: Judge Tate looks at him for a moment --
speaker_heading: JUDGE TATE
dialog: So noted.
dialog: (bangs gavel)
dialog: We're adjourned.
text: Crowd gets up. Much talk. Truman watches Perry and Dick
text: through the forest of bodies. They are led away in handcuffs.
text: Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things --
text: he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers. Truman
dialog: watches.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON
text: Truman knocks. He holds a PIE. Dorothy answers.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Mr. Capote.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (offers pie)
dialog: Madame Sanderson.
speaker_heading: DOROTHY
dialog: Is that for the two of us to share?
dialog: Or for me to eat alone while you
dialog: talk to our guest?
text: Truman is caught. He smiles.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
text: Truman sits near the bars of the cell. Perry draws on a scrap
text: of paper at the small table. Dorothy watches from the door
text: to the living room. The BOOK Truman gave to Dorothy lies on
text: the floor next to Perry's meticulously made bed.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Was it your choice to waive the
dialog: hearing?
text: Perry doesn't answer. Dorothy checks her watch, leaves. Truman
text: takes a bottle of BAYER ASPIRIN out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You still need some?
dialog: (Perry doesn't move)
dialog: Give me your hand.
text: Perry extends his hand through the bars. As Truman shakes
dialog: some aspirin into it --
speaker_heading: PERRY

speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: PERRY

speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Not much yet, but I know. I can sense

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: He's as short as I am. And almost as

text: Guests laugh.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Most people assume he's a monster. I

dialog: a different path -- by inventing an
dialog: entirely new kind of writing: the
dialog: non-fiction novel.
speaker_heading: REPORTER
dialog: You have a subject?
text: Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: On the night of November 14, two men
text: broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas
dialog: and murdered an entire family. Why
dialog: did they do that? It's been suggested
dialog: that this subject is tawdry -- it's
dialog: not worthy of literature. I disagree.
dialog: Two worlds exist in this country --
dialog: the quiet conservative life, and the
dialog: life of those two men -- the
text: underbelly, the criminally violent.
dialog: Those worlds converged that bloody
dialog: night. I spent the past three months
dialog: interviewing everyone in Kansas
dialog: touched by that violence. I spent
dialog: hours talking to the killers -- and
dialog: I'll spend more.
dialog: (waiter brings his
dialog: drink)
dialog: Researching this work has changed my
dialog: life, altered my point of view about
dialog: almost everything. I think those who
dialog: read it will be similarly affected.
dialog: (he sips)
dialog: Such a book can only be written by a

speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: JACK

speaker_heading: TRUMAN

text: Perry nods. Truman waits for more. It doesn't come.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: We're not so different as you might
dialog: think. I was abandoned repeatedly as

dialog: after night she'd lock me in the
dialog: hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch
dialog: and tell the staff not to let me out

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: What I can't decide is if you

text: Perry doesn't respond, then --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I'm sorry about your tie. They took
dialog: it away from me because we're all on

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I hope we're past that now. You had
dialog: me worried.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Be careful of Ricardo. I think he

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Alright --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: But he's naturally mendacious -- not
dialog: to be trusted -- if he had a hundred

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You wouldn't.

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I want to take your notebooks with

text: Perry hesitates.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: If I leave here without understanding
dialog: you, the world will always see you
dialog: as a monster. I don't want that -- I
dialog: don't see you that way.

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I tracked my father down in Alaska.
dialog: I was 14. One day I said to him,
dialog: "Mom's dead." I could see it. A week

text: There's an exclamation point on the
dialog: end of that thank you, in case you
dialog: didn't catch it...
dialog: (silence)
dialog: Where'd you go?
text: We hear Nelle exhale her cigarette.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Christ. I guess it stopped being

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I never said it was.

scene_heading: INT. DINER, DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY - MORNING
text: Truman is eating breakfast with Alvin Dewey. A WAITRESS
text: refills their coffees.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (to waitress)
dialog: Thanks.
text: She leaves. An uncomfortable silence. Then:
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: You're nothing if not hard-working.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You look good, healthy again.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Not a chance.
text: Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I've decided on a title for my book.
dialog: I think you'll like it -- very
text: masculine. "In Cold Blood."
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (lights the cigarette)
dialog: That refers to the crime or the fact
dialog: that you're still talking to the
dialog: criminals?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: The former, among other things.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I see.
text: They eat for a moment. Then:
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I've been wanting to ask if you'll
dialog: let me look at your investigation
dialog: notes.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: That lawyer you helped find for your
dialog: friends got them a hearing at the
dialog: Kansas Supreme Court --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I heard this morning.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: -- on the issue of inadequate counsel.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Alvin. Do you not want me to look at
dialog: your notes? You are permitted to say
dialog: no.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: (rises, takes out
dialog: wallet)
dialog: I'll tell you what: if those boys
dialog: get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to
dialog: hunt you down.
text: Truman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not. Dewey
text: puts money on the table.
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: I have to be in court at nine o'clock.
text: He walks away. Over his shoulder:
speaker_heading: DEWEY
dialog: Call Roy Church. He'll show you what
dialog: you want to see.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY
text: Truman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is
text: lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: Hey, hey...
text: Truman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past.
text: He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER)
text: is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT
text: swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments,
text: then Perry looks at him.
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER
text: The Guard locks Truman inside with Perry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Thank you.
text: Truman looks at the Guard -- he leaves.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: It was as much for me as for anyone.
dialog: I couldn't bear the thought of losing
dialog: you so soon.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: We're going to be able to use your
dialog: book for our case. You'll write we
dialog: never got to raise our insanity plea.
dialog: You wrote how terrible the lawyer
dialog: was?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I haven't written a word yet.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: What have you been doing?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Research. Waiting to talk to you.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: All right.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I had hoped --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: What are you calling it?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: The book?
dialog: (looks directly at
dialog: him)
dialog: I have no idea.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: If I'm going to write about you --
dialog: if I'm going to determine how to
dialog: write about you -- you need to tell
dialog: me about that night at the Clutter
dialog: house.
text: Perry just looks at him.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Perry.
text: Perry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Why? Do you worry what I'll think?
text: Perry looks away. A long moment.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Is that it?
dialog: Silence. Then:
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Dick says you know Elizabeth Taylor.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I know a lot of people.
text: Truman gives up for now. Sees the PICTURE OF THE YELLOW BIRD
text: on the desk.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: What is that you keep drawing?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You must hate having to come to this
dialog: place --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Perry, I have invitations to be in
dialog: Morocco, Greece... I choose to be
dialog: here. Those people have everything,
dialog: all their prayers have been answered,
dialog: yet they're more desperate than ever.
dialog: I prefer to be here with you.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (looks at Truman;
dialog: evenly)
dialog: I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns
dialog: at the orphanage hated the smell.
dialog: First month one of them found me
dialog: shivering -- just trying to get
text: through the night. The Sister pulled
text: back the covers and shined her
dialog: flashlight to see what I'd did. The
dialog: sheets were wet. She hit me so many
dialog: times with that flashlight she broke
dialog: it.
dialog: (he shrugs)
dialog: That night I dreamed about the yellow
text: bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It
dialog: picked me up and it clawed the Nun's
text: eyes and it lifted me into the sky.
text: They look at each other.
scene_heading: EXT. BAR, DOWNTOWN K.C. - NIGHT
text: Truman on the street outside the club at a PAY PHONE. He
text: talks with Jack in Brooklyn.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm just missing this one piece,
dialog: Jack. Be patient with me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: How long is that gonna take? Why
dialog: don't you try leaving him alone for
dialog: a while? Come to Spain. You can always
dialog: visit him later.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing
dialog: to do.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Too many people around.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll leave the address on the kitchen
dialog: table. Truman, what do you do there
dialog: when you're not with him? -- It must
dialog: be awful.
text: Truman's watching a YOUNG GUY standing outside the bar,
text: looking at him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Think about what I said. Join me
dialog: when you can.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I will. I will. Bye.
text: Truman follows the YOUNG GUY into the bar.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. KANSAS CITY - DAWN

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY
text: Perry is lying on his cot reading an ADVENTURE MAGAZINE --
dialog: something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast
text: of Mexico -- and sucking on the tip of his thumb. After a
text: moment he STARTLES and looks up.
text: Truman stands outside his cell. He holds a stack of books:
text: Perry's PERSONAL DICTIONARY and DIARY, and a new WEBSTER'S
scene_heading: DICTIONARY and THESAURUS.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I didn't see you. Jesus, you...
dialog: (stands, tucks in
dialog: shirt)
dialog: Come in. Where's the guard?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I can't. I brought you some things,
dialog: but I have to fly back East.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: An hour. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You can't.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Who are you going there to see --
speaker_heading: HICKOCK (O.S.)
dialog: (from next cell)
dialog: Capote, get it straight in your book --
dialog: we never intended on killing that
dialog: family --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I told him that.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK (O.S.)
dialog: No premeditation --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I told him!
text: Perry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman
text: to keep him there. Then, he stops. He has nothing left to
dialog: give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the
text: Clutters. He becomes very still. Truman speaks gently --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Your writings are magnificent. I
dialog: hope these help you do more.
text: No response. Truman places the books on the floor just outside
text: Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new
text: dictionaries in another right next to it.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I have so much material -- from the
dialog: trial, from our visits, your journals.
dialog: I have to organize it all, and I
dialog: have to start the process of writing.
dialog: (no response)
dialog: I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall.
dialog: (backing away)
dialog: I miss you already. Write me every
dialog: five minutes.
text: He turns and goes. We stay with Perry as Truman leaves. We
dialog: hear Dick speak to Truman.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK (O.S.)
dialog: Be good now.
text: Hear Truman's footsteps receding. Then, a long shot of the
text: hallway as the Guard lets Truman out the gate at the end of
text: the row. Silence.
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL
text: Perry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside
text: his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and
text: touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
text: Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then
dialog: passing.
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - DAY
text: FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand,
text: cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach.
scene_heading: EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: The house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman
text: pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to
text: the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks
text: up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then
text: Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in
text: the background, and starts to LAUGH.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
dialog: Title up: "January, 1962"
text: Sound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black.
scene_heading: EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: FADE IN on the peaceful outside of the house. Sound of TYPING.
scene_heading: INT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: More typing. A PHONE rings. CAMERA tracks slowly through the
text: pretty, tiled living room, toward a DOOR at the far end.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: Truman at his DESK, surrounded by piles of filled YELLOW
text: PADS, NOTE CARDS, an open TRUNK of random notes. He is at
text: the MANUAL TYPEWRITER. The phone is on the floor, ringing.
text: He types. The phone rings. Exasperated, he picks up.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: SHAWN (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Truman. I was supposed to be home
dialog: for dinner with my wife three hours
dialog: ago -- I have not been able to tear
dialog: myself away from your book. It's
dialog: that good. It's not good, it's
dialog: astonishing. This first half is
dialog: astonishing. If the second half lives
dialog: up to this it, -- it -- how much is
dialog: left to do?
text: INTERCUT with Shawn's OFFICE at the New Yorker, NIGHT. Shawn
text: has a stack of manuscript pages on his desk.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORKER, WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm already well into the third part,
dialog: but I -- I can't finish that till I
dialog: convince Perry to describe the night
dialog: of the killings to me. I was planning
dialog: to visit this fall, see --
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: I think you need to talk to him now.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: And we all need to see how this ends
dialog: for the final part. I can't finish
dialog: the book till I know what happens.
dialog: If Perry and Dick are executed it's
dialog: one thing -- and if not, well --
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Truman. You got your ending --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I really don't know --
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: The Kansas court denied their appeal.
dialog: It came over the wire on Friday. You
dialog: need to talk to Perry now. He'll be
dialog: dead by September. I'm sorry, I know
dialog: how much you've come to care about
dialog: him.
text: Truman is completely immobile.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Truman?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Right. Yes. Right.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: I want to set up a reading for you
dialog: in the fall, in New York. We'll build
dialog: some interest, and we'll publish in
dialog: the fall.
dialog: On Truman.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING
text: Truman at the stove watching his tea water heat up. Jack

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in
dialog: the house.
text: He takes one from the basket. Jack starts to unpack food.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Why aren't you working?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I knew you couldn't be depended on
dialog: to stock the kitchen.
text: Truman looks at him blankly.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What would we feed our famous guest?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.
text: He helps Jack put away the groceries. Then:
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (utterly nonchalant)
dialog: Plus -- I finished my novel yesterday.
text: Truman looks at Jack, smiles widely.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
text: Truman, Jack and Nelle. A BONFIRE, a wind-up Victrola playing
text: Ella Fitzgerald, bottles of wine. Jack and Nelle dance. Truman
text: toasts Jack drunkenly.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: My man, my hero, my talented... My
dialog: man...
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You said that.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You are the hardest worker, the most
dialog: unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes
text: by on her way to London to sell her
dialog: book which needs no selling, may a
dialog: little of her success rub off on
dialog: both of us.
text: Jack laughs.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Here, here!
text: Nelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him. The song
text: changes to a slow one. Jack and Truman dance sweetly together.
text: Nelle sits on the sand and watches.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING
text: Breakfast. Truman and Nelle are sitting -- Nelle has a small
text: envelope in her hand. Truman is obviously uncomfortable. As
text: Jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table:
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: (to Truman)
dialog: When was the last time you wrote
dialog: back to him?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: A letter for your boyfriend I was
dialog: asked to deliver.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: From Perry.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Let's have it.
text: Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads:
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: "Dear Friend Truman. Where are you?
dialog: Read this item in a medical
dialog: dictionary: "Death by hanging is
dialog: caused by asphyxia, by fracture of
dialog: the cervical vertebrae, by laceration
dialog: of the trachea." Not too comforting
dialog: as we lost our appeal. Missing you --
dialog: alone and desirous of your presence.
dialog: Your amigo, Perry."
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Mr. Shawn told me about the court
dialog: decision yesterday.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I was wondering why you were in such
dialog: a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's
dialog: not because I finished my little
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: That's a terrible thing to say.
text: Jack looks out at the ocean.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (to no one in
dialog: particular)
dialog: I used to write him all the time.
dialog: I've been so focused lately on the
dialog: book.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY
text: Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a
speaker_heading: waiting TAXI.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Jack says I'm using Perry, but he
dialog: also thinks I fell in love with him
dialog: when I was in Kansas. How both of
dialog: those things can be true is beyond
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Did you? Fall in love with him.
text: Silence as they load the bags into the trunk.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Truman? --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't know how to answer that...
dialog: It's as if Perry and I started life
dialog: in the same house. One day he stood
text: up and walked out the back door while
text: I walked out the front. With some
dialog: different choices, he's the man I
dialog: might have become.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Are you kidding me?
text: Truman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think
dialog: he's what I like about you best.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I'll see you at the reading in New
dialog: York.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: The sixteenth.
text: Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Truman. Honestly. Are you going back
dialog: to Kansas because you care about
dialog: Perry or because you need information
dialog: before he's killed?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Can't it be both?
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: No. I don't think it can be.
text: She drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up
text: toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the
text: bushes at the front gate.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY
text: A Guard walks down the corridor carrying a SINGLE FLOWER. He
text: delivers it to Perry, then walks off. Perry is confused. He
text: hears FOOTSTEPS approaching, but can't see who it is.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, buddy. Thanks.
text: More footsteps. CAMERA on Perry as the footsteps finally
text: arrive outside his cell. He's shocked.
text: REVERSE onto Truman, looking tanned, healthy, very blond. He
text: holds a STACK OF BOOKS with a BOW on top. He smiles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: LONG SHOT of dimly lit corridor, light spilling out from
text: each cell. A ROW GUARD walks the hall. We hear voices

text: SIX MORE GUARDS arrive at the top of the stairs. The ROW
text: GUARD walks over, unlocks the GATE to let them in.
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT
text: Perry is looking at the cover of a BOOK -- "WALDEN POND."
text: Other books sit next to Perry on the cot. Among them -- WILLA
scene_heading: CATHER's "MY ANTONIA", also "GREAT EXPECTATIONS" --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: What was he in jail for?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: They said it was not paying his taxes.
dialog: But really for being an outsider --
dialog: refusing to go along.
text: Perry nods, looks at the other books.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: You don't have to read any of these
dialog: if you don't want to. But I thought
dialog: you'd like something decent. You're
dialog: much too smart for adventure
dialog: magazines.
text: Through the bars of Perry's cell, we can see the SIX GUARDS
text: enter Lowell Lee Andrew's cell (diagonally across the
text: corridor). The ROW GUARD appears at Perry's cell.
speaker_heading: ROW GUARD
text: Lock-down while Lowell goes to

dialog: You want in or out?
text: Truman looks at Perry, then back to the Guard.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: In.

speaker_heading: LATER

scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER
text: Perry and Truman talk very QUIETLY. (Throughout this scene,
text: we see in the background, across the corridor, the mostly
text: obscured cell of Andrews. We see his incredibly FAT LEG being
text: shackled, his belongings being packed in boxes.)
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Everyone says he's a genius. I don't
dialog: think he's a genius. He's rich and
dialog: he went to college -- like any of us
dialog: would've if we got the chance. He
dialog: came home for Christmas and shot his
dialog: parents --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
text: -- in front of the television.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You remember the story --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: They were watching Father Knows Best.
text: They look at each other and smile. Then:
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I won't be sorry to see him go. Always
dialog: correcting my grammar.
text: They watch Andrews being shackled in the background.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Now -- Dick and me -- we're next in
dialog: line.
text: Truman regards Perry, who looks down.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm so sorry I've been away.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: It was a long time.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I wish you could come next week,
text: when they take him out to the Corner,
text: but the whole prison shuts down.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I have to be in New York anyway.
text: Perry nods.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: How's the book going?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
text: Very slowly.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Will you show it to me?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I've hardly written anything.
text: One of the six guards CLANGS Andrews' cell bars with his
dialog: stick.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Ready.
text: The ROW GUARD opens the cell door. Andrews is led out, arms
text: and legs shackled, into the corridor.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: Keep your head high, buddy.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: Alright now.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: ...or they won't be able to rope you
dialog: under your fat fucking chin.
text: Andrews is led past Perry's cell. He looks in at Perry.
speaker_heading: ANDREWS
dialog: Next!

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THEATER - EVENING

speaker_heading: BEN BARON
dialog: (loudly, over the
dialog: hubbub)
dialog: Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle
dialog: you sold your book for.
text: Nelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of

speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Well...
text: Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: What a gentleman.
scene_heading: INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Truman sits alone. In the background, we can HEAR the noise
text: of the huge crowd gathering in the theater. Truman wears his
text: MOST STYLISH LITERARY OUTFIT: a gorgeous dark green Knize
text: SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed
text: GLASSES (which we've never seen him wear before).
text: He's frozen with anticipation, nervousness. After several
text: moments a THEATER ASSISTANT opens the door.
scene_heading: YOUNG ASSISTANT
dialog: Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: No.
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: Thank you.

text: We hear William Shawn on stage.
speaker_heading: SHAWN (O.S.)
dialog: Welcome New Yorkers...
scene_heading: INT. WINGS/STAGE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: SHAWN (O.S.)
dialog: Thank you for coming to the first
dialog: public reading, the first offering
dialog: of any kind, of Truman Capote's new
dialog: work "In Cold Blood." Our magazine --
text: Truman walks on stage. Loud applause. Shawn sees him, slinks

text: The four coffins, which quite filled

dialog: services -- very understandably, for
dialog: the effect... was disquieting. Nancy
dialog: wore her dress of cherry-red velvet,
text: her brother a bright plaid shirt;
dialog: the parents were more sedately
text: attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue
text: flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe;
dialog: and -- and it was this especially
dialog: that lent the scene an awful aura --
dialog: the head of each was completely
text: encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon
dialog: twice the size of an ordinary blown-
dialog: up balloon, and the cotton, because
text: it had been sprayed with a glossy
dialog: substance, twinkled like Christmas-

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Imagination, of course, can open any
dialog: door -- turn the key and let terror
dialog: walk right in. [One] Tuesday, at
text: dawn, a carload of... strangers,
dialog: ignorant of the local disaster --
dialog: were startled by what they saw as
dialog: they crossed the prairies and passed
text: through Holcomb: windows ablaze,
dialog: almost every window in almost every
text: house, and, in the brightly lit rooms,
dialog: fully clothed people, even entire
dialog: families, who had sat the whole night

scene_heading: INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - NIGHT
text: Truman's dressing room. Packed with well-wishers drinking

text: BARON others, laughing. A LITERARY ENTHUSIAST approaches,
text: leans in.
scene_heading: LITERARY ENTHUSIAST
dialog: Your portrait of those men was
text: terrifying. Terrifying.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Thank you.
text: Truman and Isherwood watch him walk away.
speaker_heading: ISHERWOOD
dialog: Your hairpiece is terrifying.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN

dialog: Tennessee loved it.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Of course he did.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Should we do more? I was terrified,

speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: No, Now we get to withhold while
dialog: everyone else talks. Let them do the
dialog: work.
text: Truman is barely able to suppress his excitement.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: This book is going to change
dialog: everything. It'll change how people
dialog: see you as a writer. It'll change
dialog: how people write. You'll finish by
dialog: October?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I think so. You know they're scheduled
dialog: for next month?
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many

dialog: As many as it takes.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll

speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Honestly, what's he got to lose?
text: Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: It really is too awful.
dialog: Institutionalized sadism.

speaker_heading: SHAWN

text: He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry
text: sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: When did you hear?
text: Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared
text: enthusiasm. He smiles widely.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Two days ago.
text: The Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of
text: the DOCUMENTS.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: It's what we've been waiting for. A
dialog: stay of execution to make a federal
dialog: appeal.
text: Truman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: All thanks to you.
text: On Truman, shocked, being hugged.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER
text: Truman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry --
text: hyped up, talking, walking around the cell.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Kansas's had it in for me for ten
dialog: years -- in prison the first time,
dialog: at that trial, here. They can't corner
dialog: me now. Not till the U.S. Government
dialog: says so --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Perry, sit down. For a minute.
dialog: (Perry sits)
dialog: I need you to talk to me...
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: We've got all the time in the world
dialog: to talk. About everything. I've been
dialog: thinking about Ricardo. You need to
dialog: stop sending him those trashy books.
dialog: I won't even mention the pornography.
dialog: (getting up)
dialog: I realize he might have trouble
dialog: grasping the literature you gave me,
dialog: but those books only exacerbate the
dialog: problem -- only 'heighten' or
dialog: 'intensify' it. Maybe we should start
dialog: him on a program...
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Perry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Give him the simple novels first --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Perry.
text: Perry stops.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I know what exacerbate means.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Okay. I thought in case...
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: There is not a word, or a sentence,
dialog: or a concept, that you can illuminate
dialog: for me. There is one singular reason
dialog: that I keep coming here --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Truman --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: ...November 14th, 1959. Three years
dialog: ago. Three years. That's all I want
dialog: to hear from you.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I've asked you not to --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (stands up)
dialog: This is ridiculous.
dialog: (to the Guard)
dialog: I'm ready.
dialog: (to Perry)
dialog: I have a plane to catch. I found
dialog: your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll
dialog: talk to me about something useful.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Don't go out there.
text: The Guard lets Truman out of the cell.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Please don't go out there.

speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: This is my work, Perry. I'm working.

scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: They'll play outside a while longer.
text: Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small,
text: attractive and nervous. Through the window, we see THREE
text: LITTLE CHILDREN playing on a DECREPIT JUNGLE GYM in the yard.
text: Truman sits at the table, leafing through a PHOTO ALBUM.
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: I don't want them to see that.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: They've never seen these pictures?
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: (shakes her head)
dialog: Too many questions.
text: She joins Truman again at the table.
text: We see an OLD PHOTO of the SMITH FAMILY -- Linda at age 8,
dialog: Perry (5); their older sister, June; their brother Frank;
dialog: and the parents: Florence (American Indian) and John (Irish) --
text: in front of their rundown truck on a desolate road.
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
text: June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now
dialog: Perry's did what he did. I suppose
dialog: I'm next. Some ruination will visit
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't think life works that way.
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: It does in this family.
text: Truman turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (3) and Linda
text: HOLDING HANDS and splashing in a big mud-puddle in the rain.
text: Linda is smiling at Perry, who is naked, laughing.
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: I used to love him. He was my little
dialog: doll.
text: He turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (6) and Linda sitting
text: on the back steps of a shack, poking with a stick at something
text: in the dirt. After a moment, she gets up, clears coffee cups.
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: He scares me now.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: When was the last time you saw him?
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: Ten years.
text: She picks up the album to put it away.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Do you think I could borrow one of
dialog: those pictures?
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: (hands it to him)
dialog: Take the whole thing. I don't want'em
dialog: anymore.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Just... Perry doesn't know where I
dialog: live. He thinks we're still in
dialog: Portland. Please don't tell him we're
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (he already has)
dialog: Alright.
scene_heading: MRS. MURCHAK
dialog: Don't be taken in by my brother.
dialog: He's got this sensitive side he'll
dialog: show. You believe he's gentle, so

dialog: Yes

speaker_heading: PERRY

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: What's the name of your book?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't...
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: What's the name of your book?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't know what you're talking
dialog: about.
text: Perry picks up a cut-out ARTICLE from the NY Times from his
text: desk. He reads.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: "Truman Capote read last night before
text: a packed audience from his non-fiction
dialog: book IN COLD BLOOD."

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: More?

dialog: "The true-crime novel tells of killers

dialog: brutally murdered a Kansas family
dialog: three years ago."
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Who sent that to you?
text: Perry doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Who sent that to you?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: That's not your goddamn business.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: It is my business, because it's not
dialog: true. The organizers of the reading
dialog: needed a title. They picked one -- a
dialog: sensational one, I admit -- to attract
text: a crowd.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: They picked it.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: That's not your title.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I haven't chosen one yet.
text: Perry stares at him, not believing.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: How could I choose --
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You pretend to be my friend...
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: How could I choose a title when you
dialog: still haven't told me what happened
dialog: that night? How could I? I couldn't
dialog: possibly.
text: Long pause. Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts
text: a PHOTO (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle.)
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I have something from your sister.
text: He hands it through the bars to Perry. Perry takes it.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: She misses you.
text: Perry looks at the photo. After a few moments, Truman turns
dialog: to the Guard.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: It's alright. I'll go in.
text: The Guard unlocks the cell. Truman enters. The Guard locks
text: up, walks away. Perry is still looking at the PHOTO.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm sorry. I should have told you
dialog: what they made me call the book.
dialog: (touches Perry's arm)
dialog: I couldn't pretend to be your friend.
dialog: The truth is, I can't help wanting
dialog: to be.
dialog: (silence, then:)
dialog: You don't have to tell me anything
dialog: if you don't want to.

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Look at my belly.

speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: There must be something wrong with
dialog: us. To do what we did.
text: Truman waits him out, sitting on the chair. Finally, Perry
text: looks at him. When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely
dialog: matter-of-fact.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: We heard there was ten thousand
dialog: dollars in that house. Once we'd
dialog: tied up everybody and searched all
dialog: over, I knew the guy who told us
dialog: about it was wrong. There wasn't any
dialog: money. But Dick wouldn't believe it.
text: He went tearing through the house
text: again, banging on the walls, looking
dialog: for a safe. He said when he was done,
dialog: he was going to come up to Nancy's
dialog: room and have his way with her. I

scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT
text: Perry talking to Truman.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Dick came to get me and we turned
text: out the lights and went down to the
dialog: basement, where we had Mr. Clutter
dialog: and the boy. Dick kept saying "No
dialog: witnesses." I figured if I just waited
dialog: him out he'd give up and leave them
dialog: tied up there. We'd drive all night,
dialog: they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's

dialog: and I said they were fine, they were
dialog: ready to go to sleep. I told him it
dialog: wasn't long till morning when somebody
dialog: would find them.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: He was looking at me. Just... looking
text: at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he
dialog: expects me to kill him -- expects me
dialog: to be the kind of person who would
dialog: kill him. I was thinking -- this
dialog: nice man, he's scared of me. I was
dialog: ashamed. I mean, I thought he was a

dialog: And how'd you like the movie, Truman.
text: She puts her drink down on the bar and walks away. Truman
text: turns back to the bartender, shrugs.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I frankly don't know what the fuss
dialog: is about.
text: On Truman, alone at the bar.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
text: FADE UP on a PAPER BOY riding his BIKE down the street. New
text: buds are on the trees. It is SPRING. The BOY wears a NEW
text: YORK TIMES bag slung over his chest and is tossing copies of
text: the paper. One of them lands on Truman and Jack's stoop.
scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Phone RINGING. Truman asleep.
scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, JACK'S TINY OFFICE - SAME TIME
text: Jack is writing, longhand, at his desk. PHONE is ringing.
text: Jack notices that his door is slightly ajar. He kicks it
text: shut. The ringing is much quieter. He keeps writing.
scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME
text: Truman asleep. PHONE ringing. He wakes up, groggy, answers.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)

speaker_heading: OPERATOR

speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: You'll accept charges?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Mr. Smith, you're on the line.
text: Now Truman's awake. We hear a series of CLICKS, then:
speaker_heading: PERRY (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Hello.
text: Truman can't bring himself to speak.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Hello? I can't --
dialog: (to someone)
dialog: This doesn't seem --

dialog: the cradle, then:)
dialog: Operator, I don't think you put me --
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm here.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Truman.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Hello, Perry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: They let me make a couple phone calls
dialog: before I go down to Holding... You
dialog: heard the Supreme Court rejected the
dialog: appeal.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I didn't... I hadn't heard that.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Yeah. They let me make two phone
dialog: calls.
text: Truman doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: We've got a date set for the

dialog: and... Finito. April 14.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Will you visit me? Truman. Will you
dialog: come visit?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't know if I can. I'll try.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don't know if I can.
text: We hear over the line a GUARD in the background:
scene_heading: GUARD IN BACKGROUND (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Time, Smith. Hang it up.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Please visit me, Truman. Just...
scene_heading: GUARD IN BACKGROUND (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Time. Smith.
text: CLICK. Truman sits very still, the phone in his hand.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - ONE WEEK LATER, NIGHT

speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Ready.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - ONE WEEK LATER, NIGHT

speaker_heading: KRUTCH

text: Perry sits up. Krutch sits on the one chair. The Guard stands
text: by the door, takes out a PAD and STUBBY PENCIL.
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: You're allowed three names of people
dialog: you'd like to witness tomorrow. If
dialog: there's anybody you want, tell me
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Truman Capote.
text: Krutch nods to the Guard who writes the name down. Krutch
dialog: waits, then:
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: Anybody else?
text: Perry SHAKES HIS HEAD.
scene_heading: INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
text: In a chair near the window, Truman sits awake in his pajamas,
text: unable to sleep, completely unable to decide what to do. He
text: watches Jack sleep. A long time -- then Truman walks to the
text: closet, gets out a travel bag, starts to pack.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. IDLEWILD AIRPORT, NEW YORK - DAY
text: A PLANE takes off.
scene_heading: INT. PLANE, FIRST CLASS SECTION - DAY
text: Truman sits next to William Shawn, who looks exhausted. The

speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: You want anything?
text: Truman shakes his head.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: a strawberry soda. The Guard sets it down on the chair.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You sent the telegram to his hotel?
speaker_heading: GUARD
dialog: Hours ago.
text: Perry looks at the CLOCK on the wall: it's after 8pm.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: May I make a phone call?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, MUEHLEBACH HOTEL, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT
text: PHONE ringing. The CLOCK rads 8:55pm. Empty drinks glasses,
text: a custard jar. Truman lies curled in a fetal position on the
text: BED. Shawn walks the floor, exasperated.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: That's him again.
text: Truman is immobile. Phone still rings.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: We've never even met. It is utterly
dialog: inappropriate for me to be talking
dialog: to him.
text: Shawn gives up, PICKS UP the phone.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Yes... I'm sorry, he's out, gone
dialog: out... I'm not sure when...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, HALLWAY - NIGHT

text: They pass a WALL CLOCK: 9:40pm.
scene_heading: INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT
text: Krutch and Guard enter Perry's cell. Perry hasn't touched
dialog: his meal.
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: You got a telex.
text: Perry nods. Krutch reads:
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: "Perry. Unable to visit today because
dialog: not permitted. Always your friend,
dialog: Truman."
dialog: (apologetically)
dialog: That's it.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: It's not true, is it?
text: Krutch hesitates a moment, then SHAKES his head.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. NELLE'S KITCHEN, MONROEVILLE - MINUTES LATER
text: Nelle on the PHONE looking at a TELEGRAM. The kitchen CLOCK
text: reads 10:20pm. She waits a moment till the line is answered.
speaker_heading: NELLE (ON PHONE)
dialog: Mr. Shawn? It's Nelle... I just got
dialog: this telegram, has he seen it?
text: INTERCUT with William Shawn on the phone in Truman's hotel
text: room. A TELEGRAM lies on the DESK. Truman lies on the bed.
scene_heading: INT. MUEHLEBACH HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SHAWN (ON PHONE)
text: He won't look at it.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Would you put him on please?
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: He won't talk.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: (calmly)
dialog: Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him
dialog: down and put the phone on his ear, I
dialog: need to speak to him.
text: Shawn, terrifically uncomfortable, walks over to Truman and
text: holds the phone out to him.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: It's Nelle.
text: A moment, then Truman takes the phone. On Truman's face. We
text: hear, through the receiver, Nelle:
speaker_heading: NELLE (OVER PHONE)
dialog: Truman.
text: Truman finally breathes out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - SAME TIME
text: Perry is led, SHACKLED, into a holding cell on the ground
text: floor of the Death Row Building. Dick is already there,
text: seated, shackled. We HEAR PERRY'S VOICE:
speaker_heading: PERRY (V.O.)
dialog: "Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman
dialog: Capote: Sorry that Truman was unable
dialog: to make it here at the prison for a
dialog: brief word prior to necktie party...
text: The CLOCK reads 11:05pm. Through the WINDOW, we see activity
text: in the Gallows Warehouse across the yard.
speaker_heading: PERRY (V.O.)
dialog: ...Whatever his reason for not showing
dialog: up, I want him to know that I cannot
dialog: condemn him for it and understand...
text: Perry makes eye contact with the Guard, who CHEWS GUM. The
text: Guard checks through the SMALL WINDOW in the door, then
text: approaches Perry, places a STICK OF GUM in Perry's mouth.
speaker_heading: Perry CHEWS.
speaker_heading: PERRY (V.O.)
dialog: ...Not much time left but want you
dialog: both to know that I've been sincerely
dialog: grateful for your friendship through
dialog: the years and everything else...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MUEHLEBACH HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT

scene_heading: EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY - NIGHT
text: TAXICAB pulls up to the prison gates. Perry's VOICE:

dialog: Adios amigos. Your friend, Perry."
scene_heading: INT. KSP, WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE CELLS - NIGHT
text: Clock reads 11:35pm. Truman sits with Shawn. Truman is looking
text: at the TELEGRAM from Perry. He folds it, puts it in the breast
text: pocket of his jacket. Krutch approaches.
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: I didn't think I'd be seeing you
dialog: again.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You can visit for a few minutes.
text: Truman stands, turns to Shawn, still seated.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Come with me.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: Truman. No.
text: Truman goes alone.
scene_heading: INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - NIGHT
text: Perry, Dick, a Guard. Krutch lets Truman in.
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
text: Five minutes.
text: He exits, closes the door. Truman doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: (without rancor)
text: He returns. Long time.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't know what you must think of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: You haven't been foremost on my mind
dialog: lately. As you can imagine.
text: Dick looks at Perry and smiles. Perry chews his gum and smiles
text: back, then looks to Truman who seems upset.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You got the letter?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: It's true. I mean I understand why
dialog: you didn't want to come. I wouldn't
dialog: be here either if I didn't have to.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: You got that right.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You know Ricardo donated his eyes to
dialog: science? Next week, some blind man
dialog: will be seeing what Dick used to
dialog: see.
speaker_heading: HICKOCK
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: He'd be better off the way he was.
dialog: What I've seen hasn't been so nice
dialog: to look at -- but I guess it's better
dialog: than nothing.
dialog: (he shrugs, to Truman)
text: They came around with a form.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hey. You'll be walking down the street
dialog: one day in Denver, wherever -- and
dialog: suddenly these eyes will be staring
dialog: at you. Wouldn't that be something?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: It would be.
text: Krutch opens the door.
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: Time.
text: Truman looks at the clock: 11:50pm. Truman turns to Perry
text: and Dick. Perry stands.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You'll be watching?
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I don't know. Do you want me to?
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I'd like to have a friend there.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Okay. Then I will.
text: Truman looks down, starts to cry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: It's alright.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I did everything I could.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: I truly did.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: I know.
text: Truman nods, wipes his eyes.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Goodbye, Perry.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: You're not rid of me yet. I'll see
dialog: you in a few minutes.
text: Truman goes. On Perry watching him leave.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: Huge. Dirt floor. Wooden gallows. TWENTY MEN stand around,
text: some smoking. Some are silent. Some whisper quietly.
dialog: Journalists. Also, Alvin Dewey and the KBI men: Church and
text: Nye. Krutch in front of the gallows with a CHAPLAIN. At the
text: foot of the gallows steps, the EXECUTIONER -- thin, older, a
text: too-large pin-striped suit and stained cowboy hat. Truman.
dialog: William Shawn.
text: HEADLIGHTS, then a PRISON CAR enters, stops. Dick is extracted
text: from the back seat. He stands, looks at the CROWD, then at
text: the GALLOWS. The Guards nudge him forward.
scene_heading: INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - A FEW MINUTES LATER
text: CLOCK reads 12:05pm. Perry sits alone looking at his hands.
text: We HEAR A TRAP DOOR SPRING and CLATTER. Perry looks up.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CAR - NIGHT
text: Light rain outside. Perry in the back seat being driven across
text: the yard. He looks out his window, sees a PICKUP TRUCK drive
text: out of the Corner Warehouse. On it: a BODY covered by a BLACK
speaker_heading: CLOTH.
scene_heading: INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
text: The PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back
text: seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman.
text: He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand:
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Nice to see you.
text: Dewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led
text: to the base of the gallows.
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: Perry Edward Smith.
dialog: (reads)
dialog: "For the crime of murder in the first
dialog: degree, by order of the Court of
dialog: Finney County and the Supreme Court
dialog: of the sovereign State of Kansas,
dialog: you are sentenced to hang until you
dialog: die."
dialog: (then)
dialog: You can say something if you want.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: (quietly, to Krutch)
dialog: Is there anybody from the family
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: KRUTCH
dialog: No.
text: Perry is disappointed by this information.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Well. Tell them...
dialog: (he look out at
dialog: everyone)
dialog: I can't remember what I was going to
dialog: say for the life of me...
text: He stops. Several moments.
text: Krutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the
text: Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows.
speaker_heading: CHAPLAIN
dialog: Though I walk through the valley of
dialog: the shadow of death, I will fear no
dialog: evil, for thou art with me.
text: The Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry
text: chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK.
text: Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the
text: crowd, at Truman.
speaker_heading: CHAPLAIN
dialog: Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort
dialog: me.
text: The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He
text: stands next to Alvin Dewey.
speaker_heading: CHAPLAIN
dialog: Thou preparest a table before me in
dialog: the presence of mine enemies. Thou
dialog: annointest my head with oil.
text: The Executioner pulls the handle, Perry drops.
speaker_heading: CHAPLAIN
dialog: My cup runneth over.
text: On Truman. Then a WIDE SHOT of the inside of the Warehouse:
text: twenty men watching Perry Smith hang, the Chaplain reading.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK:
text: The SOUND of a TELEPHONE RINGING, as heard through the
text: receiver. We HEAR the CLICK of the phone being PICKED UP,
text: then, after a moment, a VOICE:
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: FADE UP:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - EARLY MORNING
text: Truman sits on the edge of the bed in his WET OVERCOAT, as
dialog: if he'd walked in the rain.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: Someday I'll tell you about it. For
dialog: the moment, I'm too shattered.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: They're dead, Truman. You're alive.
speaker_heading: TRUMAN
dialog: It was a terrible experience and I
dialog: will never get over it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: There wasn't anything I could have
dialog: done to save them.
text: We hear Nelle light a cigarette.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: Maybe not.
text: We hear her exhale slowly.
speaker_heading: NELLE
dialog: But the fact is, you didn't want to.
dialog: On Truman,
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE. AIRPLANE NOISE. COLORS RESOLVE INTO:
scene_heading: INT. FIRST CLASS SECTION, AIRPLANE - DAY
text: Truman, seated on the aisle, next to William Shawn. After a
text: long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE
text: wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.
speaker_heading: SHAWN
dialog: It came to the hotel this morning. I
dialog: told them I'd give it to you.
text: The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed
text: to Truman. Truman opens it.
text: He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL
text: DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds
text: Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:
speaker_heading: PERRY (V.O.)
dialog: Did we not know we were to die, we
dialog: would be children. By knowing it, we
dialog: are given the opportunity to mature
dialog: in spirit...
text: Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.
text: We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a
text: SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing
text: in the puddle.
speaker_heading: PERRY (V.O.)
dialog: Some take that opportunity. I hope I
dialog: have...
text: Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's
text: very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.
speaker_heading: PERRY
dialog: Life is only the father of wisdom.
dialog: Death is the mother.
text: Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes
text: it out, clutches it.
text: Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on
text: tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.
text: The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the
text: tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: TITLE UP: (each title fades up in succession)
dialog: In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in
dialog: America.
dialog: He never finished another book.
dialog: The epigraph he chose for his last published work reads:
dialog: "More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered
dialog: ones. "
dialog: He died in 1984 of complications due to alcoholism.

speaker_heading: THE END
