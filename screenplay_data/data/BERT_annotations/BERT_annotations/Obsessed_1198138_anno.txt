dialog: 
text: As she's about to fall, Lisa reaches out and grabs the
text: chandelier with both hands.
dialog: 
text: By a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth
text: like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to
text: pull loose from it's ceiling mount. Plaster cracks and rips
dialog: away.
dialog: 
text: Lisa swings back and forth, dangling.
dialog: 
text: Beth stands on the landing. She looks at terrified Lisa,
text: then up at the ceiling mount. It won't take Lisa's weight
dialog: much longer.
dialog: 
dialog: And both women know it.
dialog: 
text: Lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to
text: Beth who could pull her to safety.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Please....
dialog: 
text: Beth considers. Then, as if coming out of dream, she slowly
text: reaches out to Lisa. Their hands lock together. Beth slowly
text: pulls Lisa toward her, toward safety.

dialog: 
text: With a look of horror on her face, Lisa falls through space.

dialog: 
text: Down, down, down Lisa falls. Her arms and legs flop around
text: like a marionette with its strings cut, clawing the air.
dialog: 
text: The fall seems endless.
dialog: 
text: Then... Lisa hits the glass dining table with her back. Her
text: whole body buckles. The surface of the table ripples.
dialog: 
text: In slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa,
text: framing her entire body, forming a halo around her head.
text: Sound returns -- the sound of breaking glass -- and it's
text: deafening.
dialog: 
text: The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor,
text: her skull cracking. Her back is probably broken but she's
text: still conscious.
dialog: 
text: ying there, Lisa stares up at Beth on the landing as glass
text: bounces and TINKLES around her.
dialog: 
text: The two enemies lock eyes. Beth's face is impassive.
dialog: 
text: Lisa opens her mouth, trying to speak.
dialog: 
text: And that's when the chandelier breaks loose.
