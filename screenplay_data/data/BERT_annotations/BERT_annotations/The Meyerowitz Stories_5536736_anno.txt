speaker_heading: TEXT:
text: Danny Meyerowitz was trying to park.
text: The sound of car HORNS.
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S SUBARU OUTBACK. DAY
text: Danny Meyerowitz, mid-40's, is backing up on the Bowery.
text: He wears a soft brown leather jacket and shorts. Eliza,
text: his 18 year old daughter, is flipping channels on the
dialog: radio.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I'm really thinking about being
dialog: vegetarian again.
dialog: Eliza--
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Do you realize, eating meat
dialog: is worse than driving an SUV
dialog: for a year.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Eliza, am I fitting?
text: A car honks.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm parking asshole!
dialog: (twisting the wheel)
dialog: I can't believe that's true.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: It's true, Dad.
dialog: Podcast.
dialog: I'll send you the
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't think I'm fitting.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I'm telling you. It's a big thing
dialog: we can do for the environment.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Let's look it up. But not while
dialog: I'm pulling THIS maneuver.
text: He turns the wheel dramatically.
text: followed by a thud.
text: There's a scraping sound
dialog: 2
speaker_heading: ELIZA
text: It’s too small a space.
dialog: Shit!
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: He shifts back into drive and pulls out into traffic.
dialog: horns.
dialog: More
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to the car behind him)
dialog: What?!
text: Eliza fiddles with the radio, looking for a song.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Go back to the Mets game.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: It's a commercial.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I splurged and got the satellite.
text: She lands on "Head to Toe" by Lisa Lisa and the Cult Jam.
dialog: Ooh, nice.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Turn it up.
text: Eliza turns up the song.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: "Head to toe --"
dialog: (cutting himself off)
dialog: I put this on a tape for you when
dialog: you were like twelve.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (mildly interested)
dialog: Cool.
text: Danny looks over his shoulder, realizes something, and hits
text: the wheel in frustration.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shit, was that...was that a spot?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (looking back)
dialog: Yeah, he's taking it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How did I miss that?
dialog: Fucking shit.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Let's go around.
dialog: 3
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We've been around. I'm going to
dialog: try further East.
dialog: (an idea)
dialog: There should be an App for
dialog: parking. Is there an App for
dialog: parking?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: They're working on it.
dialog: (re: the street they're on)
dialog: This is all No Parking.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How did I do this wrong?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: It's OK, Dad. Why don't we just
dialog: garage it?
dialog: Do you
dialog: garage
dialog: garage
dialog: That's
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: know how much it is to
dialog: it around here? If we
dialog: it, you can't go to college.
dialog: why.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: I'll pay half.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm not taking your money.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: What's the matter with me?
dialog: usually very good at this.
dialog: It's OK--
dialog: I know.
dialog: I'm
speaker_heading: ELIZA
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm an extremely good
dialog: parker. I have a real eye
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Now, I'm over-thinking it.
dialog: I'm getting gun-shy.
text: Sweating, he wrestles with his jacket trying to take it
text: off. He drives while doing this.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Dad, wait until we’re stopped.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I’m hot, it’s interfering
dialog: with my mobility--
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Let me help you then.
dialog: 4
text: She leans over and helps him take it off.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: (looking in the rear-view
dialog: mirror)
dialog: Are these the same people that
dialog: were behind us?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (re: his jacket)
dialog: Keep it right-side up, my
dialog: wallet’s in there.
text: He turns the song down.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: The song was distracting.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: It's too good!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (half smiling)
dialog: It is too good.
text: They stop at a light.
text: Danny gazes outside.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (musing)
dialog: There's so much construction in
dialog: Manhattan. They're just endlessly
dialog: building. I used to go dancing
dialog: around here. At Danceteria. Me
dialog: and your uncle Matthew. Now, it's
dialog: all banks.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: You guys went dancing together?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We went together, we didn't dance
dialog: together. For a short time in the
dialog: 80's we hung out. I had moves,
dialog: I'm telling you. Is this a museum
dialog: now? Everything's glass.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Do you like the photographer, Cindy
dialog: Sherman? Marcus and me went to the
dialog: Cindy Sherman show at MOMA last
dialog: week.
text: They start moving.
dialog: 5
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (pointedly)
dialog: Yes, I like Cindy Sherman.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I told you about Cindy Sherman
dialog: like two years ago.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't remember.
dialog: I did!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And you had NO interest.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: When Marcus tells you, suddenly
dialog: you listen. I'm telling you, I've
dialog: got good recommendations. I mean,
dialog: I have a few years on you.
text: He hits the brakes.
speaker_heading: HORNS!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Is this a spot?
dialog: signs say?
dialog: What do these
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Um, I'm trying to see.
text: Another car honks behind them.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Quick, Eliza...
text: Blaring honking.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I find parking signs
dialog: confusing. What's today?
text: Danny swerves back into traffic.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: This asshole is riding my tail.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I think it was a good space.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Can I back up?
dialog: 6
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (looking over her shoulder)
dialog: I don't think so.
dialog: Horns!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shit! He's on my tail.
dialog: to go around.
dialog: I've got
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: We should just garage it.
dialog: Son.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: A. Bitch!
dialog: Of.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Stop yelling in the car! He can't
dialog: hear you. Only I can hear you.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: (looking in the rearview)
dialog: This is just Nobody Can Fucking
dialog: Drive Day.
dialog: (horns!)
scene_heading: SHUT THE FUCK-EXT./INT. TOWNHOUSE, LOWER MANHATTAN. DAY
text: The door opens with a light creak.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Yoo-hoo. Hello?
text: Danny carries a duffel bag, holds a suitcase and walks with
text: a slight limp. Eliza follows behind him.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to Eliza, concerned)
text: The outer door was ajar. And the
text: button on the foyer door was
text: pressed and unlocked.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Something smells weird.
text: A big poodle leaps up on Danny and Eliza.
dialog: Oh wow!
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: Down Bruno! Bruno, down!
text: Eliza screams.
dialog: 7
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Whose dog is this?
dialog: Brune!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: Harold Meyerowitz, 70's, is bearded, wearing a green polo
text: shirt with a knit tie and a knee-high work coat. He also
text: has a red bruise on the side of his face.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (to the dog)
dialog: Where did you come from?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maureen and I bought him from a
dialog: very elegant apricot poodle farm
text: near the country house.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Hi Bruno! Oh, you're crazy,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (while hugging his Dad)
text: Dad, the outer door was left open.
dialog: (demonstrating)
dialog: And someone pressed the button in
text: on the foyer door-HAROLD
text: Maureen is always doing something.
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Maureen!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm telling you, you got to be
dialog: careful. It's crazy to leave the
dialog: doors open. This isn't the
dialog: country.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to the leaping dog)
dialog: Brune!
dialog: (to the air)
dialog: Maureen!
dialog: (to Danny and Eliza)
dialog: This house isn't very big, but she
dialog: never seems to be able to hear me.
dialog: (again)
dialog: Maureen!
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN (O.S.)
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Did you leave the front door open?
dialog: 8
speaker_heading: MAUREEN (O.S.)
dialog: For the Con Ed guy?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That was three days ago!
text: He shakes his head, irritated.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm sorry we're late, we had to
text: garage the car.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: And Dad had to sell me into child
dialog: slavery to pay for it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That's basically right.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Did you try East?
speaker_heading: DANNY/ELIZA
dialog: We did./Twice.
text: The dog lunges at Danny.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Bruno! He does this elegant
dialog: pirouette.
text: Danny now reacts to the bruise on Harold's face.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dad, what happened?
dialog: into a fight?
dialog: Did you get
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I was walking Bruno in the country
text: when he lunged for a feral hare in
text: the brush and I tumbled forward.
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did you see a doctor?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm fine. My joke is, you should
text: see the other dog.
text: He smiles slyly at Eliza.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Good one, Grampa.
dialog: 9
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maureen won't even walk that path
text: anymore. She was mauled by a
dialog: buck.
dialog: A buck?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: In the Berkshires?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: A male deer.
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maybe it was a big dog or a small
dialog: boy. In her indomitable way she
dialog: survived with just a nasty
text: raspberry on her knee, but her
dialog: wallet was gone.
text: He takes Eliza's hand and leads her further inside. They
text: pass the living room where the TV is on the baseball game.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: The Mets just relinquished the
dialog: lead.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Shit, it was tied when we
text: were in the car.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Collins shouldn’t have left
dialog: Syndergaard in. He was
text: clearly tiring.
text: Jean, 50's, rises from the couch, watching the game.
dialog: Danny's older sister.
dialog: She's
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I could tell Dad wanted to say Hi
dialog: to you guys by himself.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (startles)
dialog: Hey. When'd you get here?
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: Your sister is here.
text: Her hair is graying and she doesn't dye it. She wears a
text: blazer with an abstract pin on the lapel and big hanging
text: earrings and glasses. She dresses how she probably dressed
dialog: twenty-five years ago.
dialog: *
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Couple hours ago.
text: showing up late.
dialog: Thanks for
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Sorry, we were--
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I made cookies but I stepped
dialog: in dog shit.
text: She hugs Eliza and Danny.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I like your jacket.
dialog: Thanks.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I like your pin.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Are you excited for college
dialog: tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I really can't wait.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Dad keeps saying he wishes he
dialog: hadn’t retired now so that you
dialog: could take his class. If that’s
dialog: even allowed at Bard.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I couldn’t make sculpture,
dialog: that’s too intimidating.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She's very excited which I'm
dialog: trying not to take
dialog: personally. I'm bad with
dialog: transitions.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You don't leave the house.
dialog: are no transitions.
dialog: (whispers to Danny)
dialog: Maureen's plastered.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (yelling up the stairs)
dialog: Maureen, every one is here!
dialog: down!
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: She's making shark.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I don't think I've ever had
dialog: shark.
dialog: There
dialog: Come
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maureen's a real gourmand.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (meeting Eliza's eyes)
dialog: Well, you're in for a treat.
dialog: 11
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (loud whisper to Danny)
dialog: Maureen's been sober for six
dialog: weeks.
dialog: Oh, OK.
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I tell her, I don't like you when
dialog: you drink. She becomes a
dialog: different person.
dialog: (to Eliza)
dialog: I made her a deal, I told her, if
dialog: you stop drinking, we'll get a
dialog: dog.
scene_heading: INT. DINING ROOM
text: CLOSE: A bowl of bouillabaisse. All the clam and mussel
text: shells are still closed shut. A fork picks through the
text: uncooked slab of shark.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: This is very handsome shellfish,
dialog: Maureen.
text: Eliza makes a face.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: The Dad says you're going to study
dialog: film at college.
text: The family sits around a wooden table. Maureen, 50's,
text: looks plastered. She wears an Indian patterned caftan and
text: a big bulky necklace she probably got at a craft fair.
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: That seems to be what everybody is
dialog: doing these days. I think the Dad
dialog: hoped you’d follow in his
text: footsteps and take sculpture-HAROLD
dialog: No, I think it’s good she’s doing
dialog: her own thing. Since Clarence had
dialog: his stroke and I retired, the art
dialog: department at Bard has really
dialog: suffered.
dialog: 12
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She's quite a good editor.
text: Danny is trying to pry open a clam shell. Eliza moves the
text: food around on her plate. Harold eats quickly and messily.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So, now we have a sculptor and a
dialog: filmmaker in the family.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (re: Danny)
dialog: And a musician.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: And an accountant which sounds
text: uninteresting, but Matthew's in
dialog: fact the only one in the family
dialog: who's figured out how to make
dialog: money. Sign of the times.
text: He laughs at his own remark.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I would have thought we'd have had
dialog: more artists in this family.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: What about Dad?
text: Eliza looks over to Danny, who listens closely, perhaps
dialog: waiting to be mentioned himself.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (finally)
dialog: I'm artistic.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Matthew showed interest in fine
dialog: art and Danny had musical talent.
dialog: But Matthew was also talented
text: musically and a wonderful mimic.
text: He looks at Jean and hesitates.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Jean, you showed interest in
dialog: photography.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: At Montessori, yeah. In my office
dialog: at Xerox, I'm known as the resident
dialog: auteur. I make funny movies for my
dialog: co-worker's birthdays.
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: They’re really good.
text: Danny finally breaks open his clam shell. He meets eyes
text: with Eliza. She slowly shakes her head at him: Don't do
text: it. He drops the shell back into the bowl, nodding, OK.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: We have no idea what Jean does at
dialog: Xerox.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I’m a facilities manager for
dialog: special--
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: When was the last job you
dialog: had, Danny?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (helping out her Dad)
dialog: Those piano lessons-DANNY
dialog: Well...except for the piano
dialog: lessons--
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: --and there was a gig at
dialog: Beefsteak Charlies.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I haven't really worked in
dialog: a...since Eliza was born...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Danny was a house-husband. But
dialog: now with the separation, he's
dialog: going to have to get a job. You
dialog: can't take alimony, that's not
dialog: right.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: What will you do for money?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, we just sold the apartment
dialog: and we'll split that.
dialog: (reassuringly placing his
dialog: hand on Eliza's back)
text: Karen...Karen is getting an
dialog: apartment in Ditmas and I'm...I'll
dialog: be staying here for a little, of
dialog: course, while I figure it out.
dialog: Thank you, again.
text: He looks to his Dad for some acknowledgement.
dialog: none.
dialog: He gets
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: While you're staying here, would
dialog: you please go through all the
dialog: boxes upstairs and take whatever
dialog: papers and posters you want from
dialog: your childhood.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to Eliza)
text: Maureen is taking a fancy
dialog: trip to Easter Island on
text: Monday with a group.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: And when I'm back, we're
dialog: going to start throwing
text: things away.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We don’t really have
dialog: anything here.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: We lived in Queens with our
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, it’s mostly Matthew's stuff,
dialog: but OK.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (excitedly)
text: Matthew's coming out from the
dialog: coast in a few weeks. He
dialog: corresponded with me about meeting
dialog: for lunch.
text: Danny looks up, surprised.
dialog: Matt is?
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Danny absentmindedly puts some shark in his mouth and then
text: takes it right back out.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: He has some wealthy clients who
dialog: are coming here on Sunday to look
dialog: at the Dad's work.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Matt does?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Apparently they're both admirers
dialog: of mine.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: We never hear from him and then
dialog: suddenly...poof!
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That's not true, he and I
dialog: correspond quite frequently.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: He texts with me.
text: They all look at Eliza.
text: Danny frowns.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You guys text? About what?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't know. Things.
dialog: Life.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Maybe I'll try to see him
dialog: when he's here.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: He's only here for a day to see a
dialog: client and he wants to see me
dialog: during that time. Eliza, have
dialog: more shark. Maureen, give my
dialog: granddaughter more shark!
text: Maureen heaps more shark on Eliza's plate.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: You kids don't eat.
text: Jean starts clearing. Maureen and Danny help her. Eliza
text: remains with her grandfather, pretending to eat her shark.
text: We MOVE between the adjacent kitchen and the dining room.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: It's amazing how much Matthew's
dialog: clients make when you think about
dialog: what a teacher or nurse earns-HAROLD
dialog: I think I would have had greater
dialog: success if I had been more
dialog: fashionable.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Well, you were always out of step
dialog: with the times.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That's true, I was a vanguard.
dialog: L.J. Shapiro said that about me.
text: Jean reenters from the kitchen bringing out coffee cups.
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You know L.J.'s having a
text: retrospective at MOMA.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (didn't know)
dialog: Is he? L.J. was always very
dialog: political. He's not untalented,
dialog: but he's a very skillful operator.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN (O.S.)
dialog: You didn't play the game.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You know L.J. and I showed
dialog: together at Paula Cooper in the
dialog: late 60's. And believe it or not,
dialog: I was the headliner.
text: Danny, still distracted by discussion of Matthew says to
dialog: Jean:
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Do you think I should e-mail Matt
dialog: about his visit?
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: JEAN
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't want to be presumptuous.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: He's your brother, Dan.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Half.
text: Maureen reenters.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Isn't that when the Whitney bought
dialog: a piece of yours?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes. They were going to buy more
dialog: work too, but Bernie, my dealer at
dialog: the time didn't like the deal. I
dialog: probably shouldn't have listened
dialog: to him.
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (continuing to Jean)
dialog: I don't know, he didn't respond
dialog: the last time I reached out.
text: Harold pries open another clam and eats it.
text: disgusted face to herself.
dialog: Eliza makes a
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: When I called and wrote the
dialog: Whitney about it, they couldn't
dialog: find it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It's there.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: They can't find it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Jean, damnit, they have the work!
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (chastised)
dialog: OK, OK...
text: Jean takes Eliza's full plate, rescuing her from eating
dialog: anything more, and says in her ear:
dialog: It's lost.
speaker_heading: JEAN
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY
text: We hear family conversation from the other room. Danny
text: turns the knob on the bathroom door. It opens and Maureen
text: immediately comes out, wearing rose tinted glasses, but
dialog: where you can see her eyes.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh...sorry.
text: Maureen mumbles something.
text: Danny enters.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Danny flushes. A strange rattling sound. He lifts up the
text: back of the toilet. Inside, bouncing around the chain, are
text: several small, pint-size liquor bottles.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: Danny and Eliza sit at an upright piano.
text: top keys, Eliza the bottom.
dialog: Danny plays the
dialog: 18
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: This is a Meyerowitz/Meyerowitz
dialog: composition.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: We wrote it when I was nine.
text: CUT TO: CLOSE on a book of Harold's work.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: The work looks stunning all
dialog: together like this. Danny, you
dialog: made this?
text: Harold sits with Jean on a old corduroy couch. They eat
text: cookies Jean made. Harold hands the book to Maureen.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: (reading)
dialog: Harold Meyerowitz: A
dialog: Retrospective.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Jean and I did it, yes.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You send in the pictures and they
dialog: make it for you.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (from the piano)
dialog: Oh, Dad, Jean and I spoke with a
text: woman at the museum at Bard-Danny looks at Jean who nods for him to continue.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Is that Hilma Federman?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hilma, yes. And there's some
dialog: interest at Bard in doing a show-MAUREEN
dialog: That's the least they can do for
dialog: you after all those years you've
dialog: given them.
text: Maureen randomly clears a plate and leaves the room.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I think with Eliza going this fall
dialog: and your history there as a
dialog: teacher, we have a good shot--
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Danny, make sure Hilma sees the
dialog: book. A retrospective at this
dialog: point would be a real feather in
dialog: my cap. And I think bring
dialog: attention to the new work.
text: Jean looks at Danny, who stops playing.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, the thing is Dad...it
dialog: would be part of a group
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Bard Faculty.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: A group show? No. That's
dialog: essentially an insult. I think
dialog: Hilma's angry because I voted
dialog: against her chairmanship. Tell
dialog: Hilma, No.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hilma hasn't offered it yet.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, when she does, tell her, No.
text: Danny continues playing.
text: Eliza and Danny finish the song.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: That sounded great.
dialog: good, Eliza.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Is shark bad or was that bad
dialog: shark?
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Dad, it was raw! The rice was
text: hard, the shell fish was closed.
text: Danny removes a piece of trash that's blown up on the walk.
text: He walks uneasily over to a trash can and chucks it.
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Dad, your limp is worse.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's always worse after I've been
dialog: sitting. I need to stretch it.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Please see someone about it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I have an appointment with an
text: acupuncturist on Tuesday.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Someone real please.
text: He looks at her.
text: Tears run down her face.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm telling you, you're going to
dialog: meet a lot of wonderful,
dialog: interesting new people. Or I
dialog: imagine you will as I didn't make
dialog: it more than a month at college
dialog: because I liked drugs so much.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I'm going to miss you and Mom.
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We'll miss you too.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I still haven't wrapped my mind
dialog: around it. You not being
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We wouldn't have made it this long
dialog: if it weren't for you.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (wiping her face)
dialog: That's a lot of responsibility.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You know what I mean. We don't
dialog: get along when it's just us. I'm
dialog: sorry I don't get to drive you,
dialog: but your mom won that one.
dialog: It's OK.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: She's a good driver.
text: He hugs her.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Remind her when you're going up
dialog: tomorrow, the Taconic is a speed

dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And I'll be up there whenever
dialog: you're ready for me.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Will you be OK here?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, it'll be nice to spend time
dialog: with Dad while Maureen’s away. You
dialog: know I didn't get a lot of time
text: with him growing up. After he left
dialog: my mom and married Julia, and they
dialog: had Matt...we didn’t see so much of
dialog: him. It's an opportunity to get
text: closer now.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: It's nice you and Jean are getting
dialog: him this show.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I know it's just a college show,
dialog: but I think it could really put
text: him back on the map. The work is
dialog: good and deserves more exposure.
text: A car has pulled up at the corner.
text: behind the wheel.
text: A bearded guy, 18,
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hey Marcus!
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hey, Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You're a truly wonderful girl.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: You've been a great Dad.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, I think I still am.

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: This one is interesting.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: I think it's a masterpiece.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It's intended as a sort of sequel
text: to Gilded Halfwing.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: That's the squiggly one outside
dialog: Lincoln Center?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Yes, Gilded Halfwing.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That's probably my most well known
text: work, it has a young man's energy,
dialog: but I like to think the later work
dialog: is richer and more interesting.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: When Matthew told me that was
dialog: yours, I was like, I walk by that
dialog: all the time. We're on Central
dialog: Park West now, but have been
dialog: looking for the right place
dialog: downtown.
text: James wanders into an adjacent bathroom.
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Show them the wood structures.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes, I've been working in wood
dialog: recently. Danny, give me a hand.
text: Danny indicates a stacked metal structure tucked in the

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How about this one with the red?
dialog: I always loved this one.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No, not that one.
dialog: work of mine.
dialog: That's a minor
text: Danny and Harold lug a couple of pieces into the center of
text: the room. Brian wanders to the window and looks outside.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: How's the noise in this area?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It gets very loud. All the
dialog: tourists.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Only on weekends.
text: James tests the water on the tap and the toilet flush.
text: Danny pokes his head around the corner finding James
text: inspecting the fixtures.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: The art's over here.
speaker_heading: JAMES
dialog: Yes, great.
text: He hurries back to find Harold with five new pieces.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It's largely intuitive really and
text: in its way, a return to the old
dialog: masters. I think I'm doing the
dialog: best work of my life right now.
dialog: But that's just one man's opinion.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM
text: Maureen prepares lunch.
text: Harold watches the game on TV.
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: I found Brian very attractive.
text: He's baby-faced but sinewy like an
dialog: old lover of mine, Willem Dafoe.
dialog: James has very firm calves.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: They were very enthusiastic about
dialog: the work.
text: Danny enters from the other room.
text: He looks annoyed.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Are they interested in the house
dialog: or the art?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (considered)
dialog: I think, the art.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: (walking past him)
dialog: Both.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: What do you mean, both?
text: Harold watches the TV.
text: Danny follows her.
text: Maureen walks into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Maureen, what do you mean, both?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Per Matthew, they're interested in
dialog: purchasing all of the work, some of
dialog: the furniture, as well as the
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (alarmed)
dialog: The house? What...what did you
dialog: tell him?
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: That we're open to exploring
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: (re: the game)
dialog: The Mets are staging a
dialog: comeback. They've got first
text: and third with no one out.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (suddenly agitated)
dialog: You're thinking of selling the
dialog: house? Why?
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: It's very expensive to keep this
dialog: place up. And we're spending more
text: time at the country house now.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But the country's yours.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Well, I had it before we were
dialog: married, but it's ours.
dialog: Everything is ours now.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM
text: She heads toward the living room. Danny limps after her.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (concerned)
dialog: You're selling ALL of the art?
dialog: Why? Dad...I think...do you want
dialog: to sell?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh come on! Cabrera just grounded
text: into a double play.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Matt set this up?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (distracted by the game)
dialog: I told him it was a family
dialog: discussion.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I think it is! I don't think you
dialog: should sell AT ALL. I'm telling
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I didn't expect you to get so
dialog: upset about it.
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I am upset about it!
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Why do you care?
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (suddenly emotional)
dialog: I don't know. We've lived here
dialog: for years.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You haven't. This is where
dialog: Matthew grew up. You lived in
dialog: Queens with your mother.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I lived here for a year when I was
dialog: sixteen.
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Your studio is here... They want
dialog: ALL the art work? I mean, Dad,
dialog: with a show here or there, your
dialog: work might become valuable.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That is true.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I say, No!
text: He hits his hand down on a table for emphasis.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Everyone in the family will be
dialog: consulted before we sell anything.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Matthew isn't here, you know.
text: Matthew isn't in the house NOW.
dialog: (wiping his eyes)
dialog: It's a Meyerowitz tradition, this
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: I guess I wouldn't know about
dialog: that.
text: Maureen storms out of the room.
text: We hear a door slam.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I didn't mean it like that.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: She gets sensitive about these
dialog: things. She feels like an
dialog: outsider and she doesn't have kids
dialog: of her own.
speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Was that L.J.? I always liked
dialog: L.J..
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: He says he had a prostate surgery,
dialog: I didn't know about.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And I really like his work.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: The early, experimental work is
dialog: terrific. You know, he and I

dialog: back in the late 60’s.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Uh huh. I love the 80's stuff.
dialog: Those bears.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You liked the bears? Hmm. I

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (can't hide his pleasure)
dialog: I have a herring-bone blazer and

scene_heading: INT. MOMA LOBBY. DAY
text: They enter the lobby, both in outdated -- and in the case
text: of Danny, ill-fitted -- tuxedos. Ahead: a spirited crowd
text: mingles around the exhibit. A few people in suits,

speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Dad, no one is in tuxes.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I think I see a couple of people.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Tell her to tell L.J. we're-DANNY

dialog: I'm going to go home.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Come on, Dad-Harold pulls away from Danny and hurries toward the

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: My father is Harold Meyerowitz, he

dialog: Also a sculptor.
text: The Gallery Girl shrugs.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Big night, huh?
dialog: Danny?!
speaker_heading: L.J. (O.S.)
text: L.J., late 60's, excitedly approaches from behind. He's in
text: a white tank top with a tailored blazer over it and suit
text: pants. A scarf tied around his ankle.
dialog: 34
text: Blue tinted glasses on his head. He walks over with Glenn

dialog: L.J.
dialog: (to the Gallery Girl)
dialog: This guy giving you trouble?
text: She laughs heartily.
dialog: L.J.

dialog: Danny, you were so damned young
dialog: the last time I saw you.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, last time I saw you was at
dialog: those Chinatown dinners you guys
dialog: would throw. Those were great, I
dialog: was living with Dad that year.
text: Glenn excuses himself and goes inside, greeted by guests.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: It was you and Matthew. Always
dialog: playing music. Your Dad was with
dialog: Julia, I was with Maya. Before
dialog: the divorces!
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, before his second divorce,
dialog: he'd already divorced my mom, but
dialog: yeah, those were fun dinners.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: (confused by the tuxedo)
dialog: Are you going somewhere after
dialog: this?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (muttering)
dialog: Dad said it was black tie.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: You know, Loretta's here.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: She is?

dialog: L.J.
dialog: (re: the tuxes)
dialog: Look at you. You guys are so
dialog: cute.

dialog: Come have a drink. We're having
dialog: Zubrowka. I just reread The
dialog: Razor's Edge -- it's Larry
text: Durrell's drink.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I find Maugham to be skillful
dialog: without being an artist, but I'll
dialog: sip a red wine, if you have.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: It's the Museum of Modern Art.
dialog: Dammit, they have everything.
text: Harold follows L.J. into the party. Danny starts to follow

dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to himself)
scene_heading: INT. MOMA RECEPTION AREA
text: Danny, again, assesses the very non-tuxedo crowd, and
text: attempts to wander the premises as unself-consciously as
text: possible. He nervously hums an indecipherable tune.
text: Amongst the sculptures, and old high 8 video of a young
text: girl (Loretta) on monitors, he sees a woman, 40's, in a
text: simple, elegant dress.
dialog: 36

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I came with my Dad.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (frowns, re: the tux)
dialog: Are you going somewhere after

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (here we go again)
dialog: No...no...
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Why are you so dressed up?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't know.

dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: How is your Dad?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He's with your dad now which makes

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She's in Easter Island so

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Oh, that's nice of you.

speaker_heading: DANNY
text: This is her dead ex-husband’s tux.

speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Yeah, that's hard, that stuff.

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: The work looks good. I don't know
dialog: that the presentation is helping.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: You think? Yeah, I think some of
text: the bears are not well served.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: In a sense, the work is more
dialog: intimate than the space. But,
dialog: hey, you're on a streak.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: (good naturedly)
dialog: Don't say that! Streaks end.

dialog: L.J.
dialog: How are you, old man?
dialog: Maureen?
dialog: How's
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Bard has approached me about a
dialog: show.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: Are you still teaching there?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm retired, but my grand-daughter
dialog: just started as a freshman. She's
dialog: making movies.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: That's what they're all doing now.
dialog: I say, don't teach 'em what we do,
dialog: there's no damn money in that.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, you seem to have found a
dialog: way.
text: Glenn Twitchell, the curator, approaches, his back to
dialog: Harold.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I hope it's OK, I invited
dialog: Sigourney to the dinner
dialog: afterwards.
dialog: 39
dialog: L.J.
dialog: Of course. I've known
dialog: Sigourney for twenty years.
dialog: Glenn, you remember-Good, good.
dialog: L.J.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: I hear a rave tomorrow from
dialog: Michael and Twitter has been
text: almost entirely glowing.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: We're going to have a good
dialog: day.
text: Harold sips his wine and smiles along, although he's not
text: part of the conversation.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: Glenn Twitchell, Harold
dialog: Meyerowitz. Harold, Glenn's the
dialog: curator here now.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (starts to correct him)
dialog: We've actually... Nice to
dialog: meet you.
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Wait, Harold Meyerowitz?
dialog: course. We've met -HAROLD
dialog: In the 70's --
dialog: Shit, of
speaker_heading: GLENN
dialog: It's been a long time. What
dialog: have you been doing?
dialog: Forgive me, I don't know.
dialog: Are you making art? Are you
dialog: in the City?
text: More people approach Glenn.
dialog: Excuse me.
speaker_heading: GLENN
text: L.J. gives Harold's shoulder a squeeze.
dialog: over the din:
dialog: Harold says oddly
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: How good are we?
dialog: L.J.
dialog: (mis-hearing)
dialog: How am I? I'm exhausted. This
dialog: show took it out of me physically
dialog: and emotionally...hold on a

text: He's mobbed by more guests.

scene_heading: INT. MOMA RECEPTION AREA
text: CUT TO: The old high 8 video work on a monitor. A young
text: girl with frizzy hair runs down an Upper West Side street.
text: It's cut in a fragmentary, stuttering way.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I remember you like that.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Yeah, I used to have mixed
dialog: feelings about being part of Dad's
dialog: art, but now I kind of love it.
dialog: You know, he dedicated the
dialog: catalogue to me.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's definitely a cool thing.
dialog: This whole thing is really cool.
dialog: It's special for me, I don't go
dialog: out like this generally.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: How's your family and everything?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well...Karen and I are splitting
text: up. Split up.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Oh shit, sorry. I'm doing the
dialog: same thing.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Really!
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Yeah, but it's good. He...he's a
dialog: good guy but can't get out of his
dialog: own way. But my girls are
dialog: handling it so great. How are you
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh, fine. You know, Karen and I
dialog: stayed together until Eliza went
dialog: to school, but also I just didn't
dialog: want to do what my Dad did, you
dialog: know? Failed marriages and...you
dialog: ever worry we're doing the same
dialog: thing as them?
dialog: 41
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Oh, but we're so different, Dan.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: So different. We were raised like
dialog: animals. We were feral! My worry
dialog: is that we're too different.
dialog: We're too close to our kids, don't
dialog: you think? Parents shouldn't be
dialog: best friends with their kids. I
dialog: mean, I don't think my girls will
dialog: ever move out!
text: Danny laughs.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, I secretly hoped that about
text: Eliza, but unfortunately she seems
dialog: pretty healthy in that area.
text: Loretta laughs. Danny smiles broadly, pleased she's so
text: engaged. Suddenly:
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: I want to go.
text: Danny startles.
dialog: Dad--
text: Harold is right behind him.
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Harold!
dialog: (identifying herself)
dialog: Loretta!
text: Loretta hugs him and kisses him warmly on the cheek.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh, Loretta. Hi. I didn't
dialog: recognize you at first.
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: I'm going.
speaker_heading: GUEST
dialog: (re: the video)
dialog: There's that little girl I keep
text: seeing running down 79th Street!
text: Loretta is swarmed by more well-wishers.
dialog: 42
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: I want to go.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (trying to keep it light)
dialog: Just a few more minutes, roomie?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm leaving.
text: Harold hurries toward the EXIT. Danny looks at Loretta,
text: who is distracted by the bigger group-Danny gazes toward the EXIT where his father is wrestling
text: open one of the big glass doors. Danny hesitates.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Um, Loretta-She doesn't hear him.
dialog: Loretta!
text: He politely waits for a moment.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: She smiles at him, still talking to the group.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: (strangely pantomiming
dialog: leaving)
dialog: I have to go!
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: Oh, no. You sure? You guys
dialog: aren't staying for the dinner?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't think we were invited to-LORETTA
dialog: (to her friends)
dialog: Excuse me for a second.
text: She touches Danny's arm, her face open and welcoming.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, I better...
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: OK. Well...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Great to see you.
dialog: He's old.
dialog: 43
dialog: So great.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
text: She kisses him on the cheek.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I got your hair again.
dialog: Bye.
speaker_heading: LORETTA
dialog: OK, bye Danny.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Danny hesitates. She turns back to her group.
text: he's blown it. He hurries after his father.
dialog: Danny knows
scene_heading: EXT. MOMA/5TH AVENUE. NIGHT
text: Danny is hit by a blast of cold air.
text: He looks around to see:
text: His father is gone.
text: Harold running toward 5th Avenue.
text: Danny takes off after his father, but with his limp and the
text: jump Harold has already gotten, he's quite a bit behind.
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Danny turns onto 5th Avenue. Harold is crossing the
text: street. Danny hurries, dodging traffic. Horns.
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Finally Danny catches up to him, out of breath.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (out of breath)
dialog: Dad! Did you hear me?
text: Harold doesn't answer.
dialog: Shit.
text: Danny holds his hip.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: They slowly walk together in silence.
dialog: rip:
text: Then Harold lets it
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Ultimately L.J. is a popular but
dialog: minor artist. There's a

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 44
speaker_heading: HAROLD (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you like the bears but it's
text: a reshuffling of obnoxious cliches,
dialog: like listening to music played
text: slightly off-key.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I didn't get to see it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: And the video work is embarrassing - I've never forgiven L.J. for
dialog: using Loretta in those pieces. You
dialog: don't do that to a child. And it's
text: a disturbing commentary on the
dialog: culture that truly ordinary work,
dialog: made mostly by his assistants, gets
dialog: reverent reviews by critics who
dialog: ought to know better. He's a
text: talented, pretentious enigma.
text: Silence as they continue to walk past the bright lights of
text: 5th Avenue stores and office buildings.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It was nice to see Loretta.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (brightening)
dialog: She was very happy to see me.
dialog: gave me quite a kiss.
dialog: She
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I did well, I was pretty funny, I
dialog: think. I didn't get her number or
dialog: anything. Maybe I can get L.J.'s
scene_heading: e-mail from you-HAROLD
dialog: I don’t feel comfortable giving it
dialog: out. Maybe there’s a work one.
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I met Sigourney Weaver who was very
dialog: friendly. She said, "Hi, I'm
dialog: Sigourney." I said, "Hi, I'm
dialog: Harold."
text: Danny waits, but there isn't more.
text: He looks for a cab.

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Have you thought about getting a
dialog: job?
text: Danny shrugs.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You've essentially never worked in
dialog: your life.
text: Danny nods.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I think you'd feel better about

text: Danny nods.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Do you ever think about playing
dialog: music again?
text: Danny shrugs.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maureen will be back next Thursday
dialog: and you should think about where
dialog: you're going to live. I mean, you
scene_heading: can stay a while longer, but-INT. HAROLD'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
text: A clock reads: 9:40. Danny, still in his tux, walks by the
text: piano and plays the opening chords of Van Halen's Jump.
text: He eats a sandwich and makes up the living room couch with
text: a sheet and pillow. Harold appears in the doorway. He
text: holds up black Vuarnet sunglasses.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maureen wanted me to remind you to
dialog: go through the boxes and things
dialog: upstairs because we're going to
dialog: start throwing things away. You

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Who's Joaquin?
speaker_heading: ELIZA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, I'm at Harold's. We went to
text: L.J. Shapiro's opening at MOMA.
speaker_heading: ELIZA'S VOICE
dialog: Was it fun?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, for a little while.
speaker_heading: ELIZA'S VOICE
dialog: You having fun with Grampa?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I might go stay at Jean's in
dialog: Rochester for a while. I'll be
dialog: closer to you, but don't worry!
speaker_heading: ELIZA'S VOICE
dialog: Ha. OK. We're going to see this
text: band and then there's a party.

speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: ELIZA'S VOICE

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: RANDY
text: These guys are six months behind.
text: Matt hands him a piece of paper.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's why I'm here. I put

speaker_heading: RANDY

speaker_heading: MATT

dialog: You realize you have a steam room
dialog: and a sauna?
text: Randy nods innocently.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We have to make some decisions.
dialog: (wiping plaster dust off
dialog: his shoulder)
dialog: It's too late to take out the

dialog: grand.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You look tired.
text: Matt's phone rings.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I can’t sleep on the red-eye.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Let's get you a coffee.
text: Matt checks his phone.
dialog: Dad.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I’m glad you’re here, Matt.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m not leaving until we’ve

text: Hammering. Plaster dust drifts down on them.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (marveling)
dialog: There are different people here
dialog: every day.

dialog: How's your kid?

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Good. I'm in a fight with my wife
dialog: right now, but...

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And you're not going on tour any

dialog: Right?
speaker_heading: RANDY
text: Matt sips the coffee and
dialog: It's nice.
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: It's my own espresso bean. SEE,
dialog: I'm doing everything I can to make
dialog: a buck. The coffee will pay for
dialog: the pool!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That might be too much pressure to

text: He looks at it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Here’s what we’re going to do.
dialog: We’re going to get you the pool.
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: RANDY
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But not this year. We’re going to

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: But can’t I afford--
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: The income from the rentals
dialog: will cover the real estate

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: These are yours. They were in the

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Are you all right?
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It wasn't his fault.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shall we go in?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm not eating here.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Because they wouldn't seat

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, Brian and James, who
dialog: you met--
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: They were a very charming,

dialog: And smart about the work. They
dialog: were familiar with Gilded Halfwing.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yes, James says they liked the
dialog: work very much and they love the

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: For the work too?

speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: He and Karen have separated.
speaker_heading: MATT

dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I took him in, but now he's with

dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Apparently his mother moved to
dialog: Florida, which I didn’t know. Did
dialog: you know that?
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: She’s also still angry at me
dialog: apparently. You know, your
dialog: brother and sister have
dialog: helped organize a show for

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: A retrospective?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: A retrospective of the faculty,
dialog: yes.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Like a group show?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: There are other artists, yes, but

dialog: Sounds good. Congratulations.

dialog: You purchased the property in 1973

dialog: Danny thinks after this show, my
dialog: work could appreciate considerably
dialog: in value and that we should wait.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: You just told me Danny doesn't
dialog: want to sell at all. Dad,
dialog: whatever happens at Bard, you
dialog: can't afford the real estate taxesGABE

speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: GABE
dialog: I'm just giving examples--
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (sternly to Gabe)
dialog: Mercedes has been with us

text: not letting her go.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (re: Gabe)
dialog: Am I paying for him?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, he's doing this as a favor to
dialog: me. Gabe's specialty is not my
dialog: specialty. I'm in personal
dialog: wealth.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Something I wouldn't know
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Gabe would only get paid

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm not giving Gabe anything.
dialog: Absolutely not. And I’m not

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (vaguely)
dialog: If I'm in town...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I think I'm going to show the

dialog: piece I made when you used to sit
dialog: on the floor and watch me work.
dialog: You remember that?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You've told me this before, and I
dialog: don't remember it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You would hand me tools and make
dialog: suggestions as if you too were the

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, I wasn't.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It was originally untitled,
dialog: but I'm going to call it
dialog: "Matthew."
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: I'd like to see Eliza too. She
dialog: sent me her movie which I thought
dialog: was really good. Did you like it?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: At that time I thought you might
dialog: be interested in sculpture. Or
dialog: maybe an actor or a comic. You
dialog: were a very talented mimic.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I do the voices of a lot of my coworkers which cracks people up at
dialog: the firm.
dialog: (doing a voice)
dialog: "I'm going to run downstairs for
dialog: an esmoke." You don't know Ezra,
dialog: but that's a pretty good
dialog: imitation.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You were also very musical like
dialog: Danny.
dialog: 63
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But Danny could really play.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: He was chubby as a kid but
dialog: surprisingly dexterous. No, that's
dialog: true, Danny was quite gifted. I
dialog: don't know why he didn't pursue it.
dialog: I know he raised a child, but in
dialog: this day and age, it's possible to
dialog: do both.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: There are so many other things
dialog: that factor in, don't you think?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I suppose that's true, he had a
dialog: difficult mother.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And poor Jean, I feel like she
dialog: just opted out of...life. Has
dialog: Jean ever had a boyfriend?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Or girlfriend?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Apparently her office-movies
dialog: show real ability.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I thought you'd do something
dialog: artistic.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I work with artists.
dialog: the temperament.
dialog: I understand
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maybe Eliza will be my heir in that
dialog: department. Although she seems
dialog: more commercially minded. And
dialog: potentially a lesbian.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Really? I didn't get that.
dialog: (clears his throat)
dialog: You know, I think I mentioned to
dialog: you, I left the company I was with

dialog: might put me back on the
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It was scary, and a big
dialog: change, but things have
dialog: settled and we're doing
dialog: really well. A lot of our

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Live it up.
speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: That's the sweater, I think.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Handsome boy. Has the Meyerowitz

dialog: this point.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah, but New York isn’t
dialog: what it was. My artist

speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: TONY’S VOICE
dialog: He comes on weekends. Is this a
dialog: weekend?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: In three days it's a weekend.
speaker_heading: TONY’S VOICE
dialog: Three days! That's three weeks.

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, sweetheart, it's three days.
dialog: Does...does Jim stay over?
speaker_heading: TONY’S VOICE

speaker_heading: TONY'S VOICE

text: Danny and Jean are talking over each other.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Danny, stop, it doesn't

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Maybe if he hears it--
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (to Harold)
dialog: Do you know who this is?
dialog: 96
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (with difficulty)
dialog: It's all right.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Do you remember when you said:
dialog: "Danny."
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: You have to stop giving him the
dialog: answers.
text: Matt looks between his siblings and his Dad with confusion.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (pointing at Matt)
dialog: Who is this?
text: We SWING over to find Matt.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (vaguely)
dialog: It's all right.
dialog: Oh...no.
dialog: It’s Matt.
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He just got
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Stop giving him the answers.
text: A bald male nurse, 40's, enters. The nurse looks at Harold
text: and says as if speaking to a child.
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: How are we doing?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: It's all right.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Where's Pam?
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Pam Engels or Pam Chin?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don't know? I was JUST here and
dialog: he knew what a Blackberry was and
dialog: could say my name and everything.
dialog: (to Danny and Jean)
dialog: We talked about his show.
dialog: 97
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You were here?
dialog: (and then)
dialog: Where were you?
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Sometimes it can take a little
dialog: while to come back from these
dialog: surgeries.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (upset)
dialog: No, he was already BACK!
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: I'm sorry, who are you?
dialog: everybody?
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: I just got here.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We're his kids.
dialog: Who is
dialog: Where's Pam?
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: I wasn't here, so I don't know.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I WAS! That's what I'm telling
dialog: you. Where's Pam?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: Why didn't you call?
dialog: you go?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I was heading back to the
dialog: City for a meeting, but I
dialog: turned around when Pam
dialog: called--
dialog: Where did
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Sometimes tiredness can
dialog: cause this. And his blood
text: pressure is quite high.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: This isn't tiredness! Something
dialog: is WRONG. Can't we find Pam?!
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: (offended)
dialog: No, I'm the charge nurse.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to Matt)
dialog: You were here. Why didn't
dialog: you call us?
dialog: 98
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (sharply to Danny)
dialog: Because it never occurred to me!
dialog: OK?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Where's Dr. Soni?
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
text: She's on her rounds.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Something is happening to my
dialog: father! I want Pam!
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: Ok, you're going to have to stop
text: shouting.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We’re sorry, he’s just emotional.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: It's our Dad.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I’m not emotional, Danny, I
dialog: want Pam.
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Right now, we're waiting for a
text: neurologist to read his EEG for
dialog: brainwave activity.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: When will that happen?
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: I don't know. It's being read in
dialog: India.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh, because of...
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: In the meantime, I'm going to give
dialog: him Lotensin for his high blood
dialog: pressure. I'll be right back.
text: He leaves.
text: Matt turns to Danny and Jean.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He's giving him Lotensin. What did
dialog: he get before for his blood
dialog: pressure?
dialog: 99
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Umm...the other nurse came
dialog: through. She did something.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Yeah, she seemed to know-MATT
dialog: Did you write it down?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I can't remember...
dialog: Me neither.
speaker_heading: JEAN
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (furious)
dialog: From now on everything gets
dialog: written down. Do you understand?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: It's one thing. You can read what
dialog: number it is now. He's alive.
dialog: Jesus. These people do this for a
dialog: living.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: These people change every five
dialog: minutes. If we're not paying
dialog: attention he might DIE. Do you
dialog: understand THAT?
text: Danny looks like he’s about to cry like a scolded child.
dialog: I do.
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'll write everything down.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: EVERYTHING.
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Sorry!
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: 100
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (yells)
dialog: It's OK!
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: It’s nice to see you, Matt.
speaker_heading: DR. SONI (V.O.)
dialog: The lost speech could be because
dialog: of frequent or partial seizures.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM
text: Dr. Soni addresses the three siblings who listen
text: attentively, scribbling in pads in their laps.
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: An up and down is common but this
text: is more of a down than expected.
dialog: If it was his heart, we'd shock him
dialog: out of it, but you can't shock the
dialog: brain in these cases so we need to
dialog: quiet the brain.
text: The three siblings turn the pages in their books almost in
dialog: unison but not quite.
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: We're putting him in a barbiturate
dialog: coma with a combination of Propofol
text: and Pentobarbital or Phenobarbital.
dialog: Probably Pento. I want to be
dialog: aggressive.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Will he be OK?
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: Think of it like shutting down a
text: computer and then restarting. Or
dialog: if you're a luddite like me, like
text: a grain of sand becoming a pearl.
text: Jean laughs politely.
dialog: strangely.
text: Danny and Matt look at her
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Will he be OK?
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: Well, it's not what we'd hope at
dialog: this stage.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 101
speaker_heading: DR. SONI (CONT'D)
dialog: Because he'll be completely
dialog: sedated we'll need to intubate.
dialog: (warmly)
dialog: I want you to know, we're doing
dialog: our very best. We want to see
dialog: your father walking out of here
dialog: soon.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Thank you, Dr. Soni.
text: She smiles and heads toward the door.
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: Now, I'm going to be on vacation
text: for three weeks starting tomorrow-They all immediately stand up.
speaker_heading: MATT/DANNY/JEAN
dialog: What?!/What?!/Are you serious?
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: You'll be in very good care. Dr.
text: Brotman will be taking over-Danny, standing, tries writing on his pad, using his lifted
dialog: leg for support.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Dr. Brotman...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM HALLWAY
text: Soni walks briskly down the hall, the three siblings
text: chasing her.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Do you have to go?
dialog: you just push it?
dialog: Can't
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: We need you here.
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: God, no, my husband will divorce
dialog: me! We’re going to China.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You're putting our Dad in a coma
dialog: and then leaving us?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Matt, it's not like that.
dialog: (then not sure)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 102
speaker_heading: DANNY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not, right Dr. Soni?
dialog: not like that.
dialog: It's
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: Well, technically, yes, it's that.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You can't do that to us.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: First Pam, now you?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Can we get Pam back at least?
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: I'm not in charge of the nurse
dialog: assignments.
dialog: (aside to a passing man)
dialog: Hi, Doctor Liu.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It doesn't feel fair, Dr. Soni,
dialog: that you can just live your live
dialog: normally while our Dad is lying
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: DR. SONI
dialog: (hesitates)
dialog: Maybe it isn't.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY
text: Matt and Danny end up next to each another, walking down
text: the hall. Danny hums an indecipherable tune.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dad said you started your own
dialog: company?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah, a couple of other guys
dialog: and me decided to--
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (trying to engage)
dialog: So, how does that work? Do
dialog: you just tell your boss,
dialog: like--?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Well, I was one of the partners so
dialog: I didn't technically have a boss-DANNY
dialog: Right, no...so you got a better
dialog: offer--
dialog: 103
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, there was no offer, that's
dialog: what was so scary, we were
dialog: creating our own opportunity-DANNY
dialog: Because you wanted something smallerMATT
dialog: Bigger. Many of the firm's clients
dialog: came with us-DANNY
text: Which was surprising-They reach an elevator.
text: Matt hits the button.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, we expected it. We can't
dialog: legally ask the clients to come
dialog: with us, but we trusted-DANNY
dialog: But they don't have much choice-MATT
dialog: It's totally their choice-DANNY
dialog: No, I know, because you have their
speaker_heading: money-MATT
dialog: Well, their money is with the
dialog: firm. But their money is in
text: investments or a bank-The elevator arrives.
text: They get on.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I understand. My buddy, Ptolemy,
dialog: he lives across the street, or
dialog: lived across the street from where
dialog: I lived-MATT
dialog: Dad told me about your...Karen,
dialog: I'm sorry. I've also--
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ptolemy is like you, he works in
dialog: a...
dialog: (fishing for it)
dialog: Arbitrage.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah, that's not what I do.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, I wasn't saying-- But Ptolemy
dialog: said the system is rigged from the
dialog: inside-MATT
dialog: That's not entirely true--
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But mostly--
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So, this is an exciting time for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: How's your boy?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Good, Victoria and I are having
dialog: some problems.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I never met her.
dialog: separated.
dialog: Karen and I
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I know, I just said I was sorry.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did you?
dialog: (pause)
dialog: I'm sorry too.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (moving on)
dialog: I liked Eliza's movie!
speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: She sent it to you?
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY
text: They get off the elevator and head through the lobby toward
text: the parking lot.

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (to Danny)
dialog: Are you limping?
text: Jean rises from a bench where she's been waiting for them.
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: JEAN
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's always stiff after I've been
dialog: sitting.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You should see the other dog.
dialog: What?
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I borrowed an old cane of Maureen’s
dialog: dead ex-husband, but it's not

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

text: Danny is lying between two chairs, asleep. He dips slowly
text: between the divide in chairs. A hand gently rustles his

text: gathers his things.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (sleepily, but attentive)
dialog: The night nurse today is named
dialog: Rich. He's OK, but doesn't really

dialog: book.
text: CUT TO: A nurse opens a curtain. Sunlight through the
text: window. Jean is woken by Matt who relieves her.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: His blood pressure dropped so they
text: put him on a Levophed drip, but
dialog: that’s hard on his kidneys, so
dialog: make sure they keep him hydrated
dialog: with the IV...
text: Matt nods and takes her place at their Dad's side.
text: CUT TO: Matt works on a stack of tax documents with his
text: calculator. He hears laughter. He gazes into the hallway.

text: They chat casually.
speaker_heading: NURSE #1

dialog: Oh, shit.
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GONZALEZ
dialog: Unfortunately the longer
dialog: he’s here the more
dialog: susceptible he is to
dialog: infection.
dialog: 108
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: What about his brain?
dialog: an EEG?
dialog: Do we have
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GONZALEZ
dialog: This is a different unit, we're in
dialog: the ICU, so I don't have those
dialog: answers as of yet.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: So, now we're in the right unit to
dialog: treat his sepsis, but the wrong
dialog: unit to treat his head?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GONZALEZ
dialog: (nods)
dialog: They have a call in to a
dialog: neurologist. People rarely come
dialog: in on weekends.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Do people not generally get sick
dialog: on weekends?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR GONZALEZ
dialog: We're working on getting you those
dialog: answers.
text: The doctor hands Matthew a pamphlet.

speaker_heading: DOCTOR GONZALEZ
dialog: This is a helpful summary of the

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: He told me he liked this when I

speaker_heading: TONY (O.S.)

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA

text: yogurt on his tray.
dialog: 110
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (sitting)
dialog: I'm oddly growing fond of this
dialog: cafeteria, like I’d almost come
dialog: here just anyway to eat. How’s
dialog: your boy?
speaker_heading: MATT
text: She fucking gets in his head.
dialog: He’s always hanging up on me now.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Call him back.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I don’t want to call him back, it
dialog: makes me feel bad.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He’s five years old. They hate
dialog: phones. Eliza, when you were that
dialog: age you’d never talk on the phone.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: She makes it too difficult. I
dialog: don’t know, sometimes I think
dialog: maybe I sit this kid out and start
text: another family and then he finds
dialog: me when he’s twenty-one. Let him
dialog: come to me.
text: Danny gets up to grab napkins from another table.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He’s not a girl you’re trying to
dialog: trick into dating you.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Dad, your limp is worse.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's always stiff after I've been
dialog: sitting.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: I was looking on-line, it could be
dialog: your hip.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's my back.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We should get you checked
dialog: out.
dialog: 111
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don't have time to see a doctor
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: We're already AT a doctor.

text: Danny sits back down.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I know what it is, OK?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It's...I...I mean I
dialog: basically KNOW.
speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: Dad, you got to deal with
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Yeah, Dan, I mean, look at Dad.
text: He ignored his thing and-DANNY
dialog: Just let me eat my fucking banana,
dialog: OK?!
text: Matt and Eliza share a quick smile.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And call your son!
text: Matt hesitates and slowly gets up to make the call.
scene_heading: EXT. MAUREEN'S DRIVEWAY. LATE DAY
text: Maureen pulls into the gravel nodding hello to Matt who
text: stretches before a run.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Hi, Maureen.
text: She drives past Matt. Matt continues to loosen up as we
text: watch her car slowly veer onto the grass and roll down into
text: a tree. Matt turns when he hears the soft impact.
scene_heading: INT. MAUREEN’S HOUSE. KITCHEN
text: It's filled with dusty appliances, yogurt containers full of
text: tacks and coins, faded photos and outdated menus crookedly
text: affixed with random refrigerator magnets. Matt finds a musty
text: water pitcher with an old filter and fills it.
dialog: 112
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: It's a shame the Dad is going to
dialog: miss the opening tomorrow. He was
dialog: really looking forward to it.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Dad asked me to say something. I
dialog: was going to ask Danny and Jean
dialog: too.
text: He removes some mismatched bowls from a cabinet, looking
text: for glasses. A Popov vodka bottle is stashed in the back.
text: He turns around. Maureen quickly averts her eyes. Matt
text: hesitates and takes the bottle.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: He never would have expected you
dialog: to have shown up. We were trying
dialog: to figure it out, have you ever
dialog: even been to this house before?
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: MATT
text: He pours her and him a glass of vodka. She hesitates, but
text: takes it. She holds a frozen pack of peas to the bruise on
text: her face.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: The Dad always hoped for a visit
dialog: but I guess you always had a lot to
dialog: do in the City when you came to
dialog: town. And us not being A-list
dialog: parents and all. Danny and Jean,
dialog: of course, are here all the time,
dialog: but that’s less exciting for the
dialog: Dad.
text: Matt drinks his vodka.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I reached out to some of his old
dialog: friends who are going to come
dialog: visit.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: (rising)
dialog: I hope they understand they'll be
dialog: looking at a sleeping man. Hello
dialog: Andy Warhol!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I explained that.
dialog: words.
dialog: In so many
dialog: 113
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: I spoke to the neurologist, Dr.
dialog: Diebert, who seems very
dialog: knowledgeable, but has no upper lip
dialog: to speak of, and if Harold survives
dialog: the infection, they have no idea
dialog: what person will be there when he
dialog: wakes up. Maybe he'll be Brad
dialog: Pitt. Or Neruda. Or Joe the
dialog: Plumber.
dialog: (with real feeling, but
dialog: dramatically)
dialog: I just want him to be Harold.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (changing the subject)
dialog: Have you looked over the documents
dialog: I sent you?
text: Maureen rises and retrieves an envelope from a drawer.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Yes and given where we are with
dialog: the Dad...and the Manhattan house
dialog: is more than we need right now,
dialog: I’ve taken your counsel, and I
dialog: think selling the house and art to
dialog: James and Brian is the right thing
dialog: to do. I signed the places you
dialog: marked for me.

dialog: don’t know, there’s been so much

speaker_heading: MAUREEN
dialog: Really they have no power anyway.
dialog: I don’t know what happened to them

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: Nobody took care of them.
text: Maureen nods.
speaker_heading: MAUREEN

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Paul came.
speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: MATT

dialog: (Jean's Story)
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
text: Jean wanders around the cement columns as she talks.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I wrote a short story about this
dialog: once, but I never finished it and
dialog: it wasn't very good. You remember
dialog: that summer I visited Dad on
dialog: Martha's Vineyard? Dad never
dialog: invited me or Danny-Never.
speaker_heading: DANNY (O.S.)
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: --that summer I was a camp
dialog: counselor at French Woods in
dialog: Vermont--
speaker_heading: JEAN
scene_heading: --to the summer places but-DANNY (O.S.)
dialog: Was that the one with Alisa
dialog: Lirtzman?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: No, that was Thoreau. I was only
dialog: at this one for one summer-- And I
dialog: had two days off, and I called him
dialog: and he couldn't say, No. He must
dialog: have gotten permission from your
dialog: mother-- It wasn't as convenient
dialog: as I had thought.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 116
speaker_heading: JEAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I had to take two buses and a
dialog: ferry. When I arrived nobody met
dialog: me. I hitchhiked to the other side
dialog: of the island. When I got to the
dialog: house it was already night and the
dialog: adults were all going out for
dialog: dinner. Dad and your Mom and L.J.
dialog: and Maya and Paul and Lori. Julia
dialog: said something about me having my
dialog: bags in the way. They were happy
dialog: to have a baby-sitter, so they left
dialog: me with the kids. You were there,
text: Matthew, and Loretta and some other
dialog: kids I didn't know. We watched
text: Three's Company on TV. The next
dialog: day, Dad played tennis and worked
dialog: in his studio. I went down to the
dialog: beach with the kids. I got to swim
dialog: in the ocean which was really
dialog: special for me. I loved that.
dialog: Later, I showered in the outdoor
dialog: shower with my suit on. And I
dialog: realized someone was watching me.
text: It was Paul. He smiled at me,
dialog: almost politely and then he lowered
text: his tight bathing suit, took out
text: his penis and started stroking it.
dialog: Oh God.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Paul did?!
speaker_heading: DANNY
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I watched him until he finished.
text: Then he walked away.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Did you tell anyone?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I told Dad that night and he asked
dialog: if Paul had touched me and I said,
dialog: No. He thought we should probably
dialog: just leave it then, they were going
dialog: back to the City soon anyway. But
dialog: that if Paul did it again, he'd
text: punch him in the nose. The next
dialog: day when I was leaving, I looked
dialog: around for Dad to say goodbye, but
dialog: he was playing tennis. I thought
dialog: about telling your Mom, Matthew,
dialog: but I was afraid she'd get angry at
dialog: me. I remember crying on my way to
dialog: the ferry.
dialog: 117
text: Matt and Danny look stunned.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Jean, can I ask you a question?
dialog: Why do you always show up for Dad?
dialog: Why are you always HERE?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: (shrugs and says matterof-factly)
dialog: Because I’m a decent person. Even
dialog: though he never took care of
dialog: us...it’s what you do. Besides, I
dialog: like hanging out with you guys.
text: Matt and Danny awkwardly try to hug her.
dialog: away.

speaker_heading: DANNY (O.S.)
dialog: Do we kick the shit out of him?
speaker_heading: MATT (O.S.)
dialog: He's eighty. We'd kill him.
text: Danny and Matt watch from a distance.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That's true. Or hurt him very
dialog: badly.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And neither of us can take that
dialog: nurse.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That's for sure.
dialog: (starting toward the
dialog: room)

scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT
text: Matthew grabs a wooden branch, walks over, and smashes it

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: But good too!
dialog: (grabbing a rock)
dialog: You got to try this.
dialog: Oww!
text: Danny comes forward, brandishing his metal cane and smashes
text: the roof with it. Danny looks at it, bent.
speaker_heading: DANNY
text: Shit, this is Maureen’s dead exhusband’s cane.

speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (suddenly)
text: Pam is talking to another nurse in the hallway. She

text: toward her bursting with enthusiasm. They both hug her.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Last night his blood
dialog: pressure was at 173 but they
dialog: gave him Hydrolozene--
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And an extra dose of
dialog: Lopressor--
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And got it down to 155.
dialog: Oh good.
speaker_heading: PAM
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That sounds OK? He's also
dialog: on Kepra and Morphine and...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's in our notes.

speaker_heading: PAM
speaker_heading: MATT

speaker_heading: DANNY

speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: Pento actually-DANNY

text: He has dementia.
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (to Jean)
dialog: We thought you'd be happy.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: Why would I be happy about this?
dialog: You smashed a sick old man's car.
dialog: (re: Danny's hand)
dialog: Let's get you a bandage.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (jumping up and down)
dialog: I don't want a bandage. I want to

speaker_heading: ELIZA
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MATT
text: He has dementia.
speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: he molested Jean.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: He didn't molest me.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (losing steam)
dialog: But let's not minimize it, Jean.
dialog: What he did was shitty and
dialog: damaging and I don't know...that
dialog: same asshole is in there
dialog: somewhere... Right? Beneath the
dialog: dementia.
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I’m glad you guys feel better.
dialog: Unfortunately I’m still fucked up.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Do you want to take a swing?
speaker_heading: JEAN
dialog: I could smash every car in this
dialog: parking lot and burn the hospital
dialog: down and it wouldn’t un-fuck me
dialog: up.

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You would've stayed.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I probably would've, yeah. But I

dialog: care of yourself.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, he can't, Matt. That's why
text: he's where he is now.
dialog: (beating himself up)
dialog: I should've been able to tell
dialog: something was wrong. I just
dialog: thought he was getting old...
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Shit, I yelled at him. The guy

speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah? Me too. You know, I've
dialog: wanted to apologize for a long
dialog: time.
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: MATT
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I'm pissed at myself because when
dialog: Dad kicked me out of the house and
dialog: I moved back with my mom, you
dialog: really made an effort to hang out
dialog: and I kind of blew you off. And I
dialog: feel like I fucked that up. I

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: you maybe also were critical of me
dialog: for quitting piano and-MATT
dialog: No, no, no. You were my big
dialog: brother, I looked up to you.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I quit because it was my protest.
dialog: OK?
dialog: OK.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Like McEnroe.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: And also...because it was

dialog: were...bleeding.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: I can understand that.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Can you? Cause my feeling about
dialog: you is you can't. It's not your

dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: A few years ago, when Karen and I
dialog: had you over to our house when you
dialog: were in town and I never heard
dialog: from you afterwards. Maybe you
dialog: didn't like the food or Karen or I
dialog: insulted you in some way. Karen

speaker_heading: DANNY

dialog: that.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well, even in life, you can make an
dialog: effort. Write an e-mail from one
dialog: of your phones. But, I guess
dialog: you're fine making no effort with
dialog: family. You say you have guilt,
dialog: but...
speaker_heading: MATT

dialog: You know what: I'm tired of
dialog: apologizing for doing well.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ptolemy asked me why you never
dialog: talk Dad's work up to your wealthy
dialog: clients. He says you could be
dialog: really helpful, that it's all
dialog: perception. You know, he's a good
dialog: artist and there's no reason he
dialog: isn't as well known as L.J.!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Maybe it's not my responsibility
dialog: to help Dad. Maybe THAT.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: No, it's what you DO.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And ALSO maybe he's not so great.
dialog: Maybe he's undiscovered for a
dialog: reason. Maybe THAT! The truth is
dialog: we DON'T KNOW, Danny. We were
text: brainwashed.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why are you so angry at him
dialog: anyway. He loves everything you
dialog: do.
dialog: Does he?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: He doesn't tell me that.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He tells ME. I should be angry at
dialog: him. I should hate him for
dialog: treating me and Jean like second
dialog: class citizens.
dialog: 133
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Then why don't you?!
dialog: You SHOULD.
text: He holds Danny's shoulder again, and says more tenderly.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Listen, you and Jean are going to
dialog: get some money. We got a great
dialog: deal on the house and all of the
dialog: art and I’m giving my share to both
dialog: of you. It doesn’t make up for
dialog: everything but you guys really
dialog: deserve this.
text: Danny slips from Matt's grasp, angry.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Dad said this was a family
dialog: discussion! Wait...did this...did
dialog: this happen already?
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It’s done.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: He told me we’d decide
dialog: together. And you do this
dialog: when he can’t say
dialog: anything... He told me,
dialog: Matt. You weren’t there.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: If we didn’t do something, we'd be
dialog: spending the next few years
text: throwing his work in dumpsters.
dialog: This way we get something for it.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I don’t care about money. That
dialog: house, that work MEANS something
dialog: to me.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You should embrace this. I should
dialog: be the one who cares. I grew up
dialog: there. That’s MY house. I SHOULD
dialog: care.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Then why don’t you?
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Because...I don’t know... You’re
dialog: probably right, I should care.
dialog: Maybe I do... Maybe I do...
dialog: (hesitates)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 134
speaker_heading: MATT (CONT'D)
dialog: But this makes sense, they're going
text: to donate the art as a tax writeoff. James's family owns a series
dialog: of retirement communities around
speaker_heading: the country-DANNY
dialog: How could you do this to him? Who
dialog: could even dream up such a plan?!
dialog: Me!
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: It's what I do for a living.
text: Danny shoves Matt.
text: Matt shoves him back.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Ptolemy said you guys make
dialog: yourselves indispensable to
dialog: vulnerable rich people.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Why don't you tell me more about my
dialog: business? Danny, I really want YOU
dialog: or DAD or FUCKING Ptolemy to tell
dialog: ME about what I do every day for a
dialog: living.
text: Matt pushes Danny.
dialog: Oww!
text: Danny kicks him in the leg.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: You kicked me in the shin.
text: And now they're scuffling awkwardly.
speaker_heading: MATT

dialog: What's wrong with you two?
text: They're rolling on the grass. Eliza and Jean try to stop

text: them apart in headlocks.
dialog: L.J.
dialog: Goddamn it, Meyerowitzes.

speaker_heading: MATT (V.O.)
dialog: We want to thank Bard for making
dialog: this show happen.
scene_heading: INT. BARD GALLERY
text: Matt, bloody, his suit torn, and still picking grass out of
text: his hair addresses the crowd. He consults note cards and
text: talks smoothly and professionally despite his appearance.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: And thank many of you for making
dialog: the trip. My Dad, and I'm sure
dialog: every artist involved in this
dialog: show, would be really pleased.
text: Jean indicates for him to address the bleeding coming from
text: his nose. Matt wipes it on his arm.
dialog: 136
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: My father was a teacher here for
dialog: thirty-three years so this is
dialog: particularly special for him. And
dialog: this piece is special for me as
dialog: it's called Matthew. My father
dialog: tells a story of how this piece
dialog: came to be. How I would sit on
text: the hardwood floor of his studio,
dialog: getting nails in my ass, and hand
dialog: him tools and make suggestions and
dialog: he would let me help or let me
dialog: THINK I was helping and when it
dialog: was done he said we had made it
dialog: together. Even though I don’t
dialog: remember this time, he does. But
dialog: I remember that feeling. Of being
dialog: very proud. Of wanting to be an
dialog: artist like my dad. Of being
dialog: included -- he was interested in
dialog: me, he...loved me...
text: (he wipes tears from his
dialog: face)
dialog: I'm sorry, I don't know why I'm...
dialog: I've been angry at him for so much
dialog: of my adult life. I guess I was
dialog: trying to outrun him. But I didn’t
dialog: -- I’m still that boy helping my
dialog: Dad. And he loved me. Even if it
dialog: wasn’t how I wanted him to love me,
dialog: he loved me. And I’ve given away
dialog: his life’s work--it’s gone...
dialog: (to Danny and Jean)
dialog: I’m sorry. And if Dad doesn’t
dialog: make it, he and I aren’t OK. We
dialog: never got to be OK...
text: Danny is there beside him now, holding Matt in his arms.
text: Matt continues to cry like a baby.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: (to the audience, trying
dialog: to sound intelligible,
dialog: but just crying)
dialog: Danny, do you want to say a few
dialog: words...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yes, thank you, Matthew.
text: He holds out the mike for Danny to take.
text: anticipating a punch.
text: Danny flinches,
dialog: 137
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: No, I'm giving this to you...
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Oh, I see, OK.
text: Danny takes the mike. Eliza and Jean help Matt to a bench.
text: Now, Danny, also bloody, clothes torn, looks petrified. He
text: hums an indecipherable tune. He leans on the back of a
dialog: chair for support.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You'll have to bear with me as I'm
dialog: not a good public speaker and also
dialog: I've never done it. It's something
dialog: I've gone to great pains to avoid.
dialog: When I used to perform music in
dialog: front of an audience it was just
dialog: too excruciating. The reward was
dialog: just not worth the self-hatred.
dialog: Not to mention, unlike my brother,
dialog: Matthew, I find this particular
dialog: piece painful because it was during
dialog: a time I wasn't really speaking to
dialog: my Dad. He had left my mother and
dialog: Jean and me, gotten remarried to
dialog: Matt's mom whom we did not like.
dialog: Again, unlike Matt, I was NOT
dialog: included in the art-making process,
dialog: it wasn't MINE too... This piece
dialog: is NOT called Danny. In fact,
dialog: there are NO Danny's.
dialog: Or Jeans!
speaker_heading: JEAN (O.S.)
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: For me, it's a symbol of what I
dialog: will NEVER be able to do. A club I
dialog: will NEVER be admitted to. But Dad
dialog: and I have gotten to spend more
dialog: time together as adults and that's
dialog: been good, I think we have gotten
dialog: closer. We've certainly watched a
dialog: lot of Mets games. Some of you
dialog: know, my Dad is in a hospital in
dialog: Pittsfield and we don't know how
dialog: it's all going to go. Our doctor's
dialog: in China and the only really good
dialog: nurse got reassigned to a different
dialog: floor. Maybe I need to believe my
dialog: Dad was a genius because I don't
dialog: want his life to be worthless.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 138
speaker_heading: DANNY (CONT'D)
dialog: If he's not a great artist, that
dialog: means he was just a prick. I think
dialog: he's good, though. I think he
dialog: deserved more attention than he
dialog: got. I think that's true. Matt?
text: Matt, eyes bloodshot, face splotchy, shrugs.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I wish he'd had more success
dialog: because it would have made his
dialog: life easier. Even if that kind of
dialog: thing doesn't ultimately mean
dialog: much. I don't know, L.J.?
dialog: L.J.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't know either.
dialog: I'd tell you.
dialog: If I did,
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Also, I'm really proud of my
