dialog: and
dialog: Adam Bezark
dialog: January 11, 1995
speaker_heading: EXTERIOR/ENTRANCE
text: As we stroll down the elegant Hollywood Boulevard at
dialog: Universal Studios Florida, one particular facade catches
text: our eye. It's a 1940s HOLLYWOOD OFFICE BUILDING that
dialog: might have been commissioned by Howard Hughes in his
text: prime. The SIGN over the ENTRANCE reads:
speaker_heading: Cyberdyne Systems
text: The graphic style is hi-tech modern, indicating that
text: Cyberdyne must be a new tenant. But even more compelling
text: is the SIGN that "morphs" out of the concrete in front of
text: the building. Rising on a pylon, the sign lets us know
dialog: what we're really here to see:
speaker_heading: T2/3D
text: We walk through the doors into the dark, chilly lobby.
scene_heading: INTERIOR QUEUE: CYBERDYNE LOBBY
text: Once inside the building, it's as though we've stepped
text: into another world. All traces of the gracious 1940s
text: design have been obliterated by the current tenant.
text: The CYBERDYNE LOBBY is an ultramodern statement in
text: polished gray concrete, with a rustic terrazzo floor. The
text: Cyberdyne Systems LOGO hangs on the back wall. A smaller
text: SIGN inside the lobby reads:
scene_heading: CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS
dialog: Special Projects Division - Authorized Personnel Only
scene_heading: TODAY'S SCHEDULE:
dialog: Demonstration of New Technologies
dialog: Invited Guests Only
text: We enter the QUEUE AREA, a cheerless world of polished
text: gray concrete and brushed stainless steel accents. A
text: number of smoked plastic DOMES hang from the ceiling,
text: presumably concealing surveillance cameras.
text: VIDEO MONITORS suspended from the ceiling carry an endless
dialog: cycle of information programs. These depict the history
text: of Cyberdyne, the history of Cyberdyne's robotic
text: development program, and so forth. The videos are both
text: serious and humorous.
text: Beyond the lobby, we find the entrance to another room. A
text: sign over the entry reads "Miles Bennet Dyson Memorial
dialog: Auditorium."
text: Presently a cheery P.R. DRONE VOICE addresses us.
scene_heading: P.R. DRONE VOICE
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen; Senators,
dialog: Congressmen; invited guests.
dialog: Welcome to Cyberdyne Systems,
dialog: America's leading supplier of
dialog: future technology for consumer
dialog: products and defense.
dialog: You are about to enter our
dialog: Demonstration Center for a
dialog: classified preview of our most
dialog: incredible new technologies.
dialog: Please remember that all information
dialog: presented today is strictly
dialog: confidential.
dialog: Finally, Cyberdyne Systems cannot be
dialog: responsible for personal injuries
dialog: sustained due to radiation exposure
dialog: or high energy tachyon fields.
dialog: Thank you, and enjoy the
dialog: presentation.
text: As we leave the indoor queue, we pass an unattended kiosk
text: which contains custom-designed SAFETY VISORS -- our 3-D
text: GLASSES. We pick up a pair as we walk into the Pre-Show.
scene_heading: PRE-SHOW: VIDEO WALL PROLOGUE
text: Entering the PRE-SHOW AREA gives us a strange sense of
text: compression. Claustrophobia, even. It's a narrow,
text: rectangular chamber with an angular ceiling. High-tech,
text: ultramodern wall finishes and carpeted floors give us the
text: sense of entering the inner sanctum of a powerful
text: corporation. Four large VIDEO WALLS bear down on us,
text: embedded in the slopping ceiling. A cantilevered platform
text: at the far end of the room features a speaker's podium; it
text: hangs in front of the farthest Video Wall.
text: As we enter, carrying our 3-D Glasses, the CYBERDYNE LOGO
text: floats across the Video Walls.
text: We hear the glossy P.R. VOICE again as we file into the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: P.R. DRONE VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Welcome to the Cyberdyne
dialog: Demonstration Center. Please do not
dialog: put on your Safety Visors at this
dialog: time. Improper use of these glasses
dialog: can result in disorientation,
dialog: dizziness, or minor chromosome
dialog: damage. Thank you.
text: The ROOM LIGHTS FADE TO HALF, as the VIDEO WALL springs to
text: life with a CYBERDYNE PROMOTIONAL VIDEO that spreads
text: across the screens. It's a slick, polished presentation
text: with lots of fancy video effects, trendy cinematography,
text: punchy MTV editing.
dialog: The ACTORS are a Politically Correct ethnic balance, and
text: all look happy. Wealthy. Perfect. Our NARRATOR VOICE is
text: warm and fatherly: Hal Holbrook, John Mahoney, Dennis
text: Weaver. It's a parody of those AT&T "You Will" ads, but
text: with a slightly sinister Cyberdyne overtone.
dialog: And it goes like this:
speaker_heading: SHOW START
speaker_heading: FADE IN
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW - DAY
text: A graceful BUTTERFLY flitters across a golden field of
text: daffodils. It lands on a flower in the foreground.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Imagine a world... where butterflies
dialog: run on batteries.
text: TIGHT on the butterfly: we see it's actually a tiny FLYING
text: MACHINE of plastic and chrome. Miniature hydraulic
text: cylinders power its delicate wings.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOLROOM MONTAGE - DAY
text: Scrubbed, happy kids listen eagerly to the day's lesson.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Where children in Chicago...
dialog: Detroit... Los Angeles... and
dialog: Seattle...
text: In each schoolroom, the eager STUDENTS gaze at hi-tech
text: flatscreen MONITORS built into their desks. A single
text: teacher appears on all the monitors.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: ... all learn exactly the same
dialog: lesson. From exactly the same
text: teacher. At exactly the same time.
dialog: Every day.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: A LITTLE OLD LADY sits in a rocking chair, deftly
text: manipulating the world's most complicated REMOTE CONTROL.
text: A huge VIDEO WALL dominates her living room, the screen
text: divided into sixty different individual images.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Where a Grandmother can choose from
text: five thousand television channels.
dialog: And if she can't, her television
dialog: chooses for her.
text: All sixty screens cut to "Murder, She Wrote" -- or other
text: innocuous MCA show. The Lady smiles.
scene_heading: INT. OPERATING ROOM
text: A high-tech surgical procedure is in progress. Robot-
text: guided LASERS move across the patient, making ultra-
text: precise incisions. A VIDEO CAMERA looks down at the
text: procedure, next to a VIDEO MONITOR displaying a SURGEON'S
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Where a neurosurgeon can remove a
dialog: brain tumor...
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH FRONT HOUSE - SUNSET
text: The other end of the video link: the same SURGEON sits on
text: a rustic porch overlooking a sunset-drenched beach. A
text: laptop computer sits on the arm of his chaise-lounge.
text: The contented looking Surgeon deftly manipulates a pair of
text: ROBOTIC REMOTE CONTROL HANDLES that are connected to the
text: computer, while watching the results of his surgery on the
dialog: little monitor.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: ... without missing the sunset.
text: The surgeon reaches over and sips a Pina Colada.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: A smiling MOMMY looks into a picture phone, whispering a
text: lullaby to her Daughter. She grasps a ROBOTIC REMOTE
text: CONTROL HANDLE just like the one the surgeon used.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Or a mother can tuck her babies in
dialog: at night...
scene_heading: INT. NURSERY - NIGHT
text: The other end of the video link: angle on the sleepy
text: DAUGHTER as Mommy's video face coos gently from the
text: picture phone. Responding to the mother's commands, a
text: shiny MECHANICAL CLAW grasps the little girl's blanket and
text: pulls it up to her chin.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: ... from halfway around the planet.
text: POW! SMASH CUT to extreme CU, moving across a fantastic
scene_heading: COMPUTER CHIP.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: It's happening.
text: POW. Closer on the chip.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Today.
text: POW. Closer.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
text: At Cyberdyne Systems.
text: POW!! SMASH CUT to the CYBERDYNE LOGO. Then...
text: FADE TO BLACK.
text: In the darkness, we hear driving INDUSTRIAL MUSIC. Then,
text: screen by screen, the Video Wall comes back to life with
text: images of HI-TECH MANUFACTURING.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: That's right. Cyberdyne. We're
text: back, bigger and better than ever.
dialog: And we're ready to lead the world
text: down the Information Superhighway.
dialog: Our goal: complete global
dialog: communications leadership.
scene_heading: MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS
text: We see HAPPY PEOPLE using Cyberdyne's high-tech products
text: in a variety of glossy settings. Those ROBOTIC ARMS are
text: showing up again. Painting cars, weaving baskets,
text: assembling detonators.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: We've pioneered new breakthroughs in
dialog: Artificial Intelligence... Neural
dialog: Network Processors... plus advanced
dialog: Robotic systems for Medicine,
dialog: Consumer Products... and Defense.
text: TOMAHAWK MISSILES streak through the skies, creating
text: brilliant traces of light.
text: The visuals come faster now. More military images mix
text: with the industrial/commercial visuals. Music begins to
text: build, accelerating urgently.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: But our greatest challenge lies
dialog: ahead.
text: And now we see technicians laboring over something dark,
text: omniscient. A NASA SPACE SHUTTLE orbits the earth,
text: releasing a satellite.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Or rather... above. Six hundred
text: miles above, in geosynchronous earth
dialog: orbit. Today, these Cyberdyne
dialog: satellites protect us from enemy
dialog: attack. But soon, they'll go even
dialog: farther.
text: SATELLITES in space. Department of Defense Stratigic
text: Defense Initiative satellite footage.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Imagine every computer on earth...
dialog: Every television... every
dialog: telephone... and eventually, every
text: living person... united. In the
dialog: ultimate global network.
dialog: You've heard of the information
dialog: highway? Welcome to the information
text: skyway.
text: Images of PEOPLE and COMPUTER NETWORKS. People carry
text: nifty-looking personal communications devices.
dialog: CAPTION: "Pending FCC Approval"
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Imagine the ease... the speed... the
dialog: fun! You'll be able to reach any
dialog: person, anywhere on earth, any time
dialog: you choose.
text: A CONSUMER consults her Newton-style personal
text: communications device. It flashes a series of messages:
dialog: "Judy: call Mom"... "Come to Ed Blumberg's Auto Mall!
dialog: Check out our new minivans! Click here"... "Past Due:
dialog: $62.94 to Skynet Communications, Inc. -- Click to
dialog: authorize funds transfer."
text: The images come faster. MUSIC is pounding.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: This is the future of communication.
dialog: The future of National Defense. The
dialog: future of a new global society.
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen...
dialog: This is SKYNET.
text: The SKYNET LOGO forms on screen.
text: Suddenly the video image twitches, then explodes into
text: STATIC. A computer-generated STATUS LINE appears in the
text: upper left corner of the screen.
text: It says: SIGNAL INTERRUPT.
scene_heading: UNAUTHORIZED TRANSMISSION.
scene_heading: AUTO-OVERRIDE: FAIL.
speaker_heading: AN ANGRY VOICE
dialog: NO!!!
text: An instant later the static scatters, revealing a shaky
text: Closed Circuit VIDEO IMAGE.
scene_heading: INT. A DARK PLACE
text: Two PEOPLE are standing in a small dark room: one of them
text: reaches toward us, adjusting a unseen VIDEO CAMERA. The
text: other twiddles the controls on a small electronic box.
dialog: But these people don't look like the well-groomed
dialog: Cyberdyne employees we've seen so far. They wear battle
text: fatigues and carry a small arsenal of weapons and
dialog: electronic gear.
text: We're looking at two fugitives from history.
text: SARAH CONNOR. And her son JOHN.
dialog: John has grown since we saw him last. Now about sixteen
text: years old, tall and whipcord lean, he's kept in shape by
dialog: constant exercise, travel and vigilance. He's tougher
text: than before, hardened by loss. But still a boy, really.
text: Prone to outbursts of youthful enthusiasm.
text: Sarah, though, looks much the same. Years of combat
dialog: training have kept her in top physical condition. Hair
text: pulled back in a tough ponytail, eyes hidden by dark
text: glasses. She's not quite as wired as she was in 1991, but
dialog: she's still not someone you'd want to piss off.
text: And right now, she's pretty pissed off.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How dare you?! How dare you!?!
dialog: These stupid cutesy-pie corporate
dialog: videos make me sick! Skynet isn't
dialog: our defender. It's our downfall!
dialog: Everyone of you death mongering
dialog: Cyberdyne bloodsuckers should be
dialog: barbecued in your own--
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mom... MOM! The mission, remember?
dialog: (to us)
text: She's a little tense.
text: Sarah takes a second to calm down. John steps forward and
text: addresses the camera.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Um, okay. Attention, everybody.
dialog: This is a warning. To all civilians
dialog: inside this building. Cyberdyne
text: Systems is a menace. The Skynet
dialog: project threatens the future of
dialog: humanity. We're going to stop it.
dialog: You've got five minutes to get out.
text: And now, in the Pre-Show Theater, Cyberdyne starts to
text: react to Sarah's uninvited broadcast. As Sarah's
text: narration continues, we hear a quiet BEEPING, and a little
text: LIGHT begins to flash from an OPERATIONS PANEL on the
dialog: raised Dais.
text: A DOOR opens behind the Dais, and we see a SILHOUETTE
text: moving in the dark. A CYBERDYNE EMPLOYEE walks up to the
text: Dais. She stands in front of the Video Wall, a dark
text: silhouette against the giant flickering images.
text: This is KIMBERLEY DUNCAN, a Cyberdyne "marketeer" who
dialog: we'll meet in a minute. She watches the pirate broadcast
text: for a moment. Though she tries not to show it, we can
text: tell that she's upset by the transmission.
text: Kimberley picks up a TELEPHONE HANDSET hanging from the
text: Ops Panel. She WHISPERS into the phone, trying to keep us
dialog: from hearing.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Security? It's them.
dialog: (hissing)
dialog: The CONNORS, you idiot! They're
dialog: crashing our show. Yes, there's an
dialog: audience here.
dialog: (angry)
dialog: I don't care. Shut them down. Now.
text: Kimberley slams down the phone. Meanwhile, back on the
text: Video Screens, The Connor's PIRATE TRANSMISSION continues:
text: Sarah removes her sunglasses and stares at us.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to us)
dialog: Now listen very carefully.
text: John punches a tape player. The words "INITIATE PROGRAM"
text: flash for an instant on the screen. STATIC.
text: Then: a nightmare vision of the future.
speaker_heading: VISION - MONTAGE
text: We're watching a FLASHBACK SEQUENCE of scenes from the
text: movie "Terminator 2: Judgment Day". In contrast to the
text: chic, soft look of the Cyberdyne video, these images are
text: sharp, bold, flooded with brilliant oranges and blues.
text: A DESOLATE LANDSCAPE: the ruins of Los Angeles. CAMERA
text: comes to rest on a skull half-buried in the rubble.
text: HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as:
text: A METAL FOOT crushes the skull like china.
text: TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive
text: battle rifle. It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-
text: tech Death figure. It is the endoskeleton of a Series 800
dialog: terminator.
text: And now, for the first time, we hear the TERMINATOR THEME
text: MUSIC. Dark. Urgent. Militant.
text: Cut to assorted shots of the FUTURE WAR as Sarah speaks:
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: The Skynet project is doomed. One
dialog: month after its completion, the
dialog: Skynet computer will turn against
dialog: its human creators, and launch an
dialog: all-out war against mankind. The
dialog: conflict will last over thirty
dialog: years, with the fate of the human
dialog: race at stake.
text: SARAH appears in an INSET FRAME, addressing the camera.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: How do I know this is going to
dialog: happen in the future?
dialog: (solemn)
dialog: Trust me.
text: Angry streaks of lightning flicker across the screen, and
text: a black TIME SPHERE appears in a parking lot. The sphere
text: vanishes, revealing a crouching, naked man.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Skynet sent mechanical assassins
dialog: back in time, to destroy anyone who
dialog: might oppose it.
text: The T-1000 walks into view, framed by dancing flames.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: These "Terminators" threatened my
dialog: life... and the life of my son.
text: WHAM! CUT TO a lightning-fast collection of ACTION CLIPS
text: from the movie. The T-1000 pursues YOUNG JOHN.
text: The T-1000 STALKS JOHN through a mall, breaking into a
dialog: run.
text: The T-1000 PURSUES JOHN down a riverbed. Three-ton tow
text: truck versus eighty-pound minibike.
text: The T-1000 FIRES HIS PISTOL at John with alarming speed.
speaker_heading: SARAH
text: But resistance sent a lone warrior.
text: A protector for John.
text: HEROIC SHOT of the TERMINATOR.
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O.)
text: Another terminator, programmed to
dialog: defend human life.
text: TERMINATOR AIMS HIS SHOTGUN directly at John.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Get down.
text: John ducks; Terminator opens fire on the T-1000, shielding
text: John with his back.
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O.)
dialog: And despite certain...
dialog: reservations... that I had about
dialog: this particular model, he defended
dialog: us to the very end. Sacrificed his
dialog: own existence to save the future.
text: TERMINATOR lowers himself into the molten steel pit.
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O.)
dialog: And then John and I were alone
dialog: again.
text: SARAH AND JOHN EMBRACE in their final shot from
text: "Terminator 2," gazing down into the molten steel.
scene_heading: TERMINATOR THEME MUSIC ENDS.
text: POP! We're back with JOHN AND SARAH in the present day,
text: transmitting from their secret location. John monitors
text: the jamming equipment, increasingly jumpy.
speaker_heading: SARAH (ONSCREEN)
dialog: I thought we'd prevented Judgment
dialog: Day. But now... it's all starting
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mom, we gotta go. Like now.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Skynet must never be completed.
text: STATIC starts to obscure the image.
text: Sarah is a giant now, her blazing eyes filling the Video
text: Screens.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Get out of the building. You've
dialog: been warned. You have five minutes
dialog: before we--
text: VIDEO STATIC overwhelms the image. Computer data scrolls
text: across the screen: UNAUTHORIZED TRANSMISSION: MANUAL
text: OVERRIDE. COLOR BARS fill the screen; the words PLEASE
text: STAND BY are superimposed.
dialog: Then--
text: An instant of STATIC, and we're back to:
scene_heading: CYBERDYNE PROMO VIDEO
text: -- which, oblivious to the Connor's interruption, is now
text: building up to its stirring conclusion. FLAGS wave
text: against flashing laser graphics; CHILDREN laugh across
text: digital chat networks; SOLDIERS march and smile from hi-
text: tech tanks; a pair of GRANDPARENTS kiss via two-way
text: television. It's big and soppy and sentimental, with a
text: slight military edge.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: -- making the future safer and
dialog: friendlier for everyone.
text: One of the images that flickers by: Cyberdyne Scientists,
text: wearing Safety Visors like ours, labor over a silhouetted
scene_heading: CHROME SKELETON.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: And you'll witness perhaps
dialog: Cyberdyne's greatest breakthrough.
text: An incredible new technology that
dialog: will change your world today... and
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Meanwhile, KIMBERLEY DUNCAN re-enters and watches the
text: screens. She picks up the phone, dials as she watches the
text: Cyberdyne Video finale.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Right. That took care of it.
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: I don't know how they did it.
dialog: That's supposed to be your job.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Do what you have to. Double the
dialog: security on the doors. Just keep
dialog: them out.
text: She bangs down the phone and waits in the dark for the
dialog: video to end.
scene_heading: EXT. CHILDREN'S PLAYGROUND - DAY
text: An idyllic playground overlooking Los Angeles. CHILDREN
text: and MOTHERS play on the swings, the slide, the roundabout.
text: The MECHANICAL BUTTERFLY lands on a swingset, next to a
text: beautiful LITTLE GIRL. Its wings move slowly back and
text: forth. We PUSH IN on the creation, into EXTREME CLOSE-UP.
text: A tiny red LED LIGHT glows in the center of each wing.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: The future.
dialog: It's happening.
dialog: Today.
text: At Cyberdyne Systems.
text: And as we FADE OUT, the butterfly's outline seems for a
text: moment to resemble the red-eyed chrome skull of a
scene_heading: TERMINATOR ENDOSKELETON.
text: We FADE TO BLACK. A moment later, the Cyberdyne Logo
text: FADES IN, white letters against black:
scene_heading: CYBERDYNE SYSTEMS
dialog: We are the future
dialog: After a moment of silence, we...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
text: A moment of darkness. Then...
text: A SPOTLIGHT RISES, illuminating the person standing on the
text: Dais. The KIMBERLEY DUNCAN who greets us now acts
dialog: completely different from the shadowy, angry person we
dialog: heard a moment ago.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Well, Hi, everybody! It sure is
dialog: nice to see so many friendly faces
dialog: here today!
dialog: (a fresh start)
dialog: Welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen, to
dialog: Cyberdyne Systems. My name is
dialog: Kimberley Duncan, Cyberdyne's
dialog: Director of Community Relations and
dialog: Media Control. Today you're going
dialog: to see a classified presentation of
dialog: out latest, most exciting
dialog: technology.
dialog: I'll tell you this much now: you'll
dialog: need the Safety Visors we
dialog: distributed when you entered. Does
dialog: anybody need a pair of glasses?
dialog: Please ask our attendants as you
text: enter the Demonstration Center.
dialog: Everybody ready? Okay, then.
dialog: Follow me!
text: The AUTOMATIC DOORS swing open. Kimberley steps down from
text: the Dais and leads us into the MAIN SHOW THEATER.
speaker_heading: MAIN SHOW
speaker_heading: ACT I
dialog: Cyberdyne Demonstration
text: We enter the CYBERDYNE PRESENTATION CENTER through
text: MULTIPLE DOORS at the back of the theater.
text: The spacious auditorium features wide, carpeted aisles and
text: comfortable seats. A broad STAGE spans the room, its
text: various platformed levels reaching down to the audience
text: floor and up to a large CURTAIN.
text: The WALK-IN MUSIC continues the hip, you're-going-to-love-
text: this flavor established in the Pre-Show Video.
text: A SPEAKER'S PODIUM/CONTROL CONSOLE stands stage right,
text: bearing the Cyberdyne logo. The Control Console wraps
text: around behind the Podium, forming a little space where a
dialog: person can stand and either address the audience, or turn
text: upstage to operate an array of high-tech CONTROL PANELS
text: and DIGITAL DISPLAYS. A vertical VIDEO PROJECTION SCREEN
text: lies embedded in a structural column, stage right of the
dialog: Podium.
text: The same droning VOICE from the Pre-Show chimes in.
speaker_heading: P.R. DRONE (V.O.)
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen: welcome to the
dialog: Cyberdyne Visitor Center. Our
dialog: special presentation of classified
dialog: technology will continue in just a
dialog: moment. Please do not put on your
dialog: Safety Visors at this time. Wait
dialog: until instructed by your Cyberdyne
dialog: Host or Hostess.
text: KIMBERLEY DUNCAN, the Cyberdyne Spokesperson, leads us
text: into the theater. She hops up onto the stage and directs
dialog: us.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Please step in quickly, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen. Find a row and move all
text: the way to the end, making room for
dialog: everyone. Because this auditorium
dialog: was precision designed by Cyberdyne
dialog: engineers, rest assured that every
dialog: seat will give you an excellent view
dialog: of our presentation.
text: Kimberley busies herself at the Control Console, pressing
text: a sequence of buttons.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: And now, if everybody is settled,
dialog: let's continue with our
dialog: presentation.
text: Kimberley presses a button, and the HOUSE LIGHTS FADE TO
text: HALF. A SPOTLIGHT FADES UP on her. Behind Kimberley, the
text: CURTAIN OPENS, revealing a HI-TECH WALL emblazoned with a
text: large CHROME CYBERDYNE LOGO. The Video Projection Screen
text: carries a LIVE IMAGE OF KIMBERLEY as she speaks from the
dialog: podium.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen: Armed combat
dialog: has entered the age of the thinking
dialog: machine. And today, it gives us
dialog: great pleasure to introduce the
dialog: ultimate thinking machine...
text: We hear the faint WHIRRING of servos all around us. Then,
text: with a startling PCHSSSSSH, SIX large PNEUMATIC HATCHES
text: open around the room. LIQUID NITROGEN FOG spills out of
text: the hatches.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
text: ... The mechanical soldier.
text: And as INTENSE MUSIC BUILDS, a group of cold metal objects
text: start to rise from the six open hatches around us. FOG
text: LIGHTS shine up through dark METAL GRATINGS below, casting
text: eerie shadows up the theater walls.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Cyberdyne Systems is proud to
dialog: present... the future of modern
dialog: defense.
dialog: These things are creepy. At first we might mistake them
dialog: for missiles rising out of their silos; but then we
text: realize that these are gleaming CHROME ROBOTS.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: The Cyberdyne Series 70 Automated
dialog: Fighting Infantry units. Or, as we
dialog: call them...
text: KA-CHUNK! The robots finish their upward travel and lock
text: into place. Their EYES LIGHT UP with a blood-red glow.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: ... The Terminators.
dialog: And that's what they are.
dialog: They're the deadly endoskeletons from the movies. Those
text: same skull faces and chrome bodies, but a little larger --
text: these models are nearly eight feet tall.
text: The machines are "alert" now, scanning the audience as if
text: looking for trouble. They carry huge ATTACK RIFLES.
text: The Video Projection Screen switches to images of the T-
text: 70s around the room.
text: A SPOTLIGHT RISES on Kimberley. Her cheery spiel
text: contrasts with the endoskeletons lethal appearance.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Ladies and gentlemen, you are
dialog: looking at the most advanced
dialog: fighting machines in the world
dialog: today. And now... let's see just
dialog: what they can do.
dialog: Please put on your Safety Visors --
dialog: the special glasses you received
dialog: outside.
text: She puts on a pair of VISORS just like ours. HOUSE LIGHTS
speaker_heading: DOWN.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Observe.
text: Kimberley pushes another button on the console. SIX
text: HANGING TARGETS descend from the ceiling and hang over the
dialog: audience. They're hi-tech versions of standard police
text: targets, showing stylized outlines of a human profile.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Automatic Targeting Systems active.
text: The T-70s suddenly SNAP TO ATTENTION like hunting dogs on
text: the trail. Each Terminator picks out a target and watches
text: it descend into position.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Laser Designators active.
text: From each T-70s rifle a bright red LASER BEAM appears.
text: They crisscross the theater in sweeping arcs until they
text: LOCK ONTO their designated targets.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Prepare to fire.
dialog: Lock and load.
text: Commence firing.
text: And the room fills with thunder.
text: The T-70s OPEN FIRE on the targets. The guns BLAZE with
text: Automatic Fire, rattling off six hundred rounds a minute.
text: Their shooting is laser perfect at first: the guns punch
text: precise clusters through the heart and head bullseyes.
text: Kimberley calmly puts her fingers in her ears, watching
text: the demonstration with a placid smile.
text: Then, as the sequence progresses, the robots aim deviates
text: more and more. They start to hit the target's arms, legs,
text: groins. SCRAPS OF PAPER flutter down from the targets.
text: Bullets tear up the Target Frames, sending SPARKS flying
text: and causing pieces of the frames to BREAK LOOSE and dangle
dialog: from the Targets.
text: The GUNFIRE STOPS as suddenly as it began. The T-70s
text: return to attention.
text: Silence. It's been only ten or fifteen seconds, but it
text: felt like the Normandy invasion. The room is filled with
text: smoke and ruined targets and little drifting bits of
text: charred paper.
text: Kimberley jumps right in with a winning corporate smile.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: The Cyberdyne Series 70, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen!
text: HOUSE LIGHTS UP TO HALF.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: But raw firepower is just the
dialog: beginning. Within five years, these
dialog: incredible fighting machines will
dialog: completely replace U.S. combat
dialog: troops in all--
text: THPOW! PTOOM! A pair of EXPLOSIONS shake the air
text: overhead. The CEILING VENTILATION DUCTS BURST OPEN at two
text: different places with a FLASH OF LIGHT and a CLOUD OF
speaker_heading: SMOKE.
text: RAPPELLING CABLES drop from the ducts into the theater.
text: Then, zipping down the lines from above, we see a pair of
text: LIVE ACTORS: JOHN and SARAH CONNOR. They're heavily armed
dialog: and ready for action.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mom! They've already started!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Move!
text: The Security System goes nuts. ALARMS and SIRENS SOUND
text: all around the theater, as the VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM
text: tries to get a fix on the two intruders. The Video
text: Projection Screen cuts away from Kimberley, to show the
text: two intruders.
text: Kimberley suddenly springs into action. She completely
text: drops her civilized facade, and becomes a snarling, take-
text: no-prisoners Cyberdyne mercenary. She grabs for the
text: security phone on the Control Console.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Get me security -- NOW! I've got
dialog: the Connors in the theater!
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: John! The alarms!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: On it!
text: They pause in mid-descent and OPEN FIRE, expertly blasting
text: the Alarms. John blasts the alarm on the side column;
text: Sarah destroys the phone Kimberley's holding. They finish
text: their zip-slides and land in the theater. They unclip
text: their harnesses and run toward the stage. On the Video
text: Projection Screen, we can see their faces more clearly.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (to Kimberley,
dialog: indicating the
dialog: T-70s)
dialog: Shut those things down!
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: No way, Connor. This is a High-
dialog: security--
text: PKOW! Sarah FIRES A SHOT just over Kimberley's head; it
text: HITS the CYBERDYNE LOGO on the wall behind her.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: RIGHT NOW!
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: (caving in)
dialog: Okay -- d-don't shoot--
text: Kimberley fumbles with the controls, trying to comply.
text: But as she does, we hear a weird LIQUID SUCKING sound
text: behind her.
text: And the bullet holes in the Cyberdyne logo heals.
text: Where the bullets entered a moment earlier, it left a
text: large chrome "crater." But now, the metal logo SHIFTS and
text: RIPPLES like soft butter, smoothing over the hole until
text: there's no trace of it left.
text: And then, as Sarah crosses to the console, the logo loses
text: its shape and begins to PEEL OFF THE WALL.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (noticing)
dialog: Oh, no. It can't be.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Now let's get this thing--
text: As OMINOUS MUSIC BUILDS, the melting Logo DROPS to the
text: ground, landing in a formless CHROME BLOB on the top step.
text: It cast a "shadow" on the "wall" behind it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Mom! Look out!
text: Sarah turns and sees the bizarre chrome thing, which
text: shifts and changes under its own power.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: John! Take cover!
text: The Connors dive off the stage, into the audience, and
text: take refuge in the crowd.
text: Suddenly a portion of the chrome mass STRETCHES AWAY FROM
text: THE STAGE, extending out into the theater. The liquid
text: metal forms a mirrored FACE that reaches out toward us,
text: almost close enough to touch; we can see the AUDIENCE
text: REFLECTED in its smooth chrome features.
text: Kimberley points a shaking finger at the chrome blob.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLY
dialog: My god -- what is that?
dialog: But the Connors already know what it is: the deadly
text: cybernetic organism sent by Skynet to destroy John and
dialog: Sarah.
dialog: THE T-1000.
text: The robot assassin scans slowly back and forth, looking
dialog: for John and Sarah.
speaker_heading: T-1000
dialog: (an eerie, filtered
dialog: voice)
dialog: Sarah Connor... John Connor...
text: The metal face THRUSTS toward us one more time; but as it
text: pushes forward, the chrome surface changes to SKIN TONES,
text: a snake shedding digital skin. The T-1000's "human" face
text: is almost fully formed now.
text: The head BACKS AWAY FROM US and retracts toward the wall
text: as the remaining chrome mass transforms into the BLACK
text: FABRIC of a policeman's uniform. The creature pulls
text: itself into shape of a HUMAN FIGURE. And in one final
text: transformation, the creature MORPHS into the T-1000's
text: familiar MOTORCYCLE COP persona, complete with sunglasses
dialog: and helmet.
text: The T-1000 crosses the stage, never taking its eyes off
text: the audience where it knows John and Sarah are hiding.
text: Kimberley sees it coming and panics.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLEY
dialog: Wh-what are you doing? You can't
dialog: just hrgkh--
text: With a casual effort, the T-1000 grabs Kimberley by the
text: throat and TOSSES HER BEHIND THE CONSOLE.
text: John and Sarah run up to the edge of the stage,
text: desperately trying to take cover behind a piece of
text: equipment onstage.
text: The T-1000 turns to the Control Console and efficiently
text: punches a few buttons.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE (OVERHEAD)
dialog: Automatic Designators active.
text: The Hanging Targets ASCEND out of sight, as the T-70
text: ROBOTS come back to life. They SWING AROUND and their
text: LASER TARGETING systems start to converge on John and
dialog: Sarah.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Laser Designators active.
text: The T-70 LASER SCOPES sweep red beams toward the Connors,
text: who are completely exposed to the chrome robots. John
text: notices the T-70s zeroing in on them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Uh, Mom. Mom, this isn't good.
text: Sarah turns around and sees the T-70s. They're trapped.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER VOICE
dialog: Prepare to fire.
dialog: Lock and load.
text: They exchange looks. Sarah grabs John's hand. A last
dialog: goodbye...
text: The quiet is shattered by a BOLT OF BLUE-WHITE LIGHTNING
text: that rips across the stage. TZZZAKT! Another bolt
text: appears, then another. They dance across the screen,
text: clutching at the side columns and floor as though looking
text: for a place to "land." The lightning bolts begin to
text: CONVERGE at a single point, across the stage from the
text: control console. HEAVY METAL THUNDER shakes the theater;
text: and somewhere in the surreal background we hear the
text: revving of an enormous MOTORCYCLE, getting louder. T-1000
text: stops before he hits the firing button, looking around,
text: momentarily distracted.
text: Suddenly a JET-BLACK SPHERE opens up in the middle of the
text: lightning bolts, appearing out of dead-ass nowhere. This
text: is the TIME SPHERE effect from "T2,". Through this 'time
text: vacuole" we see fleeting, static-shadowed images of
text: another world. And with a ROAR of light and thunder, a
scene_heading: LEATHER-CLAD FIGURE ON A BLACK HARLEY-DAVIDSON EXPLODES
text: OUT OF THE SPHERE!
text: The bike hurtles out of the void, flying through the air
text: as though it had just arrived in mid-jump, and SOARS
text: ACROSS THE STAGE in a blazing meteor-trail of WHITE
text: LIGHTNING. The entire theater is LIT BY THE GLARE as the
text: bike comes roaring through.
text: It lands on the stage floor, bouncing heavily on its
text: suspension. Trailing CRACKLING ELECTRIC DISCHARGES. It
text: disappears for a moment behind the Control Console and
text: reappears an instant later. The bike screeches forward,
text: accelerating toward downstage center. As it passes the
text: console, the Harley SMASHES INTO the T-1000, sending the
text: "cop" FLYING across the stage. The bike FISHTAILS
text: slightly and SKIDS TO A HALT near the Connors.
text: The big machine THUNDERS MENACINGLY as its RIDER revs the
text: engine. The figure on the machine is massive, dressed all
text: in black riding leather, his severe face made more
text: threatening by the familiar black glasses.
text: Enter TERMINATOR.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: I said I'd be back.
text: The T-70s turn to follow Terminator, the LASER TARGETING
text: BEAMS sweeping toward him. But Terminator doesn't waste a
text: moment. He unslings a SAWED-OFF TEN-GAUGE LEVER ACTION
text: WINCHESTER from the bike's saddle-bag and--
text: POOM! POOM! Pumps two rounds into the control console,
text: which EXPLODES IN SPARKS. The T-70s go dead. They
text: descend into their silos.
text: The T-1000 jumps back to his feet and begins to advance
text: toward them. Terminator holds out a hand to John.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Come with me if you want to live.
text: Sarah is between John and the T-1000. She raises her
text: weapon and FIRES. It jerks with the impacts, staggering
text: but advancing. Dripping MERCURY CRATERS appear in its
text: chest with each shot. Sarah shouts to John, who is
dialog: hesitating...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Go with him! Go get Skynet!
text: John leaps onto the motorcycle behind Terminator. Sarah
text: fires again. T-1000 staggers back, then advances.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Get out of here! GO!!
text: Terminator GUNS THE THROTTLE on the Motorcycle. It POPS A
text: WHEELIE, the back wheel SPINNING and SMOKING. The T-1000
text: is coming toward them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hit it, lugnuts!
text: VRROOOOOOMMM!! The Motorcycle takes off, straight for the
text: back wall. The TIME SPHERE, which has been flickering
text: slowly from left to right, now hovers in the dead center
text: of the stage. The Harley hits the bottom steps and LEAPS
text: INTO THE AIR, and with a burst of CRACKLING ENERGY, the
text: Motorcycle flies RIGHT INTO THE TIME SPHERE!
text: The world turns inside out. As the Terminator's
text: motorcycle enters the Time Sphere, a BLINDING GLARE OF
text: ELECTRICAL ENERGY flashes all around the bike and Sphere.
text: A cloud of TACHYON PARTICLES swirls like tiny glowing
text: cinders in the bike's wake. The TIME SPHERE EXPANDS,
text: growing bigger and moving toward us. The mysterious world
text: behind it rushes forward as well, so we're actually
text: following the motorcycle. The crackling Sphere grows
text: until it fills the entire 3-D FILM SCREEN.
text: At the same time, the Stage and Theater GO DARK, and all
text: objects on the stage DESCEND INTO THE STAGE, leaving us
text: looking at a PURE 3-D FILM.
speaker_heading: ACT II
dialog: Future Run
text: The Terminator and John BLAST THROUGH the Time Sphere as
text: Tachyon Particles fly out in 3-D at the audience,
text: revealing the NUCLEAR NIGHTMARE WORLD of LOS ANGELES 2029.
text: The city lies in ruins. Little fires dot the shattered
text: landscape. Strange CHROME AIRCRAFT fly through the
text: darkened sky, rapid-firing PLASMA BLASTS. Grotesque
text: HUNTER-KILLER TANKS tread the rubble landscape in the
dialog: distance.
text: As the motorcycle HITS THE GROUND and screeches to a stop,
text: the CAMERA rushes up to it, moving in TIGHT ON TERMINATOR
text: as he leans the weight of the machine on one leg and turns
dialog: to look back.
text: Off his look WE WHIP PAN 180 DEGREES, looking back the way
text: we just came... revealing the TIME SPHERE, seen from the
dialog: future side.
text: Beyond the outline of the window is the audience, still
dialog: seated in the auditorium in 1996!
dialog: Before we have too much time to think about this out-of-
text: body paradox, the T-1000 leaps through the window and runs
text: right toward us.
text: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN, rushing toward the evil T-1000,
text: giving him a sense of enormous speed. The T-1000 reaches
text: out with his right hand -- we see that it's changed into a
text: cruel METAL HOOK -- and then SWIPES at us with his left
text: arm, which is now an EXTENDED METALLIC BLADE.
text: ANGLE ON TERMINATOR as he extends the 10-gauge with one
text: hand and points RIGHT INTO CAMERA. BOOM!
text: HE FIRES RIGHT BETWEEN THE T-1000'S EYES.
text: The T-1000's head splits (saucehead effect) as he falls
text: back and collapses to the ground. This moment of victory
text: is interrupted by the thundering SOUND of an approaching
text: FHK, even as PLASMA BLASTS begin exploding nearby.
text: Back to Terminator and John as a FLYING HUNTER KILLER
text: swoops into view. Terminator revs up the bike and takes
text: off just as a MASSIVE PLASMA BLAST punches a three-foot
text: crater in the ground, right where the bike was seconds
dialog: before.
text: We BURST THROUGH the smoke and fire of the explosion
text: FOLLOWING the bike as Terminator swerves with machine
text: precision, avoiding the barrage of purple blasts. John
text: SHOUTS over the action.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What the hell is going on?! Where
dialog: are we?!
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Your future, John Connor. Unless we
dialog: stop them. Now.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh man. You're heading for Skynet.
text: Before Terminator can respond, a MAJOR BIG-TIME PLASMA
text: BLAST EXPLODES directly in front of them.
speaker_heading: KA-BLAMMM!
text: The bike hits the exploding rubble, launching them into
text: the air. IN SLOW MOTION Terminator grabs John and spins
text: in the air like a cat, coming down on his back on the
dialog: pavement--
dialog: K-WHAM!!
text: He skids on his back on the concrete, throwing a comet-
text: tail of sparks behind them. Before he has even come to
text: rest he is rolling to his feet, pulling John up next to
dialog: him.
text: Behind them, the FHK circles around and comes in for the
text: kill. Terminator grabs John and pulls him as they rush
dialog: for cover.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: This way. Quick.
text: They rush to a large burned-out PARKING STRUCTURE, darting
text: under its protective cover. The massive FHK fires several
text: PLASMA BLASTS at them, but too late: its intended victims
text: are safely inside. The FHK can't get to them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That was close.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
text: It's not over.
text: They move into the shadows as the FHK sweeps overhead
text: again, its moving searchlights seeking them out.
text: TIGHT ON THE FLYING HK as doors open in its belly,
text: releasing THREE CHROME DISKS as they come to life,
text: rocketing downwards towards the parking structure.
text: They are MINI-HUNTERS: single rotor anti-personnel drones
text: about a foot in diameter. Fast, short range death-
text: frisbees, they each carry a front-mounted automatic-weapon
text: about as powerful as an UZI.
text: They whine like evil bees as they swarm down into the
text: shadows, SPLITTING OFF IN THREE DIRECTIONS with keen
text: precision. We TRACK WITH ONE OF THEM as it zips through
text: the war torn landscape.
text: TRACKING WITH JOHN AND TERMINATOR as they sprint through
text: the ruins of the crumbling parking structure.
scene_heading: The MINI-HUNTERS ATTACK.
text: ANGLE FOLLOWING THE LEAD DISK as it closes on the running
dialog: targets.
text: Terminator pulls John in front of him, shielding him with
dialog: his body as--
text: The Mini-Hunters open fire and--
text: Terminator's leather jacket is ripped to shreds as rounds
text: riddle his back.
text: Sheltering John, he whips around with the 10-gauge, firing
text: one-handed RIGHT INTO CAMERA.
text: Mini-Hunter #1 is blown into shrapnel right in the
scene_heading: FOREGROUND.
text: Terminator pulls John behind a concrete column as--
text: The other Mini-Hunters fire and--
text: The concrete is riddled with hits, and--
text: Terminator and John dodge out of the garage structure and
dialog: through the ruins, and--
text: The two remaining Mini-Hunters fly aerobatics, swooping
text: around, through and under the jumbled ruins to stay in
text: pursuit.
text: THE LAST TWO MINI-HUNTERS whine around a mound of debris,
text: closing. MINI-HUNTER #2 FLIES IN, its guns targeting
text: Terminator. John sees it first and dives for cover.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: LOOK OUT!
text: Terminator swings around, brings up the shotgun, pulls the
dialog: trigger--
text: CLICK! Empty.
text: As the Mini-Hunter fires, stitching rounds into his chest,
text: he flips the gun in his hand, holding it by the muzzle
dialog: and--
text: Swings it like a bat.
text: CRACK! Grand slam! The Mini-Hunter SPINS AWAY, out of
text: control, smoking and throwing off bits of shrapnel.
text: Wailing plaintively and out of control, it corkscrews past
text: the last functioning Mini-Hunter.
text: The remaining Mini-Hunter follows with its optical sensors
text: as it goes by, "watching" it until we hear an off-screen
dialog: explosion.
text: Then it turns back toward its target and revs up angrily
dialog: for an attack.
text: FOLLOWING THE LAST MINI-HUNTER as it zips at blinding
text: speed through the ruins, following John and Terminator as
text: they run and dodge. It loses sight of them and banks,
dialog: doubling back--
text: Zigzagging through columns, burnt-out doorframes, empty
dialog: windows--
text: It catches a glimpse, homes in and--
text: Loses them again.
text: The whining disk hovers one way, then the other. Its
text: sensors spin, searching. Huh?
text: Perplexed, it edges past a column and--
text: WHAM! A hand shoots out of the darkness and grabs it in a
text: vice-like grip.
text: Terminator steps from behind the pillar, holding the angry
text: drone. It wriggles savagely in his hand.
text: Its miniature guns rotate, trying to fire. Its little
text: rotor screams shrilly as it struggles.
text: Terminator SMASHES IT AGAINST THE WALL.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Quit your whining.
dialog: It does.
text: A SKELETAL SILHOUETTE with glowing red eyes steps out of a
text: charred doorway behind them.
text: A T-800 TERMINATOR ENDOSKELETON (ENDO) raising its plasma
text: rifle toward them as it moves in. The T-800s are the
dialog: first stage in the creation of the cyborg. Our
text: reprogrammed hero, Terminator himself, started as one of
dialog: these, before he was completed as a human-infiltration
dialog: unit.
text: Terminator spins, hurling the dead Mini-Hunter like a
text: discus, right into the chest of the T-800. The Mini-
text: Hunter EXPLODES, blasting the Endo into cartwheeling
text: chunks of metal.
text: Out of the fiery explosion, the dead Endo's metallic head
text: comes flying out, DIRECTLY AT US, in horrific 3-D.
text: John jumps backwards as the skull hurtles toward him--
text: The head hovers for a moment -- its eyes glowing red as it
text: seems to stare at us -- then it EXPLODES right in our
dialog: faces--
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Nice shootin', Tex. A friend of
dialog: yours?
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: He was my roommate in college.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Now what?
text: Terminator hands John a backpack as he picks up the heavy
text: PLASMA RIFLE from the dead Endo.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Now we take on Skynet.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I was afraid you were going to say
dialog: that.
text: John follows Terminator to a blackened doorway, CAMERA
text: FOLLOWING, REVEALING...
text: AN ENORMOUS BUNKER. Squat and brutal in its design, like
text: a mesa of burnished metal, its sides angling up hundreds
text: of feet to a flat top. It gives the impression of being
text: only the tip of a vast structure under the earth, which it
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (awed)
dialog: Oh, man.
text: Set into the face of the implacable bunker are numerous
text: sets of massive doors, some closed, some open to allow
text: HUNTER KILLERS to come and go. The nearest doors yawn
text: wide as a FLYING HUNTER KILLER emerges onto the killing
text: plain. Beyond it, several doors down, a huge tracked-
text: vehicle (TANK HUNTER KILLER) is entering the bunker.
text: John takes a peek inside the pack given to him by
text: Terminator. Inside are metal cylinders the size of a
text: thermos... a futuristic version of German "potato-masher"
dialog: grenades.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Satchel charges. Cool.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Let's bust a move.
text: They sprint towards the doors, right under the jetwash of
text: the departing FHK. Ahead, the ENORMOUS DOORS are grinding
dialog: closed. Let me tell you about these doors: they're big.
text: BIG. Bigger than the Wizard of Oz's doors. Bigger than
text: the door in "War Games". This is the Spruce Goose of
dialog: doors.
text: John and Terminator run full-out toward the doors.
dialog: They're not going to make it...
text: Terminator's stride lengthens and he gets there first, in
text: time to wedge himself between the enormous doors. Like
text: Samson between the pillars of the temple, his hydraulic
text: arms hold the doors apart.
text: There is a grumbling roar from the hidden mechanism as the
text: doors strain to close.
text: Just as John makes it through, the powerful cyborg
text: releases the doors, diving out of the way as they SLAM
text: TOGETHER with a THUNDEROUS CLANGGGG!
text: PLUNGING US INTO ABSOLUTE BLACKNESS...
speaker_heading: ACT III
speaker_heading: Skynet Showdown
text: The gong-like echo of the doors closing dies away along
text: with the fading sounds of the HK explosions.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Home.
text: A pale shaft of light filters down through the darkness,
text: and into it walk JOHN and TERMINATOR.
speaker_heading: KAWHUNNK.
text: A low, powerful HYDRAULIC MOTOR comes to life beneath us.
text: And then the theater begins to drop.
text: With a hefty UNLATCHING sound, the WALLS OF THE THEATER
text: START TO RISE. We're on a giant ELEVATOR, the size of the
dialog: entire theater.
text: Descending into the bowels of the earth.
text: John looks around in awe as the room descends.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Skynet.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Affirmative.
text: As we descend, the walls of the shaft reveal a larger
text: vista. We're descending through the heart of Skynet's
dialog: operations.
dialog: This is not a place intended for human use. This is a
text: facility designed by machines for machines. The
text: architecture is alien, without aesthetics, without even
text: such human basics as light switches and door knobs.
text: Girders and conduits crisscross the space around us.
text: We notice dozens of tiny red "EYES" scattered throughout
text: the chamber. These are AUTOMATIC VIDEO CAMERAS; they
text: constantly scan the complex, looking for trouble.
text: A bank of SECURITY SCANNERS checks the elevator for
text: intruders. These are BLUE FANS OF LIGHT that sweep across
text: the elevator and into the theater. John and Terminator
text: duck to avoid them. A sequence of ELECTRIC SPARKS throws
text: eerie popping light from below. John and Terminator brace
text: for trouble, but it's just a T-800 ENDOSKELETON WELDING
text: some mechanical components; it pays them no notice.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Pretty intense security.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
text: We are approaching the final level.
dialog: Skynet's Central Core.
text: Terminator starts loading his Plasma Rifle, checking the
text: satchel charges: preparing for the final battle.
text: And we descend into the highest, deepest, widest chamber
dialog: ever built.
text: THE CENTRAL CORE is a vast, gleaming steel corridor that
text: seems to go on forever: a cold, mechanical environment,
text: some kind of thermal-insulated manufacturing facility.
text: LIQUID NITROGEN moves through translucent walls and
text: streams down from vents and piping that line the walls and
text: ceiling. CATWALKS and CONVEYOR BELTS crisscross the
text: chamber at weird angles.
text: To the left and right, huge SIDE TUNNELS branch off,
text: nearly as vast as the central corridor. On the left we
text: see a GIGANTIC VIDEO WALL. The Video Wall stands thirty
text: of forty feet high and several hundred feet long, receding
text: down the corridor. From here, Skynet monitors every
dialog: aspect of its empire.
text: In the right hand tunnel, two massive TRUNCATED CONES
text: converge from above and below. A CATWALK extends from the
text: platform into the gap between the cones.
text: An immense CHROME PYRAMID, perhaps thirty feet high,
text: dominates the center tunnel. While the rest of the Skynet
text: systems are interconnected with ducts and cable trays,
text: this gleaming metal stands strangely removed.
text: BDOOOOM! The elevator comes to a stop. We've reached the
text: bottom of the huge elevator shaft.
text: John and Terminator quietly start to explore the space.
text: In contrast to the thunderous noise of the Act II
text: motorcycle-and-foot chase, the only sounds here are a
text: faint hum of powerful machines all around us and their
text: echoing footsteps. The room is cold. Sterile. Tomblike.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So... what's the plan?
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: (indicating the huge
dialog: pyramid)
dialog: We destroy the central processing
dialog: unit. Then we activate the Time
dialog: Generator...
dialog: (indicating the twin
dialog: cones to our right)
dialog: ... and you go home.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hmmm. Well... at least we're past
dialog: all the security systems.
text: But what he doesn't see is that the video cameras have
text: already spotted them, and their image appears on the stage
text: right VIDEO WALL.
text: And now, a bad sound. That same METALLIC SUCKING we heard
dialog: when the Cyberdyne Logo healed up. Only a whole lot
dialog: bigger.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: All but one.
text: There's MOVEMENT as the MASSIVE CHROME PYRAMID begins to
text: MELT. It ripples down, forming a huge donut of liquid
text: metal on the ground. The slithering chrome reveals a
text: smaller object underneath: an imposing ELECTRONIC PYRAMID
text: covered in undecipherable patterns of light.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (looking around,
dialog: nervous)
dialog: Okay... don't tell me...
dialog: (looking at the
dialog: cabinet)
dialog: That's the Central Processor...
text: Suddenly the entire chamber seems to COME TO LIFE as the
text: liquid metal mound begins to change shape. With the
text: horrifying sound of bending, twisting, shrieking metal,
text: GIANT SPIDER-LIKE ARMS slice up and out of the liquid
text: metal moat. A METALLIC HEAD grows from the center.
text: Razor-sharp chrome legs extend from the shape--
text: And it rises into the air.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: ... and we're about to meet the
dialog: night watchman.
text: John backs away as the DEADLY CREATURE CONTINUES MORPHING,
text: growing in size by the second. As the creature comes to
text: life, its head and arms REACH OUT towards us. John and
text: Terminator back away, momentarily unsure what to do.
text: With a DEAFENING ROAR the metal completes its
text: transformation into a horrific TECHNO-ORGANIC CHROME
text: CREATURE; a kind of "steel spider" nearly thirty feet
text: high. Revealing a cruel set of razor-sharp METAL TEETH,
text: the creature (call it the T-1,000,000) lets out a SHRIEK
text: OF FURY straight from the cauldrons of hell.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Do something quick!
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Stand clear.
text: Without missing a beat, Terminator OPENS FIRE with the
text: PLASMA RIFLE as John dives out of the way. The shots have
text: no effect on the creature. John and Terminator RUN TO
text: STAGE LEFT -- and the creature REACHES OUT ITS ARMS for
dialog: them.
text: Terminator FIRES another PLASMA BLAST and this time
text: manages to blow off one of the creature's chrome arms.
text: The wriggling tentacle merely dissolves and re-merges with
text: its body once again.
text: Terminator and John rush to the other side of the stage.
text: The T-1,000,000 blocks them with its arm while metallic
text: jaws snap at them. They move off the platform as the
text: creature tries to get at them. The metallic head hovers
text: over the audience as it searches for John and Terminator.
text: 3-D IMAGES ARE COMING AT US NOW FROM ALL THREE SCREENS.
text: Suddenly, John and Terminator leap onto the platform at
text: stage right. The creature's head snaps in their direction
text: and it SCREAMS LOUDLY as its arms extend toward them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Any ideas?
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Get down!
text: Terminator AIMS AT THE WALL BEHIND THE CREATURE and fires
text: blindly into it. PTWOOOOSSSSSHHH! THE SIDE OF THE WALL
text: BLOWS OPEN, releasing a spectacular cloud of LIQUID
text: NITROGEN across the stage. The fog fills the screen and
text: stage, obscuring the T-1,000,000 for a moment. The
text: creature's hideous metallic cries are silenced.
text: A moment later, the smoke clears. John and Terminator
text: stand as before, still ready for their attack. But now we
text: see the T-1,000,000 is FROZEN SOLID, covered with sparking
text: frost. Crystallized.
text: Terminator raises the plasma rifle.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wait!
text: The Terminator sprays the crystallized creature with
text: gunfire, and the T-1,000,000 shatters like glass. It's
text: blown into a million silvery fragments; the razor sharp
text: METAL SHARDS fly through the air in all directions. A
text: large cluster of fragments flies right toward our eyes.
text: They hover in front of us, tinkling against each other
text: with a music sound like a million wind chimes. We feel
text: tiny sprinkles of ICE WATER on our arms and faces as the
text: pieces shatter toward us.
text: John and Terminator look up in awe at the galaxy of metal
text: flakes floating overhead.
text: John looks around, uneasy.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I'm not sure that was a great idea.
text: He's right, of course. Already the fragments hovering in
text: front of us begin to SOFTEN and MELT. They turn into
text: floating blobs of liquid metal that start drifting back
text: towards the center of the chamber. The larger pieces
text: shift, moving to join the floating blobs. As our heroes
text: watch, the shattered pieces melt and merge together...
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: We don't have much time.
text: Terminator grabs the satchel charge from the backpack on
text: John. He sets the timer and sets the trigger. We hear it
text: BEEPING as the bomb begins counting down.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Thirty seconds. Follow me.
text: Terminator and John head to the stage left column, where a
text: metal structure leads to the upper platform--
text: And start to climb.
text: The T-1,000,000 is slowly reassembling itself. And now it
dialog: is really, really pissed.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, man... This is not good... This
dialog: is definitely not good...
text: Terminator reaches the Service Platform first, and RIPS
text: OPEN the big Junction Box. SPARKS jitter inside the box
text: as Terminator jiggers the wires.
scene_heading: TZZZZZZZAKKKTT!
text: The huge CONES on our right suddenly flare to life.
text: Familiar LIGHTNING BOLTS crackle, and a TIME SPHERE
text: appears between the cones, identical to the one Terminator
dialog: used in Act I.
text: John reaches the platform. The noise is building: the T-
text: 1,000,000 rises and undulates violently, extending its
text: razor-sharp arms out as it reforms.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: (indication the Time
dialog: Sphere)
dialog: Go John! Now!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: NO!
text: The creature's head is reforming now.
text: Terminator grabs hold of a HANGING CABLE and tests it for
text: strength. He wraps it around himself and grabs the bomb
text: in one hand. The BEEPING of the bomb has become rapid--
text: There's only about ten seconds left.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: NO! I won't go without you!
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Six seconds! GO!
text: Things happen REALLY fast now.
text: Terminator LAUNCHES HIMSELF INTO THE AIR, swinging on the
text: cable. As he swings toward the CPU Cabinet, Terminator
text: shouts back to John:
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: GO!!!
text: John realizes what's happening as he see Terminator
text: swinging towards the T-1,000,000--
text: He turns and RACES down the CATWALK--
text: And LEAPS INTO THE TIME SPHERE--
text: There's a FLARE OF ELECTRICAL ENERGY as he disappears--
text: The HEAD of the T-1,000,000 reforms and SCREAMS a blood-
text: curdling DIGITAL HOWL, twisting our attention back to the
dialog: center screen--
text: Its mouth opens, flashing chrome daggers as Terminator
text: swings toward it--
text: Terminator KICKS AND SPINS, narrowly avoiding the T-
dialog: 1,000,000 in mid-gnash--
text: The BEEPING of the bomb turns into a continuous high-
dialog: pitched "this-is-it" tone--
text: Terminator reaches the end of the cable's swing--
text: The T-1,000,000 freezes in its tracks: it knows it's
text: screwed. And in the split instant before it blows, every
text: surveillance camera in Skynet turns and focuses in on
text: Terminator. His grim face fills the massive VIDEO WALL in
text: a heroic close-up.
speaker_heading: TERMINATOR
dialog: Hasta la vista, baby.
text: And Terminator HURLS the bomb into the CPU.
text: KABLALAWHOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!
text: A MASSIVE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE CPU TO SHREDS -- IT TRIGGERS
text: A HUGE FIREBALL THAT BLOWS STRAIGHT TOWARD US--
text: AND BLOWS THE T-1,000,000 TO SLIVERY VAPOR!
text: And as the RUMBLING, ROILING FIREBALL BLOWS OFF THE SCREEN
text: and REACHES OUT towards us, a huge cloud of LIQUID
text: NITROGEN SMOKE thunders into the audience, obscuring
dialog: everything--
text: -- and for one terrifying instant, OUR SEATS suddenly DROP
dialog: OUT from under us--
text: -- and the world goes black.
speaker_heading: EPILOGUE
text: In the darkness that follows, the TERMINATOR THEME MUSIC
text: begins again.
text: We can make out the trappings of the CYBERDYNE
text: PRESENTATION CENTER in the dim light. A LIGHT falls on
text: JOHN and SARAH. John has returned from the battle drained
text: and forlorn. Sarah folds him into her arms as she gazes
text: out into the darkness. We hear SARAH'S VOICE overhead.
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O.)
text: And so the battle continues.
text: On the 3-D FILM SCREEN above them, a final image appears:
text: The burning red eyes of a TERMINATOR ENDOSKELETON. IT
text: moves slowly OUT toward us, flames reflected in its
text: chromeskull.
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O.)
dialog: And once again I find I owe my son's
dialog: life to the heroic actions of a
dialog: machine.
text: And then, as the endo skull hovers directly in front of
text: us, it FADES into the solemn visage of Arnold
text: Schwarzenegger. A RED GLOW appears in one eye behind his
dialog: sunglasses.
speaker_heading: SARAH (V.O)
dialog: A Terminator.
text: Thundering drums roll...
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT.
