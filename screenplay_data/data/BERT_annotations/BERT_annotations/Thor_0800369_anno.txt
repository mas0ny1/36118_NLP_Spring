speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
dialog: with a billion stars.
text: Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
text: BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
text: breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.
scene_heading: 1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1
text: A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
text: amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
text: down the street and heads out of town.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2
text: The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
text: of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
text: variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
text: at the sky.
text: JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
text: positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
text: constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
text: spare parts of other devices.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hurry!
text: We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
text: Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
text: well, rubbing his head.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh-- watch your head.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"
dialog: of yours supposed to look like?
speaker_heading: JANE
text: It's a little different each time.
dialog: Once it looked like, I don't know,
text: melted stars, pooling in a corner
dialog: of the sky. But last week it was a
dialog: rolling rainbow ribbon--
speaker_heading: SELVIG
speaker_heading: (GENTLY TEASING)
dialog: "Racing "round Orion?" I've always
dialog: said you should have been a poet.
text: Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
dialog: my gloves, will you?
text: Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
text: a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
text: Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
text: and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
text: foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not until you see it!
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: (re: the gloves)
dialog: I recognize those. Think how proud
dialog: he'd be to see you now.
text: Jane's grin fades to a sad smile.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The benefit of the doubt.
text: The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
text: they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: It's never taken this long before.
text: Darcy calls up from the front seat.
speaker_heading: DARCY (O.S.)
dialog: Can I turn on the radio?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (an edge to her voice)
dialog: Sure, if you like rocking out to
dialog: KFRM, "All agriculture, all the
dialog: time."
text: Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.
scene_heading: 3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3
text: The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
text: equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
text: together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
text: handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
text: frustrated Jane with sympathy.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The anomalies are always
text: precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
text: She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
text: tracking occurrences and patterns.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: The last seventeen occurrences have
dialog: been predictable to the minute... I
dialog: just don't understand.
text: Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
text: She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
text: the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Jane?
text: Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
text: champagne begins to vibrate.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: There's got to be some new
dialog: variable... Or an equipment
dialog: malfunction...
text: The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
text: them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I don't think there's anything
dialog: wrong with your equipment...
text: The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
text: shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
text: They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
text: the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
text: everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jane?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I think you want to see this.
text: Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
dialog: the desert --
text: MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
text: Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Holy. Shatner.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: That's your "subtle" aurora?!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: No-- yes! Let's go!
scene_heading: 4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4
text: The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
text: event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
text: out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
text: The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
text: her, yanks her back in.
dialog: 5 INT. SUV 5
text: Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Isn't this great?!
text: A thought strikes her.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're seeing it too, right? I'm
dialog: not crazy?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: That's debateable. Put your seat
dialog: belt on!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
text: The SUV lurches.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. DESERT 6
text: Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
dialog: out of the clouds comes --
scene_heading: AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
text: Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
text: thousand freight trains as it touches down.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.
dialog: 7 INT. SUV 7
text: Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
text: enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
text: into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
text: window, TAPING the storm.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You've gotta get us closer so I can
dialog: take a magnetic reading.
text: Darcy laughs.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Yeah, right! Good one!
dialog: (then, realizing)
dialog: Oh God, you're serious...
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You want those college credits or
dialog: not?
dialog: 8 EXT. SUV 8
text: The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
text: leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
text: two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
text: take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
text: strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
text: them with a terrifying intensity.
dialog: 9 INT. SUV 9
text: The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
text: the wheel, starts to head away.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Keep the credits. I'll intern at
dialog: Burger King.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Saving our lives!
text: Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
text: struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --
speaker_heading: A MAN
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
text: Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
text: slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
text: The SUV swerves -- but too late.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10
text: The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
text: him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.
dialog: 11 INT. SUV 11
text: Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
text: They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
text: A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.
scene_heading: 12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12
text: The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
text: man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
text: charred and blackened.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I think that was legally your
dialog: fault.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Get the first aid kit.
text: Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
text: next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
text: She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
text: clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
text: long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
text: features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
text: the life back into him.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
dialog: and don't be dead, okay? Open your
text: eyes and look at me.
text: Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
text: his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
text: azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
dialog: them.
text: For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
text: The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
text: freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
dialog: know CPR.
text: A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
text: She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: HIS EYES--
speaker_heading: DARCY
speaker_heading: (DREAMILY)
dialog: --are beautiful.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: --are dilating. That's a good
dialog: sign.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: We still have to get him to a
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (HOPEFULLY)
dialog: After we get a reading on the
dialog: storm?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
text: Immediately, Jane.
text: Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
text: above their heads. A thought strikes her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Where did he come from?
text: They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
text: glowing remnants of the storm, and into:
scene_heading: 13 EXT. SPACE 13
text: EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
text: resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL (V.O.)
dialog: Questions, they've always asked
dialog: questions -- this race called man,
dialog: on this planet they call earth.
dialog: Passionately longing to know how
dialog: they are connected to the heavens.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
text: We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
dialog: cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
dialog: galaxy.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: In ages past, they looked to us as
dialog: gods, for indeed so many times we
dialog: saved them from calamity. We tried
dialog: to show them how their world was
dialog: but one of the Nine Realms of the
dialog: Cosmos, linked to all others by the
dialog: branches of Yggdrasil...
text: We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
text: sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
text: shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
text: out into the black void of space.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
dialog: a universe of wonder, beauty, and
dialog: terror that they barely
dialog: comprehended.
text: We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
text: a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: But for all their thirst for
dialog: knowledge, they let our lessons
dialog: fall into myth and dreams.
dialog: Where did he come from? He came
dialog: from us, the proudest race of
dialog: warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
dialog: He came from this -- the greatest
dialog: Realm the universe has ever known.
text: We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
text: over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
dialog: what's on the other side:
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He came... from Asgard!
scene_heading: 14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14
text: Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
text: landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
text: modern yet timeless.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.
scene_heading: 15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15
text: The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
text: other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
text: out before it.
text: We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE
speaker_heading: STANDS --
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.
speaker_heading: ODIN ALLFATHER
text: Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
text: land at his side.
scene_heading: 16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16
text: Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
text: vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Do you think he's ready?
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
text: He thinks he is. He has his
dialog: father's confidence.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: He'll need his father's wisdom.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: And his humility?
text: Odin reacts.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
text: at his side to give him counsel.
dialog: Have faith in your sons.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
dialog: could be a great King...
text: Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
text: synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
text: as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
text: trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
dialog: sheer will.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
text: Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
text: A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.
speaker_heading: ODIN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (QUIETLY)
dialog: ...if we only had more time.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: For once, our son needs something
dialog: we cannot provide.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: I can fight it a little longer...
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: No. You've put it off too long! I
dialog: worry for you.
text: He touches her cheek.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: I've destroyed demons and monsters,
dialog: devastated whole worlds, laid waste
dialog: to mighty kingdoms, and still you
dialog: worry for me?
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: Always.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Not today. Now come kiss your
dialog: king... while I'm still king.
text: He pulls her close, and they kiss.
scene_heading: 17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17
text: Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
text: hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
text: fire lit room.
text: Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
text: against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
text: recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
text: Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
text: An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
text: He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Another!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
text: The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
text: intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
text: length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
text: He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
dialog: the Hall.
text: We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
text: shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
text: horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
text: from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
text: horned headpiece.
text: Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
text: a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
dialog: throne room.
speaker_heading: LOKI
speaker_heading: (TO THOR)
dialog: Nervous, brother?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Have you ever known me to be
dialog: nervous?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: There was the time in Nornheim...
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: That wasn't nerves, brother. It
dialog: was the rage of battle. How else
dialog: could I have fought my way through
dialog: a hundred warriors and pulled us
dialog: out alive?
text: The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
dialog: Thor.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: As I recall, I was the one who
dialog: veiled us in smoke to ease our
dialog: escape.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Some do battle, others just do
dialog: tricks.
text: The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
text: it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
text: EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
text: across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
text: goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Loki...
text: Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
text: back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Now that was just a waste of good
dialog: wine.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Just a bit of fun.
dialog: (to the Attendant)
dialog: Right, my friend?
text: The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED
speaker_heading: HELMET.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: Thor's helmet)
dialog: Nice feathers.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You don't really want to start this
dialog: again, do you, Cow?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I was being sincere!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You're incapable of sincerity.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Am I?
text: He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: I've looked forward to this day as
dialog: long as you have. You're my
dialog: brother and my friend. Sometimes
dialog: I'm envious, but never doubt that I
dialog: love you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
text: Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
dialog: He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
text: liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
text: brother's shoulder.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Thank you.
text: The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Give us a kiss.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Stop.
text: Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Like a king.
text: They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: It's time.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You go ahead.
text: Loki casts him a wary look.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll be along. Go on.
text: Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.
scene_heading: 17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A
text: VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
text: event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
text: stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
text: eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
text: FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
text: moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
text: holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
text: dreamily.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Thank you, love.
dialog: (to the Maidens)
speaker_heading: (MORE)

dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Now who'd like to polish my sword
dialog: for me?
text: The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
text: HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
text: of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
text: the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
text: ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
text: Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
text: Attendant quickly backs away.
text: From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
text: SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
text: HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
text: reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
text: on the table.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: (to the weapons)
dialog: I'll miss you.
scene_heading: 18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18
text: Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the

text: Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
text: the front of the hall. They are:
scene_heading: THE WARRIORS THREE
text: VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
text: oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
text: swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
text: HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
dialog: side.
text: With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
text: a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
dialog: with.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 11.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: I hope this goes quickly. I'm
text: famished.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
speaker_heading: (FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
dialog: Noooo!
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Are you attached to that pretty
dialog: face of yours? Because one more
dialog: word, and you won't be.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: My, we are hungry, aren't we?
text: The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do
dialog: it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
dialog: Just one smile.
text: Hogun stares at him grimly.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, half a smile. Look,
dialog: forget the smile, just show some
dialog: teeth.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Fandral, is it true the famous

speaker_heading: FANDRAL

dialog: the palace.
text: A cold BREEZE blows past them.
scene_heading: 19A INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 19A
text: Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his
text: hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: It's all right to be nervous.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Why does everyone keep saying that?
dialog: I'm not nervous!
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: You may be able to fool the rest of
speaker_heading: ASGARD --
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: ...but never you. I know.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: Thor, just remember that you have
dialog: something even the great Allfather

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: And what is that?
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: Me for a mother.

speaker_heading: FRIGGA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now don't keep your father waiting.

scene_heading: 20 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 20

text: him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
dialog: Ruler of Asgard.
text: Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
text: casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
text: seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
text: A murmur spreads through the crowd.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: (sotto, to Loki)
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: He said he'd be along.
text: Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SIF
text: He wants to make an entrance.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Well, if he doesn't show up soon,
dialog: he shouldn't bother. Odin looks
text: like he's ready to feed him to his
text: ravens.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I wouldn't worry. Father will
dialog: forgive him. He always does.

text: Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the
dialog: lower level --
speaker_heading: MJOLNIR
text: Roars up into the hall, Thor strides cockily into the hall
text: behind it, catching it behind his back. The CROWD erupts in
text: CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up
text: before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the
text: adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Oh, please.
text: Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.
scene_heading: 21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21
text: As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
text: breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
text: warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
dialog: something's not right.
text: They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
text: hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
dialog: pedestal.
text: LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
text: SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.
scene_heading: 22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22
text: Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
text: of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
text: Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
text: her. She can't help but smile.
text: Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
text: The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
dialog: authority.
text: He raises Gungnir before him.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Gungnir. Its aim is true, its
dialog: power strong. With it I have
dialog: defended Asgard and the lives of
dialog: the innocent across the Nine Realms
dialog: since the time of the Great
dialog: Beginning. And though the day has
dialog: come for a new King to wield his
dialog: own weapon -- that duty remains the
dialog: same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my
dialog: first-born.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A.
speaker_heading: ODIN (CONT'D)
dialog: So long entrusted with this mighty
dialog: hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the
dialog: heart of a dying star, from the
dialog: sacred metal of Uru. Only one may
dialog: lift it. Only one is worthy. Who
dialog: wields this hammer commands the
dialog: lightning and the storm. Its power
dialog: has no equal -- as a weapon, to
dialog: destroy, or as a tool, to build.
text: It is a fit companion for a King.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14.
scene_heading: 23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23
text: The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now
text: strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just
text: catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
scene_heading: and BLUE-SKINNED.
text: One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
text: to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
text: Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
text: standing in the shadows behind it.
text: As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
text: They turn back around.
text: Now it's their turn to SCREAM.
scene_heading: 24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24
text: The Ceremony continues.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Today I entrust you with the
dialog: greatest honor in all the Nine
dialog: Realms. The sacred throne of
dialog: Asgard. I have sacrificed much to
dialog: achieve peace. So, too, must a new
dialog: generation sacrifice to maintain
dialog: that peace. Responsibility, duty,
dialog: honor. These are not merely
dialog: virtues to which we must aspire.
dialog: They are essential to every soldier
dialog: and to every King.
text: The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub
text: their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the
dialog: hall.
text: Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son
dialog: with pride.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 15.
speaker_heading: ODIN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I swear.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Do you swear to preserve the peace?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I swear.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Do you swear to cast aside all
dialog: selfish ambition and pledge
dialog: yourself only to the good of all
dialog: the Realms?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I swear.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Then on this day, I, Odin
dialog: Allfather, proclaim you--
text: Odin hesitates, noticing a strange sight before him. ICE
text: creeps across the surface of the large banners around the
text: hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,
text: and the crowd see it too.
speaker_heading: ODIN (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: Frost giants...
text: The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the

scene_heading: 25B INT. VAULT - DAY 25B
text: Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him.
text: Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and
dialog: stop short.
text: Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the floor.
text: We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost Giants
text: clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering
text: remains on the floor.
text: They've just lost a savage battle. Badly.
text: Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal
text: creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.
text: It is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: The Destroyer.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
speaker_heading: (AWED)
dialog: I thought it was but a legend.
text: Odin steps in behind the Asgardians, as the Destroyer sets
text: the Casket back on its pedestal. It moves back to its post,
text: the faint, FIERY GLOW extinguishes within it.
text: Fandral looks around the Vault, ill at ease.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: I've never been inside the Vault
dialog: before. It's said the Tesseract
dialog: was once held here.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
speaker_heading: (AWED)
dialog: The Tesseract? I thought that was
dialog: but a legend too!
speaker_heading: SIF

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: The Jotuns must pay for what

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: They have paid with their lives.
dialog: The Destroyer did its job, and the
text: Casket is safe. All is well.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: "All is well?!" They broke into
dialog: the Weapons Vault! If the Frost
dialog: Giants had stolen even one of these
speaker_heading: RELICS--
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: But they didn't.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I want to know why they--
speaker_heading: ODIN
speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)
dialog: The Casket of Ancient Winters
dialog: belonged to the Jotuns. They
dialog: believe it's their birthright.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: And if you hadn't taken it from
dialog: them they would have laid waste to
dialog: all the Nine Realms!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: I have a truce with Laufey, the
dialog: Jotun King.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: He just broke your truce! We must
dialog: act!
text: Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Leave us.
text: Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.
speaker_heading: ODIN (CONT'D)
dialog: And what action would you take?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: March into Jotunheim as you once
dialog: did, teach them a lesson, break
dialog: their spirits so they'll never dare
dialog: try to cross our borders again!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: You're thinking only as a warrior!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16B.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: This was an act of war!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: It was the act of but a few, doomed
dialog: to fail.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: They got this far!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: We will find the breach in our
dialog: defenses. It will be found, and it
dialog: will be sealed.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: As King of Asgard, I would--
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: You are not King. Not yet.
text: Thor sees in his father's face that he's pushed this as far
text: as he can. He backs away, then leaves, pushing through the
text: doors so hard that they SLAM backwards behind him. Odin
text: watches him go.
scene_heading: 26 INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26
text: Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the
text: festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger
text: and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the
text: massive tables.
text: From across the room, Loki watches him.
text: AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE
text: Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in
text: search of his dinner.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Redecorating, are we?
text: Volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food, aghast.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: What's this -- ?!
speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: I told you they'd cancel it.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: We thought that was just you being
dialog: your normal cheery self.
text: Volstagg looks about the floor, despairing.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: All this food -- so innocent, cast
text: to the ground. It breaks the
dialog: heart!
text: Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki
text: calmly moves towards him.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: It's unwise to be in my company
dialog: right now, brother.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Who said I was wise?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: (re: the empty hall)
dialog: This was to be my day of triumph.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It will come. In time.
speaker_heading: (ADMITS)
dialog: If it's any consolation, I think
dialog: you're right. About the Frost
dialog: Giants, about Laufey, everything.
dialog: If a few of them could penetrate
dialog: the defenses of Asgard once, who's
dialog: to say they won't try again. Next
dialog: time with an army?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Yes, exactly!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: But there's nothing we can do
dialog: without defying Father.
text: Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye.
text: Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: No... stop there! I know that
dialog: look!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: It's the only way to ensure the
dialog: safety of our borders.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It's madness!
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Madness? What sort of madness?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Nothing! Thor was making a jest!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: The safety of our Realm is no jest.
dialog: We're going to Jotunheim.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Thor, of all the laws of Asgard,
dialog: this is one you must not break.
text: Loki looks on, intrigued by the proceedings.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: This isn't like a journey to Earth,
dialog: where you summon a little lightning
dialog: and thunder and the mortals worship
dialog: you as a god. This is Jotunheim.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: And if the Frost Giants don't kill
dialog: you, your Father will!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: My father fought his way into
dialog: Jotunheim, defeated their armies,
dialog: and took their Casket! We'd just
dialog: be looking for answers.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: It is forbidden!
text: Thor sizes up his friends, smiles. He proceeds to make his
text: case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: My friends, have you forgotten all
dialog: that we've done together?
text: He turns to Fandral.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Who brought you into the sweet
dialog: embrace of the most exotic maidens
dialog: in all of Yggdrasil?
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: You did.
speaker_heading: THOR
speaker_heading: (TO HOGUN)
dialog: Who led you into the most glorious
dialog: of battles...
speaker_heading: (TO VOLSTAGG)
dialog: ...and to delicacies so succulent,
dialog: you thought you'd died and gone to

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
dialog: You did. / You did.
text: He turns to Sif.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: And who proved wrong all who
dialog: scoffed at the idea that a young
dialog: maiden could be one of the fiercest
dialog: warriors this Realm has ever known?
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: THOR
speaker_heading: (QUICKLY)
dialog: True. But I supported you...
dialog: (then, to the others)
dialog: My friends, trust me now. We must
dialog: do this.
text: The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no
dialog: convincing him.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on. You're not going to let
dialog: my brother and me take all the
dialog: glory, are you?
text: Loki looks startled.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You are coming with me...
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Yes, of course! I won't let my
text: brother march into Jotunheim alone.
dialog: I will be at his side.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: And I.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: And I.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20.
speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: And I. The Warriors Three fight
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: I fear we'll live to regret this.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: If we're lucky.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27
text: Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the Palace,
text: across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS who
text: ready their battle gear for their journey.
text: Loki slips away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD.
text: Hogun notices.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: We must first find a way to get
text: past Heimdall.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: That will be no easy task. It's
dialog: said the Gatekeeper can see a
text: single dew drop fall from a blade
text: of grass a thousand worlds away.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
text: And he can hear a cricket passing
text: gas in Niffelheim.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Jest not! He heareth all!
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Please. Getting past him should be
dialog: simple enough now, since he seems
dialog: to be letting Frost Giants sneak by
text: under his nose.
text: Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Forgive him! He meaneth no
dialog: offense!
text: Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20A.
scene_heading: 28 EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28
text: Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
text: the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
dialog: most astounding path in this Realm or any other --
text: THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
text: Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
text: mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
text: ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
dialog: Observatory.
scene_heading: 29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29
text: The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
text: Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
text: them, blocking their way, staring them down.
dialog: There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
text: Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
text: intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
text: glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Keep your weapons sheathed and your
dialog: mouths closed. This is going to
dialog: take subtlety and sincerity, not
dialog: brute strength. Leave it to me.
text: Loki dismounts and steps forward.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
scene_heading: GOOD HEIMDALL--
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: You're not dressed warmly enough.
text: Thor, Loki, and the others trade looks.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
text: The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It
dialog: will kill you all in time, even
dialog: Thor.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: You think you can deceive me? I,
dialog: who watch all? I, who can sense
text: the flapping of a butterfly's wings
dialog: a thousand worlds away?
text: He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL (CONT'D)
text: Or can hear a cricket passing gas
dialog: in Niffelheim?
text: Fandral looks gob-smacked.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 22.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: That was just a bit of a jest,
dialog: really...
text: Loki goes into damage control.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You must be mistaken. We're not--
speaker_heading: THOR
speaker_heading: (STEPPING FORWARD)
dialog: Enough.
speaker_heading: (TO HEIMDALL)
dialog: Heimdall, may we pass?
text: Heimdall stares him down.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: For ages have I guarded Asgard and
dialog: kept it safe from those who would
dialog: do it harm. In all that time,
dialog: never has an enemy slipped by my
dialog: watch -- until this day. I wish to
dialog: know how that happened.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Then tell no one where we've gone
dialog: until we've returned.
text: Thor walks past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper lets the group
text: pass. Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: What happened? Your silver tongue
dialog: turn to lead?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Get me off this bridge before it
dialog: cracks under your girth.
text: Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
scene_heading: 30 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30
text: Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a
text: platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus
text: at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: Be warned. I will honor my sworn
dialog: oath to protect this Realm as its
dialog: Gatekeeper. If your return
dialog: threatens the safety of Asgard,
dialog: Bifrost will remain closed to you.
dialog: You'll be left to die in the cold
text: wastes of Jotunheim.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I have no plans to die today.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: None do.
text: Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the
text: apparatus of the Observatory starts up.
scene_heading: 31 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31
text: The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
dialog: the Observatory.
scene_heading: 32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32
text: Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
text: Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
text: section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
text: sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
text: the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.
text: The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor
text: and his five comrades stand.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: All is ready. You may pass.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Couldn't you just leave the bridge
dialog: open for us?
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: To keep this bridge open would
dialog: unleash the full power of the
dialog: Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with
dialog: you upon it.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Ah. Never mind, then.
text: Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,
dialog: grins.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Come on. Don't be bashful.
text: The others join him at his side, then step towards the
text: Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
text: changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
text: elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
text: off the platform and inside the vortex.
scene_heading: 33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33
text: A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
text: out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
text: and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
text: imprinted on the ice around them.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
text: Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
text: grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling
text: precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's
text: inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Come on, big fella. Up...!
text: With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the
text: ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: This belt! This belt is now my
dialog: lucky belt! I will never remove
dialog: it! Even when bathing!
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: You bathe?
text: Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
text: at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
text: is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
text: apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
text: and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks
text: and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun
text: city lies in the distance.
speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: We shouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Too late now.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Actually, it's not. We could turn
dialog: right around, hop back to Asgard,
text: share a mug by the fire. Could be
dialog: nice.
text: Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Perhaps we should wait.
text: Thor turns back to his brother.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: To survey the enemy. To gauge
dialog: their strengths and weaknesses from
text: a distance.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: I'm liking that. Gauging,
dialog: surveying. Particularly the
dialog: distance part.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: We know all we must. It's time to
dialog: act.
text: Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: He's just got to swing his
dialog: hammer...
scene_heading: 34 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34
text: The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland,
text: shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki
text: looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers.
text: Thor, invigorated, turns back to his comrades.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: It feels good, doesn't it? To be
text: together again, adventuring on
dialog: another world?
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Adventuring? Is that what we're
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What would you call it?
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Freezing.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
text: Starving.
speaker_heading: SIF
text: Whining.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: How about a song to lift our

speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: No, not that!

speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Well, now I'm on board.
text: She and Thor share a grin.
text: The party reaches the edge of the city -- its ancient
text: structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling, ravaged by
text: warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies before them, across a
dialog: central plaza.
speaker_heading: SIF (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are they?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Hiding. As cowards always do.
text: Thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza.
text: Loki reluctantly follows. They don't notice as SHADOWY
text: FIGURES move in the shadows of the structures nearby.
scene_heading: 35 EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35
text: The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in
text: the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides.
text: The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons.
text: A JOTUN SENTRY calls to him.
speaker_heading: JOTUN SENTRY
dialog: What is your business here,

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I speak only to your King. Not to

speaker_heading: JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Then speak.
text: Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple,
text: where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading
dialog: waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too
text: proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and
dialog: his people have endured.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: I am Laufey, King of this Realm.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: And I am--
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: We know who you are, Odinson. Why
dialog: have you brought the stench of your
dialog: blood into my world?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I demand answers.
text: Laufey stands, sizing up Thor, tries to piece this together.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: You "demand?"
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: How did your people get into
dialog: Asgard?
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
text: The house of Odin is full of

text: Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, disturbed
text: by the Jotun King's words.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Do not dishonor my father's name
dialog: with your lies.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: Your father is a murderer and a

dialog: the right to reclaim the Casket.
dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Not when you'd use it to make war

text: Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: And why have you come here? To
dialog: make peace? You long for battle.
dialog: You crave it. I see you for what
dialog: you are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but
text: a boy, trying to prove himself a
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: This boy has grown tired of your
text: mockery.
text: Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in
text: front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost
text: Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet
text: tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Thor, stop and think. Look around
dialog: you. We are outnumbered.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Know your place, brother...
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: You should listen to his counsel.
dialog: You know not what your actions

text: Laufey steps out of the shadows.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY (CONT'D)
dialog: But I do. Go now, while I still
dialog: allow it.
text: Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: We will accept your most gracious
dialog: offer.
text: The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down
text: a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades
text: breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant

speaker_heading: JOTUN
dialog: Run back home, little princess.
text: Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes white. He knows what's
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Damn.
text: In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS
text: the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly
text: draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
text: Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Silly hammer! Has a mind of its
dialog: own!
text: ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR
text: around them, extending off the ends of their arms like
text: SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: I'm hoping that's just decorative.
text: Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost
text: Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,
text: separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer
text: around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Next!
text: Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Well? What move, do you think?
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: I say we use "The Norn's Revenge."
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: At this close range? I think "The
dialog: Alfheim Lunge" is a better move.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
speaker_heading: (DISGUSTED)

dialog: No! How about "The Randy

speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: Shut up!
text: Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
text: loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
text: A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
text: hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
text: mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
text: hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
text: him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
text: back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
text: with his mace.
text: Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
text: double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: If you don't treat me like a lady,
dialog: I won't act like a lady!
text: She takes out the Jotun.
text: Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
text: the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
text: swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
text: The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
text: out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
text: crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (to the falling Giant)
dialog: Pathetic.
text: He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
text: either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
dialog: once.
text: Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
text: The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
text: punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
text: long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
text: front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
text: Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Come on! At least make it a
dialog: challenge for me!
text: He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
text: tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
text: rises, grins.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Now that's more like it!
text: He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
text: head over heels.
text: Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
text: back to his grasp.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: the fallen Brute)
dialog: Ugly and stupid.
text: Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
text: ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
text: Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
text: sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
text: the chest. The Jotun falls dead.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: (to Hogun, re: knife)
dialog: I'm so glad I taught him how to do
dialog: that!
text: Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
dialog: hits in.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: You may want to put some ice on
dialog: that!
text: The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
text: a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
text: Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
dialog: You may be taller, but I'm wider!
text: Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
dialog: flying.
text: Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
text: sending him crashing to the ground.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
dialog: It's not too late for you to
dialog: surrender.
text: Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
text: bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
text: Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
text: Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
text: Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
text: ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
text: Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
text: to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
text: opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
text: out a small FLASK.
text: Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
text: to his comrades.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't let them grab hold of you!
text: He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
dialog: battle.
text: Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
text: stops mid ice layer.
text: The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
text: and the warrior drops to one knee.
text: Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
text: quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
text: her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
text: chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
dialog: (on his belly)
dialog: Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
dialog: had him!
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Of course you did.
text: Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
text: them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
text: bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
text: the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
dialog: out.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.
text: A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-
text: FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.
text: Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he
dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Hang on!
text: Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
text: Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
text: worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
text: close to hacking into Hogun's legs.
speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: Watch the legs!
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: Right. Sorry.
text: Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally
text: freeing Hogun's feet.
text: Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: You really think your icicles are a
dialog: match for Asgardian steel?
text: Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Fair enough.
text: Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
text: sword and snaps it in half.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Could we stop just a moment while I
dialog: get another sword?
text: Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
text: then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
text: the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
text: through with his own weapon.
text: The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
text: pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
text: forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
text: rendering him helpless.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
text: Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and

text: unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
dialog: them off.
text: Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: That's unfortunate.
text: He hurries to his wounded comrade.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: I may need a bit of help. Not a
dialog: good look, is it?
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Just try not to bleed.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: How's the face?
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Flawless.
text: Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
text: stalagmite.
text: Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
dialog: Giants.
text: The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
text: hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
text: grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
text: his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
text: Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
text: of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
text: -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
text: painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
text: The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
text: unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
text: distraction, KICKS the Giant.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
text: Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
text: the Jotuns around him.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Come on!
text: But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
text: Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
text: from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
text: Mjolnir falls to the ground.
text: A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
dialog: ground, to no avail.
text: Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
text: slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
dialog: leave.
text: From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
text: it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
text: palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
text: wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.
text: The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their
dialog: feet.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: That can't be good.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Yes, it could! Might be an early
dialog: spring!
text: They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see
text: shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS
text: awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.
text: Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Thor, we must go!
text: Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes
text: mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the
text: look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat
dialog: of battle.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Then go!
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: There are too many of them!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I can stop them!
text: The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all
dialog: around them.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Thor!
text: But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Run!
text: Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of
text: the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give
dialog: chase.
text: Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.
text: The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he
text: disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a
speaker_heading: MOMENT --
speaker_heading: THOR'S FIST
text: Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.
text: He opens his hand, beckoning.
text: One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind
text: him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in
text: the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
text: raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
text: with all his might.
text: KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
text: channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
text: Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
text: shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.
text: But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
text: shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to
text: where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground
text: beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
dialog: What's Thor done?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Likely killed us all!
text: As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their
text: mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists
text: quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
text: The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
text: a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
text: move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
text: Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
text: raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off
text: the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his
dialog: comrades.
scene_heading: 35A EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A
text: Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Loki, we have to see.

dialog: many, even for a Thunder God.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
speaker_heading: (TO LOKI)
dialog: Actually, could you bring the mists
dialog: back, please?
text: Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.
text: The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening
text: ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts
text: down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom
text: comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of
text: all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --
speaker_heading: ODIN ALLFATHER

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.
text: The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,
text: stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.
text: Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath
text: his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to
text: react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-
text: to-face with Odin.
text: Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's
text: about to happen.
text: Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the
dialog: Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's
text: not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of

dialog: You're right. These are the

speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: We are beyond diplomacy now,
dialog: Allfather. He'll get what he came
dialog: for -- war and death.
text: Odin looks grim, determined.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: So be it.
text: Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but
text: Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon
text: the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards
text: in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.
text: The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the
text: fleeing Jotuns with delight.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Now! We'll finish them together!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Silence!
text: Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the

dialog: Whosoever holds this hammer, if he

scene_heading: 37 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37
text: Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's

dialog: into him, as we:
text: CUT TO BLACK.

speaker_heading: JANE (V.O.)
dialog: Get the first aid kit.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
dialog: and don't be dead, okay? Open your
text: eyes and look at me.
speaker_heading: THOR'S POV
text: Thor opens his eyes to see Jane Foster staring at him,
text: concerned. She looks vulnerable and beautiful.
speaker_heading: DARCY (O.S.)
dialog: Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
dialog: know CPR.
speaker_heading: END THOR'S POV
scene_heading: TIME CUT TO:
text: Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their
text: heads. A thought strikes her.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (TO SELVIG)
dialog: Where did he come from?
text: They exchange puzzled looks when Thor GROANS again. He sits
text: up abruptly, and Jane topples backwards in surprise.
text: Thor staggers groggily to his feet, then turns and offers
text: Jane a hand up. She takes it hesitantly, and he easily pulls
text: her up. She can't help but marvel at his strength.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh, thanks. Are you okay?
text: Thor searches the ground.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Hammer...
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
dialog: That's pretty obvious.
text: Jane notices something on the ground around them. She shines
text: her flashlight down at the sand.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 36A.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Erik... look at this.
text: He joins her at her side and sees it. A faint, discernible
text: pattern is etched into the sand. They exchange a look.
text: Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly takes out a camera and
text: snaps some photos of the runes. A breeze begins to blow them
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: We've got to move fast before
dialog: anything changes.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: We need soil samples, light
dialog: readings, everything.
text: She pulls out a light meter, holds it up, takes some
text: readings, jots them down in her notebook. Selvig looks at
text: Thor, who stares up at the sky.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Jane, we need get him to a
dialog: hospital.
text: Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the
text: cannister.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Not right now. It'll take too
text: long. County's an hour away.
dialog: We'll drop him off after we're done
dialog: here.
text: Selvig looks uncertain.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (RE: THOR)
dialog: Look at him, he's fine.
text: Thor stares up at the stars, shouts up at them angrily.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Father! Heimdall! I know you can
dialog: hear me! Open the bridge!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (off Selvig's look)
dialog: Okay, you and Darcy take him to the
dialog: hospital, I'll stay here.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: You expect me to leave you alone in
dialog: the middle of the desert?
text: Thor turns to the others, frustrated.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You! What world is this?
text: The group is intimidated by his fervor.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: It's all right, my friend. We're
dialog: going to get you some help.
text: Selvig touches Thor's shoulder. Thor shoves him off, grows
text: agitated, belligerent.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 37A.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Where am I?! Answer me!

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 38.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Erik, just back away...
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: (to Thor, calming)
dialog: You're in the desert outside the
dialog: town of Puente Antiguo.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Uh... New Mexico?
text: Darcy raises a TASER at him. Thor looks at the weapon,
dialog: unsure what to make of it.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You dare threaten Thor with so puny
dialog: A--
text: Darcy fires, the electrified wires shooting out of the taser,
text: ZAPPING him in the chest. Thor convulses, falls to the
text: ground unconscious. Jane and Selvig stare at her, shocked.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: What? He was freaking me out.
scene_heading: 38 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38
text: As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle
text: to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
speaker_heading: (TO DARCY)
dialog: Next time you decide to taser
dialog: someone, do me a favor and make
dialog: sure they're already inside the
dialog: truck.
speaker_heading: (TO JANE)
dialog: Jane, come on...
text: Reluctantly, Jane joins the others inside the SUV.
scene_heading: 39 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39
text: The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high
text: overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost
text: energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing
text: into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a

scene_heading: 42 INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 42
text: Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two

text: stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS NURSE
dialog: Name?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He said it was "Thor."
text: The Nurse painstakingly types it into the computer, one key
text: at a time. Jane watches as Thor is wheeled out of the room.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS NURSE
speaker_heading: (SPELLING)
dialog: T-H-O-R. And your relationship to
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I've never met him before.
speaker_heading: DARCY
text: Until she hit him with the car.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Grazed him, actually.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: Oh, and we tasered him, too.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS NURSE
speaker_heading: (SYMPATHETIC)
dialog: Must have been quite the spat.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I told you, I don't know him. I
dialog: just want to make sure he's okay.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS NURSE
dialog: I'm going to need a name and

speaker_heading: SELVIG

scene_heading: 43 INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43
text: Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on
text: a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his
dialog: arm.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: Hi. Just taking a little blood.
text: Thor SLAPS the syringe away angrily, starts to sit up.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: How dare you attack the son of
dialog: Odin!
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: I need some help!
text: Two ORDERLIES race over, try to hold Thor down.
speaker_heading: NURSE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're trying to help you!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Then bring me a healing stone, you
dialog: savages!
text: He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a
text: couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all
text: struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying,
text: furniture overturned.
speaker_heading: ORDERLY
dialog: What the hell is this guy on?
text: Finally, they force him back down onto the gurney. Thor
text: looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered
text: by this small group. The NURSE injects him with a sedative.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You're no match for the Mighty--
text: Thor struggles a beat, then passes out.
scene_heading: 44 EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 44
text: Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls

speaker_heading: TOWNIE
dialog: Huh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A.
text: The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater.
text: We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an
text: otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object,
text: tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts,
text: strains with all his might, with no luck.
text: He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious
dialog: object.

scene_heading: 45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45
text: The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.
text: Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast
text: desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at
text: her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.
text: A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the
text: Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.
text: Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.
text: He notices a monitor which displays a complex program
text: entitled "J. FOSTER ALGORITHM ANALYSIS". He looks proud.
text: The three of them have been up all night, fueled by caffeine
dialog: and excitement.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Darcy, when you're done, take the
dialog: soil samples to Professor Meyers in
dialog: geology. Remind him, he owes me.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: We might want to perform a spectral
dialog: analysis.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: "We?"
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: I flew all the way out here --
dialog: might as well make myself useful.
text: This is the offer Jane's been waiting for. She gets up,
text: inserts the piece of equipment she's been working on into a
text: rack-mounted server.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know what would be really
dialog: useful? Do you still have that
dialog: friend at LIGO?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: She was more than a friend.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Could you call in a favor?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: You don't think this was just a
dialog: magnetic storm?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: If I'm right, their observatory
dialog: must have picked up gravitational
dialog: waves during last night's event.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Meaning?
text: Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Meaning these anomalies might
dialog: signify something bigger.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: How "big" are we talking about?
text: Jane indicates the footage on the monitor. As the last of
text: the Bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky, there
text: appears to be a blister in space, bulging out in convex and
text: covered with stars.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I think the lensing around the
dialog: edges is characteristic of an
dialog: Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: I thought you were a science major.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Political Science.
text: Selvig shoots Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: She was the only applicant.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
speaker_heading: (TO DARCY)
dialog: An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a
dialog: "theoretical" connection between
text: two different points of space-time.
text: Darcy stares blankly.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (TO DARCY)
text: A wormhole.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B.
text: Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the
dialog: monitor.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Erik, look...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42.
text: Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen
text: through the "bubble" in the clouds.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you see here?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Stars.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes. But not our stars.
text: She spreads out a STAR CHART, barely able to contain her
dialog: excitement.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is the star alignment for our
dialog: quadrant, this time of year. So
dialog: unless Ursa Minor decided to take
dialog: the day off... those are someone
dialog: else's constellations.
text: Selvig's intrigued, in spite of himself.
text: Darcy pulls another frame-grab of the Bifrost footage from
text: the printer and hangs it on the wall, when something in the
text: image catches her eye.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Hey, check it out.
text: Jane and Selvig examine the photo, amazed.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Is that...?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I think I left something at the
dialog: hospital.
text: As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost
text: funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable shape
text: of a MAN.
scene_heading: 45A EXT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 45A
text: At the top of the palace, we see a small FIGURE on the

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 42A.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: How could you have done this?
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Do you understand what he set in
dialog: motion? He's taken us to the brink
dialog: of war!
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: But banishment? You would lose him
dialog: forever? He's your son!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: What would you have done?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: I would not have exiled him to a
dialog: world of mortals, stripped of his
dialog: powers, to suffer alone. I would
dialog: not have had the heart for such
dialog: cruelty!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: That is why I'm King.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I, too, grieve the loss of our son.
dialog: But there are some things that even
dialog: I cannot undo.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: You can bring him back.
speaker_heading: ODIN
text: No. His fate is in his own hands
dialog: now.
scene_heading: 47 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47
text: Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his
text: wrists now. He pulls at them, tries to free himself, to no
dialog: avail.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: It's not possible.
text: He tries again, mustering all his strength. One of his hands
text: slips free from its restraint.
scene_heading: 47A INT. COUNTY HOSPITAL ER - DAY 47A
text: Jane again faces the Admissions Nurse, with Selvig and Darcy
dialog: nearby.
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS NURSE
dialog: I'm sorry, only relatives can visit

speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (THINKING FAST)
dialog: But... I'm his wife.

speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS NURSE
dialog: I thought you said you didn't know
dialog: him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I meant I barely know him anymore.
text: The man he's become. He's changed.
dialog: I mean, what woman really knows her
dialog: husband, anyway?
speaker_heading: ADMISSIONS NURSE
dialog: None of us, dear. He's in Room
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: 48 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 48

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 44.

scene_heading: 51 INT. JANE'S SUV 51

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Typical. I just lost my most

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: So now what?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: We find him.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Did you see what he did in there?
dialog: I don't know if finding him is the
dialog: best idea.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I want to know what that thing was,
dialog: and he may have the answers. We
dialog: don't have a choice.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Oo-kay.
text: She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: So we're just going to spend the
dialog: rest of the day looking for him?
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: However long it takes.
text: Jane puts the car in reverse and backs up, when --
speaker_heading: BAM!
text: She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital

scene_heading: 53 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53
text: Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-
text: shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a
text: ROARING central fire.
text: Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING
text: STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he
text: carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,
text: the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His
text: comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.
text: Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.
text: Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still
text: blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.
text: Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the
text: Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to
dialog: its normal color.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: We should never have let him go.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: There was no stopping him.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: At least he's only banished, not
dialog: dead. Which is what we'd all be if
dialog: that guard hadn't told Odin where
dialog: we'd gone.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: How did the guard even know?
text: Loki stares at his arm.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I told him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I told him to go to Odin after we'd
dialog: left. Though he should be flogged
dialog: for taking so long.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: You told the guard?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I saved our lives! And Thor's. I
dialog: had no idea Father would banish him
dialog: for what he did.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Loki, you're the only one who can
dialog: help Thor now. You must go to the
dialog: Allfather and convince him to
dialog: change his mind!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: And if I do, then what? I love
dialog: Thor more dearly than any of you,
dialog: but you know what he is. He's
dialog: arrogant. He's reckless. He's
dialog: dangerous. You saw how he was
dialog: today. Is that what Asgard needs
dialog: from its King?
text: The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He
text: leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: He may speak about the good of
dialog: Asgard, but he's always been
dialog: jealous of Thor.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: True, but we should be grateful to
dialog: him. He did save our lives.
speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: Laufey said there were traitors in
dialog: the House of Odin.
text: The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Why is it every time you choose to
dialog: speak, it has to be something dark
dialog: and ominous?
speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: A master of magic could easily
text: bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
text: The others look to Hogun, understanding the implication.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: No! Surely not!
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Loki's always been one for
dialog: mischief, but you're talking about
dialog: something else entirely.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: Who else could elude Heimdall's
text: gaze with tricks of light and
dialog: shadow?
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: The ceremony was interrupted just
dialog: before Thor was named King.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: We should go to the Allfather.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: And tell him what? "Oh, by the
dialog: way, we think your son just
dialog: betrayed the throne. And do us a
dialog: favor. Bring back Thor. There's a
dialog: good fellow!"
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: It's our duty. If any of our
dialog: suspicions are right, then all of
text: Asgard is in danger.
scene_heading: 54 INT. VAULT - DAY 54
text: Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient Winters
text: sitting on its stand.
text: He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
text: between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
text: blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.
text: The latticework behind the Casket starts to separate, the
text: Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow within its black
text: metal armor, as it rattles to life, but Loki ignores it --
text: the blueness spreading further, consuming his whole body.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48.
speaker_heading: ODIN (O.S.)
dialog: Stop!
text: Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer
text: goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it.
text: Odin eyes Loki with dismay.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Am I cursed?
speaker_heading: ODIN
text: No. Put the Casket down.
text: Loki sets the Casket back upon its pedestal, his body quickly
text: returning to its normal form and color. He stares at his
dialog: father.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What am I?
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: You're my son.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What more than that?
text: Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened.
text: Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: The Casket wasn't the only thing

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: In the aftermath of the battle, I

text: Loki is sent reeling by the revelation.
speaker_heading: LOKI

speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun
dialog: blood. Why would you take me?
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: You were an innocent child.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You took me for a purpose, what was
dialog: it?
text: Odin doesn't answer.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: I thought we could unite our
dialog: kingdoms one day, bring about an
dialog: alliance, bring about a permanent
dialog: peace... through you. But those
dialog: plans no longer matter.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: So I am no more than another stolen
dialog: relic, locked up here until you
dialog: might have use of me.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Why do you twist my words?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You could have told me what I was
dialog: from the beginning. Why didn't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: You are my son. My blood. I
dialog: wanted only to protect you from the
dialog: truth.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Because I am the monster parents
dialog: tell their children about at night?
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Don't...
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It all makes sense now. Why you
dialog: favored Thor all these years.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Listen...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48B.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Because no matter how much you

dialog: Throne of Asgard!
text: Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to
text: move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of

dialog: to fight it off.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Listen to me!
text: Loki strides away towards the exit.
speaker_heading: ODIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Loki!
text: Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, emotional,

text: The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. His entire body
text: now moves out of sync with the rest of the world, leaving
text: trails behind him as he staggers backwards.
text: Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a
text: scream. He collapses to the stone floor.
text: Loki, shocked, hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms,

scene_heading: 59 EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 59
text: It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on
text: lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They
text: watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed a
text: line to take a turn with the mysterious object.
text: One of them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up,
text: the next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the
text: effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their
dialog: cell phones.
text: They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a path as a large
text: PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the crater's edge. An EAGER
text: TOWNIE hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain

text: He fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes

speaker_heading: EAGER TOWNIE
dialog: This'll do it.

speaker_heading: EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, let 'er rip!

dialog: and go flying.
text: People dive out of the way.
text: The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"

text: continuing. They don't notice as --
text: ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM
text: An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in

text: below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the
dialog: crater.
text: He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the object

text: In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks

text: Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, can't help but notice
text: his reflection in the mirror. Darcy eyes his powerful build,

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: You know, for a crazy homeless guy,

text: Jane turns away. Thor emerges from the back room, holding a
text: t-shirt.
speaker_heading: DARCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, sorry I tased you!
text: Thor heads over to Jane's work area, starts fiddling with the
text: equipment there with interest. Jane hurries over to put a
dialog: stop to it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Excuse me... excuse me!
text: She leads him away from the work station. Thor holds up the
text: t-shirt. On the front, it bear a sticker which reads:
text: "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. DONALD BLAKE". Thor looks at it,
text: puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: They're the only clothes I had

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: They will suffice.
text: Thor turns his attention to the pictures of the Bifrost on
dialog: the wall.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You're welcome. Now tell me...
text: Thor studies the frame-grabs with interest. Jane points to
text: his form in the Bifrost photo.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: What were you doing, in that?
text: He glances at it, dismissive.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What does anyone do in the Bifrost?
text: Everyone stares at him. Selvig seems to recognize the word.
text: Jane opens her notebook, quickly writes the word down. Thor
text: moves close to her, eyes the notations and drawings within
dialog: the book, curious.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: (amused, skeptical)
dialog: The Bifrost...
text: Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: THOR
speaker_heading: (IGNORING HER)

scene_heading: 61 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61
text: Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin
text: lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the
text: space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The
text: walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting
text: him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight.
text: Loki sits at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks
text: softly to him.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: I asked him to be honest with you
dialog: from the beginning. There should
dialog: be no secrets in a family.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: So why did he lie?
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: He kept the truth from you so that
dialog: you would never feel different.
dialog: You are in every way our son, Loki,
dialog: and we your family. You must know
dialog: that.
text: Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (RE: ODIN)
dialog: You can speak to him. He can see

speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: How long will it last?

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: I don't know. This time is
dialog: different. We were unprepared.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I never get used to seeing him like
dialog: this. The most powerful being in
dialog: the Nine Realms lying helpless
text: until his body is restored.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: But he's put it off for so long
dialog: now, I fear...
text: Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a good son.
text: Loki sits there, uncertain how to react, uncertain how he
dialog: really feels.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA (CONT'D)
dialog: We mustn't lose hope that your
dialog: father will return to us. And your
dialog: brother.
text: Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What hope is there for Thor?
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: There's always a purpose to
dialog: everything your father does. Thor
text: may yet find a way home.
text: Loki looks troubled by the revelation. He rises, heads for
text: the exit, when they hear the clatter of ARMORED FOOTSTEPS
text: hurriedly approaching.
scene_heading: THE EINHERJAR GUARD
text: Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for
text: the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is
text: baffled.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA (CONT'D)
text: Thor is banished. The line of
dialog: succession falls to you. Until he
dialog: awakens, Asgard is yours.

text: pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before him.
text: Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Now tell us exactly what happened
dialog: to you last night.
text: Thor looks her in the eyes, staring, intrigued. Jane gets
text: flustered, looks away.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe start with how you got inside
dialog: that cloud.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: And how you could eat an entire box
dialog: of Pop-Tarts and still be this
dialog: hungry.
text: Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of
dialog: coffee.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: (re: coffee mug)
dialog: This drink. I like it.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: (to Thor, re: coffee)
dialog: Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

dialog: a lunatic!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (to Thor, re: mug)
dialog: What was that?
text: He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: It was delicious. I want another.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Then you should just say so!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I just did.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I mean ask for it. Nicely.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I meant no disrespect.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: All right, then no more smashing,

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You have my word.
speaker_heading: JANE

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55.
text: A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at

speaker_heading: ISABELA
dialog: Morning, Pete. Jake.
speaker_heading: TOWNIE PETE
dialog: The usual, please, Izzy.
text: Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee.
scene_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
dialog: You missed all the excitement out

speaker_heading: ISABELA
dialog: What crater?
text: Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the
text: Townies with interest.
speaker_heading: TOWNIE PETE
dialog: They're saying some kind of
text: satellite crashed in the desert.
scene_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
dialog: We were having a good time with it
dialog: till the Feds showed up, chased us
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: (to the Townies)
dialog: Excuse me, did you say there was a
dialog: satellite crash?
scene_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
dialog: Yep. They said it was radioactive.
dialog: And I had my hands all over it.
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: I'm probably sterile now.
text: Thor, unconcerned, prepares to dig into the giant pile of

speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: (to the Townies)
dialog: What did the satellite look like?
scene_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
dialog: I don't know nothing about

text: This gets Thor's attention.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 56.

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Where?!
scene_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE
dialog: About twelve miles east of here.
text: Thor grins, his spirits soaring, as he quickly strides out of

speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I wouldn't bother! Looked like the

dialog: left!
scene_heading: 63 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63
text: Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings.
text: Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Twelve miles east of here.
text: He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks
dialog: with him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: To get what belongs to me.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: So now you own a satellite?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: It's not what they say it is.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Whatever it is, the government
dialog: seems to think it's theirs. You
dialog: intend to just walk in there and
dialog: take it?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Yes.
text: He stops walking.

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Everything?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: All the answers you seek will be
dialog: yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir.
text: Darcy looks to the others.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: "Myeu-muh?" What's "Myeu-muh?"
text: Jane studies Thor. He looks sincere. She's nearly swayed,
speaker_heading: WHEN:
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Jane.
text: He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much
dialog: care for him.
speaker_heading: SELVIG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO JANE)
dialog: Please don't do this.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: You know what we saw last night.
dialog: This can't be a coincidence. I
dialog: want to know what's in that crater.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: I'm not talking about the crater.
dialog: I'm talking about him.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: He's promised us answers.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: He's delusional! Listen to what
text: he's saying! "Thor." "Bifrost."
dialog: "Mjolnir." These are the stories I
dialog: grew up with as a child!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'd just be driving him out there,

speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58.
text: After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I'm sorry. I can't take you.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I understand. Then this is where
dialog: we say goodbye.
text: He takes her hand and kisses it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: That's... thank you.
text: Thor bows slightly to each of them.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Jane Foster... Erik Selvig...

speaker_heading: SELVIG

speaker_heading: SIF

speaker_heading: LOKI

speaker_heading: JANE

scene_heading: 66A EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A

speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Jane. This is more serious than

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Let it go?! This is my life!
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: We're here investigating a security

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: By "appropriate" you mean "steal?"
text: Instead of answering, Coulson gives her a check.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: This should more than compensate
dialog: you for your trouble.
text: She throws the check to the ground without looking at it.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I can't just pick up replacements
dialog: from RadioShack! I made most of
dialog: that equipment myself!
speaker_heading: COULSON

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: AGENT DELANCEY

text: As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
text: rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
dialog: ground.
text: Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the

text: Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main

text: A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to

text: Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
text: raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
text: He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
text: catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
text: hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
text: the ATV's spotlight.
text: Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off

speaker_heading: JANE

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Hey! Myeu-muh!

text: knowingly.
speaker_heading: JANE
speaker_heading: (RE: BOOK)
dialog: Where did you find this?
text: Selvig grabs the book from them, quickly closes it.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: In the children's section. I
dialog: wanted to show you how ridiculous
dialog: his story was.
text: Jane is unconvinced by this. She knows he wants to believe.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Aren't you the one who's always
dialog: told me to chase down all leads,
dialog: all possibilities?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: I was talking about science, not
dialog: magic!
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Magic's just science we don't
dialog: understand yet. Arthur C. Clarke.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Who wrote science fiction.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: The precursor of science fact.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: In some cases.
speaker_heading: JANE

dialog: Jane...
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: A primitive culture like the

dialog: as deities.
text: They give her a look, surprised by her unexpectedly

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Yes! Exactly! Thank you!
text: Darcy beams.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 71.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Jane, if you do this, you'll find

speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: I'll help you.

scene_heading: 89 INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 89
text: Thor sits in a chair, staring forward blankly, hands cuffed
text: behind him. Coulson stands across from him.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: It's not easy to do what you did.
dialog: You made us all look like a bunch
dialog: of mall cops. That's hurtful.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: The men you so easily subdued are
dialog: highly-trained professionals, and
dialog: in my experience, it takes someone
dialog: who's received similar training to
dialog: do what you did to them. Would you
dialog: like to tell me where you received
dialog: your training?
text: Thor sits silently.
speaker_heading: COULSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
dialog: Then again, you strike me more as
dialog: the soldier of fortune type. What
dialog: was it, South Africa?
text: Still no answer. Coulson leans in close to him.
speaker_heading: COULSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Certain groups pay well for a good

speaker_heading: COULSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 72.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Just a man.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: One way or another, we find out
dialog: what we want to know. We're good
dialog: at that.
text: Coulson leaves the room. Thor lowers his head.
speaker_heading: LOKI (O.S.)
dialog: I thought he'd never leave.
text: Thor looks up, shocked to find Loki standing there, dressed
text: in 21st century attire.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Loki? What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I had to see you.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What's happened? Tell me! Is it
dialog: Jotunheim? Let me explain to
speaker_heading: FATHER--
speaker_heading: LOKI
text: Father is dead.
text: Thor stares at him, stunned.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Your banishment, the threat of a
dialog: new war, it was too much for him to
dialog: bear.
text: The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's
text: responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him,
text: looks in his eyes, consolingly.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: You mustn't blame yourself. I know
dialog: that you loved him. I tried to
dialog: tell him so, but he wouldn't
dialog: listen.

dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 73.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: It was cruel to put the hammer
dialog: within your reach, knowing you
dialog: could never lift it.
text: Thor stares ahead, falling deeper into the abyss.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
text: The burden of the throne has fallen
dialog: to me now.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Can I come home?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: The truce with Jotunheim is
dialog: conditional upon your exile.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: But couldn't we find a way to--
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Mother has forbidden your return.
text: Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: This is goodbye, brother. I'm so
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you

speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Nothing could have stopped me.
text: Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Fare well, brother.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Good-bye.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: Good-bye? I just got back.

scene_heading: 90 EXT. CRATER - NIGHT 90
text: Agents and Scientists work to repair the damaged area around
text: Mjolnir. They take no notice of Loki as he steps up beside
text: the hammer. He stares at it -- intrigued, wondering. Can he
dialog: do it?
text: He reaches down, tries to lift it -- but can't. He lets it
text: go, eyes it with contempt, then steps away.
text: He gestures with his arms. An odd GREEN AND GOLD LIGHT rises
text: from the ground, enveloping him, then he disappears.
scene_heading: 91 INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 91

speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: "Donald Blake?"
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Doctor Donald Blake. He's part of
dialog: our team.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: You have dangerous coworkers, Dr.
dialog: Selvig.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Troubled, not dangerous. He was
text: distraught when he found out that
dialog: you'd taken all of our research.
dialog: It was years of his life, gone! He
dialog: got depressed, started drinking,
dialog: and... well, you know the rest.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: Uh-huh. You mind if we take a
dialog: moment to verify his identity?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Certainly.
text: The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.
speaker_heading: SELVIG (CONT'D)
dialog: You can understand how a man could
dialog: go off like that. I mean, a big,
dialog: faceless organization like yours,
text: coming in with their jack-booted
dialog: thugs and stealing private
dialog: property...
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: ...is how he described it.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: That doesn't explain how he managed
dialog: to tear through our security.
text: Selvig shrugs.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness
dialog: nut.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A.
text: On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New
text: York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE". The license photo
text: is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her
dialog: cellphone.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75.
text: The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD
text: SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS." Coulson eyes the screen.
text: After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: It says here he's an M.D.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: He is. That is, he was. He
dialog: switched careers and became a
dialog: physicist. He's quite brilliant,
dialog: really.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: If you would just release him to
dialog: me, I promise to keep an eye on
dialog: him.
text: Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to
text: an AGENT nearby.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig
dialog: here.
text: The Techie looks to him, surprised.
speaker_heading: COULSON (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO SELVIG)
dialog: Make sure he stays in town for the
dialog: next few days in case we need to
text: talk to him again.
text: Selvig shakes his hand.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: 92A INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A
text: Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a
text: seated Thor.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Donny, Donny, Donny! There you
dialog: are!
text: Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig
text: pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.
speaker_heading: SELVIG (CONT'D)
dialog: It's going to be all right, my
dialog: friend. Come on, I'm taking you
dialog: home.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 75A.
text: He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.
scene_heading: 92B EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B
text: As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security
text: Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the
text: Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand-
text: written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes
text: it from the pile and pockets it.
scene_heading: 92C INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C
text: Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV
text: record. A security warning over the image clearly reads
text: "SECURITY ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA." He knows it's been a ruse
dialog: all along.
text: He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the Security
text: Room, then follows them outside.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93
text: Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with Thor
text: away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: Just keep him away from the bars.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: I will!
speaker_heading: THOR
speaker_heading: (TO SELVIG)
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Selvig drops his cool demeanor.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: To get a drink.
text: Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV.
text: As they drive off, Coulson turns to the other two agents --
scene_heading: GARRETT and CALE.
speaker_heading: COULSON
dialog: Follow them.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76.
scene_heading: 94 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94
text: Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy
dialog: surface of the planet.
scene_heading: 95 INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95
text: Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of
text: light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling.
text: Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides.
text: Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I've come alone and unarmed.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: To what end?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: To make you another proposition.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: So you're the one who let us into
dialog: Asgard.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You're welcome.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: My men are dead, and I have no
dialog: Casket. You are a deceiver.
text: Laufey lashes out, grabs Loki around the throat, but Loki
text: calmly stands his ground.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You have no idea what I am.
text: The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the
text: guards stare in shock. Loki grins.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, Father.
text: Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal.
text: Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76A.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: Ah, the bastard son. I thought
dialog: Odin had killed you. That's what I
dialog: would have done. He's as weak as
dialog: you are.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: No longer weak. I now rule Asgard,
dialog: until Odin awakens. Perhaps you
dialog: should not have so carelessly
dialog: abandoned me.
text: This gives Laufey pause.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: Or perhaps it was the wisest choice
dialog: I've ever made. I will hear you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I will conceal you and a handful of
dialog: your soldiers, lead you into his
dialog: chambers, and let you slay him
dialog: where he lies. I'll keep the
dialog: throne, and you will have the
dialog: Casket.
text: Laufey studies Loki's face.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: Why would you do this?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: When all is done, we will have a
dialog: permanent peace between our two
dialog: worlds. Then I, the bastard son,
dialog: will have accomplished what Odin
dialog: and Thor never could.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: This is a great day for Jotunheim.
dialog: Asgard is finally ours.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: No. Asgard is mine. The rest of
dialog: the Nine Realms will be yours, if
dialog: you do as you're told.
text: Laufey considers the proposition.
speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: I accept.
text: Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a
text: smile crosses his face.
scene_heading: 96 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96
text: Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from
text: his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What troubles you, Gatekeeper?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: I turned my gaze upon you in
dialog: Jotunheim, but could neither see
dialog: nor hear you. You were shrouded
dialog: from me, like the Frost Giants who
dialog: entered this Realm.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Perhaps your senses have weakened
dialog: after your many years of service.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: Or perhaps someone has found a way
dialog: to hide that which he does not wish
dialog: me to see.
text: Loki sizes him up, smiles.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You have great power, Heimdall.
dialog: Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: And why is that?
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: Because he is my King, and I am
text: sworn to obey him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Exactly. Just as you're sworn to
dialog: obey me now. Yes?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Good. Then you will open the
dialog: Bifrost to no one until I have
dialog: undone what my brother has started.

dialog: him.

scene_heading: 97 INT. BAR - NIGHT 97
text: Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive.
text: The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots

text: Thor follows his example.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 79.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Seems Darcy's a terrible intern,
dialog: but a talented hacker.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Thank you for what you've done.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Don't thank me. I only did it for
dialog: Jane.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Are you in love with her?
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Of course not! Jane's like a
dialog: daughter to me. Her father and I
dialog: taught at University together. A
dialog: good man, but he never listened.
text: This registers with Thor.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Neither did I.
text: Selvig eyes him with interest.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: I don't know if you're really
dialog: delusional, and I really don't care
dialog: at this point. I just care about
dialog: her. I've seen the way she looks
dialog: at you.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I swear to you, I mean her no harm.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Good. If that's the case, then
dialog: I'll buy you one more drink, and
dialog: you'll leave town tonight.
text: A long pause, then Thor nods. He takes a drink.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I had it all backwards. I had it
dialog: all wrong.
text: Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than
dialog: he's seen before.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: It's not a bad thing, finding out
dialog: that you don't have all the
dialog: answers. That's when you start
dialog: asking the right questions.
text: Thor takes this in.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: For the first time in my life, I
dialog: have no idea what I'm supposed to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Anyone who's ever going to find
dialog: their way in this world has to
dialog: start by admitting they don't know
dialog: where the hell they are.
text: Thor nods.
speaker_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, I know you, man...
text: An intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby sizes up Thor. He is one
text: of the Townies from Isabela's Diner who saw Thor earlier. He
text: approaches, belligerent and looking for a fight.
speaker_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You were in the diner with that hot
dialog: girl.
text: Thor doesn't like where this is going.
speaker_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I wouldn't mind her doing a little
dialog: research on me.
text: He laughs. Thor is annoyed.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I have no quarrel with you. But
dialog: she's a lady. You should be more
text: respectful.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A.
speaker_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE
dialog: And you should shut the hell up,
dialog: princess.
text: Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it.
text: But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's
text: baiting.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I will not fight him.
speaker_heading: DRUNK TOWNIE
dialog: Then it'll be easy to kick your
dialog: ass.
text: Selvig stands, steps between the two men.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our
dialog: heads.
text: Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out.
text: Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his
text: glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81.
speaker_heading: SELVIG (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO THOR)
dialog: Another drink?
scene_heading: 98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98
text: Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN
text: FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance
text: routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically
text: in time with the song.
speaker_heading: THOR/SELVIG
speaker_heading: (SINGING)
dialog: "The mood is good, our hearts are
dialog: full, there's magic in the air. /
dialog: It's all because we're here

dialog: life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la-
dialog: la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine
dialog: indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a
dialog: friend is fine indeed!"
text: Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap.
text: Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a
text: straight dead weight with a CLUNK.
text: WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell,
text: Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to
text: walk up the street towards Jane's trailer.
scene_heading: 99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99
text: The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn
text: with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane
text: lies on her bed, trying to read.
text: She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to

speaker_heading: THOR
text: Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Erik!
speaker_heading: (TO THOR)
dialog: Is he all right?
speaker_heading: THOR
text: He's fine. Not injured at all.

speaker_heading: Selvig GROANS.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, my friend.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: We drank. We fought. He made his

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: Put him on the bed.
text: Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a
text: bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the
text: way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig
text: awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: I still don't believe you're the
dialog: God of Thunder.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: But you ought to be.
text: Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to
text: sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him.
text: Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by
text: Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: These are your chambers?
text: Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up
text: the mess around her.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Well, it's more of a temporary
dialog: living space, really. I don't
dialog: usually have visitors in here.
dialog: Actually, never...
text: Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from
text: him, puts it away.
speaker_heading: JANE (CONT'D)
dialog: Can we go outside?
scene_heading: 100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100
text: Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He
text: offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set
text: up, a couple chairs, some blankets.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I come up here sometimes when I
dialog: can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to
dialog: reconcile particle data. Or when
dialog: Darcy's driving me crazy.
speaker_heading: (THEN)

speaker_heading: THOR

speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: THOR

speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Good Heimdall, less us explain--
speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: You would defy the commands of Loki

text: From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of
text: the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but
text: SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight
text: towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but
text: still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.
text: Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his

text: But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once
text: again. Sif looks on with growing trepidation.
text: Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
text: degrees to face its attackers.
text: The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
text: of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
text: rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
text: staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
text: Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer
text: unleashes another blast, sending Sif and her comrades flying
text: in all directions. Hogun's POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks
text: free, landing in the middle of the street.
scene_heading: 131 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131
text: Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has no
text: time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction.
text: A storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane,
text: and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when
text: they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris,
text: impaled by a twisted piece of iron.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Erik!

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98.
text: Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing
text: stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break
text: for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the
text: pouch and races back.
text: He opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and
text: useless. He pours the contents out in his hand.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Come on... give me one!
text: Amidst the useless powder, he finally finds one stone still
text: intact. Thor tosses the pouch aside, holds the stone over
text: the end of the iron rod.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: What are you doing? What is that?
text: As the stone begins to glow, Thor crushes it.
text: Jane looks on, amazed, as the glowing powder falls upon the
text: piece of iron, dissolving it, heading downwards, until it
text: reaches Selvig's wound. The powder heals his wound
dialog: completely.
text: Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still
text: lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He
text: reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed
dialog: flesh.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: (to Jane, re: Thor)
dialog: I'm really starting to like him.
text: Jane turns to Thor to find he's gone.
scene_heading: 132 EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132
text: Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on
text: the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Go, while you can!
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: But the others...
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: You can't help them now. Your job
dialog: is to survive.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: No! I will die a warrior's death.
dialog: Stories will be told of this day--
text: He gently takes her shield from her.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Live and tell those stories
dialog: yourself.
text: At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious,
text: with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way
text: towards them.
text: Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to pull him to
text: safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He rouses Hogun
dialog: and Fandral.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (RE: VOLSTAGG)
dialog: Get him out of here!
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: No. We can still fight!
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: But not win. Move Volstagg, or
dialog: he'll die!
text: Thor looks at them, grins.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry, my friends. I have a
dialog: plan.
text: The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and
text: drag him away from the battlefield.
text: After they go, Thor turns to back to the Destroyer, then
text: tosses Sif's shield aside.
text: He strides down the street towards the behemoth, completely
text: defenseless.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Brother... for whatever I have done
dialog: to wrong you, whatever I have done
dialog: to lead you to do this, I am sorry.
dialog: But these people have done nothing

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 99.
text: Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms.
text: The Destroyer hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then
text: swats him with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK
text: of breaking bones as Thor goes flying.
text: Thor lands in a crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith
text: Motors, before Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.
text: The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly from down the street,
text: a look of horror on their faces. Jane tries to rush out to
text: Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.
speaker_heading: SELVIG
dialog: Jane, no!
text: He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead,
dialog: watching the scene --

scene_heading: 134 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 134
text: Thor's eyes close, his last breath leaving his lips. The
text: Destroyer stands over Thor's body, lowers its head towards
text: him. It opens its faceplate, locks it in place, readying to
text: unleash its fiery blast.
scene_heading: 135 EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE 135
text: Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir reappear,
text: burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on the
text: hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it
text: vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up.
text: Clouds form in the sky above.
text: Just then, with a CRACK and flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies
text: straight up into the air like a rocket.
scene_heading: 136 EXT. MAIN STREET 136
text: The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --
dialog: KRAKAKABOOM!
text: A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above,
text: colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is
text: massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust
text: enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Oh. My. God.
scene_heading: THE MIGHTY THOR
text: Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand --
text: the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir
text: down onto the ground.
speaker_heading: KRAKABOOM!
text: Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings
text: Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the
text: Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder
text: God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale
dialog: force winds.
text: Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The
text: Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.
text: It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,
text: locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards
text: straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.
text: Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,
text: overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the
dialog: Destroyer.
text: Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.
text: The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES
text: within him, firing out of all his openings.
text: Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
text: heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
text: Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its
text: lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris
text: pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the
text: skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.
text: Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.
text: A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG

speaker_heading: FANDRAL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DARCY

speaker_heading: THOR

scene_heading: 140 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 140
text: From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him.
text: Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters

text: a tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice.
text: Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the
dialog: Observatory.
scene_heading: 141 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 141
text: The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD

speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: Primitive. Good enough for hunting
dialog: small game, I suppose.
text: Suddenly, the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the sky. Thor

speaker_heading: (THEN)

speaker_heading: COULSON (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll get your equipment back.
dialog: You're going to need it to continue

dialog: right with you.
text: Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at

dialog: again.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Whatever fate lies before me, you
dialog: are part of it.

scene_heading: 143 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 143
text: Odin lies in the Odinsleep, Frigga at his bedside. She hears

speaker_heading: LAUFEY
dialog: It's said you can still see and

dialog: even in this state. I hope it's
dialog: true, so that you may know your
text: death came by the hand of Laufey.
text: He raises his blade above Odin's body, when --
text: A BLAST OF ENERGY
text: Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground,
text: we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding
dialog: Gungnir.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: And your death came by the son of
dialog: Odin.

scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105.

scene_heading: REVEALING --
speaker_heading: FRIGGA

speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: I swear to you, mother, they will

dialog: will end the Jotun threat, now and
dialog: forever!
text: He looks to Odin.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: And I will make you proud.
text: Loki savors the moment, but it's short-lived, as Thor bursts
text: in. He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey
text: and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and
text: respect. Stunned and delighted to see Thor, Frigga beams.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: Thor!
text: She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed
text: on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Found its way back to you, did it?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: No thanks to you.
text: Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Why don't you tell her? How you
dialog: sent the Destroyer to kill our
dialog: friends? To kill me?
text: Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It must have been enforcing

scene_heading: 148 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - CORRIDOR 148
text: Thor flies from the blast through ANOTHER wall on the

scene_heading: 152 EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - DAY 152

scene_heading: 153 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 153

speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: All these years, and no one's ever
dialog: dared to use it as a weapon.
text: Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through
text: it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki
text: fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Why have you done this?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: To do what Father never could. To

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: He won't! You can't kill an entire

speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What is this newfound love for the

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: I've changed.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: So have I.
text: Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Fight me.
text: He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his

text: but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back
text: towards the frozen controls.
text: Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which

speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Is the throne really worth what

speaker_heading: LOKI

speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to you on earth that
dialog: turned you so soft? Don't tell me
dialog: it was a woman.
text: Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: It was. Perhaps when we're
dialog: finished here I'll pay her a little
dialog: visit myself.
text: That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and

scene_heading: 155 EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 155

text: Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending

dialog: hand.
text: The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
text: Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
dialog: back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
dialog: powerful.
text: Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
text: towards the Bifrost.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: If you care so much for the Jotuns,
dialog: then die with them.
text: The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
text: drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
text: concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
text: towards the Bifrost.
text: MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
text: The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another

dialog: brother.
scene_heading: 158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158
text: Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and

speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Thor! Help me!
text: Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
text: up at him desperately.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Please...
text: Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
text: brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
text: then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
text: around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
text: Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls

text: It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
text: to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
text: Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
text: never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
text: Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.
speaker_heading: LOKIS
dialog: I was always more clever than you.
speaker_heading: THOR
text: Yet still not clever enough.
text: With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
text: summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
text: channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
dialog: Lokis.
text: All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
text: Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
text: knocked from his grasp.
text: Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
text: back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
dialog: away.
text: Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
text: confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
text: his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
text: pinned to the ground.
text: Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
text: towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
text: energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
dialog: do.
text: Loki watches him smugly.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
dialog: With all your strength, what good
dialog: does it do you now?
text: Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
text: happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
text: VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
text: feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
text: He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
text: Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The

text: thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
dialog: channels the power of the storm into it, then --
text: He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
text: massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
text: the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
text: where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop! What are you doing?!
text: Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
text: The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
text: out from it. Loki thinks fast.
speaker_heading: LOKI (CONT'D)
dialog: If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
dialog: never see her again!
text: Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
text: through the back.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: Forgive me.
text: Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
text: Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
text: sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
text: KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
text: out of it.
text: Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
text: the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
text: Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
text: The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
text: As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
text: Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
text: towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
text: from the broken Bridge.
text: They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
text: force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
dialog: by the debris, when --
scene_heading: A POWERFUL HAND
text: Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
text: as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

speaker_heading: ODIN ALLFATHER
text: Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
text: Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
text: Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
text: approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
text: disappointment and regret.
text: Loki lets go.
speaker_heading: THOR (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
text: falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
text: him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
text: Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
text: Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
text: into his father's arms.
speaker_heading: ODIN
text: It is over.
scene_heading: 159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
text: The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
dialog: in all directions.
text: Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
text: Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
dialog: significance of what's just happened.
speaker_heading: JANE
text: It's gone.
scene_heading: 160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160
text: A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
text: sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
text: Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
text: their battle with the Destroyer.
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
text: ...and then, with a mighty bellow,
dialog: I flew at the great metal beast and
dialog: laid it low...

dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Is that another way of saying you
dialog: fell on your huge a--
speaker_heading: VOLSTAGG
dialog: As a matter of fact, falling down
dialog: was a tactic. Lulling the
dialog: Destroyer into a false sense of
dialog: security!
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Well, I was the one who had to drag
dialog: your enormous carcass off the
dialog: battlefield. That makes me the
dialog: real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
text: Hogun points to Volstagg.
speaker_heading: HOGUN
dialog: Big stomach.
dialog: (points to Fandral)
dialog: Big mouth.
text: The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
text: look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
dialog: smile.
speaker_heading: FANDRAL
dialog: Well, how about that? A smile!
dialog: I'd say that calls for another
dialog: drink!
text: They laugh and raise another round.
text: Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
text: sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
text: Frigga, bows her head.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: My Queen. I am so sorry for your
dialog: loss.
text: Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: Thank you, Sif.
text: She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA (CONT'D)
dialog: How is he?

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.
speaker_heading: SIF
text: He mourns for his brother. And he
text: misses her. The mortal.
text: Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
text: Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.
speaker_heading: FRIGGA
dialog: He will need his friends now more
dialog: than ever.
speaker_heading: SIF
dialog: I will always be at his side.
text: Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.
scene_heading: 161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161
text: Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
text: walks up behind him.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: You'll be a wise King.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: There will never be a wiser king
dialog: than you. Or a better father.
speaker_heading: (THEN)
dialog: I have much to learn. I know that
dialog: now. But some day, perhaps, I will
dialog: make you proud.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: You've already made me proud.
text: Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.
scene_heading: 162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162
text: Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
text: energy, drifting off into space.
text: Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.

speaker_heading: HEIMDALL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: THOR
dialog: How is she?
scene_heading: 163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163
text: Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
text: ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
text: away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
text: inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
text: that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
text: facility, abuzz with activity.
text: SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
dialog: the-art equipment.
text: Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
text: SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
text: windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
text: roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
text: hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
text: before her, which bears the "STARK INDUSTRIES" logo.
text: From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: Here you go.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: Thanks.
text: Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.
speaker_heading: DARCY
dialog: He would have come back if he
dialog: could.
speaker_heading: JANE
dialog: I know. But if he can't get here
dialog: on his own...
text: Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D
text: HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,
text: bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --
text: YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.
