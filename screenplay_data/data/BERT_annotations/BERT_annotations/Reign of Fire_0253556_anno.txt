scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL LONDON - LATE AFTERNOON
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE: WESTMINSTER, LONDON. THE PRESENT.
dialog: A city caught between the 12th century and the 20th; where
text: the medietal spires of the Tower of London compete for space
text: with office buildings of glass and steel.
text: THE BULLDOZER rumbles through the city's afternoon traffic toward a
text: nearby COKSTRUCTION SITE. A high barrier surrounds the site, from
scene_heading: which hangs A BANNER: JUBILEE LINE EXTENSION PROJECT: TAKING LONDON
text: INTO A NEW MILLENNIUM.

text: Quinn entess a door in the barrier marked SITE ENTRANCE.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTSUCTION SITE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Quinn walksthrough the site. Around him, WORKERS labor over
text: a lattice d girders. Huge CRANES lift material down a FIFTY
text: FOOT WIDE WLE which leads to subway construction below.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SITE - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Site forewoman KAREN ABERCROMBY stands by a table, going over
text: a schematic. She's a working class matron in her 40s, full
text: of life, sturdy as the buildings she's helped construct. Her
text: assistant, STUART, nudges her.
speaker_heading: STUART

dialog: ‘Nother time.
text: Karen and Stuart head to the construction hole and enter a
text: cage-like ELEVATOR. With a metallic THUNK, the cage descends.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION
text: Dark, recently dug walls of soft earth and clotted clay. The
text: entire tunnel resonates with GRINDING SOUNDS coming from
text: A TUNNEL BORING MACHINE ("TBM"): a steel cylinder the size of
text: several pick-up trucks. Its cutting edge is a series of
text: hydraulic rams that dig into the earth before it.
text: At the moment, the TBM is stuck into the earth at the
text: tunnel’s end. It bucks and grinds, like an animal trying to
text: free itself from a trap.
text: Karen and Stuart approach the TBM's operator cab. Inside,
text: JESS, a portly, choleric Irishmen, fiddles with the controls.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: All right, Jess?
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Damn stuck is what I am.
dialog: (Jimmies controls)
dialog: You geniuses tol' me it was clay down

speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Bollocks.
dialog: (Climbs into the cab.)
dialog: There's no bedrock for miles.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Well, maybe if Your Ladyship'd learn to
dialog: read the charts.
text: Karen disregards him; she works the hydraulic controls. The
text: TBM WHIRRS, begins to unjam itself from the wall.
text: Stuart inspects the debris nearby. It's then he notices
text: A TRICKLE OF WATER running from the cut the TBM has made into
text: the wall. It's as if the machine has hit a water main.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Oy, Karen! Hold...
text: CRASH! A GUSH OF WATER BLASTS FROM THE CUT IN THE WALL! It
text: SLAMS into Stuart, knocking him backward. ,
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Stuart!
text: Karen grabs his arm, pulls him up to the cab just as
text: THE GUSH BECOMES A TORRENT, PUSHING THE TBM BACKWARD, like a
text: cork forced from a bottle.
text: KAREN, STUART AND JESS cling to the TBM cab for dear life.
text: Then, as quick as it came, the flood subsides. Soon, the
text: only sound is the HISS of water STEAMING in the tunnel.
text: aren rises unsteadily. She stares at what lies before them.
text: # LARGE HOLE, punctured in the wall by the TBM.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF CONSTRUCTION SITE - DUSK
text: Unaware of the events below, Quinn sits reading a schoolbook.
text: A distant CLANG splits the air. He looks up.
text: The sound resonates from the spire of BIG BEN. It's 6:00 PM.
text: The famed clocktower is tolling in the coming night.
scene_heading: INT. HOLE IN THE TUNNEL
text: Holding her flashlight, Karen steps into the hole, followed
text: by Stuart and Jess. They can see their breath MIST with cold.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Jesus! Water's bloody freezing.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Below freezing, mate. It's salt.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: What the hell's salt water doing...?

speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Good Christ.
dialog: REVEAL they are in
scene_heading: INT. A HUGE DRIPPING WET CAVERN
text: 100 feet high, but the dark makes it seem bigger. SHADOWS of
text: ODDLY SHAPED TRANSLUCENT STALACTITES AND STALAGMITES haunt
text: the space. Eeriest of all, however, are the PINPRICKS OF
text: PHOSPHORESCENT LIGHT that dot the ceiling and walls. Their
text: dim, green glow make them look like subterranean stars.
text: The three glance around nervously, their breath misting
text: eerily before them.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.
text: Stuart touches the glowing stuff on the wall.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Phosphorescent algae. What do you reckon?
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Undersea cave maybe.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: You daft? Ocean's miles from here.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Yes, your Lordship. And this country was
text: under it.
speaker_heading: JESS
dialog: What, ten thousand years ago?!
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: This must've gotten sealed off somehow.
text: Karen and Stuart walk forward into the cavern.
text: Jess, not so bold, takes a few steps back.
text: SQUISH. His foot falls on something soft and wet. He looks
dialog: down at what he's stepped upon:
text: A MASSIVE CABLE, stretching the length of the floor.
text: Jess touches the thing with his boot. It's then he sees
text: The Cable is covered with what seem to be HAIRS.
scene_heading: KAREN AND STUART
text: head into the cave. Karen trips on something. Stuart catches
text: her. Karen turns her light to see on what she tripped on.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: A BIZARRE FISH, prehistoric, almost alien looking, lies
text: motionless on the ground. Stuart bends down to look at it.
speaker_heading: STUART (cont'd)
dialog: Jesus. Looks bloody primeval...
text: Suddenly the fish THRASHES OUT, its spiny body nearly
text: striking Stuart in the face.
speaker_heading: STUART (cont'd)
dialog: Fuckin' hell! How can it be alive?
text: THUD. A FAINT SOUND like a fist hitting an empty drum echoes
text: through the cavern.
speaker_heading: STUART (CONT'D)
dialog: Jess, what are you on about?
text: No answer. Karen flashes her light around. No sign of him.
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Jess?
text: Nothing. Karen and Stuart rise, calling Jess' name.
text: Karen heads toward one end of the chamber. She comes to
text: A CIRCULAR BOULDER set in the wall. 5-feet, shiny black. It
text: looks like an obsidian marble sunk halfway into the rock.
text: STUART searches his end.
text: ANOTHER THUD echoes through the cave, this one louder.
text: He shines his light ahead...and freezes. For sprawled on the
text: ground before him is
text: JESS. Eyes frozen open, blood trickling from his mouth. The
text: "cable" he stepped on has WRAPPED ITSELF around his chest,
text: CRUSHING it like a tin-can.
speaker_heading: STUART
dialog: Karen!
text: Karen turns. The beam of her flashlight hits the surface of
text: the circular black boulder.
scene_heading: THE COLOR OF THE BOULDER CHANGES: DEEP BLUE appears
text: vertically on either end, widening so that all that's left of
text: the black is m angry SLIT in the middle.
dialog: It's not a barlder at all.

text: She barely has time to react before
text: SNAP! THE "CABLE" FLICKS OUT, SLAMMING Stuart against the
text: wall with a sickening CRACK!
speaker_heading: KAREN
dialog: Stuart!!
text: She runs to him. But by that time, all hell's broken loose.
text: The dull echoing thuds grow louder, quicker...
text: MOVEMENT ail around. The strange translucent stalactites
text: shift one way...parts of the walls shift another...THE ENTIRE
text: CAVERN SEEMS TO BE ALIVE WITH A TRANSLUCENT FLESH.
text: The thuds are now DEAFENING AND RHYTHMICAL. The sound of a
text: massive HEARTBEAT.
speaker_heading: KAREN
text: throws Strart over her back in a fireman's carry
text: SNAP! ! The "Cable" STRIKES the ground nearby. Karen dodges
text: with Stuart, makes for the cavern's exit.
text: The "Cable" does not go after them. Rather, it WRAPS itself
text: around TWO BOULDERS by the wall and drags them into an
text: OPENING ir the cavern wall.
text: Zn opening which we now see is a GIGANTIC MOUTH. And the
text: cable is its massive TONGUE.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAZ TUNNEL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

scene_heading: INT. CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR
text: CLANG! Karen SLAMS the elevator door shut. She, Stuart and
text: the other workers are packed in like sardines. She presses
text: the controls. The elevator SLOWLY begins to climb.
text: The tunnel’s SHAKING. In the distance, a terrible RATTLING.
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DUSK
text: Workmen run for cover as girders fall around them. An ear-

speaker_heading: QUINN

scene_heading: THE ELEVATOR CAGE

text: Quinn runs to the collapsing elevator...then stops short.
text: For something else is coming out to greet him.
speaker_heading: A_MAMMOTH WING
text: painfully unfurls from the hole. Its flesh is withered,

speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: can cniy watch, paralyzed, as
speaker_heading: A SECOND WING
text: joins the first, torturously stretching, hoisting its main
text: body from the hole.
text: As light hits the creature's skin, its color CHANGES. Like a

scene_heading: BN ENORMOUS SHADOW
text: takes shape on the ground: a leviathan's silhouette of two
text: batlike wings and a gigantic, serpentine body.
scene_heading: THE CREATCRE'S HUGE EYE
text: stares mezcilessly. For an instant, Quinn's REFLECTED in the
text: thing's cornea. Captured, like an insect in a glass.
speaker_heading: QUINN

text: The Cat MEOWS, trying to get the attention of

text: turned from us, he does not seem about to get up.
text: The Cat jumps up on a knickknack filled SHELF above the man's
text: head. It MEOWS again. The Man groans into his pillow.
speaker_heading: MAN
text: Bugger off, Murphy.
text: Undeterred, the Cat starts tapping a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH with
text: its paw. It pushes the object over the edge of the shelf;
text: the picture falls, landing a half-inch from the Man's head.
text: We see it's a FAMILY PHOTO: Young Quinn standing with Karen.
text: The Man rolls over; we see his face.
text: QUINN ABERCROMBY, now in his late 20s. A gentie, handsome
dialog: face, one that's lived at great cost.

speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: One a these days, you're not gonna miss.
text: Quinn puts the photo on the shelf, then gently grabs the cat.
speaker_heading: QUINN (CONT'D)
dialog: Then where you gonna be, eh?
text: He carries the cat through the room. PLANTS hang from the
text: wall; A GOLDFISH TANK in one corner; a CAGE with MICE in
text: another. An old SHEEP DOG huddles by the door.
text: Quinn walks to what passes for a "pantry": a small sterno
text: burner with an assortment of ancient food tins.
speaker_heading: QUINN (CONT'D)
dialog: They'll try you. Convict you. Hang you.

speaker_heading: JARED
dialog: Sorry, Chief.

speaker_heading: A SMALL CHAPEL
text: CHOIR MUSIC within, intoning a Catholic "Kyrie". We see the

scene_heading: VOICE OVER SHORTWAVE

text: DAVE CREEDY -- 30s, red-haired, the runt of a short litter.

speaker_heading: CREEDY
dialog: Give us a kiss.

scene_heading: EXT. OVER FOGBANK - DAY
text: And sees...nothing. The plane's DISAPPEARED.
text: But the buzzing is now getting louder. It's then she-notices
speaker_heading: THE MOSQUITO
text: arcing hundreds of feet above her UPSIDE DOWN. It's at
text: 12:00, EXECUTING a wild LOOP over the dragon.
scene_heading: INT. MOSQUITO
text: In a last desperate move, Quinn, upside down, guides the
text: plane back over the dragon...
scene_heading: EXT. OVER SEA - DAY
text: Too late, Ashley realizes what Quinn is doing.
text: The Mosquito is now diving BEHIND the dragon. Its loop now
text: is accelerated by its descent.
text: At the 7:00 point, it begins to PULL UP with huge speed.
text: What happens next is so quick, it's nearly simultaneous.
speaker_heading: QUINN
text: opens the canopy of his plane.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: tries to dive.
speaker_heading: THE MOSQUITO
text: arcs upward.
speaker_heading: QUINN
text: releases his belt and is sucked from the cockpit.
text: SLAM! He hits the water at an angle at a savage 70 miles an
text: hour. His body SKIPS LIKE A STONE over the ocean just as
speaker_heading: THE MOSQUITO
text: is carried in its course by the force of its acceleration...
text: ..-heading right into Ashley's egg-filled stomach.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: tries to avoid it, but
speaker_heading: THE MOSQUITO
text: strikes home, SLAMMING INTO HER BELLY.
text: Ashley's stomach EXPLODES!
text: AND THE GREAT DRAGON IS LITERALLY RIPPED IN TWO.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA
text: Quinn recovers his sense barely in time to see
speaker_heading: A SHOCK WAVE
text: from the blast, swelling right towards him.
speaker_heading: s QUINN
speaker_heading: HIT !
text: He dives just as the WAVE hits him full on.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER
text: Quinn is jostled to and fro under the wave.
scene_heading: EXT. OVER SEA
text: The fiery remains of the dragon fall from the sky like rain.
scene_heading: EXT. UNDERWATER
text: With his last strength, Quinn kicks with all his might toward
scene_heading: EXT. SEA - SURFACE
text: Quinn breaks the surface, GASPING for air.
text: The water around is filled with burning debris.
text: And there, not ten yards away, floats THE ASHLEY'S SEVERED
text: HEAD. Bobbing lifeless as it sinks.
text: Quinn watches it, sees himself reflected in the cornea of its
text: one eye, just as he had seen himself as a child.
text: Soon, the reflection and eye and the last of the dragon
text: disappear under the water.
text: HOLD ON the burning debris
speaker_heading: CROSSFADE TO:
dialog: 125.
scene_heading: EXT. SEA - A WEEK LATER
text: Burning debris CROSSFADES into BOATS. All shapes and sizes

scene_heading: EXT. HYDE PARK - DAY - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER
text: CLOSE on a pile of dragon eggs arranged in a huge PIT in the
dialog: ground.
speaker_heading: CREEDY (OS)
text: FIRE IN THE HOLE!
text: An explosive charge DETONATES in the middle of the pit,
text: reducing the their embryos to lifeless shreds.
text: PULL BACK TO REVEAL Creedy supervising a CREW OF MEN AND
text: WOMEN in the orderly disposal of remaining dragon eggs.
text: PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the rest of the park. A myriad
text: of TENTS are pitched throughout the park. A CARAVAN full of
text: new arrivals are busy preparing a campsite.
text: TUFTS OF GREEN GRASS speckle the blackened hills. There's
text: even a bit of sunlight peeking through the clouds.
text: PAN OVER to a distant hill where a lone figure stands.
scene_heading: EXT. HYDE PARK - HILL - DAY
text: It's Quinn standing before what looks like a rough military
text: graveyard. British flags fly from some; The American from
text: others. The dead in the war with Ashley.
text: Quinn kneels down by one that flies the DON’T TREAD ON ME
text: early American flag with the snake. It's there he places the
text: flask he took from Van Zan in the boat.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN (0.S.)
dialog: He actually stole that flask from me.
text: Quinn turns to see Colleen behind him. No longer wearing her
text: flight suit, but a dress that covers her arms and legs.
text: Quinn smiles.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: French delegation's here. They want to
dialog: talk about an expedition to retake the
dialog: continent.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: You wanna be in on it?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Do you?
text: Quinn shakes his head, looks down at the grave.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: Guess we owe it to him to keep fightin’.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Just him, huh?
text: She nods at Beth and a group of the castle kids, playing
text: soccer nearby.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: Won't exactly be a cakewalk. They say
dialog: there's at least four of 'em in Paris.
speaker_heading: QUINN
dialog: That's not what bothers me, Col.
dialog: (Looks at her.)
dialog: What if Van Zan was wrong about Ashley?
dialog: What if there still other females? What
dialog: do we do then?
text: Colleen takes his hand.
speaker_heading: COLLEEN
dialog: We live.
text: Hearing his own words thrown back at him, Quinn has to smile.
text: He kisses her gently, puts his arm around her.
text: They walk together from the graveyard.
text: Toward a city being reborn.
