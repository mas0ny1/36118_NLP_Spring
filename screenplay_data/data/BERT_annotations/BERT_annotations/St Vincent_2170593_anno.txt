scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: A bedroom stuck in the 1970's. Felt wallpaper, cigarette
text: smoke stains, thick dust. Pictures everywhere of a MAN
text: (VINCENT) and a WOMAN (SANDY) in love. They couldn’t
text: look happier. Young, full of life.
text: On the bed, a Russian woman with a tortured Brooklyn
text: accent, DAKA, rides on top of someone we’1ll soon meet.
text: Daka is lost in her 30s, rough, tattooed, too much
text: makeup, and somewhere underneath it all...beautiful.
text: Furthermore, she’s pregnant. Who knows how long, she’s
dialog: so damn skinny.
text: Grinding away.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: You eat the breakfast yet?
text: She’s talking to VINCENT (mostly VIN.) Whom she’s
text: riding. He’s the guy from the pictures, although now in
text: his 60s/70s. Beat-to-hell, raw, irreverent. He gave up
dialog: on life years ago.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (puffing a cigarette)
dialog: You didn’t eat?
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: I forget.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: How do you forget to eat?
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: It happens so.
text: Vincent returns his gaze to...the TV on top of his

dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You want go to breakfast?
dialog: Sure.
scene_heading: INT. NAT’S BROOKLYN DINER - LATER

speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: They have pill for this.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Bastards have a pill for

dialog: Killing us all, ten milligrams at a

text: Vincent sifts through his pill pouch. Pulls out a dozen
dialog: or so...the day’s dose.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Where’s the water? Didn’t I ask
dialog: for water?
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: Ask fuck again.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Coming here twenty years, still

speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus. Aqua. Pills.

speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: I never take this pills.
speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: Fuck you, Vin. Stay off me.
text: She reaches across the table for his toast.
speaker_heading: DAKA (CONT'D)
dialog: You want this toast.

speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Here you go, Mr. Vincent.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Can you put more ice in it? I want

text: Jesus is confused.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: He don’t want this ice.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Oh. Si.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah. Oh, si. Just like everyday
dialog: I come in here. Aqua no hielo.
dialog: No one really knows what to say. They've heard it all
dialog: before. Daily.
speaker_heading: JESUS
dialog: Uno momento, Mr. Vincent.
text: Jesus walks off, nonplussed.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Uno momento.
text: Vin takes a pill, swallows.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: What did Jesus say to the Mexicans

speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: This I don’t know.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Don’t do anything till I get back.

scene_heading: EXT. A BANK - DAY - LATER

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (pointing)

text: Terry shuffles.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Uh-huh. Got it. Yes. Let’s
dialog: see...so...with these reverse
dialog: mortgages you can only borrow a
dialog: percentage of the equity you have
dialog: in the house. That’s called the
dialog: loan-to-value.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Don’t need a financial seminar. I
dialog: own the damn thing outright. 40
dialog: years.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: Yes. Yes. Well...you did. But
dialog: now, Since you’ve been getting
dialog: monthly payments from us for the
dialog: last...
dialog: (searches the papers)
dialog: eight years...you’ve reached the
dialog: cash out limit. That’s that loan-
dialog: to-value thing I just mentioned.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: The house is worth-
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: It was worth. Whatever it was
dialog: worth. And I’m sure you know
dialog: housing prices have fallen
dialog: dramatically since the financial
dialog: crisis. Right. Unless you’ve been
text: living under a rock.
dialog: His attempt at humor...not appreciated.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You do stand-up?
text: Vin rises.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my life here, pal. I need
dialog: that money.
speaker_heading: TERRY
dialog: I’m sorry, Mr. Canatella. There’s
dialog: really nothing I can do. It is
dialog: what it is.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Everybody's says that now. You
dialog: know what it means, “You're fucked,

text: He walks off.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: VINCENT

dialog: ask why?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Lady. You're just a spoke on a
dialog: wheel, trying to make a living like
dialog: the rest of us schmucks. I don’t
dialog: want to tell you to go fuck
dialog: yourself. Let’s just leave it at
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: TELLER #23
dialog: Okay.
text: Tap, tap, tap on the keyboard.
speaker_heading: TELLER #23 (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s one hundred twelve dollars
dialog: and fourteen cents.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Small bills.
speaker_heading: TELLER #23
dialog: No, sir...you’re overdrawn that
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What’s that mean?
speaker_heading: TELLER #23
dialog: It means you don’t-
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I know what overdrawn means.
speaker_heading: TELLER #23
dialog: We've sent several notices.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So. I can’t close my account.
speaker_heading: TELLER #23
dialog: You can, when you get it back to
dialog: zero.
dialog: Vin takes his card. What’s to say.
scene_heading: INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Vin labors into the car. Daka is waiting in the
text: passenger seat. He hands her a few crumpled bills.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: What’s this?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What’s what?
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: My shit is not lay-a-way. I am no

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I’m a little tight right now. You
dialog: know I’m good for it.
text: Daka looks him over.
speaker_heading: DAKA

speaker_heading: DAKA (CONT'D)
dialog: Have to save for maternity leave.
dialog: You asshole.
text: She heads off down the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: See you next week.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: Extras when you do.
text: Daka moves on, bag in hand, adjusting her junk. Vin

text: yells back at them.
speaker_heading: DAKA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not dog! Fuck face.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUCK - NIGHT
text: The local dive bar. SMOKERS outside litter the sidewalk.
text: The windows are painted with “Happy New Year” greetings.
scene_heading: INT. THE BUCK - CONTINUOUS
text: Old neon. Older PATRONS. Vin sits at the bar next to
text: LINDA and GUS, a weathered married couple in their late
text: 60s. They’re dressed to the nines. The hanging TV set
text: plays New Year’s Eve coverage from around the country.
text: They're all fairly lit...although Vin’s in a class by
text: himself. Very thick tongued.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: You have a good Christmas, Vin?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (slurring)
dialog: Best Christmas I ever had. No
dialog: people. No presents. No bullshit.
dialog: Just celebrating the birth of the
dialog: baby Jesus.
text: Tips his tumbler to heaven.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Ah, you don’t mean that, Mister.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What do you know what I mean,
dialog: Linda? You a psychic now?
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Ay, ease up there, Vinny. We're
text: just talking.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You should get a talk show. You’re
dialog: so damn good at it. The “Linda and
dialog: Gus Just Fucking Talking Talk
dialog: Show.”
text: Vin flags the bartender, ROGER.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Rog. Another Maker's.
text: Roger steps over.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Vin...we got three hours till the
dialog: ball drops there. Why don’t we
dialog: give it a break for a minute.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Give what a break?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: The liquor.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You're not gonna serve me?
speaker_heading: ROGER
text: For a minute.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You know how much money I’ve spent
dialog: in this dump over the years?
text: Roger tries to keep it smooth.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Don't be like that, Vin. I’m
dialog: watching out for you here.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Watching out for me?
text: Vin stands, wobbles. He’s drunker than even he realized.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: You serve poison to people
dialog: everyday. So they can die while
dialog: they’re alive. Now you’re watching
dialog: out...is that right?
text: Gus stands, tries to help Vin.
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Let me give you a ride home.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Don’t touch me, Gus. Do not touch
dialog: me. I will drive home drunk like
dialog: I’ve done every night Roger here’s
dialog: been watching out for me.
text: Vin pushes free, walks to the door.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy New Year.
dialog: He’s out.
scene_heading: EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER
text: The Spider whips into the driveway. Hits the picket
text: fence on the neighbor's border. Crash. It topples.
text: Hits his own mailbox on the other side. Crash. It flies
text: onto the lawn. He puts the top up.
text: Vin shuts the car off. Sits for a minute. Then steps
text: out and swerves to the toppled mailbox. Gets on all
text: fours, opens the door, gets the mail...pounds of it.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRANCE HALLWAY - LATER
text: Vin stares at a mountain of unopened mail, overflowing a
text: basket. He empties the basket onto the floor, then
text: tosses the new mail into the empty basket. All sorted.
scene_heading: INT. VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Vin puts his feet up on a weathered coffee table,
text: watching TV from his paisley pattered couch. The decor
text: is feminine inspired, twenty years ago. Coverage of the
text: Times Square New Year's Eve Celebration plays.
text: Vin’s cat, FELIX THE CAT, jumps onto his lap. Starts to
dialog: pur.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: There you are. Where’d you go
dialog: tonight, ha? You out catting
dialog: around...
text: He rubs the cat all over. His only love.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I bet you’re hungry, aren’t you?
text: He takes Felix in his arms, shuffles to the kitchen.
scene_heading: THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: The kitchen is trashed: dishes to China, mold, stacks of
text: newspapers a decade old. Vin opens a can of gourmet cat
text: food. Dumps it in a bowl. Felix waits patiently on the
text: counter...the food arrives. He eats like there’s no
dialog: tomorrow.
text: Vin needs another drink. He holds his tumbler to the ice
text: maker in the fridge door. It grinds. No ice. He opens
text: the freezer door and grabs a glob of ice cubes stuck
text: together, puts them on the counter.
text: Grabs a hammer from the junk drawer.
text: BANG. BANG. He smashes the ice into pieces, chips fly.
text: BANG! He hits his finger.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
text: UGHHHH. Shit. AHHHH.
text: Vin stumbles with the pain. His foot gets ever so close
text: to an ice chip on the tile floor...
text: Slip. Flip. Smack.
text: Vin flies up in the air, lands on the floor. Crack! His
text: head hits the tile hard. He’s out. Or dead.
dialog: 10.
text: Felix looks at his owner. Jumps down beside him. Laps
dialog: up some blood.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: TV insert. The ball is dropping in Times Square. 5, 4,
text: 3, 2, 1. Happy New Year. PEOPLE hug, kiss, celebrate.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING
text: MEN screaming in Spanish. We pan away from Vin’s house,
text: over towards the source of the racket.
text: In the neighbor’s driveway, a moving truck is backing
text: into the drive and ripping tree limbs along the way.
text: Vin’s tree limbs. A LATIN MOVER is screaming
text: instructions to the LATIN DRIVER.
speaker_heading: LATIN MOVER
dialog: Alto! Alto! You hit the tree,
dialog: man. Come on!
speaker_heading: LATIN DRIVER
dialog: Meda, I can’t see it!
text: He notices the roof: pealed like a sardine can.
speaker_heading: LATIN MOVER
dialog: You broke the roof! Ay Dios mio!
text: They fight on.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Vin'’s where we left him: face down on the kitchen floor.
text: A small pool of blood sits stagnant under his face.
text: The yelling outside irks him to consciousness.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Shut up out there. People are
dialog: sleeping.
text: He groans. Holds himself up. Felix the Cat stares from
dialog: a safe distance.
text: Vin sees the blood.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, piss.
text: He feels his face, and for the first time we see it: he
text: looks like a prize fighter after the twelfth round.
dialog: 11.
text: A gash above his eye is the origin of the blood. It
dialog: probably needs stitches. He’1ll never get them.
text: Vin sits there for a second, collects himself.
scene_heading: EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Vin walks outside, searching for the commotion. He
text: shields the sun from his eyes. The fighting Movers are
text: still at it.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Hey! Hey! What’s the problem?
dialog: This is a neighborhood. People are
dialog: sleeping.
text: The Movers stop. Stare.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: You comprende?!
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Habla English?
speaker_heading: LATIN MOVER
dialog: We speak English, senor.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What the hell are you doing here?
text: Vin looks up, notices the tree ripped.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: What the?!? That’s my tree you
dialog: assholes hit?!
text: There's a large tree limb sitting on Vin’s car and across
dialog: the fence (which he knocked down last night.)
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: And my fence! My damn car!?!
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you speak English!?!
text: Just then a car pulls up, parks in front of the house. A
text: WOMAN in her late thirties steps out. This is MAGGIE,
text: Vin’s new neighbor. She'd be prettier if she weren’t
dialog: always so worried.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m calling the cops.
text: Vin heads inside.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Excuse me...
text: He turns.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'm Maggie. I guess I’m your new
dialog: neighbor.
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yes. We’re moving in today.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I noticed that. These dipshits
dialog: with you?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: They're with the moving company.
text: Maggie walks to the fence, stands on her side. Looks
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, boy.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Oh, shit...more like it. That
text: fence is twenty years old. The
dialog: car’s forty. And the tree’s older
dialog: than me.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I’m really sorry. I don’t know
dialog: what to...this is not the way to
dialog: meet.
text: She turns to the Movers.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you guys do this?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Of course, they did it. What are
dialog: you stupid? Look at the scene.
dialog: Maggie doesn’t take kindly to being called stupid.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Excuse me. There’s no need to be
dialog: rude. Okay. I’m just moving in
dialog: here. I hired this company. Okay.
text: Accidents happen.
dialog: 13.
text: A LITTLE BOY comes up to Maggie’s side. This is OLIVER.
text: Twelve. Frail. Four eyes. Painfully awkward and very
dialog: sensitive. He’s one of those invisible types.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Accidents happen. What’re you a
dialog: fucking adjuster?
text: Maggie puts her arm around Oliver.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Do you mind, mister?
text: Vin looks at Oliver. Absorbs him.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That car’s an antique, missy.
dialog: Worth a lot of money.
text: She looks at the car. More like a piece of shit.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I'll figure out how to-
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You. You don’t have any money. No
dialog: offense. You don’t look like you
dialog: do. And I'll bet Chico and the Man
dialog: over there are “off the books.”
dialog: No, thank you, blondie, I’1l sue
dialog: the moving company.
text: Vin walks off.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: You can buck up for the tree and
dialog: the fence.
text: He hits the front door. Oliver looks up at his mom.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: That’s our new neighbor.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It’s gonna be a long life.
scene_heading: INT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Oliver's bedroom. The room has a bed in it, little else.
text: The evening ritual is in progress: bedtime book time.
text: Although...Oliver is the one reading: “The Giving Tree.”
text: Maggie’s on a beanbag on the floor, nursing a Chardonnay.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: (reading)
dialog: “I wish that I could give you
dialog: something, but I have nothing
dialog: left.” I am just an old stump. “I
dialog: don't need very much now," said the
dialog: boy. “Just a quiet place to sit and
dialog: rest. I am very tired." "Well,"
dialog: said the tree, straightening
dialog: herself up as much as she could,
dialog: "Well, an old stump is good for
dialog: sitting and resting. Come, Boy, sit
dialog: down. Sit down and rest." And the
dialog: boy did. And the tree was happy.
text: Maggie drinks her wine.
dialog: She gets
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: God, that’s depressing.
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No, it’s not. The old tree was
dialog: made to give. So to be able to
dialog: give everything and have nothing
dialog: left is the best life the tree
dialog: could ever have.
text: She tucks Oliver into bed. Kisses his forehead.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That’s a nice way to look at it.
dialog: Need you to catch the bus tomorrow.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It’s my first day.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Mine too. Can’t be late.
text: Maggie goes to turn off the light.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Where’s the bus line?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Get on the internet in the morning.
dialog: You're good at that. Good night,

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Night.

dialog: darkness.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Bus stop. Maggie’s old Corolla sits in the bus lane.
text: Oliver’s outside the door, leaning in the window. He’s

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: Peanut butter and bananas.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Thanks, mom.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: What time you get out?
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Okay.
text: A bus pulls up behind Maggie.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (re: the bus)
dialog: This is yours. See you tonight.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Wait. Ma...you’re not picking me-
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I’m in the bus lane, Oliver. Be
dialog: good. Okay. I don’t need another
dialog: ticket.
text: Maggie blows him a kiss, pulls off.

dialog: 16.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - LATER

text: Oliver can’t open his locker. He tries the combination
text: again...no dice. He looks around for help. No one makes
text: eye contact.
text: The tardy bell chimes.
text: Oliver gives up, drags all his stuff with him. Rushes
text: down the hallway.
scene_heading: INT. BROTHER CRESPI’S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Religious Studies class. Brother Crespi stands in front
text: of THIRTY CHATTY PRETEENS. Crespi’s in his thirties,

speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: Settle down. I know it’s hard to

speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I think I’m Jewish.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: Okay. That’s good.

dialog: Oliver thinks he’s Jewish.
text: A few KIDS speak out.
speaker_heading: RANDOM KIDS

dialog: Religions of the World, with
dialog: Brother Cary Crespi.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: Bravo. Now, I happen to be
dialog: Catholic, which is the very best
dialog: religion in the world. Because we
dialog: have the most rules. But some of
dialog: us are Buddhist, Agnostic, Baptist,
dialog: Presbyterian, Christian, and “I
dialog: don’t know.” Which seems to be the
dialog: fastest growing religion on the
dialog: planet. And now we have Oliver.
dialog: Who “thinks he’s Jewish.” Which is

scene_heading: THE TRACK BREEZEWAY - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: TRACKSIDE - MOMENTS LATER
text: A TRUMPETER sounds the BUGLE CALL as JOCKEY’S on HORSES

dialog: He’s always drinking.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Come on. Come on. Dig in.

speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Dig. One time. One damn time.
text: And just like that, Vincent’s horse...loses.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Son of a bitch.
text: He crumples up his race form. Throws it on the floor.
text: It lands at a MAN’S FEET.
speaker_heading: MAN (0.S.)
dialog: No need to get pissy, Vincenzo.
dialog: You lose all the time. Should be

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Help yourself.
speaker_heading: ZUCKO
dialog: I'm thirsty, Vin. And you owe me.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I don’t have it right now, kid.
dialog: Got a situation I’m working out.
speaker_heading: ZUCKO
dialog: The thing is, if you’re breathing,
dialog: we all have situation. I’m not a

dialog: know that.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I just need a little time, you

dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: ZUCKO

text: He leaves. Vin pushes his lunch aside. Appetite gone.
scene_heading: INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - GYMNASIUM - DAY
text: Gym class. Oliver’s straining with all his might, trying
text: to do a sit-up. A PARTNER holds his feet.
text: On the mat next to him, ROBERT OZINSKI, the school bully
text: reps through sit-ups like a rabid Marine.
text: COACH MITCHELL blows the whistle, asks the PARTNERS for
text: the count. Oliver’s Partner holds up one finger.
scene_heading: THE TRACK - LATER
text: Relay races. Ozinski sprints past the finish line. He’s
text: a specimen for a twelve-year-old.
text: Oliver is at the farthest end of the track. Running in
text: slow motion. He’s lapped by a SMALL ASIAN GIRL.
scene_heading: CHIN-UP BARS - LATER
text: Ozinski’s ripping off chin-ups like a baboon. As a-
text: matter-of-fact, he looks like one. KIDS count off:
dialog: fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.
text: Oliver’s on the next bar, shaking like a leaf. He may
dialog: die.
dialog: 21.
text: Finally, COACH MITCHELL blows the whistle. Oliver’s
text: Partner holds up a goose egg.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL
dialog: Time. All right. Good job,
dialog: kiddos.
text: Ozinski drops to the floor.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: We're done.
text: Exodus towards the lockers. Coach Mitchell taps Oliver,
text: who’s still hell-bent on getting his chin to that bar.
dialog: It’s not going to happen.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: You can let go now.
text: Oliver looks down at the drop. He’s chicken shit. Coach

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL
dialog: You have PE at your last school?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL
dialog: Did you take it?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL
dialog: Go get changed.
text: Oliver walks away, in the wrong direction.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)
dialog: The other way. Those doors.
text: He stops, looks. Changes direction.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Oliver enters the locker room. Most of the KIDS are
text: fully dressed already, and leaving. Ozinski starts
text: heckling the moment he sees Oliver.
speaker_heading: OZINSKI
dialog: There’s the strong man.
text: Laughs. One of Ozinski’s buddies (BROOKLYN) chimes in.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: BROOKLYN
dialog: “I think I’m Jewish.”
text: More laughs. Oliver takes a seat in front of his locker.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: My name is Oliver.
speaker_heading: OZINSKI
dialog: (like a retard)
dialog: My name is Oliver.
text: Just then Coach walks in.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL

speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL (CONT'D)

dialog: You need a map?
text: Oliver nods.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: COACH MITCHELL
dialog: Double time it or you'll be late.
text: Oliver nods. Coach walks off.
text: He opens his locker. It’s empty. His pants,
dialog: uniform...everything’s gone.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Shit.
scene_heading: EXT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES —- SIDEWALKS - LATER
text: School's out. KIDS everywhere: jumping in cars, riding
text: bikes, walking home.
text: It's easy to spot Oliver in the crowd, he’s the only
text: student wearing short gym shorts, a tank top and
dialog: sneakers.
dialog: 23.
text: As expected, STUDENTS comment, laugh, text, chide. It’s
dialog: not been a good first day for Oliver.
text: He reaches the crosswalk. Looks up at the street sign,
text: it doesn’t look vaguely familiar. He crosses anyway.
scene_heading: MONTAGE OF OLIVER WALKING - LOST
text: -- Oliver crosses a major Boulevard. Cars everywhere.
text: -- He stops in the middle of a block. Looks around.
text: Then turns and goes back in the direction from wince he

text: -- Oliver reads a street sign. Thinks. Walks on.
scene_heading: INT. VIN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Vin’s driving through major traffic. He pulls up next to
text: a bus load of PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS. They stare at him. He

text: Then in tandem, the WHOLE WINDOW ROW OF KIDS flip him
text: off. Damn kids. Vin lights a cigarette.
scene_heading: OLIVER WALKING - CONTINUOUS
text: Finally, Oliver recognizes his block. He runs towards
dialog: what he thinks is his house. Looks...that’s it. He’s
dialog: home.
scene_heading: EXT. MAGGIE & OLIVER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Oliver, at the front door, reaches into his pocket for
text: the key. Damn. He’s not wearing his pants. His key and
text: phone were in the pockets of his stolen uniform.
text: He could cry. But he’s not the type. He slumps down in
text: resignation and sits on the cold concrete steps.
scene_heading: VIN’S DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Vin’s car pulls in haphazardly. He runs over some of the
text: toppled fence. Curses, with the windows up...so it
text: sounds like Charlie Brown’s parents.
text: Vin climbs out of the car. Walks to the fallen mailbox,
text: lowers himself onto the lawn, pulls mail out until...
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Sir?
text: Vin hears something. Stops, looks around. Confused.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Take me, God. Don’t play with me.
text: Oliver steps forward, down the walk.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It’s me, sir.
text: Vin squints. Finally sees the kid.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Yeah. What?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I was wondering if I could use your

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: In my house?
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I don’t need the whole story.

speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: One call.
text: Vin walks away. Oliver walks across the lawn and through
text: the demolished fence into Vin’s yard.
dialog: 25.
scene_heading: INT. VIN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Oliver’s on an old rotary phone in the kitchen. Vin’s
text: fixing a Maker’s Mark in the background.
text: Ring. Ring. Ring. Voicemail.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Hi, Mom. I...ah...lost my key for
dialog: the house. So, I’m at the old

scene_heading: VIN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Vin’s sitting in his La-Z-Boy, facing Oliver on the

text: A little longer.
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What’s your name?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oliver.
dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Don’t you think it’s a little cold

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It’s a long story, sir.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I’m sure it is.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I’m at work and...we got a few more

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: You want me to baby-sit?

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Sir?
text: Vin holds up his hand, shushes Oliver.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What’re you paying?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: For baby-sitting. I’m not a

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Okay...ten dollars an hour.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Twelve.
text: Maggie is amazed.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Fine. Great. Can I talk to him?

scene_heading: VIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: You've never seen Abbott &

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: No, sir. Are they old?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: No. They’re dead. That’s the

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Or the youngest. Time freezes when
dialog: you die.
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Where’d you learn that?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: A book.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What book?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: A kid's book, sir. I doubt you
dialog: know it.
dialog: Little shit. Then...
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: It’s dinner time. You hungry or
dialog: something?
text: Oliver looks at Vin, studies his face.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: A little, sir.
text: Vincent looks annoyed. He’s the kind of guy that gets
dialog: annoyed when someone wants something, even if he offered.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: That figures.
scene_heading: KITCHEN - VIN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Vin’s scouring the kitchen, looking for something to feed
text: the kid. All he finds is a tin of sardines and a package
text: of Saltines. He cracks the sardines open. Arranges like
text: it’s sushi. Decorates a dirty plate with concentric
text: circles of sardines and stale crackers. Not bad.
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: VIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Oliver’s eating a sardine cracker sandwich. Watching the
text: movie. Perfectly at home.
text: Vin’s drinking his dinner, a huge stack of mail sitting

text: The doorbell rings.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Probably your mother.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Probably, sir.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

dialog: Okay. How much?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I‘ll figure out something fair.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, he offered to watch you

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: He did?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yep. I was thinking maybe that’s
dialog: not such a horrible idea. It’s
dialog: right next door. Would save me
text: having to find a baby-sitter.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You'll be home though. Right.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Late mostly, baby. We have to eat.
dialog: I have to work. Your

text: Oliver eats, thinks.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I guess he’s too old to be
dialog: dangerous and not too old to be too
dialog: dangerous either. If you know what
dialog: I mean.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That’s what I thought. Maybe we’ll

speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: Excellent. So...saints are human

scene_heading: INT. THE BUCK - NIGHT - LATER
text: Vin is dancing solo to Steely Dan's, “Do It Again.” He’s
text: wasted. Maker’s in one hand, a smoke in the other.
text: His dance is a bizarre mix of slow-motion Tai Chi moves
text: and yoga poses. In it we see the punch he taught Oliver.
text: From the bar, Oliver watches. Perplexed.
speaker_heading: BAR - LATER
text: Celebration dinner. Vin and Oliver are bellied up to the

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Don’t lie to me, Roger. Be a man.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Vin. And he shouldn't be sitting

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: He’s just doing his job, Vin.
text: Vin stares at Oliver.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Turncoats. Everywhere you look.
dialog: No loyalty anymore. Everyone

text: falling apart.
text: Vin drains his wet ice, then smashes his glass on the

speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Damnit, Vin.
speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: VINCENT

dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Great. He tells you. Not his

speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: If you haven’t noticed...you’re not

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I love it when people like you give
dialog: people like me advice. Especially
dialog: parenting advice.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: I didn’t sign on for hormones here,

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

text: Vin starts to walk away.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: What do you know about me? Really?
dialog: Tell me. I’d love it.
text: Vin stops. Maggie thinks.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Okay. You're right. I don’t know
dialog: a whole lot about you. Because you
dialog: don’t want much known. So you act
dialog: like a prick and everyone stays
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: If it ain’t broken...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: It is broken. Look at it.

speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I can’t even say these words.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL O'BRIEN
dialog: They’re...creative.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: That’s one way to put it.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL O’BRIEN
dialog: Adjusting to a new school is tough
dialog: on children at this age. At any
dialog: age. So, I don’t want to minimize
dialog: that...but is there anything else
dialog: going on that we should be aware
dialog: of?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I don’t even know where to start.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL O'BRIEN
dialog: How about his father?
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Oh. Well. Please. That’1l take
dialog: up your whole day. We’re in the

dialog: And her assistant. And my
dialog: hairdresser. While she was still
dialog: cutting my hair. That was fun.
dialog: Now he’s filed for custody of

dialog: won't pay support till he gets his
dialog: way. You see. Plus he’s a lawyer,
dialog: so. So. I just took Oliver away
dialog: as fast as I could and took this

dialog: situations. Tumors. Cancer.
dialog: Cysts. Clots. All that. And of
dialog: course, I know what I see and I
dialog: can’t say anything to people. Which
dialog: is miserable, as you can imagine.
dialog: And I work really late, trying to
dialog: get our act together. Give Oliver
dialog: a better education and a semi-
dialog: normal life. And fight David and
dialog: this custody shit. Excuse me.
dialog: That’s his name. David. My ex.
dialog: He never wanted kids anyway. He
dialog: just doesn’t want me to be happy.
dialog: Oliver's adopted. Do you know
dialog: that? How would you. I’m not able
dialog: to have kids. Something about my
dialog: Fallopian tubes being twisted. I
text: think they were just recoiling from
dialog: David's sperm.
text: Maggie reaches for a tissue.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you mind?
text: Principal O’Brien shakes his head “no.” He has no words.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sure all of this has permeated

dialog: acting out. Right?
text: Principal O’Brien smiles. Maggie blows her nose.
scene_heading: INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - BATHROOM - LATER
text: Detention. Two adjacent bathroom stalls. Oliver’s in

dialog: that.
text: Oliver stops scrubbing.
speaker_heading: OZINSKI (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t really like it. Ozinski.
dialog: Just too many kids call me that
dialog: now, so it’s not like I can go
dialog: ‘round all day and tell ‘em, “Dick
dialog: wad, don’t call me Ozinski, my
dialog: name’s Robert.” Cause I would

text: Oliver stands, takes a piss.

speaker_heading: OZINSKI (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: SHIRLEY

text: He looks blankly at her.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE (CONT'D)
dialog: We're going to put you in this
dialog: machine here and run some tests,
dialog: okay? It won’t hurt a bit.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER NURSE
dialog: He can’t understand you, Maggie.
text: Maggie nods. Upset. Vincent grabs her hand. Holds it.
text: He understands.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: There you are. This takes about
dialog: thirty minutes, okay?
text: Vin says, “I understand” with his eyes.
scene_heading: THE WAITING ROOM - LATER
text: Oliver’s sitting in the waiting area. Amongst STRANGERS.
text: Maggie walks in, worried, looking for her son. Finally
text: she sees him...
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: He okay, ma?
text: She puts her arms around him.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You’re such a brave little man.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: We thought he was dead.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Who’s we?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Robert Ozinski and I.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: The bully kid?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: We're friends. Since I broke his
dialog: nose.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I don’t even know what you’re doing
dialog: anymore.
text: Maggie starts to get teary, she rubs Oliver’s head.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Mother. Stop feeling sorry for me.
dialog: And yourself. We're doing good.
dialog: You're working hard, every day and
dialog: we need the money. It’s okay.
dialog: 75.
text: Holy shit. Maggie is speechless, he’s a grown-up all of
text: a sudden.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I think he’s had a stroke. You
dialog: know what that is?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I've seen some billboards. “Know
text: the signs of a stroke and call 911
dialog: immediately.” But they never say
dialog: what the signs are so...
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: It’s a blockage in a brain artery.
dialog: Oliver knows this is serious.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: That’s not good.
text: Maggie puts her arm around him.
scene_heading: INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - DAY
text: Crespi’s class. Oliver’s standing in front of the
text: darkened classroom, presenting, using the Smart Board.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I chose Saint William of Rochester,
dialog: the patron saint of adopted
dialog: children.
text: Oliver clicks the Smart Board and a picture of Saint
text: William pops up on the screen.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
text: As a young man, William led a “wild
dialog: and misspent youth.” Which
dialog: included gambling, womanizing,
dialog: drinking and other things
dialog: considered inappropriate-—
text: Brother Crespi interrupts (from the back of the room.)
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: Why did you chose Saint William?
text: Throughout, Oliver clicks through slides on the Smart
dialog: Board.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Well, he found a baby on the church
text: steps and took it in and raised it
dialog: as his own. He named him David.
dialog: Click.
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: And then years later he went ona
dialog: pilgrimage to the Holy Land with
dialog: his son. And David went,
dialog: like...crazy, and clubbed Saint
text: William and cut his throat and then
text: robbed the body.
text: The slides are stock footage pictures of a crime scene.
dialog: Blood.
dialog: Mayhem.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: Ouch. Okay. Didn’t see that
dialog: coming.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: It’s a pretty interesting story.
dialog: Which is why I chose it. The other
dialog: saints I looked at were all so...
dialog: “saintly” I guess.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: What does “saintly” mean to you?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don’t know. I don’t really
dialog: believe in saints and all that
dialog: stuff. I mean, it seems like St.
dialog: William gets to be a saint just
dialog: because he was killed by the boy he
dialog: adopted. These days people get
dialog: killed all the time. They don’t
dialog: get to be saint for it.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: So you don’t think we have saints
dialog: living amongst us?
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don’t know any.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI
dialog: Thank you, Oliver.
text: Oliver walks to his seat. Brother Crespi moves to the
text: front of the class.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
text: Despite young Oliver’s reticence.
dialog: I believe there are saints all
dialog: around us today. They might never
dialog: be recognized as such by a
dialog: religion, but they’re every bit as
dialog: important to our society as the
text: saints in the textbook.
text: He flips on the Smart Board: “Modern Day Saints” is the
dialog: heading.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: BROTHER CRESPI (CONT'D)
dialog: Thus, you're going to research
dialog: someone you know, or know of, and
dialog: determine if they have the
dialog: qualities of a saint. Hence the
dialog: catchy title: Modern Day Saints.
text: Hands go up, lots of questions.
scene_heading: EXT. VIN’S HOUSE - LATER
text: Oliver’s walking home from school. He sees SOMEONE
text: sitting on Vin’s steps. It’s Daka.
speaker_heading: DAKA
text: Where’s is he? The car is there.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
text: He’s in the hospital.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: Why for?
text: Oliver just stares at her.
scene_heading: INT. MISSION HILLS HOSPITAL - LATER
text: Maggie, Oliver and Daka are walking down a hallway of

speaker_heading: MAGGIE

dialog: other?
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: I work for this man.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Doing what?
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: Working for him.
text: Maggie looks at Oliver. He’s buttoned up.
scene_heading: INT. VIN’S HOSPITAL ROOM —- MOMENTS LATER
text: Vin’s lying in bed, wide-eyed. He looks pissed. A
text: SPEECH THERAPIST is trying to “therapize” Vin.
dialog: The stroke has caused Aphasia and language apraxia. It’s
dialog: a_struggle for Vin to talk, and hard to understand.
text: The Speech Therapist holds up a flash card with the word
text: “Dog” printed on it.
dialog: 78.
scene_heading: SPEECH THERAPIST
dialog: Try to sound it out.
text: Vin pretends to think, then holds up his middle finger.
speaker_heading: SPEECH THERAPIST (CONT'D)
dialog: Not quite.
text: Vin holds up the other middle finger. Double bird.
speaker_heading: SPEECH THERAPIST (CONT'D)
dialog: You didn’t lose your sense of
dialog: humor.
text: Maggie, Oliver and Daka walk in.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: You have some company, Vin.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: I say hello only. The hospital is
dialog: shit place.
text: Oliver walks to Vin's bedside.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: You look a lot better.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: (slurred, re: Therapist)
dialog: Getttt this dippppshitt outta here.
text: Oliver’s confused with Vin’s slurred speech.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Wha’dya say?
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Getttt this...dipppppp...
text: Vin gets frustrated, his mouth won’t work. He swipes
text: hospital effects off the bedside table.
speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Getttttt outtta herrrrr.
text: Maggie interrupts.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Okay, Oli. Let’s let Vin work with
dialog: the therapist.
scene_heading: SPEECH THERAPIST
dialog: Thank you. We’1l be about an hour.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Fuccckkk you, annnnn hour.
scene_heading: SPEECH THERAPIST
dialog: Maybe less.
dialog: 79.
text: Maggie covers Oliver's ears.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: Why mean, you are? You could stop
dialog: breathing.
text: Maggie pulls Daka and Oliver out of the room.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Let’s go get a snack.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL BREAK / SNACK ROOM - LATER
text: Maggie, Oliver and Daka are sitting in the visitor’s
text: lounge drinking coffee. Daka is eating a candy bar.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: He may talk like that for a while.
dialog: That's what happens sometimes when
text: a person has a stroke.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: He sounds...
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: Like the retard.
dialog: Out of anyone else’s mouth that would be offensive.
speaker_heading: DAKA (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, he’s a stupid man anyway. So
text: retard is not far from.
text: Daka finishes her candy bar.
speaker_heading: DAKA (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you have a dollar? I’m
dialog: starving. I eat nothing today.
text: Maggie digs in her purse.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: I do.
text: She opens her wallet. Pulls out a dollar.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: I think dollar half is better.
text: Maggie gives her two bucks.
speaker_heading: DAKA (CONT'D)
dialog: Spasibo.
text: She's off to the vending machines.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: (re: her belly)
dialog: Is that Vincent’s...?
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Baby?
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Yea.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I don’t know. I avoid the whole
dialog: situation. It’s not polite to ask
dialog: a woman if she’s pregnant. So.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
text: Well. She’s obviously pregnant.
dialog: So...
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Vin's like 90 something. That
dialog: would be inappropriate.
text: Daka returns with two chocolate bars. She offers one to
dialog: Oliver.
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: If you hit this machine as first
dialog: candy drops, you can get two to
dialog: come down. Good?
text: Oliver takes it. Unwraps. The three of them sit
text: awkwardly comfortable together.

dialog: You know who you are.
text: Ozinski stares directly at a few FELLAS in class.
text: Brooklyn sinks in his chair.
speaker_heading: OZINSKI (CONT’D)
dialog: Anyways. He’s my saint. Cause he

speaker_heading: VINCENT

speaker_heading: DAKA (CONT'D)
dialog: You pay me for the hours now, papa.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Whaaaattt for?
speaker_heading: DAKA
dialog: What, for what? I take care of
dialog: your ass. And we don’t bump the

scene_heading: JUDGE REYNOLDS

scene_heading: RICHARD WALTERS, ESQ.

text: Judge Reynolds flips through more pictures.
scene_heading: JUDGE REYNOLDS
dialog: Is your client aware that Mr.

text: Maggie is lost. She looks to Oliver.
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: The odds.
speaker_heading: MAGGIE
dialog: Thank you. And the bar...well I
dialog: imagine that could fall under
dialog: current events.
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: For my modern day saint, I chose a
dialog: man who shares many of the same
dialog: qualities as St. William of
dialog: Rochester: Mr. Vincent Canatella.
text: He continues.
scene_heading: INT. ST. FRANCIS DE SALES - CONTINUOUS
text: Outside the auditorium. Vincent stands in front of a
text: marquee board. It’s the “Saint Wall.” Under each
text: student's name are two pictures: a real Saint next to a
dialog: Modern Day Saint.
dialog: Under Oliver Bornstein, we find: St. William of Rochester
dialog: and...Vincent Canatella. And he’s one fucked-up looking
text: “saint.” Eyes black, face distorted, assuredly on drugs,
text: lying in his hospital bed.
text: Vin stares at the picture of himself.
text: He hears Oliver’s voice within. Walks to the auditorium
dialog: doors.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Canatella was born in Newark,

speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: (whispers )
dialog: After you...
text: Vin defaults. Walks in first. He stands at the back of
text: the auditorium. Oliver continues:
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Growing up poor on the streets of
dialog: New Jersey, Vincent learned all the
dialog: things a kid shouldn’t need to
text: know. Fighting, cursing and
dialog: gambling.
text: The slide show shuffles images of VINCENT AS A BABY.
text: Then a YOUNG BOY. Poor. Tough. Street. Pictures of a
text: hard life. All the memories Vin had tossed in the trash.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: In 1965, as a member of United
dialog: States Army’s 5th Regiment, Vincent
dialog: was among the 450 soldiers dropped
dialog: into the la Drang Valley, and
text: immediately ambushed by 2000 enemy
dialog: troops.
text: A headshot of Vincent as a young Marine in Vietnam.
text: Smoking a cigarette, proud, strong.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: There he heroically saved the lives
text: of two wounded officers pinned down
dialog: by enemy fire and carried them to
dialog: safety.
text: Newspaper clippings of Vin’s heroics. A picture of Vin
text: receiving the Bronze Star. In the back of the
text: auditorium, Vin is frozen...seeing his life through the
text: eyes of another.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: I imagine the best way I can tell
dialog: you who Vincent Canatella is...is
dialog: to tell you what he’s done for me.
text: For the first time, Oliver sees Vin standing in back.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: When my mom and I first moved here,
dialog: we knew no one.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: And Mr. Canatella took me in. When
dialog: he didn’t have to. And probably
dialog: didn’t want to.
text: Laughter.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: But he did it anyhow. That’s what
dialog: saints do.
text: A wedding picture of Vin and Sandy pops up on the screen.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: We visited his wife of forty years,
text: Sandy, who recently passed away.
dialog: Vin's done her laundry every week
dialog: for the past eight years, long
text: after she no longer recognized him.
text: Another picture of Vin and Sandy.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Because saints never give up.
text: A picture of VIN AS A FIGHTER, with boxing gloves on.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: He taught me how to fight. How to
dialog: stand my ground and be brave. How
dialog: to speak up and be bold.
text: Maggie is crying. David hands her a tissue.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Because saints fight for themselves
dialog: and others. So that they might be
dialog: heard.
text: Vin is glued, hearing what he means to another, is the
text: warmth that melts an iceberg.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: He taught me how to gamble. Horse
text: racing, Keno, the over and under.
dialog: Which is a big reason why I’m
dialog: grounded till I’m eighteen.
text: Laughs.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: But in that I learned how to take
dialog: risks and go for broke. Because in
dialog: life the odds can be stacked
dialog: against you.
text: A picture of Vin’s cat, Felix.
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
text: This is Vin’s cat, Felix, who eats
text: gourmet cat food. While Vin eats
text: sardines.
dialog: The CROWD loves it.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Because saints make sacrifices.
text: Maggie, David and Daka are mesmerized, proud, inspired.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
text: Mr. Vincent Canatella is flawed.
text: He’s rough, drinks too much, smokes
text: and curses. He’s angry, mad at the
dialog: world, and I’m sure full of
dialog: regrets.
text: Vin takes it in.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Because after all, saints are human
text: beings. Very human beings.
text: The picture of St. William next to Vincent replays on the
text: projection screen.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Courage, sacrifice, compassion and
dialog: humanity. These are the markings
dialog: of a saint. And what makes Mr.
dialog: Vincent Canatella not so far
dialog: removed from St. William of
dialog: Rochester...
text: Vin’s picture solos on the presentation.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: And with that, I’d like to present
dialog: my friend and baby sitter, Mr.
dialog: Vincent Canatella for sainthood.
dialog: And hereby proclaim him St. Vincent
text: of Van Wyck street.
text: The place is wild with applause.
text: Vin doesn’t know what to do. People are looking around
text: for him. Finally...he starts walking down the aisle.
text: Brother Crespi helps Vin up the steps. And towards
text: Oliver, who’s holding the “Saint Medal.”
text: Vin steps in front of Oliver. He leans over as Oliver
text: puts the medal around his neck.
speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Thanks, kkkid.

dialog: when I was a kid.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Surely not. They’d be really
dialog: rotten by now.
speaker_heading: VINCENT
dialog: Nah. They’re all jacked up on

speaker_heading: VINCENT (CONT'D)
dialog: I got it. I owe you money anyhow.
dialog: What’s it going to be?
speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: VINCENT
