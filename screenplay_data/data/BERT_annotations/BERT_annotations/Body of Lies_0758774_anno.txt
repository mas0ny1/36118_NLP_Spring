speaker_heading: HANI
dialog: I have someone who wants to talk

dialog: It is only a phone. Take it.
dialog: (puts it in Karami’s
dialog: hand)
dialog: Take the phone and talk to your
dialog: mother. I will dial the phone.
dialog: Your mother has a new telephone

speaker_heading: FERRIS is
speaker_heading: HANI

speaker_heading: FERRIS

speaker_heading: HANI
dialog: She will tell him that she is

dialog: knew he would be a success, even
text: as a little boy in the refugee
dialog: camps. And now he has sent her
text: money, she is glad he is no longer
dialog: mixed up with the radicals.

speaker_heading: HANI
dialog: You are God’s blessing to your
dialog: mother, Mustafa. You did none of
dialog: those things for her. But you
dialog: should have. A mother, and that
dialog: she should live in peace, is more
dialog: important than anything they have

text: forehead. After a long silence...
speaker_heading: SADIKI
dialog: Our clients are usually Arab
dialog: companies...
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: You come very highly recommended
dialog: by our Arab clients.
text: FERRIS notices that Sadiki has looked aside at a German
dialog: drinking beer.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I’m so sorry, I didn’t know they
dialog: served beer here.
speaker_heading: SADIKI
dialog: (not meaning it)
dialog: It is no problem. He is not a
dialog: Muslim. He can do as he likes.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: That’s very generous of you.
text: Sadiki isn’t sure Ferris isn’t having him on, but
text: nonetheless produces a sheaf of photographs, turns the
dialog: pages for Ferris...
speaker_heading: SADIKI
dialog: This is a shopping center in
dialog: Fahaneel in Kuwait... Offices in
dialog: Amman... A dormitory for the
dialog: College of Technology in Irbid...
dialog: All uninspired but not terrible...
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Uh-huh... nice... but for our

speaker_heading: SADIKI
dialog: (hoping it’s not
dialog: true)
dialog: You want your bank to look like a
dialog: mosque.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Mosque-like -- yes -- since our
dialog: building site is in Sharjah and we
dialog: want to be respectful of the
dialog: Islamic character of the
dialog: neighborhood.
dialog: And we know this: Omar Sadiki hates Scanlon, and hates
dialog: the idea of working for an American company -- but also
dialog: that he will do it.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: We can go there after lunch. I
dialog: could show you the site. If you'd
dialog: like to see it.
dialog: Sadiki is either playing hard to get, or truly is
text: uncomfortable running around town with the infidel.
dialog: Ferris takes him into his confidence --
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Mr. Sadiki, I know you must have a
dialog: certain level of discomfort just
text: sitting with a non-believer, what
dialog: with all that’s going on. But let
dialog: me assure you: I despise this

speaker_heading: TONY (MAN)

scene_heading: EXT. THE BUILDING SITE (DUBAI) - DAY 112
text: Ferris has rejoined Sadiki as he finishes photographing
dialog: the site.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Hayes Andover’s option to buy this
dialog: property will expire at the end of
dialog: the month. So perhaps we could
dialog: get some preliminary sketches and
dialog: a rough bid say by... next
dialog: Thursday... before the Islamic
dialog: weekend...?
speaker_heading: SADIKI
dialog: I think we... yes, certainly.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: You'll have to sign a letter of
dialog: intent with our attorney -- Mr. Al-
dialog: Masri -- if you don’t mind.
text: FERRIS points to a rotund Arab in a suit patting at his

speaker_heading: SADIKI
dialog: It makes no difference to me. God

dialog: not.

text: AL-MASRI, greeting each other, exchanging papers, etc.
speaker_heading: FERRIS (V.O.)
dialog: Al-Masri is a lawyer. But he

speaker_heading: HANI
dialog: Ah, Dubai. The money-laundering

speaker_heading: FERRIS

speaker_heading: HANI

dialog: more than he claims to be? He
dialog: travels a lot, building mosques

scene_heading: INT. A TERRIBLE ROOM - NIGHT 200
dialog: Wherever we are, it’s very close to the blown speakers of
text: a mosque. Bugs crawl on shattered walls. FERRIS’
text: belongings and wallet are sorted through. His watch is
text: put on a skinny wrist. His MATCHBOX is shaken. The
text: tablet is turned over in fingers.
dialog: Ferris -- we assume it’s Ferris -- there’s a black cloth
text: sack over his head -- sits on a cot -- the only
text: “furniture” in the room -- hands still duct-taped behind
text: him. His head turns to the sound of a door opening, and
text: someone -- more than one -- lift him from the cot and
text: lead him out.
scene_heading: INT. A CAR (SOMEWHERE) - MOVING - NIGHT 201
text: Ferris can only listen to where he’s headed now -- which
dialog: could be anywhere, he figures, within a 500-mile radius
dialog: of where he was picked up.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER ROOM (SOMEWHERE) - NIGHT 202
text: He’s asleep -- or at least lying down -- in another
text: anonymous room.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 203
text: Another drive. The same nothing-but-car-engine clue to
text: where he is, which is no clue.
scene_heading: INT. ANOTHER ROOM (SOMEWHERE) - DAY 204
text: Ferris now sitting on a wooden chair, without which the
text: room would be bare. He hears the door open, someone walk
text: in, set something down. He feels a hand near his neck
text: and flinches slightly, but it’s only taking the sack from
text: his head from behind.
text: As the cloth comes off, Ferris sees this tableaux in
text: front of him:
text: A small wooden table. Wash basin, hand-towel, soap,
text: plastic Bic razor. Standing next to the table, looking
text: rather more wary of Ferris than Ferris is of him, an Arab
text: man wearing a little white cap and traditional dress,
text: like an ATTENDANT at a bathhouse.

scene_heading: INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT 205
text: The chair has been moved against the wall. Ferris is
text: sitting on it, bright light shining on his clean-shaven
dialog: face.
text: Fifteen feet away, just beyond lights on stands, is a
text: video camera on a tripod, its red record light blinking.
text: Behind that, in the shadows, stand several men.
text: One of the men comes forward with another chair.
text: Positions it and sits. One of the other men looks in the
text: camera eyepiece, and, like every cameraman in the world,
text: has to fool with the set dressing, gesturing to the man
text: in the chair to move it one inch to the right.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (holding out paper)
dialog: Say what is on this paper. Say
dialog: you are sorry to the Muslim

text: FERRIS reads the paper, then hands it back.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Fuck you.
text: MEN start to move at him, but a signal is given and they
dialog: relax.
scene_heading: POV THROUGH THE VIDEO EYEPIECE
text: Ferris against the wall, and the back of the man in the
text: chair, like the moderator of an interview program, still
text: slightly in frame. The camera zooms just enough to put
dialog: him O.S.
text: Ferris doesn’t see him, but MUSTAFA KARAMI is among the
text: dark figures behind the camera. (Make sure there’s
dialog: enough without Karami visible, for later reveal.)
text: Someone else goes out a door.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (SOMEWHERE) - NIGHT (LATER) 206
text: A car pulls up. A figure climbs from the passenger seat.
text: As he enters a building, the car continues down the
dialog: street, perhaps to go around back...
scene_heading: INT. THE ROOM - NIGHT 207

speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: Salaam, C.I.A.
text: He says each letter as if it is a word.
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Salaam, Sheikh.
speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: I am not the Sheikh. The Sheikh
dialog: who is, God praise him, is the
dialog: Sheikh who always was. I am his

speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Where is the girl?

speaker_heading: FERRIS

speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM

speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: Why would I want them, Mister

dialog: there’s more where they came from.
dialog: This is a world of poverty and
dialog: frustration and filth and
dialog: humiliation. There’s no shortage
dialog: of recruits in this world.
text: The BROTHERS look at each other. Ferris is fucked and he
dialog: knows it but he sees a way to play the situation:
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I forgot I was talking to a man
dialog: who murders his own men but never
dialog: risks himself. Who feels his
dialog: ‘brothers’ are dispensable.
text: Glances past Al-Saleem to the executioners in the shadows
text: behind the camera. There is a stir among the brothers.
dialog: Al-Saleem, pissed off that he had an unusual slip of ego,
dialog: studies him...
speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: Are you a Jew?
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: For you? Why not?
text: He moves like lightning to drive his thumb into Al-
text: Saleem’s eye. AL-SALEEM falls backwards, his eye socket
text: merely grazed. FERRIS, still not recovered from his
text: lunge, is shot in the thigh. He falls to the PLASTIC-
text: COVERED FLOOR. AL-SALEEM, a bit of blood at the corner
text: of his eye socket, grabs the agonized FERRIS by the
dialog: shirt.
speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: I could bind you. You want to be
dialog: bound?
text: FERRIS’ hands are lashed behind his back.
speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
speaker_heading: (punching FERRIS)
dialog: How do you like it? Do you like

speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: Tell me about this ‘attention.’
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I'd rather it be a surprise.
speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM

speaker_heading: FERRIS

text: AL-SALEEM stares at him.
speaker_heading: FERRIS

speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: You know nothing. What country
dialog: are you in?
speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: Do you think the people who ‘sold’
dialog: me were what they seemed to be,
dialog: Sheikh?
speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: There are always precautions. No
dialog: one knows where you are.
dialog: And because Hoffman lost Ferris on predator cam, we think
dialog: so, too.
speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM

speaker_heading: AL-SALEEM
dialog: I am not going to torture you,
dialog: Mister Ferris. I know you will
dialog: not read what is prepared for you
dialog: on the paper.
dialog: (crumples it)
dialog: You know what that camera is for.
dialog: It’s not for this. This is
dialog: Intermission. It’s for what comes
dialog: after this.
text: Ferris does know. And when Al-Saleem gets up, he knows
text: the time for it has come. Al-Saleem calmly walks away,
text: back the way he came, around the light stands and cords,
text: and out the door. Ferris’ eyes shift to the blinking red
text: light on the camera. Then behind it to the men getting
text: ready in the shadows -- gathering up their beheading
text: knives, putting on their black knit masks. And then they
dialog: come...
text: Ferris, who isn’t cuffed, goes for the closest one,
text: digging his thumbs into the man’s eyes, but is quickly
text: set upon by the others who knock him to the floor, and in
text: a violent blur, punch and kick him to within an inch of
text: unconsciousness, a horrific beating...
text: Now they cinch his hands behind his back with nylon
dialog: cuffs. Lift him up and sit him on the chair. Line up
text: behind him, posed with their knives for the camera. One
dialog: of them, who we might recognize from his eyes as Al-
text: Saleem’s lieutenant, speaks to it, in Arabic (subtitles):
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: When the Believers saw the Allies,
dialog: they said: This is what Allah and
dialog: his Apostle promised us, and Allah
dialog: and his Apostle spoke the truth,
dialog: increasing them in their faith.
text: He’s done. Grabs Ferris’ hair to pull his head back for
dialog: the knives that will cut it off --
text: Ferris’ eyes shift as if to see the KNIFE but as he does
text: he sees a man standing to the side who he has not seen
dialog: before in the room:
scene_heading: MUSTAFA KARAMI.

text: Doors and shutters are torn away and brilliant light
text: bursts in on the already blinded men --
text: MEN IN BLACK TACTICALS advance into the room, shooting
text: some of the jihadists, slamming others to the floor.
text: Ferris, lying with blood trickling from an ear, watches

speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You can’t smoke in here, sir.
speaker_heading: HANI

speaker_heading: FERRIS
dialog: I shudder too, Hani. And how
