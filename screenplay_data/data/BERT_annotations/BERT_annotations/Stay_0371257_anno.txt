scene_heading: EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: A wrecked Ford Mustang burns in the middle of the empty
text: bridge. Empty. No other cars, no people in sight..
text: There is a gaping hole in the windshield on the driver's
text: side. Flames consume the backseat. Smoke spills out the
text: windows. The radio still plays, however: The Band's "I Shall
dialog: be Released."
text: One of the Mustang's front tires has blown out. Scraps of
text: black rubber litter the accident scene.
text: As the camera pulls in, we see HENRY LETHAM, twenty, sitting
text: in front of the ruined car. His eyes are closed.
text: He looks sick-- pale, skinny, disheveled-- but he has a
text: presence, a magnetism that compels you to look at him.
text: Finally Henry opens his eyes. After a moment he stands and
text: walks away from the burning car, never turning around,
text: heading for the illuminated towers of Manhattan.
text: Somewhere nearby a BABY is HOWLING, though no one is in
dialog: sight.
scene_heading: INT. MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS APARTMENT -- MORNING
dialog: Tuesday
text: The baby's HOWL continues, faintly, in the background.
text: DR. SAM FOSTER, a psychiatrist in his early forties, wakes up
text: in bed, disoriented, sunlight shining on the disheveled
dialog: sheets.
text: For several seconds Sam looks about the apartment, confused,
text: as if he's never seen the place before.
scene_heading: EXT. OLLIE'S NOODLE SHOP -- 116TH AND BROADWAY -- MORNING
text: Sam parks his old, battered Volvo in front of the Chinese
text: noodle shop. He checks his watch and curses under his breath.
text: Sam's hair is beginning to gray, but he's still built like a
text: college tennis player. He smiles readily but there is a
text: brooding quality about him, in his dark eyes, that suggests
dialog: he has seen things most of us have not
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY -- MORNING
text: The bells are tolling. Sam dashes through the campus gates.
text: Under his tweed blazer he wears a frayed navy-blue cable-knit
dialog: sweater.
text: As he rounds a corner he checks his watch, and before he
text: looks up collides with LILA CULPEPPER, knocking her styrofoam
text: cup of coffee to the sidewalk
text: With her stylish haircut and clothing, Lila looks more like a
text: young editor of a fashion magazine than a graduate student.
text: Only the thick philosophy textbooks she carries and her red-
text: ink stained fingers give her away.
text: She shoves him.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Watch where you're going, old man.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jesus, kids these days...
text: He kisses her on the lips.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I don't have time to stand here
dialog: flirting with you. I've got to give
text: a test to Grunbaum's undergrads.
text: Sam stoops to pick up the empty cup, stands straight,
text: crumples the cup, tosses it into a nearby garbage can.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thank God none of the TAs looked
dialog: like you when I was a student. I
dialog: would've flunked every test.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Oh, that's sweet. Can I tell you
dialog: something?
text: She sidles up next to him and fixes the collar of his jacket.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You owe me a cup of coffee.
scene_heading: EXT. TURNER HALL -- MORNING
text: Sam hurries inside the sleek, angular, glass-and-steel
dialog: building.
scene_heading: INT. TURNER HALL -- MORNING
text: Sam gets out of the elevator and waves to a RECEPTIONIST
text: sitting behind a desk. A sign on the wall behind her reads
text: COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY COUNSELING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, Toni.
speaker_heading: TONT
dialog: Hey, Sam. Henry Letham's waiting in
text: Beth's office.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thanks.
text: He walks down the hallway and opens the last door on the
dialog: left.
scene_heading: INT. BETH LEVY'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Henry, wearing paint-spattered army pants and a black long-
text: sleeve tee-shirt, stands at the window of the bookshelf-lined
text: office, looking out at the sky. He stares at Sam when Sam
text: enters the room. Sam smiles and nods.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Henry?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Where's Dr. Levy?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Dr. Levy had an appendectomy,
dialog: she'll be gone a few weeks. I'm Dr.
dialog: Foster, I'm covering for her.
text: Sam offers his hand and Henry examines it for a moment before
text: shaking. Sam goes behind the desk to sit and gestures for
text: Henry to sit inn one of the facing chairs.
text: Sam pulls a manila folder from his suitcase. Henry sits on
text: the edge of a facing chair. He looks ready to bolt at any
dialog: second.
text: Henry holds a piece of string which he coils tightly around
text: his index finger, then uncoils, then coils again.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: So you're the substitute shrink?
text: Sam smiles.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I guess you could call me that.
dialog: Does it make you uncomfortable that
dialog: I'm filling in for Dr. Levy?
text: Henry thinks about it, coiling the string tightly.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Is she your girlfriend?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. We were classmates, actually.
dialog: So listen, I read your file--
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Oh, really? May I read your file?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fair enough. How about you ask me a
dialog: question for every question I ask
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: How about we don't play stupid
dialog: games.
text: Sam smiles and leans back in his chair. Far from being
text: deterred by Henry's attitude, he's intrigued. He likes
dialog: challenges.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay. Tell me why you're here.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You read the file. You ought to
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You torched your car. Why?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you mean, you don't know?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't remember.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Were you drinking?
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: I opened my eyes and I was sitting
text: in the car and it was on fire.
text: Henry is quiet for a moment, remembering.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you often set fires?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No. I'm not a pyromaniac or
dialog: anything. It's not like I burned
dialog: flies when I was a kid.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe a couple times I did. Is that
dialog: bad?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: For the flies it is.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I remember them trying to crawl
dialog: when they were on fire.
text: Henry is silent for a moment. He coils the string so tightly
text: around his finger that the tip of his finger turns bright
dialog: red.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe Hell is the place where all
dialog: the bad things you've done come
dialog: back to get you.
text: Another pause. Sam points at Henry's finger.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're cutting off the circulation.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I never meant to hurt anyone.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You were a kid. Kids are cruel.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm not talking about the flies.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Abruptly, Henry stands, knocking over his chair in the
text: process. He bends down to pick it up.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Sorry. I better go.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you sure? I feel like we're
text: just getting started.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No, no, I better--
text: Henry looks out the window.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll have hail this afternoon.
text: Sam watches him leave and then stares out the window. The sky
text: is bright blue.
scene_heading: EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK -- AFTERNOON
text: The sky is still blue on this beautiful autumn afternoon. Sam
text: and Lila, on rollerblades, slowly roll down the promenade
text: overlooking the Hudson River. Lila holds Sam's hand,
text: steadying him.
text: Lila is obviously skilled; Sam is obviously a beginner. He
text: wears a helmet, kneepads, and elbow pads over his long-sleeve
text: tee-shirt.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Don't lean forward too much.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Try to relax. You're too tense. Try
dialog: to get the rhythm. You want it to
dialog: feel natural.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: I have wheels strapped to my feet
dialog: There's nothing natural about it.
text: Two kids on rollerblades whiz by the couple. Sam, trying to
text: get out of the way, nearly falls.
text: One of the kids begins skating backwards. He nudges his
text: friend and imitates Sam's spastic motions. Both of them laugh
text: and zoom away.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Ha ha, you little bastards.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: We don't have to do this, you know.
dialog: It's supposed to be fun.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm having fun.
text: He lets go of Lila's hand and tries to skate in the manner of
text: Eric Heiden, pumping his legs with one hand behind his back
text: going faster and faster.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Sam...
text: Sam, now out of control, begins speeding downhill.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do I stop? HOW DO I STOP?
text: Ahead of him, the path forks left and right. He won't be able
dialog: to make the turn at this speed.
text: At the last second, Sam grabs onto a lamppost. He spins
text: around the post and flops into a bush.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (catching up)
dialog: Sam? Sam?
text: Sam lies on the ground, catching his breath. He's covered
text: with leaves and dirt.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT’D)
dialog: You okay?
text: Lila crouches beside him and begins checking him for injuries
text: with the practiced skill of a nurse.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm fine, I'm fine.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: That was impressive.
text: She lies down next to him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Maybe I'm not ready for this. I'm
dialog: not so coordinated.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: That's okay. You're a sexy klutz.
text: They kiss. Lila pulls herself closer, her hands on Sam's
text: wrists. Abruptly, Sam pulls his long sleeves down farther, as
text: if to hide something on his wrists. Lila releases him.
text: For a moment both of them are quiet.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have to do that. You
dialog: don't have to hide from me.
text: Sam doesn't look at her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not hiding.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Sam.
text: Sam raises his head.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't hide.
text: She kisses him. In the middle of the kiss a loud CRACK
text: startles both of them.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
text: For a few seconds nothing happens. And then another CRACK,
text: and then another, coming rapid fire now, grape-size chunks of
text: ice falling from the sky and shattering on the paved
text: walkways.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hail.
scene_heading: INT. CAR -- NIGHT
speaker_heading: DRIVER'S POV
text: We see the road through the driver's eyes. We're somewhere in
text: Brooklyn, driving fast through a string of green lights.
text: Everything is very, very quiet.
text: We turn to the right. A GREEN-EYED WOMAN (20) sits in the
text: passenger seat. She says something, but we can't hear a word.
text: She smiles.
scene_heading: INT. SUBWAY CAR -- AFTERNOON
text: Henry opens his eyes. He sits in a car that shudders and
text: rattles its way through the underground. On his lap is a book
dialog: on the artist Tristan Réveur.
text: He pulls a cigarette from a pack and lights it.
text: Next to Henry sleeps a long-haired TEENAGE BOY wearing a
text: Walkman: from the headphones we hear "I Shall be Released."
text: Various subway riders glare at Henry and wave away the smoke,
text: obviously annoyed that he's polluting their airspace.
text: A YOUNG WOMAN who wears her blonde hair in dreadlocks sits
text: across the car, watching Henry.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: You go to Columbia, right? We were
dialog: both in Psych 221. Professor
dialog: Matthewson?
dialog: (pointing at his book)
dialog: You did your oral presentation on
dialog: psychosis and Tristan Réveur
dialog: right?
text: Henry stares at her as if she's speaking an alien language. A
text: BUSINESSMAN standing between them, holding onto the metal
text: pole, wearing a gray suit and carrying an attache case,
text: shakes his head at Henry.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
text: No smoking on the train.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Look at the sign, fella. No smoking
text: on the train.
text: Henry looks at the sign.
text: INSERT NO SMOKING SIGN
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Capeesh? Put it out.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Capeesh? Are you in the Mafia?
text: The businessman leans closer, until his face is inches from
dialog: Henry's.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Put out the fucking cigarette.
text: Henry slowly rolls his shirtsleeve back from his forearm. The
text: skin is mottled with fresh burns.
text: He draws on his cigarette until its point is red-hot, then
text: stabs it out on the skin of his wrist. He does not flinch.
text: The businessman reels backward. The dreadlocked Columbia
text: student's mouth drops open. The people sitting next to Henry
text: stand and move away.
text: Henry offers the cigarette butt to the businessman, who waves
text: his hand at it and moves away, muttering:
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You ought to be locked up.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I am.
text: When the train pulls into the next station, the businessman
text: and the Columbia caucastafarian hastily depart.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Bookshelves overflowing with books dominate the space. The
text: one luxurious feature is a working fireplace where a well-
text: built little fire now burns.
text: Lila's curled up in bed, highlighting lines in Dante's
dialog: Purgatorio.
text: Sam, lying beside her, speaks on the PHONE.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, Beth, this is Sam. Hope you're
dialog: feeling better. I met with your
dialog: patient Henry Letham today, thought
dialog: maybe we could compare notes.
dialog: Anyway, give me a call.
dialog: 11.
text: He hangs up and stares into the fire, his hands folded over
text: his chest.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Lila)
dialog: You don't think it's a little odd,
dialog: predicting a hailstorm like that?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (not really paying
dialog: attention)
text: So he watches the Weather Channel.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I looked in the newspaper. There
dialog: was nothing about any hail today.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Maybe he's a shaman and he did a
dialog: little hail dance.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay, forget it.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (finally looking up)
dialog: How's Beth Levy?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know. She hasn't returned
dialog: any of my calls.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Hm.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What does "hm" mean?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: She always kind of liked you
dialog: didn't she?
text: Sam jabs Lila in the ribs with his finger.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you, jealous? Beth's one
dialog: of my oldest friends.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: She's your oldest friend, that's
dialog: supposed to make me unjealous?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Unjealous?
speaker_heading: LILA
text: She's in love. It's obvious to
dialog: everyone but you. And every day you
dialog: wear that sweater she made you--
text: She points at the blue sweater, lying folded on top of the
dialog: dresser.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: --and all I can think is, Damn, I
dialog: can't even knit.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She saved my life, sweetheart.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're the only one for me, all
dialog: right? I knew I would find you. And
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (kissing him on the lips)
dialog: It took you long enough.
scene_heading: INT. BETH LEVY'S OFFICE -- MORNING
dialog: Wednesday
text: Sam sits behind Beth's desk and Henry sits facing him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Have you considered a career in
dialog: meteorology?
text: Henry says nothing, only stares at the chewed-down stubs of
text: his fingernails.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT' D)
dialog: The weatherman said something about
dialog: the hail?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I can't listen to the weatherman
dialog: anymore. I don't understand a word
dialog: he says.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't understand the
dialog: weatherman?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sure. He says rain, I bring an
dialog: umbrella.
text: Henry stares at Sam for a moment, trying to gauge the
text: psychiatrist. He seems to come to a decision.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't know what's real anymore.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Go on.
dialog: (off Henry's non-response)
dialog: Give me a chance, Henry. I'm good
dialog: at what I do.
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: The voices never stop.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Voices?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: In my head. They never stop.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why were you so reluctant to tell
dialog: me that?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't want to fit into your grid.
dialog: I don't want you saying, "Okay,
text: paranoid schizophrenic. Two hundred
dialog: milligrams of Risperdol should do
dialog: the trick."
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't want me making
dialog: assumptions about you, right?
text: Henry nods.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: But aren't you making assumptions
dialog: about me? You think I want to fit
dialog: you into a grid?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SAM(cont 'd)
dialog: I don't make grids. I want to know
dialog: the particulars about Henry Letham.
dialog: You hear voices. All right, that's
dialog: important information. What are the
dialog: voices saying?
text: Henry shakes his head and looks out the window.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I think it might be helpful if you
text: start writing it down.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Writing what down?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What the voices are saying. write
dialog: down the exact words when you hear
dialog: them. Okay? Henry?
text: Henry hasn't been listening.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Write down what the voices are
dialog: saying.
text: Henry grabs a pen and a pad of paper from the desk and begins
dialog: writing.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: They're talking to you now?
text: Henry continues writing furiously. When he finishes he stares
text: at his own jagged cursive
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I see?
text: Henry hands the pad over. Sam studies it, straining to read
dialog: the handwriting.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Write down what the voices are
dialog: saying... They're talking to you
dialog: now?"
dialog: (looking at Henry)
dialog: That wasn't a hallucination, that
dialog: was me talking.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You come inside my head, Doctor,
dialog: and show me how to tell the
dialog: difference.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (continuing to read)
dialog: "Stay, Henry, stay. Stay. Stay.
dialog: Stay."
dialog: (looking at Henry)
dialog: You're hearing this voice now?
text: Henry nods, rubbing his palm over his scarred forearm.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you recognize the voice?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You just said you did.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's a woman. I know her, but I
dialog: don't know who she is.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't understand.
text: Henry says nothing, only scratches his forearm. Sam notices
text: the fresh burn on Henry's arm. He stands, goes around the
text: desk, gently takes Henry's arm and inspects it.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: What's this from?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I burned myself.
text: Sam looks closer. He notices the old burn scars that
text: constellate Henry's forearms.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (more firmly)
dialog: What are these scars from?
dialog: 16.
text: Absently, Henry looks at his forearms.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Cigarettes, I guess.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why do you have cigarette scars on
dialog: your forearms?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Because I keep burning myself.
text: Sam nods and studies Henry for a moment. He releases Henry's
text: arm and sits on the edge of the desk
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why do you want to hurt yourself?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I guess it's practice.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Practice for what?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: For Hell.
text: Sam takes a deep breath and exhales.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You think you're going to Hell?
text: Henry nods.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Because of what I did.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What did you do?
text: Henry shakes his head, stares out the window.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Whatever it is, we--
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I know you're trying to help me,
dialog: Doctor. And thank you. But it's too
dialog: late.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why is it too late?
text: Henry stands and grabs his bookbag off the floor.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Saturday at midnight I'm going to
dialog: kill myself.
text: He rubs his arms and smiles.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I need to get ready.
text: He walks out, leaving a stunned Sam alone in the room.
scene_heading: INT. COLUMBIA PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL -- AFTERNOON
text: Sam walks down the corridor of the Mental Health Ward. He
text: knocks on an office door marked: Mobile Crisis Unit. No
text: answer. As he's about to knock again he hears a commotion at
text: the end of the hallway.
text: Two strapping PARAMEDICS are wrestling a fiercely agitated,
text: heavy-set woman, DAISY, toward one of the rooms. She appears
text: to be homeless, wearing layer upon layer of filthy clothing,
text: her hair matted, her skin dirty and bruised.
text: Standing beside the paramedics, DOCTOR SCHLEGEL, a gaunt man
text: with a sparse goatee, tries to calm the woman.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Come on, Daisy. We've got your
text: television turned on and
dialog: everything. Take it easy.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I AM NOT A NAZI! I AM NOT A NAZI
dialog: GODDAMN YOU!
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Nobody's calling you a Nazi, Daisy.
dialog: Come on, now.
text: Sam hurries down the corridor toward the disturbance. Daisy
text: falls to the floor and the paramedics, unable to force her
text: into the room, try to hold her still as she thrashes in their
dialog: arms.
text: Dr. Schlegel has prepared a hypodermic and now crouches
text: waiting for an opportunity to stick Daisy.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I AM NOT A NAZT!
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: I know it, Daisy, I know it.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (beginning to sob)
dialog: You can't treat me this way. I am
dialog: not a Nazi! I don't deserve this.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Believe it or not, sweetheart, it's
dialog: for your own good.
text: The paramedics hold her tight and Schlegel sticks the needle
text: in Daisy's arm.
speaker_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL (CONT’D)
dialog: If you'd remember to take your
dialog: pills, we wouldn't have to go
dialog: through this every month.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: I'm not a Nazi. I'm lovable.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: You are.
speaker_heading: DAISY
dialog: (already beginning to
dialog: fade)
dialog: I'm lovable.
text: The paramedics hoist Daisy to her feet and lead her
text: peacefully into the bedroom.
text: Dr. Schlegel sees Sam for the first time and smiles, a little
dialog: embarrassed.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Hey, Sam. The glamorous world of
dialog: psychiatry, huh?
text: They shake hands and Schlegel leads Sam back toward the
dialog: Mobile Crisis Unit office.
speaker_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL (CONT'D)
dialog: So what brings you to Club Meds?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I wanted to check the protocol on
text: involuntary committal.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: SAM(cont'd)
dialog: I've got a student threatening to
dialog: kill himself.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Jesus, tell him to take a number
dialog: Well, the rules are pretty
dialog: straightforward. If he says he's
dialog: gonna hurt himself or someone else,
dialog: we can take him in. But we can only
dialog: hold him here for forty-eight
dialog: hours.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Forty-eight hours? What are we
dialog: going to do in forty-eight hours?
text: They stop outside the MCU office.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Hold his hand, feed him some pills.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If we catch him in the actual
dialog: attempt, that's different. He's
dialog: broken the law. But just based on a
dialog: threat? Without a court order, we
dialog: can't keep him for long.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He wants to do it Saturday at
dialog: midnight. If we take him in now
dialog: he'll be out by then.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: What, he's got an appointment to
dialog: off himself?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's what he told me. Saturday,
dialog: midnight.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: So maybe we should pick him up
dialog: Friday, hold him through the
dialog: weekend.
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: AS you just saw, it's not a real
dialog: fun process. If there's any way to
dialog: avoid it, avoid it. What do you
dialog: have him on?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He won't take any pills.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: SAM(cont'd)
dialog: He wants to die, Jeff. I've got
dialog: three days to convince him not to.

text: grand toward the open windows of a fourth-floor apartment.
text: PIANO MOVER 1 acts as the foreman, issuing commands.
speaker_heading: PIANO MOVER 1
dialog: Easy, easy.
text: A small BOY, accompanied by his MOTHER, runs down the street
text: holding a red balloon. He trips and falls and the balloon
text: begins to float away.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: (yelling at escaping
dialog: balloon)
dialog: Wait! wait!
text: The piano movers hear the boy's cries and see the balloon.
text: Piano Mover 1 makes a valiant effort to capture the escaping
text: balloon; he runs after it and leaps... but he can't quite
dialog: reach it.
text: Everyone watches the red balloon drift skyward.
speaker_heading: PIANO MOVER 1
dialog: Sorry, kid. It's gone to balloon
dialog: heaven.
text: Sam smiles and enters his building, where the DOORMAN greets

text: Lila meets Sam at the door and kisses him on the lips.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I didn't think you were going to

dialog: You're the only Eagle Scout I've
dialog: ever dated.
text: She leads him into the bedroom.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I never made Eagle Scout. The Troop
dialog: Master caught me drinking Mad Dog
dialog: 20/20 in my tent with Lydia
dialog: Eumanian.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Lydia Eumanian?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: The horniest thirteen-year-old in
dialog: Northern New Jersey.
text: Lila curls up at the foot of her bed and watches as Sam grabs
text: a bundle of twigs from beside the fireplace and starts laying
text: down the kindling.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Only because I never lived in
dialog: Northern New Jersey.
text: Sam begins stacking the logs.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT' D)
dialog: Are you okay, baby? You look a
dialog: little tense.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That student. Henry. He told me he
dialog: was going to kill himself Saturday
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Kids at Columbia are always talking
dialog: about killing themselves. It's hip.
text: It's like wearing black.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think it's a front for this
text: one. Saturday at midnight, he says.
dialog: Just like that. Like it's a date
dialog: he's made.
text: Sam rolls an old newspaper and inserts it beneath the stacked
dialog: logs.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Why Saturday?
text: Sam strikes a match and lights the fire.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hm?
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Why does he want to do it on
dialog: Saturday? What's so special about
dialog: midnight Saturday?
text: Sam watches the kindling catch.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He left before I could ask.
text: Confident that the fire is in good shape, Sam walks over to
text: the bedside table, picks up the phone and dials a number. He
text: waits for a moment and then shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: Beth, it's Sam again. Where are
dialog: you? You all right? Uh, okay, give
dialog: me a call when you get this.
text: He hangs up and sits on the edge of the bed.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm starting to get a little
text: worried about her.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'm starting to get a little
dialog: worried about you, baby. It's a
dialog: hell of a job, listening to these
dialog: crazy boys and girls all day.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: At least I get you all night.
text: Lila grabs Sam by the collar and pulls him over to her. They
dialog: kiss.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't go crazy on me.
scene_heading: INT. BETH LEVY'S OFFICE -- MORNING
dialog: Thursday
text: Sam sits behind the desk and Henry sits facing him. Sam holds
text: a typed contract.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I want to propose a deal. I've
dialog: written up a contract.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: SAM(cont 'd)
dialog: It says you won't do anything to
dialog: hurt yourself without contacting me
dialog: first. And here's my card. It has
dialog: my home phone and cell phone, so
dialog: you can call me whenever you want.
text: Henry leans forward and takes the contract and business card
text: from Sam. He reads the contract quickly, signs his name, and
text: hands it back to Sam. He pockets the card.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Saturday at midnight I die.
dialog: Consider yourself contacted.
text: Sam, bewildered, looks at the contract for a moment and then
text: sets it aside.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why Saturday?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's my twenty-first birthday.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think the tradition is to go out
dialog: and get drunk, not blow your brains
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Have you heard of Tristan Réveur?
dialog: He was one of the Dada artists.
dialog: When he was eighteen he told
dialog: everyone he would live three more
dialog: years and then go to New York and
dialog: kill himself. And that's exactly
dialog: what he did. He came to New York
dialog: for his twenty-first birthday, saw
text: the sights, and shot himself in the
dialog: head.
text: Both of them are silent for a while.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What about your parents? Have you
dialog: considered what this might do to
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: They don't care.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you know that?
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's pretty obvious.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do they live around here?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No. They're over in Mahlus Gardens.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mahlus Gardens? Where's that?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's a cemetery in New Jersey. I
dialog: thought you read my file.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (startled)
dialog: I did. It didn't mention anything
dialog: about that.
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: It's a little out of date, then.
text: Henry stands, walks over to the office window and looks out
text: across the campus.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Any other family?
text: Henry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Friends?
dialog: (off Henry's silence)
dialog: Who are you closest to?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What do you mean, closest to?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: If you got into trouble and you
dialog: needed someone, who would you go
dialog: to?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I am in trouble.
text: Henry does not say this in a self-pitying way. He is simply
dialog: stating a fact.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes, I think you are.
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Then you've got your answer.
text: Sam does not understand.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I came to you, Doctor. I guess that
dialog: means I'm closest to you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: To me? We met two days ago.
text: Henry inspects his fingernails.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: There was a girl.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (perking up)
dialog: A girlfriend?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I barely even talked to her. She
dialog: was my waitress at this diner I
dialog: used to go to. On Canal Street.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She'd keep filling my coffee cup.
dialog: She'd say, "Is everything okay?" I
dialog: mean, I know waitresses are always
dialog: asking that, but... this is stupid.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, it's not stupid. This waitress
dialog: did you ever get her name?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Athena.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Athena? Really?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: All right, that's a start.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No, it's not. She was in my life
text: for a few minutes and now she's
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: She's not gone. She's somewhere
dialog: else.
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: There is no somewhere else. If
dialog: you're not in my life, you don't
dialog: exist.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You think I disappear when you're
dialog: not watching?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm always watching.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
text: We're back in the DRIVER'S POV again, speeding along the
text: Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. The Brooklyn Bridge looms in the
text: distance, Gothic arches majestically lit
text: We look at the green-eyed woman, but she's speaking to
text: someone in the backseat. Her mouth moves but everything is
dialog: silent.
text: We turn to the road again. The bridge is waiting for us.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO -- AFTERNOON
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
text: Henry enters the Zoo beneath the Delacorte Clock, the bronze

text: Henry watches a lone silverback GORILLA who sits on a large
text: rock, staring back at Henry.
text: Henry sits on a park bench, watching an OLD MAN throw bread
text: crumbs to a horde of squawking pigeons.
text: Henry sits in the last row of the bleachers overlooking the
text: seal pool. The front rows are filled with screaming CHILDREN.
text: On an island in the middle of the pool, TRAINERS toss fish to
text: the SEALS as rewards for various tricks: clapping their
text: flippers, jumping through hoops, kissing each other
text: balancing balls on their noses.
scene_heading: INT. POLAR BEAR TANK -- AFTERNOON
text: We see a blurred Henry through the window of a polar bear
text: tank. The BEAR is swimming laps, never pausing.
dialog: 27.
text: It's an oddly graceful animal, bulky but elegant, flipping at
text: each end of the pool to kick off the wall (one wall being the
text: window that Henry stands behind).
scene_heading: EXT. POLAR BEAR TANK -- AFTERNOON
text: Henry seems mesmerized by the bear's endless swim. A well-
text: dressed ENGLISHMAN and ENGLISHWOMAN approach and watch the
text: bear perform its laps.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: You suppose he's bored?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I think he's trying to forget where
dialog: he is.
text: The Englishman nods and they all watch the bear in silence
text: for a moment.
scene_heading: INT. POLAR BEAR TANK
text: The polar bear glides soundlessly through the water, ignoring
text: the blurred faces beyond the glass.
scene_heading: EXT. POLAR BEAR TANK
text: Somewhere nearby a BABY is howling. Henry looks around but
text: there is no baby in sight.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: And is it working?
text: Henry looks at the Englishman.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's hard to forget where you are,
dialog: isn't it?
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: You tell me.
text: Both the man and his wife smile at Henry and walk away. Henry
text: watches them go.
text: The unseen baby continues to howl.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBIA PHILOSOPHY BUILDING -- AFTERNOON
text: Lila sits cross-legged in the grass lawn that fronts the
text: Philosophy building, highlighting lines in a textbook. A few
text: feet away, Rodin's bronze Le Penseur sits in permanent
text: contemplation.
speaker_heading: SAM (0.S.)
dialog: So what's he thinking?
text: Lila looks up from her book and sees Sam staring at the
text: statue. She smiles and studies the Thinker for a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I think therefore I am?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: It's not thinking anything. It's a
dialog: statue.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're kind of literal minded, you
dialog: know that?
text: She grins and tosses aside her book.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You grade two hundred papers in a
dialog: week, see how literal minded you
dialog: get.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You met with that student today?
dialog: The suicidal one?
text: Sam squats down beside Lila and picks at the grass. He rests
text: his BRIEFCASE on the ground beside him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He came in, yeah.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: And? Why does he want to die?
text: Sam stares at Lila for a while and she looks away, flustered.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT' D)
dialog: I'm sorry, is that a stupid
dialog: question?
text: Sam shakes his head. He takes Lila's hand.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. It's the question. I just don't
dialog: have an answer yet.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: And you... did you...
text: She's obviously uncomfortable, not sure how to proceed.
dialog: He kisses
dialog: Lila sees
dialog: Sam turns
dialog: Sam walks
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I need to find something he wants
dialog: to live for.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: How are you going to do that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He'll tell me. That's why he keeps
dialog: coming to see me.
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: I've got a meeting to get to. See
dialog: you at home.
text: her on the lips, stands, and begins walking away.
text: that he's left his briefcase lying on the ground.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Henry!
text: and stares at her. Lila points at the briefcase.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: Forgetting something?
text: back to her, staring at her the whole time.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What did you just call me?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You just called me Henry.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Baby, I think I know your name by
dialog: now.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But you called me Henry.
text: Lila holds up her hands.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Hey, don't shoot.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, it's just--
speaker_heading: LI LA
dialog: I know who you are, Sam. I promise.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Okay. Okay.
text: He grabs his briefcase, kisses her again, and walks away. She
text: watches him go.
scene_heading: EXT. HUNGARIAN CAFE -- MORNING
dialog: Friday
text: Henry sits on the sidewalk outside the cafe, playing cat's
text: cradle with a string. He's good, creating intricate patterns
text: and undoing them.
text: Sam walks up to him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey. You're early.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I skipped glee club today.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's a joke, right?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Sam leads Henry inside.
scene_heading: INT. HUNGARIAN CAFE -- CONTINUOUS
text: A small, dark cafe where STUDENTS and PROFESSORS drink coffee
text: and eat homemade pastries. Bad art lines the walls.
dialog: 31.
text: Henry and Sam find seats in a corner of the room, far away
dialog: from everyone else.
text: The song playing on the radio ends; the new song is "I Shall
dialog: be Released."
text: Henry sits up straight when he hears the song. He stares at
text: the nearest stereo speaker as if trying to figure something
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I can't escape this song.
dialog: (looking at Sam)
dialog: Why did you want to meet here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The Hungarian Cafe? Sentimental
dialog: favorite. When I was an undergrad I
dialog: worked here.
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: I lost my virginity under that
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: You what?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I used to lock up every night. So
dialog: one time I brought my girlfriend
dialog: here and we had a bottle of wine,
dialog: and, you know, one thing led to
dialog: another. It wasn't very
dialog: comfortable.
text: Henry laughs and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I never had a shrink tell me
dialog: something like that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (looking up at the
dialog: artworks)
dialog: They still have the same bad art on
text: the walls.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (looking at the art)
dialog: Tristan Réveur used to say that bad
dialog: art is more tragically beautiful
dialog: than good art, because bad art
dialog: documents human failure.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know about this Tristan
dialog: Réveur guy. I think you ought to
dialog: choose your role models a little
dialog: more carefully.
dialog: (beat; very sober now)
dialog: You do understand that I'm required
dialog: by law to report anyone who
text: physically threatens himself or
dialog: others?
text: Henry laughs.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: What's funny?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You take all this so seriously.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Should I not take it seriously? Is
dialog: that what you're telling me? Is
dialog: this a joke?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm not talking about Saturday. I
dialog: am going to die on Saturday. I just
dialog: mean your role. The psychiatrist.
dialog: You play it well.
text: Sam considers this for a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why do you think I'm playing a
dialog: role?
text: Henry smiles but does not answer.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you playing a role? The
dialog: Suicidal Romantic? why'd you choose
dialog: that role? Why do you want to die?
text: The smile disappears from Henry's face. He rubs his palm over
text: the burns on his forearm.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't want to keep hurting
dialog: people.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who did you hurt?
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't know.
text: Henry is becoming more and more distraught. He stares at the
text: floor, picks at his fingernails. But Sam won't let it rest --
text: he knows he's on to something important.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Have you done something, Henry?
dialog: You've hurt someone?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't know. Maybe.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You do know. What have you done?
text: Henry, still staring at the floor, begins to shake his head
dialog: violently.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that why you're thinking about
dialog: suicide? Is that it? You need to
dialog: punish yourself? What happened?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I don't remember.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't want to remember. But you
dialog: have to. You can't escape from the
dialog: truth. Whatever it is you've done,
dialog: you have to face it.
text: Suddenly Henry stops shaking his head and looks straight at
text: Sam, a strange smile on his face.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: If I can't escape from the truth
dialog: we're all in serious trouble, Dr.
dialog: Foster.
scene_heading: EXT. HAMILTON LAWN -- COLUMBIA CAMPUS -- AFTERNOON
text: Sam and DR. LEON PATTERSON, a middle-aged blind man wearing
text: dark glasses, sit on folding chairs, facing each other over a
text: fold-away chess table.
text: A small radio on the grass plays Billy Holiday. Sam moves his
dialog: queen.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Queen to g4.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Billy Holiday. I remember her
dialog: singing at the Five Spot, years
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I wish I could have heard her
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Yes. Well, I wish I could have seen
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Here, I want to show you something.
dialog: Give me your hand.
text: Sam pulls a small, pale-blue Tiffany's box from his blazer
text: pocket, opens it, pulls out a diamond ring and hands it to
dialog: Leon.
text: Leon rotates the ring between his fingers and rubs the stone.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: It's certainly a very hard diamond.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's what I asked for. I said,
dialog: "Give me the hardest diamond you've
dialog: got."
text: Leon hands the ring back to Sam and then claps him on the
dialog: shoulder.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Congratulations, Sam. I'm very
dialog: happy for you. Does she know?
text: Sam returns the ring to his blazer pocket.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Not yet. I want the mood to be
dialog: right before I propose. The last
dialog: few days... I'm having a hard time
text: with one of Beth Levy's patients.
dialog: He wants to kill himself Saturday
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Henry Letham.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (surprised)
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Beth told me about him. He's been
dialog: planning this suicide for quite
dialog: some time. The good news is, he's
dialog: still meeting with you. He's
text: looking for help.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You've been shrinking heads for
dialog: thirty years. I figured you could
dialog: give me some ideas.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Knight to c3. Check.
text: Sam moves Leon's knight for him and studies the chess board.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you remember the dream of the
dialog: burning boy that Freud refers to?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Vaguely.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Vaguely meaning no?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: LEON
text: He describes a man whose child is
text: dying. The father sits by the boy's
text: bed, night after night, mopping the
text: sweat from the boy's forehead
text: bringing him water to drink. All
text: for nothing. After the child dies,
text: they give him a wake, set up a
text: circle of candles around his body.
text: The father is exhausted, of course.
text: He goes to sleep in the next room.
dialog: And he dreams that his boy stands
text: beside him, holding his arm and
dialog: whispering, "Father, can't you see
dialog: that I'm burning?" When the man
text: wakes up he runs into the next room
text: and sees that one of the candles
text: has fallen onto the shroud and set
text: the dead boy on fire.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He noticed the heat or the light
text: and his unconscious figured out a
dialog: fire had started.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Probably. That's the logical
dialog: explanation. But what's
dialog: interesting, what interested Freud,
dialog: is the way the father's unconscious
dialog: dealt with that knowledge. Some
dialog: part of him knew that a fire had
dialog: started, but rather than waking
dialog: immediately he created a dream-
dialog: version of his child, to act asa
dialog: messenger.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He wanted his boy alive again. The
dialog: fire could wait a moment, he wanted
dialog: his boy to stay with him. what made
dialog: you think of it?
text: Leon smiles, tapping his cane on the floor in time with the
dialog: beat.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I never stop thinking about it. I
dialog: heard that story fifty years ago
dialog: and I still can't get it out of my
dialog: mind. Our imagination wants to
dialog: protect us from everything.
text: A shadow falls over the chess board and Sam turns around.
text: Henry stands behind him, staring at Leon. Henry's face is
text: even paler than usual, his eyes wide in disbelief.
text: Sam stands and grips Henry's shoulder.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Henry! Didn't expect to see you. Do
dialog: you know Doctor Patterson?
text: Leon rises from his chair and extends his hand in Henry's
dialog: direction.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Hello, Henry.
text: Henry ignores the offered hand. He can't take his eyes off
text: the old man's face.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Leon, in a dazed
dialog: whisper )
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: Leon is confused, unsure whether he's being spoken to or not.
text: He withdraws his extended hand.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You're dead.
text: Leon is puzzled for a moment but smiles.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Not yet, I'm happy to say. Dr.
dialog: Foster, I'll leave you two in
dialog: peace. We'll finish the game later
dialog: yes?
text: Leon walks away, tapping the ground before him with his cane.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you all right? Here, take a
dialog: seat.
text: Henry remains standing. He watches Leon disappear around a
text: corner before turning on Sam.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You're playing games with me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: Nobody's playing games.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (furious)
dialog: Why did you bring him here? Are you

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Henry- -
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What are you doing to me?

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I know my father.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Listen--
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You think I wouldn't recognize my
dialog: own father?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I thought you told me your father
dialog: was dead.
speaker_heading: HENRY
text: He is dead. He died and they buried
dialog: him and that was him sitting here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Henry, think about it for a minute.
text: Dr. Patterson is alive and well.
text: Henry doesn't say anything for a while. He rubs his scarred

text: them, the buildings and trees and students:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Everything you believe is a lie.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then tell me the truth.
text: Henry closes his eyes for a moment.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Your troubles will cease and

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where did that come from?

scene_heading: EXT. CORNING DORMITORY -- LATER

text: in one corner and a chair by the window.
text: A phone and answering machine are on the chair.
text: Every inch of the walls and ceiling is covered with minuscule
text: handwriting, an endless loop of black ink. Sam steps closer
text: to the wall and examines it.
text: The phrase FORGIVE ME repeated again and again and again.
dialog: 40.
text: The paramedics exchange glances. Dr. Schlegel studies the
text: handwriting carefully. Something on the floor catches his eye
text: and he stoops to pick it up.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Trouble.
text: Dr. Schlegel hands a small box to Sam.
scene_heading: INSERT EMPTY BOX OF .38 CALIBER CARTRIDGES
text: Sam walks over to the answering machine.
scene_heading: INSERT PHONE MACHINE
text: The number 1 is flashing in the LED display.
text: Sam looks at Dr. Schlegel, who nods. Sam pushes the play
dialog: button.
text: For a moment there is nothing but static. In the background
text: we hear a murmur of voices and distant sirens. After a few
text: seconds of this a female voice:
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE
dialog: Stay Henry stay stay stay Henry
dialog: stay stay stay Henry stay stay stay
dialog: Henry stay stay stay Henry stay
dialog: stay stay Henry stay stay stay
dialog: Henry stay.
scene_heading: EXT. DORMITORY
text: Sam and Dr. Schlegel stand alone on the steps while the
text: paramedics stand in front of the ambulance, smoking
text: cigarettes and watching the COLLEGE GIRLS stroll by.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Now what?
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Not much we can do at this point.
dialog: We don't have the manpower for a
dialog: stakeout or anything like that.
dialog: I'll notify the police but they
dialog: won't do anything.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 41.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Because they're New York City cops,
dialog: that's why not. They've got more
dialog: important things to do than look
dialog: for depressed college students.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then I'll find him.
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Okay. If you spot him, give me a
dialog: call and we'll pick him up for you.
dialog: But do me a favor, Sam?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What's that?
scene_heading: DR. SCHLEGEL
dialog: Be careful. A guy this far gone's
dialog: got nothing to lose.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DRIVER'S POV
text: We're on the ramp leading up to the Brooklyn Bridge. The
text: Gothic towers, massive and imposing, rise above us. It's
text: late, traffic is light, and we're moving fast
scene_heading: INT. CATHEDRAL OF ST. JOHN THE DIVINE -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: Henry sits, head bowed, eyes closed, in a forward pew of the
text: enormous cathedral. An enthusiastic blonde TOUR GUIDE is
text: leading a group of Midwestern TOURISTS up the nave, pointing
text: out the sights.
speaker_heading: TOUR GUIDE
text: The largest stained glass window,
text: above the entry-way -- looks like a
dialog: kaleidoscope, doesn't it? --
dialog: contains over three thousand
text: separate pieces of glass. Some of
dialog: the best craftsmen from around the
dialog: world have worked on the Cathedral
dialog: of St. John the Divine, but it's a
dialog: long way from finished. It won't be
dialog: complete for at least another
dialog: century.
text: The tour group exits the cathedral, leaving Henry alone in
text: the building. He raises his head toward the ceiling.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: HENRY'S POV
text: The roof of the cathedral is so high, and the lighting so
text: poor, that it's impossible to see the ceiling.
text: From somewhere inside the building a BABY'S howl echoes.
text: Henry looks around, wondering where the sound is coming from.
text: He gets up and begins to follow the noise.
text: Everywhere he goes statues of the saints stare down at him,
text: unsmiling.
text: No matter where he stands, the baby's howl seems just as far
text: away. He walks up the nave, toward the entrance.
text: The cathedral is very dark, the nave very long. His footsteps
text: echo off the stone walls. Finally he reaches daylight and
dialog: exits.
scene_heading: EXT. CATHEDRAL
text: Henry examines the hallucinogenic peace fountain on the
text: cathedral's grounds. Saint Michael, winged and victorious and
text: sword-wielding, has just decapitated Satan, whose headless
text: body is plunging into the abyss.
text: Henry walks over to the fenced-off garden behind the Peace
text: Fountain. The one PEACOCK in Manhattan lives in this garden.
text: Henry, behind the fence, watches it strutting about, fanning
text: its gorgeous array of feathers.
speaker_heading: BOY (0.S.)
dialog: Mommy, is that man going to die?
text: Henry wheels about. The small BOY we last saw holding a red'
text: balloon stands a few yards away, holding his MOTHER'S hand.
text: He has a new red balloon.
text: Both mother and child stare at Henry. Finally the mother tugs
text: her son away, but the child continues to stare over his
text: shoulder at Henry.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Sam sits at the kitchen table. The documents, from Henry's
dialog: folder are spread out before him: transcripts, application
dialog: materials, etc.
dialog: 43.
text: Sam studies a passport photograph of Henry for a moment then
text: continues to sift through the material while Lila, sitting on
text: the opposite side of the table, eats take-out Chinese food.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (examining a memo)
dialog: He refused to take the mandatory
dialog: swim test. Maybe he's afraid of
dialog: water.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (chewing)
dialog: Mm.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Citations for Studio Art.
dialog: Apparently he's an accomplished
dialog: painter.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Did you ever hear from Beth Levy?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. Listen to this: "Of all the
dialog: students I have encountered at
dialog: Columbia, Henry Letham has the most
dialog: fertile imagination. If he
dialog: maintains his concentration he will
dialog: create new worlds with his art."
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Clearly that professor wants to
dialog: fuck Henry Letham.
text: Sam, still paging through the documents, laughs.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There's the graduate student
dialog: cynicism I know and love.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: What exactly are you doing, baby?
text: Sam looks up at her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You're letting this kid take over
dialog: your life. It's not your job to
dialog: track down missing students.
dialog: 44.
text: Sam is quiet for a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Whose job is it?
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I just don't think it's healthy to
dialog: be so obsessed with one patient.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think it's healthy, either.
dialog: But if I don't help him, no one
dialog: else will. He's alone in the world.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Maybe you're right. Maybe I ama
dialog: cynic. But it seems to me that he's
dialog: using you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You want your fortune cookie?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's all yours.
text: Lila cracks open the cookie and pulls out the fortune.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: (reading)
dialog: "Your troubles will cease and
dialog: fortune will smile upon you."
text: Sam slowly looks up at her. All the color has drained from
text: his face.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: And not a moment too soon, that's
dialog: all I can say.
dialog: (noticing Sam's
dialog: expression)
dialog: What's the matter, baby? Sam?
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Sam stands outside an apartment door, holding the Henry
text: Letham folder. He rings the doorbell. No answer. He rings
text: again. He bangs on the door. No answer.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: Beth?
text: Finally the door opens, still chained.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (quieter)
dialog: Beth? It's Sam. Are you okay?
text: DR. BETH LEVY unchains the door and walks back into the
text: apartment. Frizz-haired and overweight, Beth looks bad. She
text: obviously hasn't showered in days, or changed her clothes.
scene_heading: INT. BETH'S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sam follows her inside, closing the door behind him. The only
text: light in the apartment is from the streetlights.
text: Beth sits on the floor, her back against a sofa.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How you feeling? I'm sorry, I
dialog: should have come earlier
text: Beth is not paying any attention to him. Sam sits down a few
text: feet away from her.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Beth?
dialog: (forcing a laugh)
dialog: They've got you doped up on some
dialog: serious painkillers, huh? what are
dialog: you on, Vicodin? Percoset?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: There was no surgery.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you mean? The appendectomy- -
dialog: they decided not to operate?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I made it up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You... why?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Do you want to play? Can we play a
dialog: kissing game?
text: She begins crawling toward him on her hands and knees.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT' D)
dialog: I always wanted to kiss you. Let's
dialog: play a kissing game. Okay?
dialog: 46.
text: Sam holds up his hands.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Beth...
text: She stops abruptly and sinks back on her haunches.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, I'm too old for you. I'm too
dialog: fat. You like them young and
dialog: skinny, don't you? Like that little
dialog: slut you live with.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Stop.
text: Beth's face seems on the verge of collapse.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don't hate me, Sam. Please don't
dialog: hate me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How could I hate you?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Not that it matters. Not that any
dialog: of it matters.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This has something to do with Henry
dialog: Letham.
text: Beth laughs very hard. It is not a pleasant sound.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Oh, yes, yes, it does! Hurrah, you
dialog: win! It does have something to do
dialog: with Henry Letham. You win the
dialog: grand prize. Very good, very good,
dialog: ten points. Thank you for playing,
dialog: Henry.
text: Sam cocks his head and looks at her more closely.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's Sam.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I remember you. Sad, sad Sam.
dialog: Henry's got quite an imagination
dialog: doesn't he? I remember you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: BETH(cont 'd)
dialog: I remember cleaning your bathroom
text: floor, on my hands and knees
text: between the tiles, behind the sink
dialog: everywhere.
text: Sam is speechless for a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That was twenty years ago. What
dialog: does that have to do with Henry?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Everything has to do with Henry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You know he's planning to kill
dialog: himself this weekend?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No more Mondays, anyway. That's the
dialog: good news. I never liked Mondays.
dialog: We played make-believe. Didn't we?
dialog: We played make-believe for so many
dialog: years. Except it wasn't us playing.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you know where I can find him?
dialog: Beth?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Ask his mother.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: His mother? His mother's dead.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Ask her anyway.
scene_heading: INT. BETH'S BEDROOM -- LATER
text: Sam has managed to get Beth into bed. She sleeps now while
text: Sam sits at the foot of the bed, looking through papers from
text: Henry's folder.
text: He dials a number on his CELL PHONE.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hello? Yes,. I'm sorry to bother
dialog: you at this hour. My name is Dr
dialog: Sam Foster, I'm a psychiatrist at
dialog: Columbia University. Yes. I'm
dialog: calling about a student named Henry
dialog: Letham.
dialog: 48.
text: Sam listens.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: He's your son? He... I'm sorry,
dialog: this is very strange. He told me
dialog: you had died... Hello? Hello?
text: Sam stares at the cell phone. He dials the number again and
text: listens. Nobody answers.
speaker_heading: BETH (0.S.)
dialog: You have no idea what's going on
dialog: do you?
text: Sam turns and sees Beth sitting up in bed, watching him. She
text: is calmer now, but her eyes are still bloodshot and wild.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He lied to me.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Trust me, Sam-- the truth is worse
dialog: than the lie.
scene_heading: EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE -- NIGHT
text: We watch the battered old Volvo glide over the Hudson
text: beneath the lighted suspension cables.
scene_heading: EXT. SUBURBAN ROAD -- NIGHT
text: Sam drives down dark New Jersey back roads.
text: He pull into the driveway of a small, rundown house. No
text: lights are on inside.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S VOLVO -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sam checks the address on the form in Henry's folder. He
text: looks up, sees 9625 on the mailbox. He parks the car.
scene_heading: EXT. LETHAM HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sam gets out of the car and walks to the doorstep. The house
text: is dark. Sam rings the doorbell. No answer. He rings again.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM (0.S.)
dialog: I've been waiting for you.
dialog: 49.
text: Sam spins around. MRS. LETHAM sits in the darkness on a porch
text: swing. She wears a silk kerchief around her head, the kind
dialog: that chemotherapy patients sometimes wear
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mrs. Letham? I'm Dr. Sam Foster. I
dialog: called before?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Sorry to bother you at this hour,
dialog: but it's an emergency.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: I thought you'd never come visit.
text: She stands and approaches Sam. She has a limp. She's a kind-
text: looking woman, but weary, with dark circles below her blue
text: eyes and wisps of gray hair straying out from under the
dialog: kerchief.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I would have called earlier
dialog: except... to be honest, I didn't
dialog: even know you were alive.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: I guess it's easy to forget me, all
dialog: alone out here in the country.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Your son's not well.. That's what
dialog: I'm here about. I'm trying to find
dialog: him. He's... he's threatened
dialog: suicide.
text: Mrs. Letham laughs but the laugh turns into a cough.
text: limps to the front door.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: I know why you came. Not because of
dialog: me. You came to see Olive, didn't
dialog: you?
text: Sam frowns.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Olive?
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: I know you did.
dialog: She
text: She opens the door, flicks on a light and leads him inside.
text: In the light we can see that Mrs. Letham has a wine-stain
text: birthmark on her left cheek.
dialog: 50.
scene_heading: INT. LETHAM FOYER -- CONTINUOUS
text: The house is immaculate. The windows are spotless; the
text: chandelier by the staircase glitters; the hardwood floor is
text: polished and gleaming.
text: But there is no furniture to be seen anywhere. Sam and Mrs.
text: Letham's footsteps echo in the empty house.
text: A black Neapolitan MASTIFF pads into the room and stares at
text: the newcomer. The dog is massive, at least 160 pounds
text: slobber-jawed, its black eyes tiny in its huge head.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: Here she is. She's been lonely. Me
text: and Olive keep each other company.
text: It feels like we've been alone in
dialog: this house for a thousand years.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey, Olive. How you doing, girl?
text: The mastiff stares at him impassively.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: She doesn't remember you anymore,
dialog: you've been away so long.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let me fix you something to eat. I
dialog: have some leftovers in the fridge.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No thank you, I ate. Do you know
dialog: how to contact your son? Any
dialog: friends or relatives he might have
dialog: gone to see?
text: But Mrs. Letham limps into the kitchen anyway and Sam is
text: forced to follow her. Olive pads in after them.
scene_heading: INT. LETHAM KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS
text: The kitchen shines like the rest of the house. Someone has
text: spent hours scrubbing every surface until it gleams.
text: Mrs. Letham opens the refrigerator and looks through it.
dialog: 51.
text: The refrigerator is empty.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: Most days I don't say a single
dialog: word. I'm silent so long sometimes
dialog: I forget how to speak. It's so
dialog: quiet here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mrs. Letham, we have an emergency.
text: Henry's in danger.
text: Suddenly, Mrs. Letham seems close to tears. She closes the
text: refrigerator and looks at Sam.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: Do you hate me? You must hate me.
dialog: Is that why you did it? Because you
dialog: hate me?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't hate you at all. Your son
dialog: needs help. That's why I'm here.
text: Mrs. Letham smiles and takes Sam's hand.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: I knew you'd come back, eventually.
dialog: It was so quiet without you, so
dialog: lonely. But now you've come back
dialog: and you're never going to leave.
text: Sam is quiet for a moment, searching Mrs. Letham's smiling
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who do you think I am, Mrs. Letham?
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: Don't play these games anymore. Not
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Who am I?
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: You think I don't know you, Henry?
dialog: You think I don't recognize my only
dialog: son?
text: Mrs. Letham wraps her arms around Sam and squeezes him to
dialog: her.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Lord, I missed you. I missed you
dialog: so much. I could never stay angry
dialog: at you. I know you didn't mean to
dialog: hurt me.
text: Sam nods. He speaks very quietly, very carefully. They are
text: still locked in an embrace.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mom?
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: Yes, baby?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How did I hurt you?
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: It doesn't matter anymore. Let's
dialog: not talk about it, please.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where do I go on the weekends?
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: You go the city. You've been going
dialog: to the city since you were old
dialog: enough to take the train.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And where do I go in the city?
text: Abruptly, Mrs. Letham goes cool. She breaks off the hug.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: You used to go to your classes
dialog: before you met Athena.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Athena?
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: (increasingly angry)
dialog: Now you might not even graduate,
dialog: your grades are so bad.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you remember where Athena lives?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: Athena this, Athena that, always
dialog: Athena, beautiful Athena. I'm sick
dialog: of Athena! I'm sick of her!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mrs. Letham--
text: Sam abruptly stops talking, seeing what we now see. Blood
text: trickles down the side of Mrs. Letham's face, leaking from
text: underneath her kerchief.
text: A large drop of the blood falls and splatters on the white-
text: tiled floor.
text: Mrs. Letham sees the blood and grabs a sponge from the sink.
text: She drops to her knees and begins violently scrubbing at the
text: spot on the floor.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: How could you? Your own mother, how
dialog: could you?
text: Meanwhile the blood is beginning to stream down her face. She
text: scrubs ferociously but more and more blood spatters on the
dialog: tiles.
text: Sam kneels beside her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let me look at your head.
text: When he reaches for her kerchief she slaps away his hand and
text: snarls.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM
dialog: You did this!
text: Olive leaps upon Henry, knocking him to the floor, biting
text: viciously at his face and throat.
text: Sam desperately holds the mastiff off, the slobbering jaws
text: inches from his jugular.
text: Mrs. Letham watches for a few seconds before speaking.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Olive! Off!
text: Upon her command the mastiff immediately disengages and
text: retreats. Sam bleeds from the hands, neck, and face.
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: MRS. LETHAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You better leave, Henry. You're not
dialog: welcome anymore.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-- EARLY MORNING
dialog: Saturday
text: Sam sits while an INTERN finishes sewing up the gash on his
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: The Percoset will make you a little
dialog: drowsy, so--
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know.
text: SHERIFF KENNELLY knocks on the open door and peeks in.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Dr. Foster? I'm Sheriff Kennelly.
dialog: Could I have a word with you, sir?
text: The intern drops the needle into the biohazard waste
text: receptacle and exits the room.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (CONT'D)
dialog: You got bit up pretty good. Got
dialog: your rabies shot already?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes.
text: Sheriff Kennelly pages through a notebook.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Now, I've been looking through the
dialog: report Deputy Carlyle gave me. And
dialog: I just wanted to check on
dialog: something. You said the assault
dialog: took place at 9625 Rickover Street?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Home belonging to the Letham
dialog: family.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Right, her dog attacked me. She's--
dialog: Mrs. Letham-- she's very sick right
dialog: now. She's had some sort of head
text: trauma, and she's showing signs of
dialog: schizophrenic paranoia. She's all
text: alone and she needs help. She
dialog: should be in a hospital.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: The thing is, Doctor, I knew
dialog: Maureen Letham. I went to high
text: school with her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh. Okay, well maybe you know her
dialog: son, then. Henry. He's a patient of
dialog: mine at Columbia University. That's
dialog: why I visited her.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Sure, I remember Henry. Pale,
dialog: skinny kid. Always reading.
dialog: (laughing uncomfortably)
dialog: Kind of gave me the creeps.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's him.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: What's strange, Doctor, what I'm
dialog: trying to figure out, is who you
dialog: were speaking with over at 9625
dialog: Rickover Street.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry, I thought we already
dialog: established that. Maureen Letham.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: There's a basic problem here I'm
dialog: trying to work out. See, I
dialog: mentioned I went to high school
dialog: with Maureen Letham. I also went to
dialog: her funeral. She's been dead for
dialog: six months.
text: Sam stares at the sheriff, dumbfounded.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF (CONT'D)
text: Car wreck. Her and her husband. As
dialog: far as I know, that house is empty
dialog: still. The family's trying to sell
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I was talking to Maureen Letham
dialog: last night. We were talking about
dialog: her son.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Well, it's probably just someone's
dialog: confused. How long they keeping you
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've got to head back to the city
dialog: as soon as possible. Listen, 9625
dialog: Rickover Street: I was there.
dialog: Henry's mother was there.
text: The sheriff stares at Sam. Finally he nods and stuffs his
text: notebook into his jacket pocket.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: All right, Dr. Foster, we'll be in
dialog: touch. I've got your number
text: The sheriff turns to leave. When he's halfway down the
text: corridor, Sam calls out to him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sheriff?
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Yep?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Maureen Letham. Did she have a
dialog: birthmark right here?
text: Sam points to his left cheek. The sheriff squints at Sam.
speaker_heading: SHERIFF
dialog: Yes sir, she did.
scene_heading: EXT. WEST 44TH STREET -- NIGHT
text: Henry walks down one of the few blocks near Times Square that
text: still looks like the old Times Square: erotic bookshops, peep
dialog: shows, adult theaters.
dialog: 57.
text: Everyone else on the street is dressed for the cold night,
text: but Henry still wears the same T-shirt he's had on all day.
text: He doesn't seem to notice the cold.
text: He looks up at the marquee of a porn movie theater. INT.
scene_heading: PORNO THEATER -- NIGHT
text: He walks down the aisle and finds a seat in the front row. We
text: hear the soundtrack: the usual moans and gasps over the usual
text: cheesy music.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HENRY
text: We watch Henry's face bathe in the flickering light from the
dialog: screen.
text: Henry looks weary. His hair lies flat and wet across his
text: scalp. Now, below the synthesized music and the grunting we
text: hear a low and distant thump.
text: The thump slowly gets louder-- it's a heartbeat. Louder and
text: louder until all other sound is masked.
text: Finally we see the screen. A FETUS curled up within its
text: mother's womb, silently swimming in the amniotic fluid.
text: We pull back to see the other viewers in the theater. Many of
text: them are asleep, street people who went inside to escape the
dialog: cold.
text: Those still awake stare at the screen as if nothing strange
text: were happening. A grizzled old VETERAN in an army jacket. Two
text: TEENS from the suburbs, wearing their varsity jackets. An
text: OBESE MAN, peering through coke-bottle lenses.
text: And we go back to Henry, who sits silently watching the
dialog: screen.
text: Back on screen, a montage of a life in the form of brief
text: clips from what could have been home movies.
text: A hospital nurse presents the baby boy to his mother. The boy
text: rattles the bars of his crib. The boy takes his first steps.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Stop.
text: In each new image the boy is slightly older. Sledding down a
text: snowy hill. Blowing out candles on a cake.
text: Henry turns to look at the projector, lighting the screen
text: with its story.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Please stop it.
text: On screen: the boy raising his hand in class. Down by the
text: shore, throwing a tennis ball for Olive (the mastiff looks
dialog: exactly like she did when we first saw her). Kissing a girl
text: for the first time (judging from his closed eyes and hesitant
text: pucker). Reading a novel. Stealing second base. Drinking
text: whiskey with his friends.
text: Henry, tormented by what he sees on screen, keeps looking
text: back at the projector's white light.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop! Stop! Turn it off!
text: On screen: the boy smoking a cigarette (and now, if we
dialog: haven't before, we recognize that it's a younger Henry on
text: screen). Arriving for his first day of freshman year at
text: Columbia. Shooting pool with friends in a smoky bar. Sitting
text: in the bleachers cheering for the New York Yankees.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: (beginning to sob)
dialog: Stop! Stop!
text: Walking down Broadway with the GREEN-EYED WOMAN, whom we
text: recognize from the driver's POV sequences.
text: Driving across the Brooklyn Bridge with the green-eyed woman
text: and two passengers in back whose faces we can't make out.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT' D)
dialog: (sobbing; barely able to
dialog: speak)
dialog: Stop... stop...
text: A terrible noise fills the theater-- steel colliding with
text: steel at high speed. The screen goes black.
text: Henry bolts up from his seat and runs from the theater.
text: After a few seconds, two words appear on the bottom of the
text: screen, a subtitle.
scene_heading: FORGIVE ME.
text: The subtitle does not fade away. The men in the theater stare
text: at the screen. Nobody says a word.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: EXT. TWELFTH STREET -- DAWN
text: Sam parks his car down the block from his building and walks
text: toward home. Halfway there he stops to watch piano movers at
text: work across the street.
text: They are the same piano movers we saw before, and they seem
text: to be hauling the same piano into the same apartment
speaker_heading: PIANO MOVER 1
dialog: Easy, easy.
text: Sam stops in his tracks. He has been here before.
text: A small boy, accompanied by his mother, runs down the street
text: holding a red balloon. He trips and falls and the balloon
text: begins to float away.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Wait! Wait!
text: The workmen hear the boy's cries and see the balloon. Piano
text: Mover 1 makes a valiant effort to capture the escaping
text: balloon: he runs after it and leaps... but he can't quite
dialog: reach it.
text: Sam stares at the rising balloon in disbelief.
speaker_heading: PIANO MOVER 1
dialog: Sorry, kid. It's gone to balloon
dialog: heaven.
text: Everything but the time of day is the same: the cars in the
text: street, the kid's crestfallen expression, the red balloon
text: disappearing into the gray sky.
text: Sam runs across the street and confronts Piano Mover 1.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You were here on Thursday. You were
dialog: moving this piano on Thursday, too.
text: The man is engaged in the difficult business of hoisting a
text: piano into a fourth-floor apartment and doesn't have time for
dialog: this kind of banter.
text: He looks briefly at Sam and then back to the Bechstein.
speaker_heading: PIANO MOVER 1
dialog: Can I help you with something, pal?
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That kid with the balloon, the
dialog: exact same thing happened on
dialog: Thursday.
speaker_heading: PIANO MOVER 1
dialog: We're a little busy here. why don't
dialog: you go bother someone else?
text: Sam watches the workmen on the fourth floor ease the piano
dialog: into position.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT -- MORNING
text: Sam staggers in the front door, exhausted. Lila comes out of
text: the bedroom. She stops in her tracks when she sees him, all
text: bandaged and battered, then hurries over to him.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: What happened to you?
text: Sam shakes his head. How can he possibly explain what has
text: happened to him? He limps toward the bedroom. Lila,
text: nonplussed, follows after him.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I was calling people all over the
dialog: city looking for you. I was about
dialog: to call the police.
text: Sam checks the clock: 8:12 a.m. He begins to undress, pulling
text: off his sweater.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: What's going on, Sam?
text: Sam sits on the edge of the bed, considering the question.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I don't know? You run out in the
dialog: middle of the night and don't come
dialog: back until eight in the morning, no
dialog: phone call, no explanation, looking
dialog: like someone tried to murder you?
dialog: Don't tell me I don't know.
dialog: 61.
text: Sam lies down on the bed, his clothes half-removed. He's too
text: exhausted to have a real conversation, too bewildered by the
text: events of the last few hours, too numbed from the Percoset.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You want a better answer, ask
text: someone else.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Lila, I'm seeing things that don't
dialog: make any sense. Okay? I'm meeting
dialog: people that are supposed to be
dialog: dead,. Beth Levy's had a nervous
dialog: breakdown and this kid I'm supposed
dialog: to be treating knows what's going
dialog: to happen before it happens.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You were at Beth Levy's all night?
text: Sam groans.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're losing me, Sam. I swear to
dialog: God, you're starting to lose me.
text: Sam grunts, already half-asleep.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: (heavy sarcasm)
dialog: I'm glad we had this conversation.
dialog: I think we really cleared the air
dialog: on some important issues.
dialog: (jangling the car keys)
dialog: I'm going to the library.
speaker_heading: SAM'S FIRST DREAM
text: The screen goes black. And then bright white. The white
text: gradually resolves and we see that we're staring into the
text: glare of a small flashlight.
text: The flashlight disappears and Sam's face replaces it, Sam's
text: face looming large, staring directly into the camera.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Can you hear me, Henry? Henry? I'm
dialog: a doctor, I'm going to help you.
dialog: Can you hear me?
dialog: 62.
scene_heading: END OF SAM'S FIRST DREAM
text: Sam opens his eyes. He's lying on his bed, still half-
text: clothed. He looks at the clock. 3 p.m. He sits straight up.
text: He's running out of time.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON
text: Sam prepares to leave, after having showered and changed
dialog: clothes (though he still wears the sweater he always wears)
text: He looks at himself in the foyer mirror. His eyes are
dialog: haunted.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON
text: Sam pushes the elevator button and waits. The door slides
dialog: open.
text: Henry stands there. He slept on the street and it shows. Sam
text: stumbles backward.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jesus Christ.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What are you doing here? How did
dialog: you know where I live?
text: The doors start to slide shut and Sam gets into the elevator.
text: They descend.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I've been looking all over for you.
dialog: I saw your mother last night.
text: Henry seems uninterested.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You told me she was dead.
text: Henry stares at Sam, never blinking.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone seems to think your
dialog: mother's dead. But I was standing
text: in her kitchen talking to her.
text: Sam indicates the bandages on his neck.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I met Olive.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Olive's dead, too. We put her to
dialog: sleep when I was twelve. She had a
text: tumor in her liver.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Olive's not dead. She is very much
dialog: not dead.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: She was a good girl. She used to
dialog: kill the rabbits.
text: Sam grabs Henry and presses him against the wall of the
dialog: elevator.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Quit playing with me.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (with mock surprise)
dialog: Doctor Foster!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I want to know what's going on. How
dialog: do you know the future?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I make it up.
text: The door opens onto the seventh-floor. A MUSLIM WOMAN in full
text: veil looks into the elevator. Sam releases Henry. The woman
text: decides not to get in.
text: Everyone is silent until the doors slide shut again.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Ever since I met you impossible
dialog: things have been happening. I'm
dialog: trying to help you but it feels
dialog: like I'm losing my mind.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What happened to your parents?
text: Henry shrugs.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: There's something you want to tell
dialog: me. Why can't you admit that? If
dialog: you just wanted to kill yourself,
dialog: you'd have already done it. So why
dialog: don't you? Why do you keep coming
dialog: to me?
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Because you're the only one who can
dialog: help me.
text: Henry looks down at the cigarette burns marking his forearms.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to know why I keep burning
dialog: my, arms?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I want to see if I'll feel any
dialog: pain.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Nothing.
text: Sam looks up at the floor indicator lights. Henry looks up as
dialog: well. 3...2...1.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS
text: They exit the elevator in the lobby and stand in front of a
text: mirrored wall.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I showed you my scars. Now let's
dialog: see yours.
text: Sam frowns and touches the bandage on his neck but Henry
text: shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: No, your old scars.
text: Sam is silent.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, don't be shy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How do you know about that?
text: Henry says nothing. Finally Sam rolls up the cuffs of his
text: shirt. He holds his arms in front of him, palms up.
dialog: 65.
text: Three narrow scars carve up each wrist. Henry looks at them
text: for a moment and then Sam rolls the cuffs back and buttons
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: First year of medical school. I
dialog: read somewhere you're supposed to
dialog: do it in warm water, to make the
dialog: blood flow quicker. I was always a
dialog: good reader. So I filled the tub
dialog: and I cut my wrists and I waited.
dialog: Beth Levy found me. She was in the
text: room across the hall, she came over
dialog: to borrow a textbook. She dragged
dialog: me out of the bath and she put
text: tourniquets on my arms and she
dialog: called an ambulance. I'd lost six
text: pints of blood by then, but they
dialog: saved me. They sewed me up and I
dialog: was good as new.
text: For the first time, Sam has Henry's complete attention. The
text: young man stares intently at Sam, waiting for the rest.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I was in the hospital two weeks.
dialog: Beth came in every night and sat
dialog: with me for a few hours. She was my
dialog: only visitor. I didn't feel like
dialog: talking. Not to Beth, not to
text: anyone. So she didn't talk. She sat
text: in the corner of the room,
dialog: knitting. Beth's not a natural with
dialog: the knitting needles. I mean, she's
dialog: maybe the smartest human being I've
dialog: ever met, but this was not one of
dialog: her skills. She never stopped
dialog: though. She'd screw up all the
dialog: time, she'd have to unravel the
dialog: whole night's work, but she never
dialog: stopped. Do you know how good it
dialog: felt to have her in there? Not
dialog: talking, not giving me advice, not
dialog: doing anything but being there with
dialog: me.
text: Henry looks at Sam's navy-blue cable-knit sweater.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: The sweater you always wear
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: The morning the hospital released
dialog: me, she came to give me a ride
dialog: home. She looked exhausted. I guess
dialog: she stayed up the whole night. She
dialog: handed me the sweater and said, "Ta-
dialog: da! Finished!" I tried it on and it
dialog: fit, perfectly. And she said-
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: "It's cold outside, Sam."
text: Sam stares at Henry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She told you the story?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Maybe I told her the story.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What the hell does that mean?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You're leaving something out
dialog: aren't you? You never told me why.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why I slit my wrists?
text: Sam thinks about it for a moment and then shrugs.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought everything was a lie. The
dialog: whole world was a lie.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What if it is?
text: Sam shrugs again.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What if it is? It's not worth dying
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Why not? Why live if everything you
dialog: believe turns out to be a lie?
dialog: 67.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Because it's a beautiful lie.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And I want to see what comes next.
text: Henry shakes his head.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: No. You don't.
text: He starts to leave but Sam grabs him by the arm.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can't let you go, Henry. I'm
dialog: taking you to the hospital.
text: Sam begins leading Henry out the door.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Get your hands off me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I can't do that.
text: Henry pulls a revolver from his waistband (the bulk of it had
text: been hidden below his T-shirt). He presses the muzzle against
text: Sam's neck.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I think you can.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let me help you, Henry. Let me try.
text: Henry says nothing but Sam sees the look in his eyes and
text: releases his arm.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You want to know what happened to
dialog: my parents? I killed them. I killed
dialog: my mother, I killed my father.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm going to Hell.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't believe in Hell.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: But I do, Dr. Foster. I think we're
text: already there.
text: Henry walks out the building's front door.
dialog: 68.
text: Sam takes a deep breath. He stares at his reflection in the
text: mirrored wall.
text: After another moment he steels himself and walks out the
dialog: door.
scene_heading: EXT. MORNINGSIDE HEIGHTS -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Henry- -
text: But Henry is nowhere in sight. Sam looks around, trying to
text: spot him, but he's gone.
text: A taxi waits at a red light. Sam runs over to it and climbs
text: into the backseat.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI -- CONTINUOUS
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Canal Street. A diner.
text: The CABBIE, a middle-aged Filipino wearing a Mets cap, turns
text: and raises his eyebrows at Sam.
speaker_heading: CABBIE
dialog: Which diner? There's maybe twenty--
text: Sam hands the cabbie two twenties.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just keep the meter running.
scene_heading: EXT. CANAL STREET DINER -- AFTERNOON
text: Sam jumps out of the taxi and hurries into the diner.
scene_heading: INT. CANAL STREET DINER -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sam approaches WAITRESS 1.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is there an Athena working here?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 1
dialog: Yeah. Athena!
text: Sam raises his eyebrows, amazed that the search was so easy.
dialog: 69.
text: A bull-necked BUTCH COOK wearing a dirty apron, her grey hair
text: shaved to the scalp, a buxom mermaid tattooed on her thick
text: forearm, pushes open the kitchen door, cleaver in her hand.
speaker_heading: BUTCH COOK
dialog: Yeah, what?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Athena?
speaker_heading: BUTCH COOK
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you a waitress?
speaker_heading: BUTCH COOK
dialog: Do I look like a goddamn waitress?
dialog: I'm the cook.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Right, my mistake. I'm very sorry.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: Sam and the cabbie work their way east on Canal Street,
text: stopping at every diner but finding no green-eyed Athena.
text: It's getting darker and darker and time is running out.
text: The wind picks up and rain starts to fall.
scene_heading: EXT. DINER -- NIGHT
text: Sam ends up at a rundown old diner on the corner of Canal and
dialog: Allen.
text: The cabbie drives off. This is the last diner.
scene_heading: INT. DINER
text: Sam seats himself at the counter. Outside it's pouring.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is there a waitress here named
dialog: Athena?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 2
dialog: Athena? Nah, never heard of her.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: All right. Could I just get a cup
dialog: of coffee, please?
text: Sam reaches into his blazer pocket for his wallet and feels
dialog: something else.
text: He pulls out the engagement ring and turns it in the light
text: watching the diamond sparkle.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 3 (0.S.)
dialog: You planning on proposing to
dialog: Athena?
text: Sam looks up. Waitress 3 apparently overheard his previous
text: conversation. He pockets the ring.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, I'm-- do you know her? We're
dialog: talking about the same Athena?
dialog: Green eyes?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 3
dialog: You a cop?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, no, nothing like that. More
dialog: like a matchmaker. I know a guy who
dialog: really likes her but he's shy.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 3
dialog: She doesn't work here anymore. But
dialog: she's in my acting class.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She is? Could you--
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 3
dialog: What are you, a stalker?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, honestly, look...
text: He pulls out his wallet, removes a photo I.D., and shows it
text: to her.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: See, I'm a psychiatrist.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 3
dialog: (examining I.D.)
dialog: You're a psychiatrist, huh? So you
dialog: can give Valium prescriptions?
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I could give them to a patient of
dialog: mine who needed them, yes.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS 3
dialog: Okay. Good luck finding Athena.
text: She walks away. Sam stares at her back and then up at the
text: clock on the wall, which reads 7:30. Sam looks at Waitress 3
text: and takes a deep breath.
scene_heading: INT. ACTOR'S STUDIO -- NIGHT
text: A cramped stage in front of several rows of seats. ATHENA
text: (the green-eyed woman from the DRIVER'S POV sequences and the
text: LIFE MONTAGE) and DEVON, a young man with bleached hair,
text: stand on stage, rehearsing.
text: Sam enters through a door in back.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: What have you, my good friends
dialog: deserved at the hands of Fortune
dialog: that she sends you to prison
dialog: hither?
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Prison, my lord?
text: Sam sits in the back row and watches. His hair is wet from
dialog: the rain.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Denmark's a prison.
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Then is the world one.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: A goodly one; in which there are
text: many confines, wards, and dungeons
dialog: Denmark being one o'th'worst.
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: We think not so, my lord.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Why, then 'tis none to you. For
dialog: there is nothing either good or bad
dialog: but thinking makes it so. To me it
dialog: is a prison.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Prison, my lord?
text: Athena grins and shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Denmark's a prison. We already had
dialog: this conversation.
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Oh, crap. Um...
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Why, then your ambition--
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Why, then your ambition makes it
dialog: one. 'Tis too narrow for your mind.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: O God, I could be bounded in a
dialog: nutshell and count myself a king of
dialog: infinite space, were it not that I
dialog: have bad dreams.
dialog: (normal speaking voice)
dialog: That's my favorite line in the
dialog: whole play.
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Good line. I better get home and
dialog: rest the pipes. I've got a solo in
text: choir tomorrow morning.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Thanks for reading with me. You're
dialog: a good Rosencrantz.
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: You're a good Hamlet.
text: Devon grabs his satchel from the side of the stage and walks
text: out. Sam stands and walks down to the stage, where Athena is
text: packing up her things.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I always pictured Hamlet as a man.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: That's a bit narrow-minded of you,
dialog: isn't it? This is the lesbian
text: Hamlet. All the parts are played by
dialog: women.
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh. That's... new.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I'm joking. I'm Ophelia. I just get
dialog: so sick of playing her. Lovely,
text: lost Ophelia. Things get tough and
text: she jumps in the drink. Hamlet hogs
dialog: all the good lines.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, he's notorious for that.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: We've met before, haven't we?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't think so.
text: He offers his hand and they shake.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam Foster.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Athena. Are you joining the class?
dialog: It's good. Kenny's a bit of a
dialog: dictator, but you get used to him.
text: Athena pulls on her sweater.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. I've been looking for you
dialog: actually.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: That's flattering. Please tell me
dialog: you're a casting director.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A psychiatrist, unfortunately. I...
dialog: I have a patient who likes you very
dialog: much.
text: Athena smiles, but clearly she's not thrilled by this
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: This is an unusual way of getting a
dialog: date. What's his name?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Henry Letham.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: Never heard of him.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I was hoping you might know where
dialog: to find him. He mentioned you once.
dialog: He has a crush on you. You served
dialog: him coffee in a diner, you were
dialog: nice to him. The way he tells it
dialog: you were the one good thing that
dialog: ever happened to him.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Henry. Is he very pale? Very thin
text: and very pale? His arms are
dialog: scarred?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You remember him?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: He always ate pecan pie with his
dialog: coffee. I remember that. But we
dialog: never spoke outside the diner.
dialog: Except...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? Tell me.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I feel stupid saying this stuff to
dialog: a psychiatrist. You'll think I'm
dialog: insane. But I had the strangest
dialog: feeling about him. I mean, he's
dialog: this ragged-looking guy, probably
dialog: hasn't bathed in months, but
dialog: something about him... I'd seen him
dialog: before, somewhere. I'd known him.
dialog: What's wrong with him?
text: Sam hesitates for a moment. This is privileged information
dialog: after all, which he is loathe to disclose. But there's no
dialog: time left for playing by the rules.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's going to kill himself at
dialog: midnight.
text: Athena opens her mouth to speak, closes it, then opens it
dialog: again.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: He seems to believe he did
dialog: something terrible. And he thinks
dialog: this is the only way he can make up
dialog: for it. That's my guess, anyway.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I wish there was something I could
dialog: do. Actually... this probably won't
dialog: help, but I did run into him one
text: night at A. Smith's.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A. Smith's?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
text: The art bookstore. He was sitting
text: in the back, reading. I don't know,
dialog: maybe he hangs out there. It's
dialog: nearby. Come on, I'll show you.
text: She leads Sam out the side door
scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY -- CONTINUOUS
text: A very dark, narrow alley piled with trash. Somewhere nearby
text: a BABY is howling.
text: The storm has died down but a drizzle continues, and
text: rainwater drips from the overhanging fire escapes.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: I know, it's gross.
text: Sam steps in a puddle and looks down.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Christ.
text: He steps out of the puddle and looks up. Athena is nowhere in
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Athena?
text: The alley seems to be darker and narrower than before; the
text: streetlights shining from the head, of the alley seem farther
dialog: away .
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Athena?
text: He begins jogging forward. After a few steps he slips ona
text: wet wrapper and falls backwards onto the trash-strewn
text: pavement, banging his head.
text: For a moment everything is dark
scene_heading: SAM'S SECOND DREAM
text: Sam's face suddenly fills the screen. He is staring directly
text: into the camera.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Come on, kid, you need to stay
dialog: conscious. Come on, come on, stay
dialog: with me.
scene_heading: END OF SAM'S SECOND DREAM
text: Sam opens his eyes. He's lying on his back in the alleyway.
text: He stands, unsteadily, and brushes the dirt from his clothes.
text: He pats his blazer pocket and realizes it's empty.
text: Panicked, he looks through all his pockets. The RING is gone.
text: He bends down and tries to find the ring, but there is no
text: light to see anything.
text: He looks up. The only light comes from beneath the side door
text: into the actor's studio.
text: Sam opens the door and lets the light from the studio shine
text: into the alleyway.

scene_heading: INT. ACTOR'S STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sam frowns and leans into the studio. He cannot believe what
text: he sees.
text: On stage, Athena and Devon are performing the same duologue
dialog: as last time.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: For there is nothing either good or
dialog: bad but thinking makes it so. To me
text: it is a prison.
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Prison, my lord?
text: Athena grins and shakes her head.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Denmark's a prison. We already had

speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Oh, crap. Um...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (prompting)
dialog: Why, then your ambition--
speaker_heading: DEVON
dialog: Why, then your ambition makes it
dialog: one. 'Tis too narrow for your mind.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: O God, I could be bounded in a
dialog: nutshell and count myself a king of

dialog: have bad dreams.

scene_heading: INT. CAR - NIGHT
speaker_heading: DRIVER'S POV
text: We're cruising across the Brooklyn Bridge. The driver's hands
text: (a man's hands) are on the steering wheel.
text: We turn to the right and see Athena sleeping in the passenger
text: seat. The driver's eyes (and the CAMERA) return to the road.
text: Suddenly, and with no warning, everything changes.
dialog: 78.
text: The car shakes and lurches to the right. We see the hands on

dialog: impossible.
text: Through the windshield we see the road spinning away from us
text: and then the steel guardrail coming at us far too fast.
scene_heading: INT. LEON'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: Leon sits by a partially-opened window, listening to the
text: wind, the rain, the thunder. He sways as he listens, and
text: gestures with his hands, as if he were conducting the storm.
speaker_heading: HENRY (0.S.)
dialog: You always loved storms.
text: Leon grabs his cane and stands up.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Who's that? How did you get in
dialog: here?
text: Leon trembles and thrusts at the air in front of him with his
dialog: cane.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's me, Dad. Henry.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: What are you doing here? You died.
dialog: I kissed your cheek at the wake.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You've got the wrong man. I told
dialog: you that before. I never had any
dialog: children.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You don't recognize me.
text: He walks over to Leon, who hears him coming and raises his
text: cane in fear. Henry grabs the cane and pulls the older man
dialog: closer.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not going to hurt you.
text: He removes Leon's dark glasses. Leon's eyes swim in their
text: sockets: useless, blind eyes.
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at me, Dad. Look at me.
text: CLOSE on Leon's eyes. They seem to stabilize, the pupils
text: dilating, beginning to focus, to work.
text: Leon looks directly at Henry now. He reaches out and touches
text: the young man's face.
text: Leon cannot speak. He looks at his own hands, the lines
text: creasing his palms. He looks out the window. A bolt of
text: lightning brightens the night sky and Leon moans.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Lightning.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Do you recognize me now?
text: Leon turns back to the boy. Leon's face is transfixed with
text: wonder everything he sees is a miracle. He touches Henry's
text: cheek again.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: What are you?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm your son.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: No--
text: Henry embraces the older man, buries his face in the
text: psychiatrist's shoulder.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Is this my punishment, Dad? You
dialog: won't recognize me?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I never had a--
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Please, please, Dad. Forgive me.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: For killing you.
text: Leon pushes out of the embrace and takes a half step
dialog: backward.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: I'm alive.
text: Henry shakes his head sadly.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you? Are you a god?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: A god?
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: You perform miracles...
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Miracles?
text: He walks over to the living room wall. One strip of wallpaper
text: has begun to peel slightly and Henry tears the strip off the
dialog: wall.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You think it's a miracle?
text: Words in black ink are scribbled on the bare wall beneath the
dialog: paper.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you see now?
text: Henry tears off an entire sheet of the wallpaper, and then
text: another, and then another, flaying the wall.
text: The phrase FORGIVE ME is written again and again, the
text: familiar endless loop of minuscule, tortured handwriting.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Can you see? It's in my head, Dad.
dialog: It's all in my head.
text: Leon stares at the writing for several seconds, then turns to
text: stare at Henry.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: No--
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm dreaming you.
text: Leon opens his mouth to speak but no words come out.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't get out of it. I try-- I
dialog: try to wake up, but I can't. I'm
dialog: trapped here.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Henry- -
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: But I can't die in a dream, right?
dialog: So if I try to kill myself, I'll
dialog: end the dream.
speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: And what happens to us?
text: Henry stares at the older man for a moment and then abruptly
text: turns and leaves. Leon limps after him.
speaker_heading: LEON (CONT'D)
dialog: What happens to us?! What happens
dialog: to us?!
text: Henry opens the apartment door and slams it shut behind him.
text: Leon looks at the closed door for a moment and then out the
text: window, where the lightning is becoming more and more
dialog: frequent.
scene_heading: INT. THE WHITE HORSE TAVERN -- NIGHT
text: A sprawling old bar in the West Village. Henry, soaking wet
text: from the rain, pushes open the door and enters. The barroom
text: is nearly empty. He approaches the bar.
text: The BARTENDER is a heavily-muscled bruiser paging through a
text: bodybuilding MAGAZINE.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You got I.D.?
text: Henry takes his driver's license out of his wallet and the
text: bartender inspects it carefully. The clock on the wall reads
dialog: 9:05.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (CONT'D)
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Happy birthday, kid. First one's on

speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: An All-American drinker, that's

dialog: up.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Isn't this where Dylan Thomas had
dialog: his last drink?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: (serving the shot and
dialog: beer)
dialog: Yep. He lined up eighteen shots,
dialog: downed them all, and said, "There,
dialog: I think that's a record." Then he
dialog: dropped dead. "Do not go gentle
dialog: into that good night."
text: Henry raises his shot glass to the bartender.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: "Rage, rage against the dying of
dialog: the light."
text: Henry gulps down the shot and pounds the glass onto the bar.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
text: Eighteen more for the record.
scene_heading: EXT. EIGHTH AVENUE -- NIGHT
text: Sam, shell shocked, walks slowly down the block. He looks
text: into the face of every person he passes.
text: A light rain continues to fall.
speaker_heading: SAM'S POV
text: Every shade of humanity is represented in the quickly passing
text: faces. The beautiful and the ugly, the rich and the poor, the
dialog: thin and the fat, the happy and the agitated and the
text: expressionless.
text: Each face comes into focus for a second before leaving the
dialog: frame.
text: Sam stops in front of a storefront. A. SMITH'S is written in
text: gold script on the glass.
dialog: 83.
scene_heading: INT. A. SMITH'S -- NIGHT
text: Sam wanders through the aisles. He checks the back area,
text: where a few STUDENTS sit on the window ledges, paging through
text: art books. Henry is not here.
text: A bespectacled CLERK approaches Sam.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Can I help you find something?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Henry Letham.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: A book by Henry Letham or on Henry
dialog: Letham?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, he's... I thought he might be
dialog: here. I heard he comes here
dialog: sometimes.
text: The clerk calls over to SMITTY, the rumpled shop owner, who
text: sits behind the checkout counter paging through a book of
dialog: photographs.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Smitty, you know a guy named Henry
dialog: Letham?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Sure.
dialog: (he looks at Sam)
dialog: Something happen to him?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I need to find him. It's an
dialog: emergency.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: I keep telling the kid to get some
dialog: sun. It's not healthy spending all
dialog: your time in bookstores.
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Look at me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You haven't seen him tonight?
dialog: 84.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Nah, he hasn't been by in weeks.
dialog: You're his father?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, I... I teach up at Columbia.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: You're his art teacher? Kid's got
dialog: talent. I have one of his paintings
dialog: here somewhere.
text: Smitty ducks below the counter and begins delving through the
dialog: drawers.
speaker_heading: SMITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: (crouching)
dialog: Here we go.
text: He stands and spreads an unframed CANVAS over the counter
scene_heading: INSERT PAINTING
text: It's a very dark, haunting interpretation of the Brooklyn
text: Bridge at night. The perspective is unusual, looking straight
dialog: up the Gothic arches-- the view you would have if you were
dialog: lying flat on your back on the bridge.
speaker_heading: SMITTY (CONT'D)
dialog: He didn't have any money for the
dialog: books he wanted, so he gave me
dialog: this. I think I got a pretty good
dialog: deal.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What books did he get?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Tristan Réveur. What else? The kid
text: is obsessed with Tristan Réveur.
dialog: Maybe he got that from your class.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I doubt it. Do you have any more
dialog: Tristan Réveur books?
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: Nah, he bought me out. It was all
dialog: secondhand, out-of-print stuff. So
dialog: what do you think? Is he gonna make
dialog: it?
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
text: Smitty indicates the painting.
speaker_heading: SMITTY
dialog: You think he's got what it takes?
text: Sam stares at the painting and nods.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HORSE TAVERN -- NIGHT
text: Henry is drunk. A row of empty shot glasses is lined up
text: before him. The clock reads 10:03. The Band's "I Shall be
text: Released" plays over the stereo system.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Could you change the station? They
dialog: never quit playing this song.
text: The bartender raises his eyebrows.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: First time I heard it in years.
text: He changes the station.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Where is everybody?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I guess the rain scared people
dialog: away .
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's my birthday. I want some
dialog: company.
text: A crew of soaked TOURISTS stumble into the bar. They speak
text: German. HAUSER, their leader, a tall blonde man with mutton-
text: chop sideburns and a bead necklace, approaches the bartender
speaker_heading: HAUSER
dialog: Is this the place of death of Dylan
dialog: Thomas?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: HAUSER
dialog: Ah!
dialog: 86.
text: He turns to his friends and announces the news in German.
text: They all say Ah! and nod happily.
scene_heading: INT. WHITE HORSE TAVERN -- LATER
text: The Germans and Henry sit in a circle, all of them very
text: drunk. Hauser is reciting a Thomas poem. He has a strong
dialog: accent but he gets every word right.
speaker_heading: HAUSER
dialog: And death shall have no dominion.
dialog: Dead men naked they shall be one
text: With the man in the wind and the
dialog: west moon...
text: Meanwhile, Henry pulls the heavy black revolver from the
text: pocket of his overcoat and places it on the bar.
text: The bartender, reading his muscle magazine at the far end of
text: the bar, does not notice. Nor do the Germans.
speaker_heading: HAUSER (CONT'D)
dialog: When their bones are picked clean
dialog: and the clean bones gone, They
dialog: shall have stars at elbow and
dialog: foot...
text: Henry reaches back into his pocket and dumps six bullets onto
dialog: the bar.
speaker_heading: HAUSER (CONT'D)
dialog: Though they go mad they shall be
dialog: sane, Though they sink through the
dialog: sea they shall rise again...
text: Henry opens the gun's cylinder, loads one bullet, spins the
dialog: cylinder.
speaker_heading: HAUSER (CONT'D)
dialog: Though lovers be lost love shall
dialog: not; And death shall have no
dialog: dominion.
text: The other Germans clap and whistle.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You want to play a drinking game?
text: The Germans nod and smile at him but it's clear they have no
text: idea what he's talking about. He aims the revolver at his own
dialog: head.
dialog: 87.
text: The Germans are suddenly very quiet.
text: He pulls the trigger.
dialog: Click.
text: He offers the gun to Hauser.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You sure you don't want to play?
speaker_heading: HAUSER
dialog: (refusing the gun)
dialog: No, please. This is for drinking
dialog: game?
text: Henry reopens the cylinder, adds another bullet, spins,
text: presses the barrel to his head.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You hear a click, you drink. You
dialog: hear a bang, I drink.
text: Henry winks at the German and pulls the trigger.
dialog: Click.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Drink.
text: Hauser smiles and nods at his comrades. He grabs a full beer
text: mug from the bar and downs half of it in a gulp.
text: The bartender looks up, sees what's happening, throws down
dialog: his magazine.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa, little brother.
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Henry doesn't answer. He adds another bullet, spins, aims,
text: pulls the trigger.
dialog: Click.
text: Hauser finishes the beer and places the empty mug on the bar.
text: The other Germans, less confident that this is really a game,
text: have slowly begun to back away.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (CONT'D)
dialog: Put the gun down, kid. Come on.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: HAUSER
dialog: (to bartender)
dialog: This is a drinking game.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: The hell it is.
text: Another bullet into the cylinder. There are four now. Spin
dialog: aim, pull.
dialog: Click.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Drink.
text: Hauser is nervous now. He stares at his comrades, who can
text: only watch fearfully.
speaker_heading: HENRY (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, you're falling behind.
text: Hauser grabs another beer and swills it down.
text: Fifth bullet. The same procedure. The bartender is inching
text: closer to Henry. Henry looks at him. The bartender freezes.
dialog: Click.
text: One of the German women starts crying. Hauser drinks as much
text: as he can but spits some of it up.
text: Henry inserts the sixth bullet into the sixth chamber. He
text: closes the cylinder, is about to spin it, realizes he doesn't
text: have to, smiles at the Germans, presses the muzzle against
dialog: his temple.
text: Henry lowers the pistol.
text: The bartender and the Germans release their breath at the
dialog: same time.
speaker_heading: HAUSER
dialog: It is a joke? It is a toy, yes? It
dialog: is a toy gun?
text: Henry points the revolver at the bottle of Jack Daniel's
text: sitting on the bar. He pulls the trigger. The bottle
text: explodes.
text: Nobody moves. Henry returns the revolver to his pocket. He
text: bows to the Germans.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Welcome to America.
text: He walks out of the silent bar.

scene_heading: INT. COLUMBIA LIBRARY STACKS -- CONTINUOUS

text: another tap. Impatiently, Sam turns around.
text: Leon stands there, smiling in the rain, no longer wearing

text: Sam stares at Leon for a moment before speaking.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Leon?
speaker_heading: LEON

speaker_heading: LEON
dialog: Henry. It's all because of Henry.

scene_heading: EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: BOY (0.S.)
dialog: Mommy, is that man going to die?
text: Henry, startled, turns and sees the same boy and mother we've

text: closer. They stare at Henry.
text: The boy holds a red balloon.
text: Henry looks down. Blood is dripping from his shirtsleeves,
text: down his arms, off his fingertips, splattering on the
text: sidewalk, mixing with the rainwater. He stares at his palms.
text: Somewhere nearby a BABY is howling.
text: When Henry looks up again everything on the crowded street
text: has stopped. The cars and trucks and buses have stopped, the

dialog: 92.
text: Everyone stares at Henry. Riders on the city bus lean out the

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I didn't mean to hurt her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You haven't hurt anyone yet, Henry.
text: Just put the gun down.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I've hurt people. I have. I've done
dialog: something terrible.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just put the gun down, Henry. Okay?
dialog: Put the gun down. Let me help you.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's the only way out. Don't you
dialog: see that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: One of the first times I met you
dialog: you said you didn't know what was
dialog: real anymore. Okay, well I thought
dialog: I did but I was wrong. I don't know
dialog: what's real, either. And if you die-
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You're real, Dr. Foster. You tried
dialog: to save me. You were just a little
dialog: too late.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: For the longest time I didn't
dialog: understand what was happening to
dialog: me. But now--
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But you waited. Why didn't you
dialog: shoot yourself as soon as you knew?
dialog: You wanted me to help you. why?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Because I'm afraid. I don't know
text: what's on the other side.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Maybe that's why I can't wake up.
dialog: I'm afraid to go back there.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Then don't. Don't go back.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: It's a dream. It's got to end
dialog: sometime.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Listen. Listen to me. If you're
dialog: wrong, you pull the trigger and
dialog: you're dead. End of story.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I'm not wrong.
text: Sam nods but says nothing for a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (very quiet)
dialog: Okay. What if you're right? What if
dialog: it is your dream? Look around. Look
dialog: around!
text: Henry takes his eyes off Sam and looks around. The cars race
text: by, headlights streaming. Below the bridge the East River
text: flows. And behind them are the towers of Manhattan.
text: Everything shimmers in the rainfall. The skyline looks both
text: majestic and fragile.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: The whole world is in your dream.
dialog: Athena's here, I'm here, everyone.
dialog: You kill yourself, you're killing
dialog: all of us.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Stay here. Stay with us.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I have to wake up.
dialog: 98.
text: The moment he says these words everything goes quiet. The
text: bridge is suddenly empty, no traffic at all, nobody in sight
dialog: but Henry and Sam.
text: The rain stops. The stars, normally invisible above the city,
text: now crowd the sky, brighter and more numerous than we've ever
dialog: seen them.
text: Then the stars begin to fall, all the stars rain from the
text: sky, leaving burning trails in their wake, the entire sky
text: crisscrossed with these scars.
text: An apocalyptic howl, the most terrifying noise imaginable,
text: seems to erupt from everywhere and nowhere. The bridge
text: shudders and sways.
text: Henry shoves the barrel of the revolver into his mouth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Please don't. Please--
text: CLOSE on Henry.
text: He pulls the trigger.
scene_heading: FADE TO WHITE
text: Very bright. People in the theater should be shielding their
text: eyes.
text: As we fade in we see that the bright light is actually a
text: small flashlight, shining directly into the camera.
speaker_heading: SAM (0.S.) (CONT'D)
text: He's still alive.
text: The camera pulls back to show Henry lying on his back on the
text: walkway, blood streaming from his head. Sam is crouched
text: beside him, holding one of his wrists. In his other hand, Sam
text: holds a small flashlight, which he shines in Henry's eyes.
text: Sam is not wearing his navy-blue cable-knit sweater, though
text: he was before Henry shot himself.
text: The camera pulls back farther. This is the Brooklyn Bridge
dialog: but this is not the scene we just left., A Ford Mustang has
text: just been in a terrible collision.
text: There is a gaping hole in the windshield on the driver's
text: side. Flames consume the backseat. Smoke spills out the
text: windows. The radio still plays, however: The Band's "I Shall
dialog: be Released."
dialog: 99.
text: One of the Mustang's front tires has blown out. Scraps of
text: black rubber litter the accident scene.
text: ATHENA is kneeling next to Henry, on the opposite side of
text: Sam, holding Henry's other hand.
text: Henry's arms are burned and lacerated from the accident.
text: Other cars have stopped short of the Mustang. All Manhattan-
text: bound traffic has come to a halt. From the distance, we hear
text: the blaring of horns.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (in shock)
dialog: He's okay, right? He's going to be
dialog: okay?
text: Sam leans closer to the injured man, so that his face is
text: hovering right above Henry's.
text: Henry's eyes are open. He appears able to see, but he's
text: losing a tremendous amount of blood. It puddles below him on
text: the asphalt, deep red in the bridge's incandescent lights.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (to the gathering crowd)
dialog: We need an ambulance! Somebody call
dialog: an ambulance!
text: He begins to unbutton his shirt. BETH LEVY gets out of a
text: stopped car and hurries over. She wears the navy-blue cable-
text: knit SWEATER, which she now quickly shrugs out of and hands
dialog: to Sam.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Here, use this.
text: Sam bundles the sweater and presses it against the deep
text: unseen gash on Henry's head.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: I just called 911. They're on the
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (to Athena)
dialog: Hold this--
text: He has Athena hold the sweater to staunch the bleeding.
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: (to Henry)
dialog: Stop bleeding, baby. Okay? You've
dialog: got to stop bleeding now.
text: Sam pinches Henry's nostrils and blows into his mouth to make
text: sure the airways are clear.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: He's breathing. Hold that tight.
text: Sam goes to check on the other two casualties. The first, an
text: old man, lies halfway out of one of the rear windows. Sam
text: checks his pulse. Nothing.
text: Sam shakes his head and walks around to the other side of the
text: car, but we PULL IN for a closer look at the old man.
text: It's LEON. Blood leaks from his nostrils and mouth.
text: On the other side of the car lies MRS. LETHAM, face up, eyes
text: open. Blood streams down her face from a massive head wound.
text: Sam checks her pulse as well, but it's obvious she's dead.
text: Sam closes her eyelids, hurries back to Henry, and crouches
text: beside him.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: His mom and dad? Are they okay?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: They're both gone.
text: CLOSE ON HENRY'S EYES. We can tell that he has registered
dialog: this news.
text: For a moment the frames projected on screen slow from their
text: 24-per-second clip and then melt away entirely. The white
text: screen is replaced by a shot we've seen before: Henry, alone
text: on the empty bridge, walking from the burning Mustang.
text: The vision disappears as quickly as it appeared, and we're
text: back at the accident scene, watching Sam trying desperately
dialog: to save Henry.
text: In the backseat of one of the stopped cars, a BABY, strapped
text: into its baby seat, HOWLS and howls.
text: A crowd has gathered around the accident scene. From the
text: nearest cars come the drivers and their passengers, circling
dialog: around Henry.
dialog: The strange thing is that we recognize all of them.
dialog: 101.
text: The Englishman and his wife. Sheriff Kennelly (not in
text: uniform). A young woman we last saw on the subway, asking
text: Henry about his Spanish Art class, and the businessman who
text: wanted him to quit smoking. Dr. Schlegel and the burly
text: paramedics (not in uniform). A middle-aged Filipino wearing a
text: Mets cap. The various waitresses and cooks we saw in the
text: diners. Devon. Smitty. The Muslim woman in full veil. The
text: bartender from the White Horse Tavern. A crew of blonde
text: tourists standing together. The piano movers.
text: The boy with the red balloon and his mother.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Mommy, is that man going to die?
text: Lila rushes over to Sam, Athena and Henry.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'm a nurse.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: All right, keep tabs on his pulse.
dialog: If it stops we'll have to start
speaker_heading: CPR.
text: Lila grabs Henry's wrist and checks his pulse against her
dialog: watch.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Athena)
dialog: What's his name?
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Henry.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Can you hear me, Henry? Henry? I'm
dialog: a doctor, I'm going to help you.
dialog: Can you hear me?
text: Henry's lips have begun to pale from the loss of blood. When
text: he speaks, his mouth barely moving, Sam and Athena bend
text: closer to hear.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Hail.
text: Athena looks up. No hail is falling, but the lights on the
text: suspension cables above look like pieces of ice suspended in
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: It's not hail, baby.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: LILA
text: He's hallucinating.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Keep him talking.
text: Henry's eyes are still open but he appear to be fading fast.
text: He is trying to speak and his face contorts with the effort
text: Athena bends closer to hear him.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: What did he say?
text: The blood from Henry's head wound has seeped through the
text: sweater and onto Athena's hand.
text: Athena struggles to keep from hysteria. She kisses Henry on
text: the forehead. When she looks up we see that her mouth and
text: chin are spotted with Henry's blood.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: "Forgive me."
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It wasn't your fault, Henry. I was
dialog: driving right behind you. Your
text: front tire blew out.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: You hear that, baby? It wasn't
dialog: anybody's fault.
text: CLOSE ON HENRY'S EYES. Again, it appears that he understands
text: the message. The words have a calming effect; his face is no
text: longer contorted.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We need an ambulance!
text: Sam stands up and looks out over the backed-up traffic. We
text: PULL BACK and see that the bridge is jammed with rush-hour
text: commuters. There is no ambulance coming.
text: Sam crouches down again and peers into Henry's eyes. He takes
text: hold of Henry's free hand (Athena holds the other hand)
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, kid, you need to stay
dialog: conscious. Come on, come on, wake
dialog: up!
text: Henry mutters something. Sam leans closer to hear.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: You're real, Dr. Foster.
text: Sam has no idea what Henry's talking about.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's Dr. Williams, Henry. Just stay
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Henry, come on. Come on. I need
dialog: you, baby, come on.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'm losing the pulse, Doctor.
text: Sam begins CPR.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Stay, Henry, stay. Stay. Stay.
dialog: Stay.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HENRY'S FACE
text: The camera shows what Henry sees.
text: HENRY'S POV of the crowd of faces gathered around him. At
text: first they are clear, each face cleanly delineated. But they
text: begin to blur and merge together.
text: The camera PANS UP, past the blur of faces. We see the great
text: Gothic arches of the bridge from this angle-- the perspective
text: of a man lying flat on his back.
dialog: We have seen this view before, in Henry's painting.
text: The camera continues to PAN UP, past the glittering towers of
text: Manhattan, up and up into the nighttime sky.
text: Now the screen is BLACK, but we continue to hear Athena's
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: ATHENA (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Stay. Stay.
text: The screen is black for ten seconds. And we think it's going
text: to stay black, except now we notices pin-pricks of light
text: piercing the darkness.
text: The stars are back in the sky, but these are the usual pale
dialog: New York stars, not the hallucinatory fires that scarred the
text: air with their fall.
dialog: 104.
text: PAN DOWN to the bridge.
text: Two ambulances have arrived, as well as several police cars.
text: The PARAMEDICS (not the same ones we've seen before) load
text: three dead bodies onto stretchers, while the POLICE OFFICERS
text: mark the scene and begin questioning people in the crowd.
text: A female OFFICER sits with a stunned Athena on the trunk of a
text: squad car.
text: Meanwhile, a TOW TRUCK OPERATOR begins attaching the hooks
text: and chains to the ruined Mustang. One lane of westbound
text: traffic has already resumed moving.
text: The people in the passing cars stare out their windows at the
text: carnage.
text: Sam and Lila, grim-faced and exhausted from their ordeal,
text: stand beside one of the ambulances.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Too much bleeding. Too much.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: You did everything you could,
dialog: Doctor. There was never a chance.
text: Sam says nothing. Lila touches him on the shoulder, briefly,
text: and walks away.
text: She's getting farther and farther away. Soon she'll be gone.
text: Sam finally looks up.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hey.
text: Lila turns.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for helping.
text: Lila smiles sadly.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I wish we could have done more.
text: She starts to walk away again.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You want to grab a cup of coffee
dialog: somewhere?
dialog: 105.
text: Lila turns again and looks at him.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I won't be able to sleep tonight.
text: Lila hesitates for a second and then nods.
speaker_heading: LILA
dialog: I'd like that.
text: Sam begins walking toward her and then stops.
text: He notices something lying on the asphalt, something
text: glittering amid the debris of the wreck, the broken glass and
text: twisted metal. He kneels and picks it up.
text: Lila, curious as to what he's found, walks over to him.
speaker_heading: LILA (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
text: Sam, standing, shows her the diamond ring. It glitters in the
text: lights of the bridge. But we're pulling back now, farther and
text: farther from the wrecked car, the ambulances, the slow-moving
dialog: traffic.
text: We're rising higher and higher, above the suspension cables,
text: above the great arches, above the blinking red lights that
dialog: warn airplane pilots.
text: All the commotion on the bridge is silent now, nothing but
text: beads of light trickling over the dark river.
dialog:
