dialog: Pre-Title Sequence
scene_heading: EXT. THE COUNTESS OF TRENTHAM’S HOUSE. DAY. NOVEMBER. 1932.
text: It is a grey day. Mary Maceachran, a young Scottish lady's maid,
text: watches a liveried chauffeur trying to start a green 1920s
text: Daimler in front of a London house. The chauffeur, Merriman,
text: climbs out with a crank handle which he fits and turns.
speaker_heading: MERRIMAN
dialog: Just start, you filthy heap of scrap.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: She’ll hear you one of these days.
speaker_heading: MERRIMAN
dialog: I don’t care if she does.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Don’t you just?
text: The motor catches and he stands. While the passenger seats are
text: enclosed, the front, driving seat is open to the weather. Mary
text: places a basket with a thermos glass and a sealed, tin sandwich
text: container on the rear seat. As she does so, it begins to rain.
speaker_heading: BUTLER (VO)
dialog: Mary? Merriman? Are you ready?
text: With a final check, she looks up to where a butler in a black
text: morning coat waits.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Yes, Mr Burkett.
dialog: We can hardly hear his “Everything's ready, milady,” nor can we
text: see the face behind the veil of the figure who hurries down the
text: steps. This is Constance, Countess of Trentham. Muffled in furs
text: against the cold, she hurries into the waiting vehicle.
text: The titles run over the following sequence.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
text: Merriman drives. Mary sits silently next to him, huddling into
text: her coat. Unlike the passenger, the servants, in the roofless
text: front seat, are exposed to the rain.
scene_heading: INT. CONSTANCE’S CAR. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
text: Gloved hands try lazily to open the thermos, give up immediately
text: and reach for the polished brass speaking tube. The veiled
text: indistinct mouth gives some instructions.
scene_heading: EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.
text: They pull over and the dripping maid gets out as a large Lagonda
text: stops. It is bright with shining chrome. It looks like Tomorrow
text: next to the Daimler’s Yesterday. A man in the front passenger
text: seat looks out helpfully. He speaks in a Californian accent.
speaker_heading: WEISSMAN
dialog: Do you need any help? Are you O.K.?
text: The door is open now and, behind the maid, the indistinct
text: passenger speaks.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Am I what?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: We‘re quite all right. Thank you.
speaker_heading: IVOR
dialog: Excuse me but.. is that.. Lady Trentham?
text: Constance does not answer.
speaker_heading: IVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't remember me.. I’m William
text: McCordle‘s cousin. Ivor Novello.
text: At this Mary gasps in recognition but Constance merely nods.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: IVOR
dialog: May I present a friend of mine from
dialog: California, Morris Weissman? And —
text: Having indicated the American on the passenger side in front, he
text: has turned to a very handsome young man sitting behind but, on
text: second thoughts, he breaks off.
speaker_heading: IVOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I was wondering if we were all headed
dialog: in the same direction...
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I dare say we might be.
speaker_heading: IVOR
dialog: Well.. if you’re sure you don’t need
dialog: any help..
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Mary has opened the folding table for the refreshments. The
text: other car drives away.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Was that really Ivor Novello?
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: Could we get on before I freeze to
dialog: death?
text: The maid shuts the car door, climbs in and the journey
text: continues. The credits end.
scene_heading: EXT, GOSFORD PARK. DAY.
text: The great house stands confidently in its park, proclaiming its
text: social pre-eminence. As the car continues down the drive, it
text: catches the attention of a beautiful woman who is cantering on
text: her horse, Topaz. She wears jodphurs and a loosely tied neck
text: scarf over her hacking jacket. This is Lady Sylvia McCordle,
text: daughter of an earl and doyenne of Gosford. She digs in her
text: heels and heads for the house.
text: As she arrives at the front steps, the Novello car is moving
text: away to the side and Novello himself, with his companion, is
text: being shepherded inside by the butler, Jennings. A footman
text: (Arthur) holds an umbrella. With them is the owner of all he
text: surveys, Sir William McCordle, bart, a rich parvenu and proud of
text: it. In his arms he holds a wiry unattractive terrier The arrival
text: of Constance makes him turn back.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Constance, Welcome.
text: The visitor nods as Sylvia jumps down from her horse, tossing
text: the reins back over its head. She gives her aunt a kiss.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: If he has to call me by my christian
dialog: name, why can’t he make it “Aunt
dialog: Constance”? I’m not the upstairs maid.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You know what he's like.
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
dialog: I see he's still got that vile dog.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: It's so typical. The ones you hate
dialog: live forever. Have you had a horrid
dialog: journey?
speaker_heading: {CONTINUED}
speaker_heading: CONTINUED :
speaker_heading: CONSTANCE
text: Fairly horrid.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA
dialog: You must be frozen. Come and have some
dialog: tea,
text: Mary eyes the standing horse warily. With a snort, it shakes its
text: head and, rather gingerly, she stretches out her hand to take
text: the reins under the animal’s chin. At once it starts to fidget
text: and plunge. Sylvia looks across.
speaker_heading: SYLVIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Leave him alone. He knows what to do.
text: The embarrassed maid drops the reins as a groom appears and
text: leads the docile horse away. Mary, of course, does not know what
dialog: to do.
text: Sylvia and her aunt start up the steps but we do not follow as
text: they move off camera.
text: Jennings steps forward.
speaker_heading: JENNINGS
dialog: Take the car round the back to unload
dialog: it.
text: The car starts up and heads towards the side of the house.
text: Still, Mary waits. Jennings looks over to the maid as he also
text: starts to reclimb the front steps
speaker_heading: JENNINGS (CONT'D)
dialog: You'd better follow him. Mrs Wilson‘11
dialog: look after you.
text: A lone figure, she trudges off through the puddles, clutching
text: the dressing case, as the car carrying the Stockbridge party
text: sweeps up to the front.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN CORRIDOR. DAY.
text: Chaos reigns. Servants duck past the piled up trunks and cases.
text: Valets and maids (Barnes and Sarah, joined later by Renee and
text: Robert) struggle to check that none of their luggage has gone to
text: the wrong rooms. Surveying it all, clipboard in hand, is Mrs
text: Wilson, the house-keeper, an opaque woman in her middle years.
text: Barnes, who is carrying a large flat, crested case approaches.
text: She does not look up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Just leave everything in one pile,
dialog: make sure it’s properly labelled and
dialog: it'll be taken up.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: These are the guns. Where’s the gun
dialog: room?
text: His voice could scarcely be more disdainful. She nods at a side
dialog: corridor.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: At the end on the left. You’1l find
dialog: the keeper, Mr Strutt, in there. He’ll
dialog: show you what to do.
speaker_heading: BARNES
dialog: I know what to do.
text: He goes as Mary arrives timidly, sheltering behind a laden
dialog: Merriman .
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: MERRIMAN
dialog: The Countess of Trentham.
text: Merriman has carried in the three smart cases. He knows the
text: ropes. Mrs Wilson nods and checks her list, handing a label to
dialog: the man.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Leave them over there by the luggage
dialog: lift and tie this to the top one.
dialog: You’ll find the chauffeur, Mr Raikes,
dialog: in the courtyard. He’1ll tell you where
dialog: to put the car. You’1l sleep in the
text: stable block with the grooms.
text: He sets about the task, leaving Mary feeling more alone than
dialog: ever.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON (CONT'D)

dialog: Room. You'll be sharing with the Head
dialog: Parlourmaid.

speaker_heading: MRS WILSON (CONT'D)
dialog: She'll show you where everything is.
dialog: Elsie, this is Miss Trentham.
text: A young, uniformed maid, Elsie, turns at the sound of her name
dialog: and comes near
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Excuse me, m’m, but.. my name’s
dialog: Maceachran..
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Not here it's not.
text: Mrs Wilson has moved away as Elsie takes Mary's case.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What about the jewels?
text: She indicates the dressing case still in her hand.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: This way. George is in charge of the
dialog: safe. He’s the First Footman. And you
dialog: want to watch where he puts his hands...
text: They turn another corner in the maze of service corridors that
text: xun beneath the house. At the door of the Butler's Silver
text: Pantry, stands a supercilious figure in livery. Next to him,
text: just inside the room, is a large wall safe. The iron door is
text: open revealing a felt-lined closet, filled with laden shelves.
text: George, the first footman, is receiving a case from another maid
text: (Renee). Mary takes a key on a chain around her neck under her
text: dress and opens the case, removing the jewel box which she is
text: about to hand over
speaker_heading: ELSIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Have you got the ones for tonight?
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Oh...
text: Mary unlocks the box. Inside are gleaming trays, each one with a
text: complete parure of gems. She takes out a set of sapphires and
text: puts them in the pocket of her coat.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Always take a separate box with the
dialog: first night’s jewels. Saves bother.
text: Mary nods, re~locking the box and handing it over to George who
text: gives her a wink as he takes it. As they walk away, re-crossing
text: the back hall, they almost collide with a tall stranger carrying
text: a suitcase. Mrs Wilson arrives.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED }

speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Elsie, this is Lord Stockbridge’s
dialog: valet. Show him the footmen's
dialog: staircase, will you? And he’1l need
text: the ironing room.
text: She starts to leave. The new arrival turns to the two maids
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: The name’s Robert, Robert Parks.
text: This seems to halt the retreating Mrs Wilson. Robert looks at
text: her enquiringly.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: I meant to say you'll be sharing with
dialog: Mr Weissman's man. You could have gone
dialog: up together but I don't know where
dialog: he's got to.
text: Other business claims her. Elsie sighs. They might as well get
text: on with it.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Has his lordship’s luggage gone up?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
text: Supposedly. He's in the Tapestry Room
dialog: wherever that is.. Oh well, here, we go
dialog: again.
text: But Mary cannot return his casual pleasantry. Instead she half
dialog: whispers.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: That‘s just it. I’ve never done a
dialog: house-party before. Not properly.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You'll be all right.
text: Elsie, above them on the back stair, has overheard.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: How d’you manage to be taken on as a
dialog: countess’s lady’s maid if you didn’t
dialog: ‘ave no experience?
speaker_heading: MARY

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN. DAY.
text: A handsome face displays the brilliant smile of Henry Denton,
text: Morris Weissman's valet. At the long table, the cook, Mrs Croft,
text: is working on a tray of quail. The senior kitchen maid, Bertha,
text: slices carrots and the junior, Ellen, slowly turns an ice-cream
text: churn. They ogle the visitor who speaks in a Scottish accent.
speaker_heading: MRS CROFT
dialog: Get on with your work. Yes?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I just —
text: But before he can say more, Mrs Wilson spies him from the
text: corridor and enters.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Ah, Mr Weissman, there you are.
speaker_heading: MRS CROFT
dialog: I'm dealing with this. What is it, Mr
dialog: Weissman?
text: The dislike between the two women is almost tangible.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Well, to start with my name is Denton.
dialog: Henry Denton.
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: You are here as valet to Mr Weissman.
dialog: That means you will be known, below
dialog: stairs, as Mr Weissman for the
dialog: duration of your stay. You'll find we
dialog: keep to the old customs, It avoids
dialog: confusion.
text: He would answer back but decides against it.
speaker_heading: HENRY

scene_heading: MRS WILSON AND MRS CROFT

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED }
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HENRY

speaker_heading: MRS CROFT

speaker_heading: HENRY
text: A vegetarian. He doesn’t eat meat. He
dialog: eats fish but not meat.
speaker_heading: MRS CROFT
dialog: Well, I never.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I’m sorry if it’s inconvenient.
speaker_heading: MRS CROFT
dialog: Well, it’s not very convenient, I must
dialog: say. Doesn’t eat meat? He’s come for a
text: shooting party and he doesn’t eat
dialog: meat?
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Mr Weissman doesn’t intend to shoot. I
dialog: think he just wants to walk out with
dialog: them. Get a bit of air.
speaker_heading: MRS CROFT
dialog: Get a bit of air?
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Thank you. We’1ll make the necessary
dialog: adjustments. Now, if you'd like to get
dialog: one of the servants to take you
dialog: upstairs... Mr Weissman is in the
dialog: Mulgrave Room and you’1ll be sharing
text: with Lord Stockbridge’s valet.
text: Henry nods his thanks and walks out of the room watched by Mrs
dialog: Croft.
speaker_heading: MRS CROFT
dialog: He's very full of himself, I must say.
dialog: Doesn’t eat meat!
speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Come along, Mrs Croft. We don’t want
dialog: to be thought unsophisticated, do we?
dialog: Mr Weissman is an American. They do

dialog: good. I said ‘julienne.’ And Ellen
dialog: that is ice-cream you are churning not
dialog: concrete. Calm down.
scene_heading: INT. ELSIE’S ATTIC ROOM. DAY.
text: This is a simple, plainly furnished room with two beds. Mary
text: hangs up her coat then opens the valise on the bed. She
text: unbuttons her wet travelling dress and takes a black frock from
text: the case then a cap and a frilly, black apron. Elsie watches
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: I thought ladies’ maids never wore
dialog: aprons.
speaker_heading: MARY @
dialog: Her ladyship used to have a French
dialog: maid who wore a black one like this.
dialog: She thinks it’s got a bit of style.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: I bet she does. And I'll bet she took
dialog: it out of your wages, too.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: She likes to have everything just so.
text: Elsie rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Don’t they all?
text: Behind Elsie’s bed are various pictures of movie stars,

dialog: but I answered.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: I only cut it out for Garbo. I prefer
dialog: the American stars. I think they've
dialog: got more oomph.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Go on. Is he really Sir William's
dialog: cousin? Imagine having a film star in
dialog: the family. Lady Sylvia must be
dialog: thrilled.
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: I don't think.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: Why wouldn't she be?
speaker_heading: ELSIE
dialog: Because she's a snobbish cow. Because
dialog: she looks down on anyone who got to
text: the top with brains and hard work.
text: dust like she looks down on her
dialog: husband. Except when it's time to foot
text: the bills. Then she’s got her hand out
dialog: all right.
speaker_heading: MARY
dialog: What was her family, then?
speaker_heading: ELSTE
dialog: What you’d expect. Toffee-nosed and
dialog: useless. Her father was the Earl of
dialog: Carton which sounds good except he
dialog: didn‘t have a pot to piss in.

speaker_heading: MRS WILSON

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Can I ask a question?
speaker_heading: JENNINGS

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: I just wondered. How many people here

dialog: why they chose to go into it?
speaker_heading: JENNINGS
dialog: That‘s an interesting point and one I
dialog: can’t answer. All those of you whose

speaker_heading: MRS WILSON

speaker_heading: MRS WILSON
dialog: Everything’s under control, your

speaker_heading: JENNINGS
