text: PARIS, Gus’s 17 year old granddaughter, pops forward, looks

speaker_heading: TOULA (V.O.)

text: Gus honks hello. Athena yells back into the house.
speaker_heading: ATHENA
dialog: Move it, Aristotle!!

speaker_heading: COSTA
dialog: Yes, because what do you play

speaker_heading: ARISTOTLE

scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL STREET/STEPS - DAY
speaker_heading: GUS (V.O.)

text: watches Paris get out. Of course, Gus has one more nugget of
dialog: wisdom:
speaker_heading: GUS
dialog: Paris, keep your eyeballs open now
dialog: for a nice Greek boy. Make babies,
dialog: don’t waste your eggs.

text: Toula keeps waving to Paris, who wishes she would go away.
