scene_heading: EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING
dialog: 
text: SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer
text: sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly,
text: looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless
dialog: wheat field.
dialog: 
text: Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her
text: shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite
text: golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in
text: the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...
dialog: 
text: She smiles, and starts walking.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING
dialog: 
text: She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in
text: Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the
text: deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a
text: white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way
text: across the asphalt toward the vehicle...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING
dialog: 
text: COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined
text: driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the
text: passenger side and slams the door shut.
dialog: 
text: Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair,
text: piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes,
text: greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She
text: finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What time is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Early...
dialog: 
text: Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes,
text: then spits out the window. She starts the car...
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY
dialog: 
text: Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up
text: the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to
text: early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...
dialog: 
text: Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at
text: work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local
text: restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...
dialog: 
text: She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It
text: contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and
text: three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster
text: makes a face at Sam as they pass by...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine
text: start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit
text: the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Shit...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY
dialog: 
text: By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway,
text: steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the
text: car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.
dialog: 
text: Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the
text: steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the
text: inside of the engine with a hammer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Turn it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (poking her head out the
speaker_heading: WINDOW)
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Turn off the car.
dialog: 
dialog: Corey does so.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Doesn't look too good...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: How do you know?
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It smells funny.
dialog: 
text: Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward
text: them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...
dialog: 
text: The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a
text: brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him
text: she gets out too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for stopping. Our car's
dialog: messed up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: My check engine light came on, then
dialog: it just started smoking, and
dialog: ticking and shit.
dialog: 
text: As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange
text: looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on
text: the steam explosion.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: (shaking it off)
dialog: Blew your water pump. Can't drive
dialog: it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fuck me...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: El Reno's just a couple miles up
dialog: ahead. Can call for a tow there.
dialog: C'mon, I'll give you a lift.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/EL RENO, VARIOUS - DAY
dialog: 
text: All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up, they drive
dialog: through the center of El Reno, Oklahoma (population 16,000)
dialog: and see some of the locals out and about [MUSIC MONTAGE
text: fueled by early- to mid-90s era GRUNGE ROCK (suggestion: Come

scene_heading: RANDY EVANS (21), RUTH GIBBENS (18) and JEFF (21) and MIKE
text: JIMENEZ (20) loiter in the parking lot of a LIQUOR STORE...
dialog: 
text: TRUDY POTTER (39) flirts with FATHER HOMEIJER (54), a
text: Catholic priest, outside the BANK. A BANK SIGN shows the TIME
text: -- 12:00 PM -- then flashes to the DATE -- JUNE 18, 1995...
dialog: 
text: OFFICER RYAN O'DELL (31) has pulled over a PRETTY LADY and
text: uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate...
dialog: 
text: They come up on VIETNAM TOM (48), who ambles along the side
text: of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they
text: pass. He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi-
text: colored SKI MASK over his head and face...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: [END MONTAGE]
dialog: 
text: Sam swivels her head to watch Tom. ANOTHER CAR passes and he
text: waves to it as well. Chris picks up on her curiosity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: He waves to everybody... Just kinda
text: walks up and down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Resident nutcase?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: People call him Vietnam Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He was in the war?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: He thinks he was... kind of a joke,
dialog: ya know?

scene_heading: I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big
text: garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has
dialog: been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth
text: Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.
dialog: 
text: Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting,
text: bored as hell. A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged
text: into a crack in the walkway. The girls are forced to get up
text: when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Can I get out?
dialog: 
text: Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's
text: look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older
dialog: than her 18 years.
dialog: 
text: The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father.
text: She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some
text: CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After
text: this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes
text: outside to address Corey and Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Yeah... it's the water pump.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: So what do we do?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: I can order you up a new one.
dialog: Probably be a couple days.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Great. This the only show in town?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Cheapest and the best. But you want
dialog: me to call the tow guy back here,
dialog: no problem. Probably charge you
dialog: another hundred bucks, but he'll
dialog: get ya wherever you wanna go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Just go ahead and fix it.

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside
text: motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's
text: GERALD'S GAME when the girls enter. They each have a SMALL
text: SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: What can I do for you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: We need a room.
dialog: 
text: He gets out a notebook and lays it out on the counter. Corey
text: finds a pen and starts to fill out a registration form... A
text: NEWS BULLETIN about the O.J. SIMPSON TRIAL plays at a LOW
text: VOLUME on a TELEVISION in the b.g.
dialog: 
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How much is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: $39 a night. How many you stayin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Just a couple, we hope.
dialog: 
text: He takes the KEY to ROOM 15 off the rack.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well... welcome to El Reno.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the
text: street from the motel. Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike
text: Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion
dialog: to how they were earlier in the day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You get checked into the motel
dialog: alright?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yep.
dialog: 
text: Randy seems surprised that Ruth has already made their
text: acquaintance. He wastes no time in introducing himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: My name's Randy. This is Mike and
dialog: Jeff. Guess you already know Ruth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Corey.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm Samantha.
dialog: 
text: They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the
text: strangers. Sam hangs back a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: One of you guys mind pickin' us up
dialog: a bottle of something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I think I can manage that. What do
dialog: you want?
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don't know. Vodka, whiskey,
dialog: whatever.
dialog: 
text: Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the
text: money and heads for the store.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Be right back...
dialog: 
text: After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence
text: in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth
text: stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat
text: resentful of their presence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: From Virginia, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I saw your plates...
dialog: 
text: Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another
text: beat of uncomfortable silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Where to?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Your obviously just passin' through
dialog: here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We're on the way to Vegas.
dialog: 
text: Ruth snickers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Well... you need anything besides
dialog: booze, you just lemme know.
dialog: 
text: Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He
text: passes it off to Corey, along with some change.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Thanks a lot, man.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: No problem. You guys wanna come
dialog: back to my place for bit? Bring
dialog: your bottle, we got some weed...
dialog: 
text: Corey looks like she's considering it, but --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm really tired.
dialog: 
text: She takes Sam's signal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah, I think we'll just head back.
dialog: Been a long day, ya know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That's cool.

scene_heading: to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29
scene_heading: MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the
text: blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over
text: and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
dialog: 
text: TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the
text: nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed.
text: There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.
dialog: 
text: The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE
text: FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images
text: WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly
text: loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...
dialog: 
text: In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the
text: television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to
text: touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from
text: the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her
text: RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple,
text: with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded
text: under the skin and protruding from the wound.
dialog: 
text: She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and
text: fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD
dialog: 
text: A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a
text: phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which
text: objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions,
dialog: and move according to a framework of set paths.
dialog: 
text: A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic
text: life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a
text: CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF
text: INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's
dialog: field of vision...
dialog: 
text: It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She
text: has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is
text: cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER
text: TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees
text: Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30
text: feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of
dialog: his ski mask...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM
dialog: 
text: Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of
text: which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE,
text: CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his
dialog: arms...
dialog: 
text: His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to
text: what is sitting right beside him --
dialog: 
text: REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform,
text: and she stares off into distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The sky's so beautiful here...
dialog: 
text: Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at
text: her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: But we can't stay.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM
dialog: 
text: Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the
text: DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent
text: circle around his chest.
dialog: 
text: Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that
text: release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...
dialog: 
text: Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE
text: FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the
text: clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his
text: hand remains glued to the spot.
dialog: 
text: Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to
text: Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of
dialog: herself.
dialog: 
text: The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to
text: shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the
speaker_heading: COSMOS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISTORTED VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: 15 days... 18 hours... 45
dialog: minutes... 6 seconds. That is when
dialog: the world will end.
dialog: 
text: A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling
text: like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and
text: Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF
text: WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away
text: from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the
text: sky as he runs...
dialog: 
text: ...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening
scene_heading: THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to
text: peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that
text: stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a
dialog: policeman -- Officer O'Dell.
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: `Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.
dialog: 
text: Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near
text: the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when
text: she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.

speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Got anyplace to be?

dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNING
dialog: 
text: O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is
text: uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side
text: of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISPATCH (V.O.)
dialog: We got some kinda situation at
dialog: Frank Haley's farm...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: Copy that. I'm here now...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER
text: about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits
text: of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from
text: the broken WELL SEAL...
dialog: 
text: And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
dialog: crater.
dialog: 
text: Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam
text: and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there
text: looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into
text: town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS.
text: FRANK HALEY (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Un-fuckin'-believable...
dialog: 
text: The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FIREMAN #1
text: It's still warm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know how much it's gonna cost
dialog: me to replace this goddamn

speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: Sell this thing off to some

dialog: could do okay.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: What's all that stuff, Frank?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That whack job Tom's been squattin'

text: early this morning, alive and well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
speaker_heading: (SARCASTIC)
dialog: Oh, well, thank heavens...
dialog: 
text: Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN
text: MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and
text: looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the
text: damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...
dialog:

speaker_heading: COREY

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: For a water pump?

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: None of my business, but...
dialog: 
text: He's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks
text: nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out
text: and hustles into the field toward the crash site.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Chris regains his train of thought:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I was just gonna say, if you
dialog: wanted, I could give you a ride
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
text: at Corey, as if just remembering she was there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You too. I mean, I could give you
dialog: both a ride.

speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I can't believe your fucking

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They totally flipped out that I was

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: We should've waited till the end of

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She wouldn't have given you

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY

text: Corey pokes at the crushed ice in her glass with her straw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Doesn't matter. As soon as we get

dialog: said sometimes she makes two grand
dialog: in a week.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jesus.
dialog:

speaker_heading: AGATHA
dialog: These girls are from Virginia.

speaker_heading: TED

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY SAM
dialog: Okay. Thank you.

speaker_heading: AGATHA
dialog: Anything else you need, give a
text: holler.
dialog: 
text: Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their
dialog: food...
dialog: 
text: Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the
text: counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the
text: BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Just a coffee, please.
dialog: 
text: Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee,
text: Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him
text: doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Can we help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: No, no... it's just that I
dialog: recognize you. I saw you by the
dialog: motel. Pretty amazing, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I guess.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I just made a deal with Frank Haley
dialog: to buy it for seven-hundred fifty

speaker_heading: JEREMY

dialog: 
text: Corey rolls her eyes at being corrected. Sam smirks and
text: munches on a french fry -- she's enjoying their conversation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm gonna study it. I'm a grad
dialog: student at Redlands... we've
dialog: actually got a pretty cool geology
dialog: lab there.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: I've gotta do some tests, but if I
dialog: had to guess, I'd say it's a
dialog: siderite. They're composed

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Have fun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: My name's Jeremy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: That's nice.
dialog: 
text: Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or

text: her, and she can't help but smile back.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE/CHURCH - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the
text: home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his
text: flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC
text: CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.
dialog: 
text: When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from
text: his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his
text: forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What's his problem?
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just keep walking.
dialog:

text: Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Hey, what's up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Not much... just getting stared

speaker_heading: JEFF
dialog: Father Homeijer?

speaker_heading: MIKE

speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: (to Randy)
dialog: You got an extra cigarette?
dialog: 
text: Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I'm throwin' a big party at my
dialog: house tonight, you guys should come
dialog: by. No excuses this time...
dialog: 
text: Sam and Corey look at each other, considering.
dialog: 
dialog: 19.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're gonna be stuck in El Reno,
dialog: you might as well have some fun,
dialog: right?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from
text: early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER
text: and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL,
text: and a few people swim in the greenish water.
dialog: 
text: Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so
text: Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam
text: hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You guys gotta come visit the club
dialog: when we get all set up. We'll give
dialog: you the VIP treatment, man...
dialog: 
text: Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE
dialog: Sounds good to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Give us a little time, me and
dialog: Sam'll be runnin' that place, no
dialog: doubt... right?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah. Definitely.
dialog: 
text: Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam
text: appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her
dialog: cup for some liquid courage.
dialog: 
text: Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer
text: O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth
text: notices him first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Fuck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: That pig, O'Dell.
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Don't worry about Ryan. He might be
text: a cop, but he still likes to party.
dialog: 
text: Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his
text: pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE
text: GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I think that asshole knows I deal.
dialog: You know how fucked that is?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: From what I hear he's got a little
dialog: somethin' goin' on the side
dialog: himself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Fucking pig's a pig.
dialog: 
text: They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into
text: the pool and splashes them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MIKE JEFF
dialog: Fuck! Bastard!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What the hell...
dialog: 
text: Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth
text: watches her, smirking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: We might as well all go in now,
dialog: we're already wet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Good idea...
dialog: 
text: Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER
dialog: 
text: She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are
text: DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.
dialog: 
text: Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS
text: glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the
text: STAGE. Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE
dialog: can been seen...
dialog: 
scene_heading: In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11)
text: and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their
dialog: dance performance... BACK TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls
dialog: her up --
dialog: 
text: She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath --
text: back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible
dialog: for pulling her out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You fall asleep down there?
dialog: 
text: He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing.
text: Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...
dialog: 
text: She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and
text: jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in
text: approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in
text: right behind her.
dialog: 
text: Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps
text: are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's
text: surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Thought you could maybe use this.
dialog: 
text: As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the
text: inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam
text: wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.
dialog: 
text: Corey looks over and sees her getting out...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So what's so wrong at home that you
dialog: had to take off?
dialog: 
text: The question takes Sam by surprise.
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd love to get outta here someday
dialog: too... just don't know quite where
dialog: I'd go.
dialog: 
text: Sam decides to open up a little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I hate it there. It's like everyone
dialog: knows everything about me, but I'm
dialog: invisible at the same time. It's
dialog: like the worst of both worlds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Small towns. How `bout your family?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They didn't want me to leave...
dialog: well, they did, but they wanted me
dialog: to go away to Harvard or something
dialog: like that, like my sister.
dialog: 
text: Sam takes a big sip of her beer, showing signs of tipsiness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes I think it would've been
dialog: easier if... I just, after my
speaker_heading: BROTHER-
dialog: 
text: Sam stops herself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (changing gears)
dialog: That's why I love Corey, she just
dialog: doesn't give a shit. She does what
dialog: she wants and she doesn't care what
dialog: people think.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You just gotta be yourself, that's
dialog: all. What is it you wanna do
dialog: exactly?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I always thought I'd be a dancer,
dialog: like in a troupe or something...
dialog: 
text: Sam is self-conscious after admitting this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: That sounds kinda stupid probably.
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: When I was younger, my dance team
dialog: was on Star Search.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Really?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah... but I didn't go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I didn't end up dancing in the
dialog: talent show where they got
dialog: discovered... I didn't really feel
dialog: like it at the time anyway.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Huh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But that's why we're going to
dialog: Vegas. There's lots of
dialog: opportunities there.
dialog: 
text: Chris glances over to the pool where Corey is topless,
text: splashing and goofing around with some BOYS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
speaker_heading: (SMIRKING)
dialog: Yeah, good place for it. Gettin'
text: some practice on the way, too.
dialog: 
text: Sam takes offense, getting drunk and sensitive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is that supposed to be like some
dialog: kind of judgement or something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No, I was just-
dialog: 
text: She takes her beer and storms away from him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam, wait... hey, come on...
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be
text: alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but
text: no one else is in sight.
dialog: 
text: Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts
dialog: to pound the rest of her drink...
dialog: 
text: A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A
text: lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an
text: orange glow.
dialog: 
text: She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and
text: JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right
text: hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her
dialog: forehead...
dialog: 
text: A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing
text: her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front
text: of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS
dialog: 
text: Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex,
text: phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR
text: SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements
text: as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON,
text: and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNK GUY #1
dialog: Hurry up...
dialog: 
text: Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam
text: whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her,
text: but she doesn't flinch...
dialog: 
text: She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side
dialog: of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone
text: who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a
text: DITCH near a CULVERT --
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE: CULVERT
dialog: 
text: Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at
text: her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight
dialog: through to the other side...
dialog: 
text: A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the
text: circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the
text: phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong
text: enough to make them falter.
dialog: 
text: On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT
text: flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of
scene_heading: FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over
text: them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS
text: and approach the great WOOD DOORS...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past
text: her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...
dialog: 
text: Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of
text: Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.
dialog: 
text: Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right,
text: where two walls and the ceiling meet...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT
dialog: 
text: The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with
text: the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING
text: SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.
dialog: 
text: PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines,
text: with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.
dialog: 
text: A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he
text: stands below it, reaching higher and higher...
dialog: 
text: As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the
text: BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes
dialog: start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS
dialog: 
text: Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and
text: outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has
dialog: enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...
dialog: 
text: COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE
dialog: FLAME...
dialog: 
text: Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and
scene_heading: SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: OVER WHITE...
dialog: 
text: The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present
text: again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face.
text: She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the
dialog: beds.
dialog: 
text: She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES
text: are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
dialog: 
text: BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
dialog: 
text: She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
dialog: 
text: Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to
text: find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.

speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You plannin' on checkin' out today?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (GROGGY)
dialog: Uh... I, I don't know yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Well, it's already way past
dialog: checkout time, so you'd better
dialog: figure it out quick.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've just gotta find Corey... and
dialog: check on the car.
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: You do whatever you have to, but if
dialog: you're stayin' another night I
dialog: wanna see some money up front.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BANK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with
text: the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes
text: a chord but she doesn't know why...
dialog: 
text: The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It
text: changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11
scene_heading: MINUTES, 22 SECONDS... 21 SECONDS...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BANK - DAY
dialog: 
text: Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter
text: she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO-
text: WORKERS are consoling her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: I don't believe it... I still just
dialog: don't believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE CO-WORKER
dialog: It's gonna be alright. You'll see.
dialog: 
text: Trudy looks up and sees Sam waiting uncomfortably.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY

dialog: a tissue)
dialog: Can I help you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is everything okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: No, it's not... Mount Calvary
dialog: burned to the ground last night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Mount Calvary?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: Father Homeijer's church.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh... How did it happen?
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
text: The police are looking into it,
dialog: but... I know it was arson.
dialog: 
text: Trudy leans in to talk quietly to Sam.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's no secret to me how people in
dialog: this town feel about Father
dialog: Homeijer. The horrible accusations
dialog: that have been made against him...
dialog: But it's just a lot of nonsense. El
dialog: Reno's changed so much since I was
text: a kid growing up here. The young
dialog: people nowadays...
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: No offense.
dialog: 
text: She places her hand on top of Sam's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY (CONT'D)
dialog: But with all the drugs and the
dialog: crime... I just don't know what
dialog: this world's coming to anymore.
dialog: 
text: Sam tries to redirect her focus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you able to get money wired
dialog: here from my bank back home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: We don't usually work with other
dialog: banks like that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I need to check my balance and get
dialog: my money out. How do I do that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: You'll have to call and arrange it.
dialog: You could always use Western Union.
dialog: Where's your bank?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Virginia.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: Oh... `cause they're gonna need to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE: NEAR EXIT
dialog: 
text: As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with
text: another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
dialog: 
text: She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: How many cheeseburgers did we get?

speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Don't worry about it so much.

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The motel guy came to the room this

dialog: probably not even gonna have enough
dialog: money to pay for the car.
dialog: 
text: Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she
dialog: can reach a decision, something in the department store's
text: parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair,
text: wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...
dialog: 
text: But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
dialog:

speaker_heading: COREY
speaker_heading: (ABRUPT)
dialog: Lemme guess, you wanna go home.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You wanna run back to mommy and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (taken aback)
dialog: What are you talking about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY

dialog: grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...
dialog: 
text: They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming
text: up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from
text: the backseat, smelling the drama.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I knew you'd bail on me eventually,
dialog: but not this quick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not bailing on you. Would you
speaker_heading: JUST-
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You can fucking sleepwalk back to
dialog: Middlesex for all I care. I'm not
dialog: driving you... you're a fucking

dialog: 
text: The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the
text: intersection, making a left...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fuck you, Corey.
dialog: 
text: Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming
text: straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something
text: stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.
dialog: 
text: He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the
text: trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.
dialog: 
text: Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He
text: looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares
text: right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS
text: DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road.
text: Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of
dialog: the intersection.]
dialog: 
text: Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but
text: something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes
dialog: forward progress impossible.
dialog: 
text: RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit
text: it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and
text: watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into
dialog: infinite space.
dialog: 
text: She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier
text: once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KA-BOOM!
dialog: 
text: FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
text: RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the
text: front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
dialog: 
text: Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
dialog: 
text: Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
text: smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
text: plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
dialog: 
text: The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --
dialog: 
text: -- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: You're sure you didn't see a
dialog: driver?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No...
dialog: 
text: He takes the statement from her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: Well, you're one lucky girl to have
dialog: gotten outta the car when you did.
dialog: Front passenger side was wiped
dialog: right out. Coulda' been two dead
dialog: girls today instead of one.
dialog: 
text: Corey nods, taking this in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I talked to Randy and sent him home
dialog: a little while ago. He's pretty
dialog: shook up.
dialog: 
text: Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in
dialog: confidence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Both of us know he'd been doin'
dialog: some drinkin' today. But we also
dialog: know he's not at fault here. That

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Can't you just look up the license
dialog: plates?
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: No plates on the vehicle. We're
dialog: investigating the VIN, but that
dialog: could take a little more time,
dialog: depending on the history of
dialog: ownership. We'll find him.
dialog: 
text: Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What about the missing boy?
dialog: 
text: O'Dell shifts in his chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: You really think it was him, huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
text: He was on the side of the road
dialog: right before the accident.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know
dialog: sometimes shock does funny
dialog: things...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You think I was hallucinating?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: We were on the scene five minutes
dialog: after the accident. I think
dialog: somebody woulda noticed a little
text: boy wandering around.
dialog: 
text: He sees how troubled Corey is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Why don't you stop in and see Dr.
dialog: Peters on your way out... right
dialog: down the hall there. She'll give
dialog: you somethin' to make you feel
dialog: better.
dialog: 
text: Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out,
text: O'Dell's voice stops her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, uh... is there anything you
dialog: wanted to say to Samantha's
dialog: parents?
dialog: 
text: Corey's expression is blank.

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

text: wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.
dialog: 
text: Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's
text: about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the
text: police station behind her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Get the hell outta here.
dialog: 
text: Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris.

speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What're you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS

scene_heading: I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm real sorry about Sam.
dialog: 
text: Corey nods.
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's such a waste. Just a horrible,
dialog: freak thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I said some pretty shitty things to
dialog: her right before it happened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm sure she knew you didn't mean
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a
text: plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where
text: Sam's belongings are spread out.
dialog: 
text: She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
dialog: TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...
dialog: 
text: As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the
text: CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double
text: image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely,
text: Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.
dialog: 
text: The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
dialog: 
text: There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the
text: book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE
text: and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old
text: photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds
text: ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.
dialog: 
text: Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand...
text: She then looks down and notices that the book is open to:
scene_heading: CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fragmentary Universe...
dialog: 
text: She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric
text: of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes
text: corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary
dialog: Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than
text: several days... FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - LATER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits
text: up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint
text: but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming
dialog: from outside...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING
text: MACHINES on the side of the building...
dialog: 
text: ...until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey
text: freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY
text: HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.
dialog: 
text: Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from
text: elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a
text: faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT
dialog: You need to save me, Corey.
dialog: 
text: Corey stares at him in disbelief.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
dialog: You need to save me... and save the
dialog: world.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Why can't anyone see you?
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT
dialog: If you tell them about me they'll
dialog: think you're a dummy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Why me?
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT
dialog: I didn't pick you. Just like you
dialog: didn't pick me either.
dialog: 
text: Corey stands before him in awe, transfixed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
dialog: We shouldn't even be here. Nobody
dialog: should...
dialog: 
text: Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where
text: the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to
text: coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2...
text: 10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't have much time.
dialog: 
text: Corey is about to respond when the sound of a DOOR OPENING
text: stops her. The FLASHING NUMBERS on the vending machines go
text: back to normal PRICES, the CRYING SOUND CEASES, and Billy
dialog: disappears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL (O.S.)
dialog: What's goin' on out here?
dialog: 
text: Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes,
text: having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Nothing... I-I don't know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PHIL
dialog: Go back to your room and get some
dialog: sleep. You've had a tough day.

text: Phil goes back inside, leaving her alone.

scene_heading: INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
dialog:

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Hey... how ya feelin'?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Not so good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Is there anything I can do?

scene_heading: EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON

dialog: 
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG
text: OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up
text: one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Shouldn't you go back home?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: There's nothing for me to go home
dialog: to. Trust me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What about Sam's funeral?
dialog: 
text: Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What's the point? She's gone,
dialog: that's it. Nothing's gonna change
dialog: that...
dialog: 
text: Chris lets it go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Is there a library around here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
speaker_heading: (PUZZLED)
dialog: Yeah... you need a book?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So you guys were real close, huh.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: When I moved to Virginia Sam was
dialog: like the only person I could even
dialog: stand to talk to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: How long had you been plannin' your
dialog: trip together?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Not too long... kind of a last
dialog: minute thing. It was good timing,
dialog: `cause I don't like to stay in one
dialog: place for too long, ya know?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Huh...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I was really surprised when Sam
dialog: wanted to come, actually. I just
dialog: kinda brought it up one day, and
dialog: she was down...
dialog: 
text: Corey reflects for a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: If it wasn't for me, she'd still be
text: alive right now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS

scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That was Sam's brother?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
text: On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many

text: away by a CRANE.
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Her parents must be going through
dialog: hell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Sam said once she wished it landed
text: on her room instead of Donnie's.

dialog: Chris thinks on this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: I saw something on Sam's wrist the
dialog: other night... it looked like a
dialog: scar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: She told me it was from some
text: accident. Put her hand through a
dialog: window or something.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Did you believe her?
dialog: 
text: Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that
text: chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no
dialog: known origin...
dialog: 
text: A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY
text: A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the
dialog: air...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: God...
dialog: 
text: Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.
dialog: 
text: She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY
text: who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A
text: PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the
text: Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in
dialog: Munchkinland.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't understand why we're
dialog: lookin' at this stuff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: They still never found a driver to

dialog: standing right there. I didn't see
dialog: anyone.
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I was pretty close too, but
dialog: everything was all crazy. Whoever
dialog: it was must've jumped out and took
dialog: off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I found this book in Sam's backpack
dialog: last night. There's a chapter where

dialog: there's a reason why they happen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: A book...? I don't get what your
dialog: talkin' about. What was the reason?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: It didn't say.
dialog: 
text: Corey thinks, trying to figure out the right way to express
dialog: something...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: Last night, and right before the

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What?

text: Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.
dialog:

scene_heading: I/E. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: Chris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris'

dialog: 
text: They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're
text: cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and
text: barking in a frenzy --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH (O.S.)
dialog: Darielle!
dialog: 
text: The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out
text: of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage
text: over a cut on her forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Come to check on your car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
text: Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into
text: the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it
text: was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: Randy's been a wreck since the
dialog: accident.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
text: He should be. He was driving around
dialog: shit-faced and somebody got killed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: You can just fuck off...
dialog: 
text: She gets right up in his face with such intensity that Chris
text: retreats a step or two.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH (CONT'D)
dialog: Prima donna motherfucker think your
dialog: shit don't stink?
dialog: 
dialog: Corey steps in:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY

text: Chris gives her a look.

speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, there's nothing Randy

dialog: 
speaker_heading: RUTH
dialog: I'll get my dad.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Momentarily, Dusty comes out, a partially eaten SANDWICH in
dialog: hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: Got some bad news for you...
dialog: 
text: He walks them over to the car, finishing off his sandwich and
text: wiping his hands on his greasy jeans.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Your engine seized up when your
dialog: water pump blew.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I need a new engine now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: I can get one in there for you.
dialog: Cost you about fifteen hundred.
dialog: 
text: Corey's face drops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don't have anywhere near that
dialog: much money.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That's probably as much as the
dialog: car's worth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: I understand. But, I already
dialog: ordered the water pump, and I'll
dialog: have to get paid for my time. That
text: comes to about three-hundred total.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don't have that much either.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY
dialog: You think I do this for charity?

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DUSTY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER HOMEIJER
dialog: Good afternoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRUDY
dialog: We're taking collections to help

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER HOMEIJER
dialog: Any small amount you could manage

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sorry.
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FATHER HOMEIJER
dialog: God bless you.
dialog: 
text: They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Everybody wants somethin'...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What about you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: You wouldn't give me stuff and
dialog: drive me around if you didn't want
dialog: something in return.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: `Cause that's just not how it
dialog: works.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Maybe you're wrong about that.
dialog: 
text: Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: See ya.
dialog: 
text: She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The
text: Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the
text: b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL
text: INFOMERCIAL...
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE
text: runs over the TV screen.
dialog: 
text: Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the
text: television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN
text: is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...
dialog: 
text: Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to
text: answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Do you hate me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You think it's my fault she's dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: No...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You mean it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Yeah... it wasn't your fault.
dialog: 
text: Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What's that?
dialog: 
text: Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The
text: Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Oh, it's just... something of
dialog: Sam's.
dialog: 
text: Randy nods. Corey tosses the book onto the bed.

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You wanna get outta here for a
dialog: while? I got my dad's car.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a

text: LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.
dialog: 
text: There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most
text: containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.
dialog: 
text: Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the
text: other cars but still with a nice view.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I've been comin' up here since I
dialog: was a kid. Good place when you
dialog: wanna just get away from
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
text: Randy pushes in a TAPE (suggestion: River of Deceit, by Mad
text: Season), then takes a JOINT from his pocket and sparks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Is Ruth your girlfriend?
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Naw, we're just friends. She's
dialog: pretty weird sometimes. Too like...

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Seems like you guys are pretty
dialog: close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Yeah... don't worry about Ruth.
dialog: 
text: Randy takes another hit and holds it in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Do you ever have a hard time
dialog: telling what's real and what's not
dialog: real?
dialog: 
text: Randy exhales and looks over at her, perplexed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Sometimes... sometimes something
dialog: can feel really real, but it's just
dialog: your mind playing tricks on you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I've got so much shit in my head
dialog: right now... I've never felt so
dialog: outta control. I think I'm really
dialog: goin' psycho.
dialog: 
text: He passes her the joint.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I got some acid from my buddy one
dialog: time... this like flying eagle
dialog: pyramid shit. I took two hits, and
dialog: man... next thing I knew I was on
text: the floor, curled up in ball, and
dialog: Mike and Jeff were just standing
dialog: there lookin' down at me. I could
dialog: see this like glowing grid cutting
dialog: through my brain, and I knew when
dialog: it got all the way through I'd be
dialog: this sketched out vegetable. I
dialog: could picture my dad staring down
dialog: at me in the hospital in my
text: straightjacket, crying and shit...
dialog: 
text: Corey blows out a hit, captivated...
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: The whole time my esophagus was
dialog: like twisting and turning in my
dialog: throat and cutting off my air
dialog: supply... it was terrible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Jesus.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I can still slip back into it
dialog: sometimes, but I know now that my
dialog: brain is what's making it real...
dialog: and that's like a blessing and a
dialog: curse, man, `cause that means you
dialog: have to decide what's real and
dialog: what's not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: The things that feel the most real
dialog: right now are... impossible. More
text: like a dream.
dialog: 
text: Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the
text: car's ashtray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I know what you mean. The scariest
dialog: part is thinking you're not the
dialog: same person anymore. Something's
dialog: changed... like your identity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What if the change is for the
dialog: better?
dialog: 
text: Randy finds an INHALER in his pocket and takes a puff.

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That's fucked up.

speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: I don't think I even care if I'm
dialog: crazy.
dialog: 
text: Corey turns and looks into his eyes. Randy leans forward...
dialog: They're about to kiss, when --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck?
dialog: 
text: A DARK SHAPE scurries to an enclosed area at the edge of the
text: forest where there's a TARP, some WATER BOTTLES, CANS OF FOOD
dialog: and a RIFLE...
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living

dialog: 
text: As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them
dialog: with her eyes...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from
text: the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above
scene_heading: it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS,
text: POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.
dialog: 
text: A large BLACK &amp; WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE UP of COBAIN'S
text: FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET HOLE drawn in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: This is cool.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Thanks.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: They kiss...

scene_heading: INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER - NIGHT

text: A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a
text: SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to
text: 01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.
dialog: 
text: Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks
text: around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep
text: by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside
text: the bed and grabs her shirt...
dialog: 
text: ...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes --
text: because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his
text: BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT
dialog: Only one day left.
dialog: 
text: Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
dialog: 
text: As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery,
text: liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.
dialog: 
text: Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room,
text: elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Her SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the
text: sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path
text: leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...
dialog: 
text: Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as
text: she treads out the door...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road
text: about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is
text: guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.
dialog: 
text: The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in
text: space-time materializes.
dialog: 
text: There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF
text: THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive,
text: swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter-
dialog: dimensional realm of darkest night.
dialog: 
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL
text: RAINS are visible within...
dialog: 
text: Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE
text: AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: In contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's
text: garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter
text: WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.
dialog: 
text: Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already
text: been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on
dialog: the floor.
dialog: 
text: Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the
dialog: corner...
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT
dialog: You can do it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: How?
dialog: 
scene_heading: BILLY MOORCROFT
dialog: It's easy.
dialog: 
text: Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The
text: pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up
text: from the sink drain, also in the shower...
dialog: 
text: Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually
text: morose expression transforms into a smile.
dialog: 
text: The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares
text: into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --

dialog: 
scene_heading: POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET
dialog: 
text: Ruth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN

speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: See ya later, Sam.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON

dialog: 
text: She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting
dialog: herself to any more of their mockery...
dialog: 
text: The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the

text: from stepping into the street...
dialog: 
text: She quickens her pace, almost there when --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KA-BOOM!
dialog: 
text: FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT
text: RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the
text: front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
dialog: 
text: Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
dialog: 
text: Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR
text: smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle
text: plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
dialog: 
text: The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and
text: skitters harmlessly across the intersection --
dialog: 
text: The world goes SILENT.
dialog: 
text: CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

scene_heading: EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
dialog:

dialog: 
text: A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's
text: Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his
text: rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.
dialog: 
text: Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom
text: watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go
text: to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: You okay?
dialog: 
text: Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away

scene_heading: I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What the fuck are you talking
dialog: about?
dialog: 
text: Sam's benumbed expression doesn't change, but her tone is
text: caustic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: All I meant was, sometimes-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know what you meant, and it's
dialog: bullshit. When someone dies for no
dialog: reason you can't just make one up
dialog: to fill the void and make yourself
dialog: feel better. It sucks, and it fucks
dialog: everything up, but it doesn't mean
dialog: shit beyond that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I'm sorry, I-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You've obviously never lost anybody
dialog: like I have, `cause if you did
dialog: you'd already know that.
dialog: 
text: Chris doesn't try anymore. Sam immediately feels bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for the ride.
dialog: 
text: She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Sam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one
text: of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...
dialog: 
text: She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME
text: TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover,
text: her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.
dialog: 
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for
text: other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present
text: in both of the panes.
dialog: 
text: The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
dialog: 
text: She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside
text: the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with
text: her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko
dialog: family together...
dialog: 
text: Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie,
text: and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner
text: part of her right wrist...
dialog: 
text: She then glances down and notices that the book is open to:
scene_heading: CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Remnants...
dialog: 
dialog: A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the

scene_heading: EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD
dialog: 
text: She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE.

text: stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS
text: follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a
scene_heading: RUSTY TRACTOR...
dialog:

text: of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the
scene_heading: CORRUGATED ROOFING...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANGLE: STORAGE SHACK
dialog: 
text: She stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom.
text: He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and
text: looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --
dialog: 
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which
text: has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.
dialog: 
text: Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you scared?
dialog: 
text: As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes

text: NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you can hear me...
dialog: 
text: A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder,
text: enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...
dialog: 
text: The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend
text: inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING
dialog: 
text: Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.
dialog: 
text: It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that
text: she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T-
text: SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE
text: that leads down to the road below.
dialog: 
text: Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current
text: position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the
dialog: SLOPE...
dialog: 
text: Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming
text: toward her.

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: JEREMY

speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you believe that everything

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah... I learned that in science.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: And everything in the universe is

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, but do you believe that

text: Someone on the other end finally picks up:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROSE DARKO (V.O.)
dialog: Hello?
dialog: 
text: When Sam HEARS her MOTHER'S VOICE, it brings tears to her

scene_heading: EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out
text: over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through
text: his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms
text: like a soldier at rest.
dialog: 
text: He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to
text: him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT,
text: JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her
dialog: forehead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You wanna know what happens when
dialog: you die?
dialog: 
text: Tom shakes his head no.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I wish it was me.
dialog: 
text: She looks at Tom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I really want... to die.
dialog: 
text: Tom aims his gun at her face...
dialog: 
text: He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them,
text: because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier
text: bends and becomes slightly opaque.
dialog: 
text: Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it
text: on the trigger.
dialog: 
text: He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE,
text: and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate
text: system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL
text: QUADRANT...
dialog: 
text: Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.
dialog: 
text: A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel.
text: Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...
dialog: 
text: The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when
text: the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to
dialog: accommodate the penetrating force...
dialog: 
text: The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but
text: then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same
text: spot, centimeters from her face --

speaker_heading: CHRIS

speaker_heading: DIDN'T-

speaker_heading: CHRIS

text: There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION
text: ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.
dialog: 
text: As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain
text: his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in
text: an extremely SMALL CAGE...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Here's my station.
dialog: 
text: He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and
text: retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid-
text: like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
text: The rest is locked away somewhere
dialog: else... somewhere safe. Everyone's
dialog: gonna want a piece of this thing
dialog: pretty soon.
dialog: 
text: He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns
text: it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's
text: VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever seen one of these?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: It's a scanning electron
dialog: microscope. It uses electrons
text: instead of light to scan the image.
dialog: 
text: A BLACK &amp; WHITE IMAGE appears on the microscope's MONITOR --
text: it's a geometric collage of all shapes and shades.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: At first I thought it was a
dialog: siderite, but then I saw it was
dialog: more than that. Much more. It does
dialog: have a percentage of nickel and
dialog: iron in it as I first suspected.
dialog: But it also has something else.
dialog: 
text: He waits for Sam to take the bait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: And what's that?
dialog: 
text: He points to cluster of BRIGHT WHITES on the monitor. Their
text: shapes are strangely different than the others surrounding
dialog: them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: An unrecognizable element. I've
dialog: done all the tests. It doesn't
dialog: exist on the periodic table.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy is practically beaming.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So this is pretty major.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: This is history. I'm thinking of
dialog: calling it framium.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Framium?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: For my last name... Frame.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What if it's like... proof of some
dialog: alien life-form from another galaxy
dialog: or something.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy's tone becomes serious, and he starts to scratch at
text: his left forearm as he talks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: It's very important you promise me
dialog: you won't tell anyone else what
dialog: I've showed you. I have to wait
dialog: till just the right moment. NASA,
dialog: or some secret government
dialog: organization could come in here and
dialog: take it away from me...
dialog: 
text: As Jeremy gets more worked up, he scratches harder...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: And then later on, years from now,
dialog: take credit for the discovery
dialog: themselves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I won't say anything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
text: Sam stares at him for a long beat, as if examining him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There's this book I think you'd
dialog: like... I got it from my physics

speaker_heading: JEREMY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Time travel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah, but it's not really that.
dialog: It's more like one scenario, or one

dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My life seems to be full of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Mysteries are what make life
dialog: interesting...
dialog:

text: Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a mystery to me, Samantha.
dialog: 
text: He goes in for a kiss, but Sam gently pushes him away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Ow...
dialog: 
text: Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. Sam looks down and
text: sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger
text: RASH, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto
text: his forearm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That doesn't look good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I should get some Hydrocortisone.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (regarding the attempted
speaker_heading: KISS)
dialog: Sorry about that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I'm sorry. I should've know better.

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: FATHER HOMEIJER
dialog: Who's there?
dialog: 
text: He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's
dialog: nearly frozen in shock --
dialog: 
text: The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits
text: on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth.
dialog: 
text: He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a

speaker_heading: OFFICER HINES
dialog: I saw you snatch the drugs outta

text: O'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: I don't think I know what the hell
dialog: you're talkin' about.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER HINES
dialog: Don't bullshit me either...
dialog: 
text: Hines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER HINES (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't wanna turn you in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: Then what do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER HINES
dialog: How much you think you'll get when
dialog: you unload it?
dialog: 
text: O'Dell keeps cool, but resents being muscled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: Depends.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER HINES
dialog: I'll take forty percent this time,
dialog: but from now on it's fifty-fifty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: What do you mean from now on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER HINES
dialog: I got a pretty good idea this ain't
dialog: the first time you done this. Won't

dialog: 
text: Hines extends his hand and smiles. O'Dell shakes it.
dialog: Grudgingly...
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: After Hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house,
text: O'Dell kicks the ground angrily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL
dialog: Shit!
dialog: 
text: When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer
text: from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that
text: it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.
dialog: 
text: Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive
dialog: stance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on outta there. Now!
dialog: 
text: He becomes tense when Tom emerges, because he sees that he's
dialog: got his RIFLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck you doin' carryin'
dialog: that around in the town proper?
dialog: 
text: O'Dell realizes that he's not holding it in a threatening
text: manner, but cradling it in his arms.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hand it over. Right now!
dialog: 
text: Tom steps toward him ever so slowly. O'Dell reaches out and
text: Tom hands him the gun, stock first.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: I should arrest you and throw you
dialog: in jail, you know that? Crazy
dialog: sonofabitch...
dialog: 
text: Tom looks at the ground, hunched over meekly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D)
dialog: Get the fuck outta my sight.
dialog: 
text: O'Dell looks around as Tom shuffles off, making sure no one
dialog: witnessed the transaction.

scene_heading: EXT. LOOKOUT - SUNSET

scene_heading: EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - SUNSET
dialog: 
text: She comes upon Tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area
text: near the lookout, and looks around before approaching.
dialog: 
text: When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things,
text: she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it
dialog: up.
dialog: 
text: She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and
dialog: jagged teeth...
dialog: 
text: She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her.
text: When she senses his presence she's startled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sorry...
dialog: 
text: She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says
text: nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her
text: there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
dialog: 
text: After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise,
text: Tom begins to speak:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIETNAM TOM
dialog: My mom told me someday everybody
dialog: would understand. She said it was
dialog: my job to look out for the town...
dialog: so that's what I do. That's what I
dialog: always do.
dialog: 
text: Sam listens to him intently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIETNAM TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: They don't know why. They don't
dialog: even want me here, but I still have
dialog: to protect them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: They're lucky to have someone to
dialog: protect them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIETNAM TOM
dialog: I'm used to it... I'm lucky to have
dialog: a job to do. Some people don't have
dialog: any reason to be here at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I know what you mean...
dialog: 
text: Tom turns and looks at her strangely.
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VIETNAM TOM
dialog: You're more important than all of
dialog: us.
dialog: 
text: Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask.
text: Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...
dialog: 
text: When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping
text: her -- not too rough, but forceful.
dialog: 
text: Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes
text: drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side.
text: Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.
dialog: 
text: When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with
text: emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you like to read?
dialog: 
text: Tom says nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You can borrow it...
dialog: 
text: Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly
text: and walks away, leaving Tom with the book.

dialog:

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Nothing... just that I haven't see

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No... I've been around. Going for

speaker_heading: JEREMY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I'd really love to check it out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh...
dialog: 
text: Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: You said you'd show it to me
dialog: sometime, and I've got a hunch it
dialog: could really help me in some of my
dialog: studies related to-
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't have it anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I kind of... gave it to someone.

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: To who? Why?

speaker_heading: GUY-

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well... that Vietnam Tom guy.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy is furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the

speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No... I just-

text: Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns
text: and finds Chris standing behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: That's enough.
dialog: 
text: Sam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: This is none of your business.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: It is, actually. You're disturbing
dialog: my customers. Get out.
dialog: 
text: Jeremy brushes past Sam as he leaves, and she and Chris are

speaker_heading: SAM
speaker_heading: (MUTTERING)
dialog: You didn't have to do that.

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: How's it feel?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A little better...
dialog: 
text: The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the
text: grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic
text: METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent.
dialog: 
text: After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy...
dialog: 
text: The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to
text: see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the
dialog: greater part of it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Good God...
dialog: 
text: Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up
text: his jacket and puts it back on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (ALARMED)
dialog: Is that from the meteorite?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I barely even notice it anymore.
dialog: I'm sure it'll go away soon.
dialog: 
text: He zips up his jacket tight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Do you think I'm disgusting?
dialog: 
text: The question takes Sam by surprise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No... I just think you should get
dialog: it looked at-
dialog: 
text: Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a
dialog: forceful kiss...
dialog: 
text: Sam shoves him away sharply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
dialog: 
dialog: 104.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: So you do find me disgusting. Which
dialog: is it, Sam, I can't take much more
dialog: of this shit!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Jesus Christ...
dialog:

speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Come here!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam tears through the woods, Jeremy close behind her. The
text: FIREWORKS CRACK and POP in the sky above...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Sam! Stop!
dialog: 
text: Sam jumps over a fallen log in the dark... Jeremy hits it
text: dead on with his shins and goes head over heels --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: FUCK!
dialog: 
text: He picks himself up and charges even faster --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tom sits alone in his jail cell, morose, staring at the
text: floor. He looks up when he senses someone approaching...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Sam sprints by the area of Vietnam Tom's squatting ground.
text: FIREWORKS continue to EXPLODE and shower overhead, and some
text: PEOPLE can be HEARD LAUGHING and SHOUTING from the main
text: parking area, not far away...
dialog: 
text: Sam runs toward the VOICES --
dialog: 
text: But Jeremy grabs her from behind and spins her around!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why are you doing this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: I just wanna talk to you!
dialog: 
dialog: 105.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She struggles against his grip. The EXPLOSIONS and the RUCKUS
text: from CROWD mask their noise.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop it!
dialog: 
text: Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He
text: starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her
dialog: across the face --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking bitch!
dialog: 
text: Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and
dialog: shoves her hard --
dialog: 
text: Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the
text: metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the
text: SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
dialog: 
text: She struggles no more.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open
text: and she is completely still.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
dialog: Sam?...
dialog: 
text: Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to
text: her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble...
dialog: 
text: The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and
text: the BLACK CLOUDS overhead...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS...
dialog: 
text: He comes face to face with Sam.
dialog: 
dialog: 106.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She stares back at him through the bars from the other side.
text: She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints
text: off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the
text: parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears
text: stream down his cheeks...
dialog: 
text: He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a
text: vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's
text: CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him.
dialog: 
text: Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by
text: the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Where the hell is Sam?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEREMY
speaker_heading: (FRANTIC)
dialog: I don't know... I don't know...
dialog: 
text: Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand
text: him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down
dialog: the hill...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the
text: FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE.
text: Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession.
text: PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby...
dialog: 
text: Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: No...
dialog: 
text: He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body
dialog: close...
dialog: 
text: As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him.
text: Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam.
text: The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them...
dialog: 
text: Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches
text: down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with
text: SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night
text: full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of
text: bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE.
dialog: 
text: Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts
text: through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's
text: swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: 15 days... 18 hours...

scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
text: TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the

scene_heading: EXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT
dialog:

text: BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP.
dialog: 
text: Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As

dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING
dialog: 
text: Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER

text: of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from
text: the broken well seal.
dialog: 
text: A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the
dialog: crater...
dialog: 
text: Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive
text: on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other
text: POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned
text: off with POLICE TAPE.
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil
text: Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried
text: off in a BLACK BAG...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh my God...
dialog: 
text: Sam moves to stand by Corey. The overall mood is grim, and
text: Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don't believe it...
dialog: 
text: The Firemen drop the porous, misshapen clod by his feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: This is just a tragedy.
dialog:

speaker_heading: SAM

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: So you guys stayed here last night?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: One of us did.

speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: What's up with your car?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's none of my business, but...
dialog: 
text: He's distracted when JEREMY'S BMW pulls up and parks. He hops

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What?
dialog: 
text: Chris regains his train of thought:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: I was just gonna say, if you
dialog: wanted, I could give you a ride
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over
text: at Corey, as if just remembering that she were there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You too. I mean, I could give you
dialog: both a ride.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY

speaker_heading: (INTERRUPTING)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: COREY
dialog: Fuck that. I'll wait for my car and

dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Corey...
dialog: 
text: Sam looks back to Chris, who is uncomfortable for causing the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHRIS
dialog: Sorry to screw you guys up.

speaker_heading: SAM
