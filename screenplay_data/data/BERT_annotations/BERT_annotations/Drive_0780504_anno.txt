scene_heading: 1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1
dialog: 
text: We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
text: as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
text: the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER O/S
dialog: ...hundred thousand streets in this city,
dialog: you don't need to know the route. You give
dialog: me a time and place, I give you a five
dialog: minute window. Those five minutes I'm
dialog: yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute
dialog: either side you're on your own...
dialog: 
text: As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
scene_heading: 2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2
dialog: 
text: A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
text: routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER O/S
dialog: ...One last thing. You won't be able to
dialog: reach me at this number again...
dialog: 
text: DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
text: in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
text: packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
text: cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
text: Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3
dialog: 
text: Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
text: bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
text: out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
text: way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle
dialog: 
scene_heading: 4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4
dialog: 
text: The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
text: only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
text: passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
text: Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
text: carefully, letting other cars overtake.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5

scene_heading: 6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6
dialog: 
text: Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
text: elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
text: pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
text: meet briefly, before Driver walks on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7
dialog: 
text: Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
dialog: apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
text: sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
text: tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8
dialog: 
text: Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
text: the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
text: shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
text: lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
dialog: vintage cars.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9
dialog: 
text: SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
text: follows him past rows of vintage cars.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: ...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but
text: with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
dialog: You get any sleep?
dialog:

speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: I can offer you some Halcyon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Won't work.
dialog: 
text: They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
text: arrive at a plain looking Impala.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHANNON
dialog: There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular
dialog: car in the state of California...
dialog:

scene_heading: 10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10
dialog: 
text: The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
text: Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
text: of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
text: 9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11
dialog: 
text: A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
text: Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
text: signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
text: making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
text: the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
dialog: ...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
dialog: Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
dialog: buried!...
dialog: 
text: Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
text: scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
text: Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
dialog: commentary now.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE SCANNER
dialog: ...9 Adam 81, what is your current
dialog: location?...Repeat, what is your current
dialog: location?...
dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
dialog: ...Another unbelievable three pointer from
text: Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
dialog: 
text: Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
text: doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
text: bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
text: pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
text: blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
text: The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
dialog: ...Time out Knicks...
dialog: 
text: The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
text: commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
dialog: 
text: The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
text: going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
text: minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
text: bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
text: without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.

speaker_heading: 11 CONTINUED: 11
dialog: 
text: The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
text: scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
text: His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
dialog: what's happened to his partner.
dialog: 
text: Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
text: his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
text: fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
text: few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 12 INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 12
dialog: 
text: Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
text: Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
text: speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
text: masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
text: his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
text: his police scanner crackles to life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE SCANNER
dialog: ...Attention all units...211...Superstore
text: on Traction Avenue...Suspects headed
text: Eastbound on 1st Street...Driving a Silver
dialog: Impala...
dialog: 
text: Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.
text: River again, heading back in the same direction he came.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE SCANNER
text: ...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle
text: Heights...All units standby. Repeat, all
dialog: units standby...
dialog: 
text: Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
text: sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
text: Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
text: switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 13 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ALLEYWAYS/INDUSTRIAL AREA/DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 13
dialog: 
text: The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
text: out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
text: It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
text: probing to see if there's anyone out there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE SCANNER
dialog: ...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle
dialog: Avenue...No sign of suspects...Repeat, no
dialog: sign of suspects...
dialog: 
text: The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car
text: glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5
dialog: 9/24/10
speaker_heading: 13 CONTINUED: 13
dialog: 
text: It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
text: taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
text: there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
text: same direction as the black-and-white.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14
dialog: 
text: It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
text: at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
text: won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
text: through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
text: shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
text: ...And for the first time in the game the
dialog: Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to
dialog: go in the Fourth here at the Staples
dialog: Centre...
dialog: 
text: Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
text: swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
text: anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
text: the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
text: chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
dialog: 
text: Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
text: helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
text: just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
text: closer and closer.
dialog: 
text: Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
text: there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
text: slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
text: chopper's searchlights spot them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 15 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.15
dialog: 
text: The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
text: crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
text: can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
text: the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 16 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 16
dialog: 
text: Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
text: Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
text: factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
text: The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
text: basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
text: sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.

scene_heading: 17 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 17
dialog: 
text: There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
text: behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
text: still playing.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
text: ...Three thirteen left on the clock.
dialog: Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the
dialog: Clippers by one...
dialog: 
text: The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
text: trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
text: approaching in the opposite direction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
dialog: ...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans.
dialog: This game really is too close to call...
dialog: 
text: The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
text: Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
text: turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE SCANNER
dialog: ...This is 1 David 16...Silver Impala
dialog: headed South on Broadway and
dialog: Pico...Couldn't get a look at her license

text: the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE SCANNER
dialog: ...1 David 11...suspect headed West on
dialog: Pico...
dialog: 
text: Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
text: smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
text: glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
text: overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
text: its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
dialog: 
text: Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
text: of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around

dialog: 
speaker_heading: POLICE SCANNER
dialog: All units...pursuit in progress...silver

scene_heading: 20 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE/ PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 20
dialog: 
text: The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the

text: ticket and roars into the parking lot.
dialog: 
scene_heading: 21 INT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 21
dialog: 
text: The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game
text: going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
text: into a free parking space.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
dialog: ...Thirty seconds remaining and all the
dialog: Knicks have to do is run out the clock...

dialog: 
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
dialog: ...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed
text: for most of the game, the Clippers have
dialog: shown incredible resilience...
dialog: 
text: Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They

dialog: 
scene_heading: 22 EXT. STAPLES CENTRE/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 22
dialog: 
text: Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping

text: reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP
text: GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.

text: window where he just shot her.
dialog: 
text: Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he

dialog: 
text: Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
text: the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as

text: up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
dialog: doll.
dialog: 
text: The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
text: it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
text: his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
text: all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
text: man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.

dialog: 
text: Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up

text: reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
dialog: 
text: Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his

dialog: 
text: Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
dialog: footsteps.
dialog: 
text: Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the

dialog: car.
dialog: 
text: Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
text: him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
dialog: 
text: Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She

dialog: 
text: Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the

dialog: 
text: The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering

dialog:
