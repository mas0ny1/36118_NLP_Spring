dialog: heroin?
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Not combined...
speaker_heading: RICKY

dialog: 14
dialog: 11.
text: Paulie stumbles out into the back garden. An OLD LADY hanging
text: washing backs away in fright.
text: Paulie is up and over the BACK FENCE into an alley -- but
text: Zak's right behind him -- barrels down onto him, drags him
text: backwards. The OLD LADY peers over the fence -- as Zak rifles
text: through Paulie’s pockets, pulls out a few bags of weed and
dialog: pills.
speaker_heading: PAULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s not mine.
speaker_heading: ZAK
dialog: Then why did you run?

speaker_heading: PAULIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Owww.
speaker_heading: ZAK
dialog: Get in the van.
text: The Old Lady watches, confused, as Zak pushes Paulie down the

speaker_heading: TOWNIE

speaker_heading: TOWNIE
dialog: I told you. We don’t like

speaker_heading: HANNAH
dialog: How do you know if you’ve never
dialog: been?
speaker_heading: TOWNIE
dialog: I’ve never had rectal bleeding but
dialog: I’m pretty sure I’m not a fan of
dialog: that either.
text: Her friend snickers. Raya steps toward them both menacingly.
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: Why don’t I stick her head up your
dialog: arse, and you can find out?
text: There is real threat in Raya’s eyes. The Townie’s scuttle
text: off, unnerved. Then from a safe distance they call back --
speaker_heading: TOWNIE
dialog: (calling back)
dialog: Freaks!
text: Hannah and Ellie look rattled. Raya calls after the Townies.
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: Yeah, we are. And proud of it!
text: She grins at Hannah and Ellie, who smile back. The girls
text: return to flyer-ing.
text: Zak's theme tune -- THRASH METAL chorus of ‘ZODIAK! ZODIAK! --

speaker_heading: ZAK (CONT'D)
dialog: No? Ever done any wrestling, mate?
speaker_heading: CALUM
dialog: Don’t take the piss.
text: Calum picks up a WHITE CANE -- slowly walks away. We realize -

text: Zak looks at his sister. He scurries after Calum tenaciously.
text: Raya follows.
speaker_heading: ZAK

speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: Posh.
speaker_heading: ZAK
text: Her dad is teetotal.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: So am I.
speaker_heading: ZAK
dialog: Yeah, but he’s teetotal out of

speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Oh, la-de-dah.
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: He just wants to make a good
dialog: impression when they get here.
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Make a good impression, how?
speaker_heading: ZAK
dialog: Can you put a shirt on for dinner?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: How fuckin’ posh are they?!
speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: Why’s a posh bird goin’ out with a
dialog: wrestler?
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: ‘Cause he told her he’s gonna be
dialog: rich and famous.
dialog: 22
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: ZAK
dialog: No. ‘Cause I’m kind and

dialog: bedroom, when I’m an animal.
speaker_heading: RAYA RICKY

speaker_heading: DAPHNE

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: If it was all fake, Daph, would I
dialog: have broken my leg three times? My
dialog: collar bone twice?
speaker_heading: RICKY
dialog: Would me elbow bend like this?
text: He shows them his elbow. It’s lumpy, mis-shapen, and bends at

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: That’s nothin’. You should see his

dialog: Oh, this is such a romantic story.
dialog: Do you want to tell it?
speaker_heading: RICKY

speaker_heading: RICKY

speaker_heading: JULIA
dialog: I'd been abused and livin’ on the

dialog: Mainly violence, yep.
speaker_heading: RICKY

speaker_heading: DWAYNE
dialog: Right. This is a fictionalized
dialog: world but the fans can tell if

speaker_heading: ZAK
dialog: When I was three years old, I could
dialog: name every WWE wrestler just by
dialog: looking at his boots; I’ve wanted

speaker_heading: RAYA (CONT'D)
dialog: My whole family are wrestlers, I’ve
dialog: been wrestling since before I was

text: Dwayne leans forward, intrigued.
speaker_heading: RAYA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sending me home is not a threat,

dialog: Is that a threat?
speaker_heading: RAYA ZAK

speaker_heading: RAYA

speaker_heading: ZAK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: I don’t care if you were taught by
dialog: the Zebra Kid, the Elephant Man or
dialog: the fuckin’ Lion King -- this ain't
dialog: the ass-crack of England anymore,
dialog: this is the NXT. If you want any
dialog: chance of makin’ it on to the Main
dialog: Roster, you do what I say, when I
dialog: say it, or you can fuck off back
dialog: home to The Addams Family.
dialog: Understood?
speaker_heading: RAYA

scene_heading: 47 EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - POOL - DAY 47
text: Kirsten and Jeri-Lynn are sunbathing.
speaker_heading: JERI-LYNN
dialog: -- and the next minute she’s “Oh
dialog: sorry, it was an accident”. So it’s
dialog: like, are you an expert or not?
dialog: (then)
dialog: I can’t understand half of what she
text: says. She sounds like she has a
dialog: dick in her mouth... but not ina
dialog: good way.
text: Raya appears. Jeri-Lynn stops speaking. Flashes a smile.
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: Sorry about before. With Madison.
dialog: It was an accident. I didn’t
dialog: realize until, like, two months ago
dialog: she was just a cheerleader.
speaker_heading: KIRSTEN
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: Yeah. Lot of times the WWE hire
dialog: cheerleaders or models, girls who
dialog: just wanna jiggle their tits and
dialog: ass, you know, get famous --
dialog: instead of girls who’ve actually
dialog: wrestled before.
speaker_heading: KIRSTEN
dialog: Where did you wrestle before?
speaker_heading: RAYA
dialog: W.A.W. in England. I was Ladies

speaker_heading: KIRSTEN
dialog: Well... nice to meet you.

scene_heading: EXT. FLORIDA BEACH - DAY 48
text: The SUN burns down on The Class as Hutch puts them through
text: merciless BLOW UP DRILLS: bellybusters -- atomic sit ups --
text: squatting with KETTLE BELLS -- suplexing WEIGHT BAGS.
text: Hutch shouts abuse -- hollers commands -- scanning them for

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 49

dialog: Lynn, then Madison.
text: Kirsten reaches a HEAVY TRACTOR TIRE. Dumps her sandbag --

text: Raya catches up -- struggles to get under her tire. Sweating
text: hard, she gives herself an extra boost -- flipping her tire
text: over -- trying to catch up with Kirsten.
text: Jeri-Lynn is close behind.
text: Raya soldiers through pain but Kirsten powers on -- gives a
text: FINAL PUSH. Crosses the ‘finish line’ -- victorious.
text: Raya, lungs working overtime, arrives behind her in second
text: place. She drops, exhausted. Finds Kirsten staring at her
text: with steel-cold eyes.
text: Jeri-Lynn slumps down next to them.
text: Madison is way behind, still doggedly trying to hoist her
text: tire. It’s a losing battle. Hutch hollers at her.
speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: Flip it!
speaker_heading: MADISON
dialog: It’s too hard...
speaker_heading: HUTCH
dialog: How you gonna throw a girl round a
dialog: ring every night if you can’t even
dialog: flip a tire? Now flip it!
