speaker_heading: PITCH BLACK
dialog: Screenplay
dialog: by
dialog: David Twohy
dialog: Based on material by Ken and Jim Wheat
dialog: Revised First Draft
speaker_heading: 3/3/98
scene_heading: NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
text: AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS
scene_heading: SOFT COPY.
text: NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON-
scene_heading: PREFORMAT FONT "TIMES NEW ROMAN". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED
text: TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.
text: Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are
text: seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are
text: felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling
text: coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life
dialog: when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake
text: hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates
text: that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do,
text: but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters.
text: For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and
dialog: lack of the same.
dialog: David Twohy
speaker_heading: CUT IN:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN
text: A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...
text: CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew
text: lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the
text: deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
text: The world is dying around her.
text: Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the
text: next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE
text: is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But
text: in the next cryo-locked...
text: The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.
text: Slapping an intercom:
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to
dialog: the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,
dialog: I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your
dialog: E-release...no, red handle, red handle.
dialog: I'll get the warm-ups out while --
scene_heading: PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin,
text: blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
text: INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS
text: HISSING in the air.
text: Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...
text: Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --
text: but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Why did I fall on you?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was
dialog: looking right at him when --
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22
dialog: weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to
dialog: kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,
dialog: I mean, why did I fall at all?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',
dialog: wait. I'm Owens. Right?
text: They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own
dialog: identities.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs
dialog: brain cells.
scene_heading: INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
text: They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up
text: suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.
speaker_heading: FRY
text: 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,
dialog: shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'
text: took a swipe at us.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Just tell me we're still in the shipping
dialog: lane. Just show me all those stars, all
dialog: those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
text: Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us.
dialog: That's why they have gravity.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Jesus God....
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
text: The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons
text: already disintegrating.
scene_heading: INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK
text: Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to
text: steady herself. Over a headset:
speaker_heading: OWENS (V.O.)
dialog: They trained you for this, right? Fry?
speaker_heading: FRY?
text: She doesn't answer.
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
text: times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters
dialog: open to reveal...
text: CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights
text: on a dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.
scene_heading: INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: ... crisis program selected Number Two of
dialog: this system because it shows at least some
dialog: oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you
dialog: SHUT THE FUCK UP!
dialog: (hammers a button,
speaker_heading: SILENCES ALARMS)
dialog: -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure
dialog: at surface-level. Okay, so maybe the ship
dialog: did something right for a change....
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: As Fry runs more switches.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP - DAY
text: As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
text: MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's
text: skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --
dialog: including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts
text: the ship into a dangerous roll.
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws
dialog: actuators...
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
text: And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the
text: ship's still coming in nose-high.
scene_heading: INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: ...showing no major water bodies...maximum
text: terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...
text: largely cinder and gypsum with some
dialog: evaporite deposits....
text: JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the
text: passenger compartment. It scares him for a new reason.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Fry? What're you doing?
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Fry?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Can't get my nose down...too much load
dialog: back there....
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: You mean that "load" of passengers?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: So what, we should both go down too?
dialog: Out of sheer fucking nobility?
text: Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will
text: jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN
text: SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.
text: He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken
text: awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across
dialog: from his, finding...
text: RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged
text: in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes
scene_heading: "LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY
dialog: RELEASE."
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible
dialog: for every one of those --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Company's not here, is it?
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: When captain went down, you stepped up --
dialog: whether you like it or not. Now they
dialog: train you for this, so --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: And there wasn't a simulated cockroach
text: alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
dialog: crash site! That's how they train you!
dialog: On a fucking simulator!
text: Owens unbuckles from his chair.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Don't touch that switch!
text: Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.
text: But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I'm not dying for them.
dialog: She pushes it. But this time...
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
text: No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
text: through the clouds.
scene_heading: INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
text: Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and
dialog: blocked them open.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Owens!
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to
dialog: level this beast out!
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more
text: speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being
text: pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...
text: The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's
text: just a glimpse of landscape before...
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY
text: An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into...
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but
text: impossibly it holds. For now.
speaker_heading: OWENS (V.O.)
dialog: What the shit was that?
text: Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking
text: into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression
dialog: of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...
text: A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.
scene_heading: INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY
text: INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he
text: claws at safety restraints.
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.
text: Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up
text: into view. Land.
dialog: 40 meters...30...20...10....
dialog: Fry braces.
text: IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.
scene_heading: INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN
text: IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,
text: Owens slams into the ceiling.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY
text: IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he
dialog: would've stayed inside, because just beside him...
text: The hull is cracking open.
text: NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...
text: skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and
text: disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.
dialog: 40 lives.
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY
text: Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.
text: FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.
text: But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.
text: Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...
text: Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA.
speaker_heading: BLACKOUT
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,
text: CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in
dialog: Arabic. Soon we find...
text: Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...
text: Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.
text: Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --
text: spooky combination. Nearby he sees...
text: The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a
text: jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...
text: AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Somethin' went wrong, huh?
text: Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet
text: lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...
text: getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
text: a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...
text: Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a
text: ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.
text: Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
text: finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of
dialog: the chained feet so that...
text: Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on
text: his neck.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: One chance and you blew it, Riddick.
dialog: Never cease to disappoint me.
scene_heading: INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
text: It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search
text: elsewhere, Johns turns back at...
speaker_heading: FRY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Hey, who?
speaker_heading: FRY (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, me. Over here.
text: His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns
text: crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
text: her. Fry. Buried to the gills.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Amazing. I'm Johns.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
text: He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading
dialog: to ask:
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Are there any others, Johns?
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --
text: but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.
text: Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog
dialog: to uncover...
text: Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his
text: chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!
text: She recoils hard. He's still alive. The other survivors bungle
text: over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to
dialog: the heart...You gotta do it, just do it
dialog: fast....
text: Fry grabs the rod.
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,
dialog: just leave it alone...delirious...doncha
dialog: you got some drugs for this poor man....
speaker_heading: OWENS
dialog: Don't touch that switch!
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Awright, awright, someone...there's
text: Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of
dialog: the cabin...next to....
text: But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
text: screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human
dialog: beings witness to such raw suffering.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Get away. Everybody.
text: The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch
text: in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.
text: Leaving, they pass...
text: Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by
text: goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:
text: ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in
text: life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal
dialog: blood. (30s.)
text: PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or
dialog: 50s.)
text: Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and
text: THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The
text: Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They
dialog: have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab
dialog: Muslims.)
text: WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.
text: The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
text: spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are
text: two suns -- one red, one yellow.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Well. Our own little slice of heaven.
text: The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to
dialog: orient themselves.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Please...which way to New Mecca? We must
dialog: know the direction in order to pray.
text: North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a
text: compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING
text: inside the ship finally ends.
scene_heading: INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: As Fry holds Owens, now dead.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together,
text: each faces a different compass point.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,
dialog: Audrey are already here.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Big talk about a scouting party...
text: Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.
text: One glance confirms that there are no other survivors.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: ...then we saw this.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Anyone else having breathing problems?
dialog: Aside from me?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Like I just ran, or something....
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Feel one lung short. All of us.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And
dialog: with all this dust....
text: Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure,
dialog: not enough oxygen. Might take a few days
dialog: to --
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a
dialog: rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking
dialog: grateful. This beast wasn't made to land
dialog: like this. But cripes, you rode it down.
dialog: (to others)
dialog: C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason
dialog: we're alive is a'cuzza her.
text: Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders.
text: HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
dialog: savior.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
dialog: Breaking out pressure suits:
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start
dialog: ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try
dialog: to make it last.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Well, is someone coming for us? Or are
dialog: we all just gonna die of exposure or
dialog: dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
dialog: something worse?
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: We're worried you'll scare us.
dialog: (ushering her away)
dialog: Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're
dialog: goin' to Taurus Three like we were?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Yeah, but...do we even have enough food
dialog: to get there? Or will we have to resort
dialog: to cannibalism?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: (to Fry)
dialog: I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit
dialog: further, cap'n. With your permission,
dialog: a' course.
text: Fry blinks. <i>"They actually think I'm the captain."</i> Zeke and the
text: others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another
dialog: problem. Riddick.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: And him?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Big Evil?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: We just keep him locked up forever?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Be my choice. Already escaped once from
dialog: the max-slam facility on --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I don't need his life story. Is he really
dialog: that dangerous?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Only around humans.
text: Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.
text: Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Oh, Christ....
text: They're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an
text: emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...
scene_heading: INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water
text: cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the
text: interior. Her face dies.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (V.O.)
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Well? Is it just the pump?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Ask if anyone has anything in cargo!
dialog: Anything to drink!
scene_heading: INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into
text: this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container
text: has an access door.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Mine here....
text: As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: S'matter?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
text: Little swamp-flu from the Conga system.
dialog: Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
text: Paris opens his container to reveal...
scene_heading: INT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental
text: umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: King Tut's tomb....
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Be surprised what these will fetch in the
dialog: Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here --
dialog: easy, easy. Very rare.
text: They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles
text: of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: This is it? Booze? That's what you have
dialog: to drink?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: (educating her)
dialog: 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
dialog: "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (cracking a bottle)
text: A toast to whatever he just said.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: I'll need a receipt for that.
dialog: (to Fry)
dialog: For all these.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Top of my list.
text: She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with
dialog: both envy and aversion.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I don't suppose....
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: One of the Christian habits we didn't
dialog: adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll
dialog: have to wait.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: For what? There is no water. You
dialog: understand that, don't you?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: All deserts have water, somewhere. God
dialog: shall lead us there.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it
dialog: is...
text: Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,
text: he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead
text: is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.
text: Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both
text: shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through
text: the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A
text: body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.
text: Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.
text: Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby.
text: It's Riddick's mouth-bit.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Like we needed another way to die.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out
dialog: anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled
text: back and dumped into...
scene_heading: INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a
text: pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax,
text: digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade.
text: Paris straggles in with antique curios.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: What the hell are these?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
dialog: India. Very rare.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: An' this?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
dialog: Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's
dialog: extinct.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: 'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these
dialog: things, be my guess.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's
dialog: gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: First, because he can only live out there
dialog: for so long -- he's gonna come back and
dialog: take what we got. Second, for the sheer
dialog: thrill of the kill.
text: A beat. They all grab for weapons.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He
text: fixates on...
text: A blue glow on the horizon. <i>"What the hell is it?"</i>
text: Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing
text: and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks
text: on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on
text: demand rather than in a constant flow.
text: Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for
dialog: travel.
text: Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun,
text: low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Imam. We should leave soon. Before
text: nightfall but while it's cooler.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What, you're goin' off, too?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a
dialog: favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They
dialog: were good guys who died bad.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: A'course we will.
speaker_heading: PILGRIM #1 (O.S.)
dialog: Imam...Imam....
dialog: (NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.")
text: Fry and the others round the ship to see...
text: A blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are
dialog: setting.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: My bloody oath....
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Three suns?
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: (to Fry)
dialog: So much for your nightfall.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: So much for my cocktail hour.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: We take this to be a good sign -- a path,
dialog: a direction from God.
text: Johns swings down from the top of the ship.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: A very good sign.
dialog: (re: blue sun)
dialog: That's Riddick's direction. You do not
dialog: wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Thought you found his restraints over
text: there. Toward sunset.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Which means he went toward sunrise.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET - DAY
text: Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM
text: THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides
text: shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.
text: Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,
dialog: odd sight.
text: Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.
text: Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: So quiet. You get used to the sounds of
dialog: the ship, then....
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: You know who Muhammad was?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Some prophet guy?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But
dialog: he had to travel to the desert -- where
dialog: there was quiet -- to hear the words of
dialog: God.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: Chrislam teaches that once in every
dialog: lifetime should there be a great hajj --
dialog: a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
dialog: yes, but to know yourself as well.
speaker_heading: FRY
text: Frightening thought.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (finishes wrapping her)
dialog: We're all on the same hajj now.
text: Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (hands her scope)
dialog: Tell me it's not a mirage.
text: SCOPE POV: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Trees?
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with
text: the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir
text: with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts
text: of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.
speaker_heading: ZEKE (O.S.)
dialog: Comfy up there?
text: Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,
dialog: cable, pick-ax.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Amazing how you can do without the
dialog: essentials of life -- so long as you have
dialog: the luxuries.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes
dialog: open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up
dialog: on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
text: He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on
text: Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,
text: pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He'd probably get you right here, right
dialog: under the jaw. And you'd never hear him
dialog: coming. That's how good Riddick is.
text: Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Now did you run away from your parents?
dialog: Or did they run away from you?
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY
text: The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.
speaker_heading: PILGRIMS
dialog: Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....
text: The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an
text: oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.
text: They don't move in the wind.
text: The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,
text: Johns and Imam catch up to behold...
text: The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,
text: tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal
text: bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,
dialog: it's like Hell overflowed right here.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Is this whole planet dead?
text: A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: He asks what could have killed so many
dialog: great things...
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - DAY
text: Moving into the boneyard:
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
dialog: like the elephants of Earth....
text: Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --
text: almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. <i>"Graveyard? Or
dialog: killing field?"</i>
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Long time ago. Whatever happened.
scene_heading: EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.
text: Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By
text: moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE
text: MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:
speaker_heading: PILGRIM #1
dialog: Ah....
text: He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns
text: back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But
dialog: it's only...
scene_heading: INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.
text: About to leave, Johns notices...
text: Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but
dialog: still...
text: Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his
text: shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...
text: Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.
scene_heading: EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her
dialog: breather.
scene_heading: INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced
text: with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.
text: Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.
dialog: Alone.
scene_heading: EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her
dialog: some.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you
dialog: even more.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Probably right.
text: They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against
text: the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...
scene_heading: INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (O.S.)
dialog: You know, I woulda played road dog for
dialog: these guys. You could've stayed back.
dialog: Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,
dialog: if we don't find water....
dialog: <i>"We may not make it back."</i>
speaker_heading: FRY (O.S.)
dialog: No, no, I wanted to get away.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (O.S.)
dialog: So I noticed. Never seen a "captain"
text: quite so ready to leave her ship.
text: Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...
scene_heading: EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: She steps away.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Better keep moving....
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching
dialog: the switch?
text: Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and
text: again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick
text: now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: You see anybody else here? Just between
dialog: you and me.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: During the landing...when things were
dialog: at their worst...Owens was at his best.
dialog: He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot
text: dump the passenger cabin.
text: Johns blinks, stunned. <i>"Are you shittin' me?"</i>
scene_heading: INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY
text: Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
text: slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's
dialog: all he wanted.
speaker_heading: FRY (O.S.)
dialog: So now you know.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (O.S.)
dialog: Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than
dialog: I thought.
text: Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,
dialog: left behind. It's still got one good swallow.
scene_heading: EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY
text: Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
text: hills. Ahead is a canyon.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Hold up.
text: He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: Didn't bite.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Thought he might be coolin' it in the
dialog: boneyard -- could either double-back to
dialog: the ship or slip in behind us. So I left
text: the bottle out as bait.
text: SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's
dialog: still got that one swallow.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: But nah. Didn't bite.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - DAY
text: CLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been
text: emptied -- and replaced with sand.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
text: Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.
text: Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...
text: The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.
scene_heading: EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY
text: The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib
text: bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.
text: Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible
text: on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. <i>"What are
dialog: they? Just mineral deposits?"</i>
speaker_heading: PILGRIM #1
dialog: Captain...captain....
text: The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.
text: Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.
text: ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Wait, wait, wait....
text: Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the
text: core. They all stare. It's a baseball.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: We are not alone here, yes?
text: They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is
text: looking back.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Never thought we were.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,
text: Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.
speaker_heading: PILGRIM #1
dialog: Assalamoo ahlaykum!
text: The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked
text: shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A
text: rusty bike lies on the ground.
speaker_heading: PILGRIM #2
dialog: Assalamoo ahlaykum!
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Long gone. Whoever they were.
text: They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them
text: looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.
text: Old jugs litter the ground.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Water...water there was here....
speaker_heading: PILGRIMS
dialog: Allahu Akbar....
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (translating)
dialog: "God is Great," yes?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I'm born-again.
text: Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
dialog: abandoned buildings. <i>"Who were these people? Why did they
dialog: leave so much behind?"</i>
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling
text: over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to
text: include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...
text: Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.
text: Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing
text: baseball. Posing with children.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Fry enters a dark room.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Lights.
text: No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall
text: switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she
text: throws them open to reveal...
text: A man standing right outside.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (through window)
dialog: Hey. Don't go too far, huh?
text: Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,
text: SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.
text: It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
text: planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts
text: turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: No darkness. No lights because no
dialog: darkness....
scene_heading: EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the
text: settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back
text: inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry
text: turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the
text: source of the glint.
text: Excited hits on her breather.
text: Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
text: bearing. Soon she's running.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: FRY (V.O.)
dialog: Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!
text: Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - DAY
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Allahu Akbar!
text: Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch
text: up. They too marvel at...
text: The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush
text: plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
text: the hull looks intact.
scene_heading: EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.
text: A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his
text: rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...
text: A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a
text: dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: This now qualifies as the worst fun I've
dialog: ever had. Stop it.
dialog: No response.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the
text: perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked
dialog: with? Again? He hopes?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
speaker_heading: AUDREY (O.S.)
dialog: What?
text: Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where
dialog: he expected.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris
text: enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,
dialog: searching for usable goods.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Tell me that was you.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
speaker_heading: PARIS
text: Assailing my fragile sense of security,
dialog: that's what.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: What're you goin' on about? She's been
dialog: right here for the last....
text: They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something
text: passing outside. Someone.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: (a quiet probe)
dialog: Zeke?
text: No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye
text: to a crack there.
text: HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He
text: starts toward the ship.
text: Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"
text: Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his
text: frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,
text: ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.
text: All eyes watch as...
text: The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:
text: We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the
text: blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...
text: And Shazza swings hard.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: No!
text: Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand
text: still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.
text: Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.
scene_heading: TOTAL STRANGER
dialog: I thought...my God, I thought I was the
dialog: only one who....
text: He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood
text: and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger
text: sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the
text: background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --
dialog: and understands what he's done.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Oh, Lord....
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: It was just somebody else. From the
dialog: crash. He was just....
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The
dialog: murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....
text: He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,
text: FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands
text: 20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes
dialog: covet...
text: Zeke's breather.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - DAY
text: Fry exits the skiff.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: No juice, looks like it's been laid up
dialog: for years. But we might be able to
dialog: adapt --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Shut up.
text: Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry. Thought I heard something.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Like my pistola.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
text: START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.
text: Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,
text: blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to
text: unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:
text: There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: Now what the bloody hell....
text: Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick
text: hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just
dialog: like this.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE - DAY
text: Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to
text: be some kind of burrow beyond.
text: BURROW POV: Staring back at Zeke.
text: Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow.
dialog: It's the last thing he ever does.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE - DAY
text: FURIOUS CLOSEUPS: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL BLASTING.
text: Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
text: The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...
text: Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of
text: the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.
scene_heading: EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY
text: CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running
text: from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and
text: SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits
text: ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Same crap, different planet, huh?
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to
text: the ship. They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: ...I don't play that...I don't play that
dialog: so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell
dialog: me a better lie....
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
dialog: what....
text: She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick
dialog: animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
text: Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no
text: sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: He used that?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: So why isn't it all bloody?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I assume he licked it clean.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening
text: to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: So where is he?
text: Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye
text: beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Tell me about the sounds. You told them
dialog: you heard something right before....
dialog: (no response)
dialog: If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take
dialog: another crack at it -- at your skull.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: 'Mean the whispers?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What whispers?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet
text: spot -- just to the left of the spine,
text: fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta.
dialog: What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt,
dialog: so I used it to catch a little run-off.
text: Metallic taste to it, human blood.
dialog: Coppery. But if you cut it with
text: peppermint schnapps, that goes away.
dialog: Course, that's more for winter.
dialog: Summertime, I take mine straight.
text: Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as
dialog: Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,
text: Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Why don't we try the truth now?
text: A head-shaking beat, then:
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: All you people are so scared of me --
dialog: an' most days, I'd take that as a
dialog: compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta
dialog: worry about now.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Show me your eyes.
text: Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with
text: lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Show me, Riddick.
text: Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
text: time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No
text: irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a
text: jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as
text: those of a starved jaguar.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You did this? To yourself?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Heard about it. Just never seen it.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?
dialog: Slamlight's so dim that you go and get
dialog: your eyeballs taken out and shined up --
dialog: then you wind up here. Three ass-kick
dialog: suns.
dialog: (replacing goggles)
dialog: Maybe I did do a few people. But not this
dialog: one. No ma'am, not this time.
speaker_heading: FRY
text: Then where is he? He's not in the hole.
dialog: We looked.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Look deeper.
text: He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site.
text: Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as...
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I know what happened -- he went off on the
dialog: guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and
dialog: now he's trying to --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Let's just be sure.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick
dialog: belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He
dialog: loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you
dialog: afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And
dialog: you're playing right into --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ,
dialog: you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this?
dialog: We gotta go down and find it.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Well, don't ask me to.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Thought you didn't believe his story.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I don't. But that ground looked none too
dialog: stable, and I don't want anyone --
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: If you're afraid, I'll go.
text: He shoots Audrey a scowl.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (pulling her aside)
dialog: Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now
dialog: doesn't change what came before -- it's
dialog: just stupid.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What, you think I'm doin' this to prove
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: You said it, not me. Let's just not let
text: one bad call lead to another.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Thanks for the tip, Johns.
dialog: <i>"Now get outta my way."</i>
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE - DAY
text: Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave. She
text: peers into the burrow...looks back up at the halo of faces above
text: her...then slithers out of sight.
scene_heading: INT. BURROW - DAY
text: Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she
text: finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
text: CLOSE on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry
text: moves deeper underground.
scene_heading: INT. UPHILL TUNNEL - DAY
text: Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms
dialog: forward to reach...
scene_heading: INT. THE LAIR - DAY
text: Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts
text: of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the
text: floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...
text: An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: They're hollow....
scene_heading: CLICK-CLICK.
text: Fry slow-turns toward the sound.
scene_heading: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.
text: There's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light.
text: Something unfolding.
text: An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her
dialog: chain, but...
text: Something shadows across the exit. It stops her cold.
text: Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's
text: one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it.
scene_heading: CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....
text: The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,
text: skulking the perimeter, circling.
text: Something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. It
dialog: was faster than a lightning-strike.
text: A paralyzed beat before...
text: Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and
text: springing straight up into...
scene_heading: INT. SPIRE - DAY
text: The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her
text: way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something?
text: Or did something catch it? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Did you hear....
text: They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave,
text: listening. Nothing now.
scene_heading: INT. SPIRE - DAY
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I'm over here in the --
text: Something tugs on her chain.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Oh, God....
text: CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge
text: out footholds.
text: A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...
text: The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.
text: She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and
text: undo the belt. Suddenly...
text: Something explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by
text: faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the
text: pick-ax. Hands reach inside...

speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got
dialog: you now....
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: The child heard you before any of us could
dialog: even....
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Did you find him? You find Zeke?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (half insane)
dialog: ...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was...
dialog: goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't
dialog: Riddick. Somethin' else down there that
dialog: got Zeke and nearly got --
text: Her. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the
dialog: chain.
text: The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human
text: hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans
dialog: are losing. Until...
text: Imam unsheathes his blade...
text: And slices through Fry's belt.
scene_heading: INT. SPIRE - DAY
text: As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the
dialog: Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid
text: the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...
text: The spired hills.
scene_heading: INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay,
text: THUMPING it down on the deck.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: One is all?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: For now.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY
text: At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells.
text: He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's
dialog: something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Found somethin' worse than me, huh?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if
dialog: I shouldn't lighten the load right now.
text: Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it
text: at Riddick's head.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Woof, woof.
text: The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show
text: Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and
text: blew off his wrist chains.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
dialog: The way it coulda gone and didn't.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (deaf)
dialog: Say that again.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Here's the deal. You work without the
dialog: chains, without the bit -- without the
dialog: shivs. You help us get off this rock....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: For what? The honor of goin' back to some
dialog: asshole of a cell?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this
dialog: head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as
dialog: much as you wanna be free of me.
text: A beat. The future rearranges in Riddick's head.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: You'd cut me loose, Boss?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Only if we both get outta this alive.
dialog: And there may be a way.
text: He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (staring at hand)
dialog: My recommendation: Do me. Don't take
dialog: the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on
dialog: your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.
dialog: Would if I were you.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon,
dialog: you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
text: A beat. Riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the
text: shotgun with his off-hand. A blur of movement. Suddenly Johns
text: is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Want you to remember this moment.
text: He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns. He drops the
text: emptied gun and walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET - DAY
text: EXTREMELY WIDE: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.
text: The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the
text: power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...
text: Riddick. Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,
text: he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: (to Johns)
dialog: So just like that. Wave your little wand
dialog: and he's one of us now.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Didn't say that. But least this way I
dialog: don't have to worry about falling asleep
dialog: and not wakin' up.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his
dialog: forgiveness. Right you are.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: At least give the man some oxygen....
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: So I can talk to him now?
speaker_heading: JOHNS/SHAZZA
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: No.
text: Paris drops a wine bottle. Trailing, Riddick collects it.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,
dialog: entrepreneur.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (shaking hands)
text: Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
dialog: murderer.
text: Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks.
text: Paris hurries to catch up to the others.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: You know, if I owned Hell and this
dialog: planet...I believe I'd rent this out and
dialog: live in Hell.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - DAY
text: FRY'S POV: Of spires high above us.
text: The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on
text: the spires. Fry stops short, hearing...
scene_heading: CLICKITY-CLICK.
text: Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. The group starts
text: moving again, faster.
scene_heading: CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICK.
text: Are they being stalked? Nervously, Fry traces the sound back
dialog: to...
text: Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,
text: the STRINGS CLACK together.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - DAY
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,
dialog: but, uh....
text: The survivors have reached the settlement. Fry is trying to get
text: the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Little ratty-ass.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the
dialog: electrical adapts.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Not a star-jumper.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back
dialog: up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick
dialog: out a thumb. You'll get picked up.
dialog: (to Fry)
dialog: Right?
text: Fry looks from Riddick to Johns. <i>"How did he know that?"</i>
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Little help here?
text: They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but
text: Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Check those containers for me. See what
dialog: we can patch wings with.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture-
dialog: recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to.
scene_heading: INT. SKIFF - DAY
text: START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to
text: the skiffs older electrical system. Soon...
text: Lights wink on throughout the ship.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.
dialog: But we'll need more cells.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: How many?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other
dialog: ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five.
dialog: Five total to launch.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: 25 kilos each, huh?
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get
text: it up and chuggin'.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Do it. And if you need an extra hand,
dialog: tap our problem child out....
dialog: (looking out)
dialog: Where's Riddick?
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended
text: chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back...
text: Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through
text: FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst.
scene_heading: EXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation
dialog: while awaiting...
text: The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette.
text: Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now
text: another and another. It brings CHEERS.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps
text: crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an
text: old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH...
scene_heading: EXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Hands digging in dirt.
text: Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the
text: entrance of a tall windowless structure.
text: He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...
text: and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel
text: clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:
speaker_heading: ROBOT
dialog: "...to all intruders. I am the guardian
dialog: of this land. I will protect my masters
dialog: at all cost. Death to all intruders..."
text: Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a
text: small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing
text: now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.
dialog: "Coring Room."
speaker_heading: JOHNS (O.S.)
dialog: Missin' the party. C'mon.
text: It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks
text: a trash bin. Hard.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Missin' the party. C'mon.
text: He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat.
speaker_heading: AUDREY (O.S.)
dialog: Talkin' to me?
scene_heading: INT. CORING ROOM - DAY
text: PILGRIM'S POV: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after
dialog: Riddick and Johns.
text: Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room. He's found a way
text: inside. By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring. Just
text: visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: ...and for this, our gift of drink, we
dialog: give thanks in the name of our Prophet,
dialog: Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our
dialog: Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his
dialog: father, Allah the Compassionate and the
dialog: Merciful.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: The strangest religion....
text: Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. Riddick gets
text: the last of it -- the part with sediment. SELECTED CLOSEUPS as
dialog: they drink. Nothing ever tasted finer.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who
dialog: were these people, anyway? Miners?
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Looks like geologists. Advance team,
text: moves around from rock to rock.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Musta crapped out here, huh?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: But why did they leave their ship?
text: Silence. It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.
text: Imam notices one water glass unspoken for.
scene_heading: EXT. CORING ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE on the "Coring Room" sign. An attached solar panel begins
text: moving, orienting toward sunlight. When it catches the full
dialog: brunt of the suns' rays...
text: STORM SHUTTERS unlatch on the roof.
scene_heading: INT. CORING ROOM - DAY
text: Pilgrim #3 hears SHOOTING LATCHES overhead. That sound brings
text: another sound: A strange SKITTERING. The pilgrim looks up. Is
dialog: there something in the rafters?
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (answering Audrey)
dialog: Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Like an emergency life-raft, right?
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take
dialog: them off-planet. Long gone.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: A toast to their ghosts, then....
text: Goblets rise.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got
dialog: Zeke got them. They're all dead.
text: It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (CONT'D)
dialog: What, you don't really think they left
dialog: with their clothes on the lines? Photos
dialog: on the walls?
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Maybe they had weight limits, you don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: I know you don't uncrate your emergency
dialog: ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your
dialog: theories on --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (to Riddick)
dialog: So what happened? Where are they, then?
text: Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least
text: glance its way. At the window, Imam scans outside.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (to Fry and Imam)
dialog: Has anyone checked the coring room?
scene_heading: INT. CORING ROOM - DAY
text: Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight
text: over Pilgrim #3 and...
text: The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of...
text: something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.
text: Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in
text: a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:
text: Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: As Imam hears the SCREAM.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Ali....
scene_heading: INT. CORING ROOM - DAY
text: CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures,
text: winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and
text: slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into...
text: A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and
text: waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's
text: still alive.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: As the survivors run for the coring room.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: As Riddick stays behind to drink their water.
scene_heading: INT. CORING ROOM - DAY
text: HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders
dialog: past Johns to enter and find...
text: The empty coring room.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Ali?
text: A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to
text: come out? Imam opens the door...
text: And hatchlings pour out.
text: Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,
text: soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,
text: SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...
text: Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody
text: kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room.
text: Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer
dialog: down...
text: The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons
text: of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service.
text: Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar.
scene_heading: INT. CORING ROOM - DAY
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Why was the door chained up? Why the
dialog: bloody hell would they lock themselves in
dialog: like that?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams
dialog: better not be diggin' another grave out
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (O.S.)
dialog: Other buildings weren't secure...
text: They turn. Riddick enters.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (CONT'D)
dialog: ...so they ran here. Heaviest doors.
dialog: Thought they'd be safe inside, but...
dialog: (looks down shaft)
text: Someone forget to lock the back door.
text: Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains:
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you
dialog: saw it. You was right there.
text: Riddick nods.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA (CONT'D)
dialog: You were tryin' to kill him too.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (shrugging, <i>"not
dialog: necessarily"</i>)
dialog: Just wanted his O-2.
dialog: (a beat)
text: Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.
text: When he shot up that stranger instead.
text: Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man
text: she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Take it.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: What, it's broken?
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.
text: Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns
text: watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick
text: being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (to Fry)
dialog: Let's board this up and get the hell gone.
dialog: They seem to stick to the dark, so if we
dialog: stick to daylight, should be all --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: 60 years ago.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Wha'?
text: Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been
text: scrutinizing them.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60
dialog: years ago. This month.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: Yeah? What's special about that?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Dunno. Maybe nothing, but....
dialog: But now Fry remembers...
scene_heading: INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: The orrery. The year-counter clicks over to "45" as...
text: Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear,
text: accelerating the orbits.
text: CLOSE on the counter. "56...57...58...59...60."
text: They all see it: A giant ringed world eclipses the suns and
text: plunges their planet into darkness. Persistent darkness.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Are you fuckin' kidding me?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Not afraid of the dark, are you?
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Crossing the yard in wide strides:
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: ...need those cells from the crash ship.
dialog: Shit, still gotta check out the hull,
dialog: patch the wings --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Let's wait on the power cells.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Wait for what? Until it's so dark we
dialog: can't even find our way back to --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: We're not sure when it happens, so let's
dialog: not --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Get the fucking cells over here, Johns.
dialog: What's the discussion?
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?
scene_heading: INT. SKIFF - DAY
text: Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (jarred)
dialog: He can pilot?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
text: Hijacked a prison transport, made a
dialog: helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (with faint hope)
dialog: Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I
dialog: can use him to help with --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
dialog: Fry.
text: A mental shiver.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You said we were going to trust him now.
dialog: You said there was a deal.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: That's what I said.
text: He challenges her to read his mind.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Oh, this is a dangerous game you're
dialog: playing, Johns.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: May've noticed chains don't work on this
dialog: guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he
dialog: believes he's goin' free. But if he stops
dialog: believin' --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You mean, if he learns that you're gonna
dialog: royally fuck him over.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells
dialog: over at the last possible minute -- when
dialog: the wings are ready, when we know we're
text: ready to launch.
text: Fry looks at him with new eyes.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You know, he hasn't harmed any of us.
dialog: Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied
dialog: to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns.
dialog: Let him go if that's what it --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta
dialog: do his bid.
text: Shaking her head, she looks off.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Dancin' on razor blades here...
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I won't give him a chance to grab another
text: ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field
text: table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now,
text: anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs
dialog: through Johns.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.
text: Johns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of
text: Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table.
text: Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was
dialog: just there.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (looking after Johns)
dialog: I'll cut.
text: He has the knife.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - DAY
text: CLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran.
text: Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
text: scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and
text: delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old
text: Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...
text: The setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet.
scene_heading: INT. SKIFF - DAY
text: The hatch closes, seals.
text: CLOSE on a monitor. A "HULL INTEGRITY TEST" is underway. Fry
text: scans rising pressure gauges.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (O.S.)
dialog: Looks like we're a few shy....
text: Fry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery
text: bay. And he has Imam's blade.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Power cells.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: They're coming.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main
dialog: drive yet.
dialog: (half-beat)
dialog: Strange unless he told you the particulars
dialog: of my escape.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I got the quick-and-ugly version.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: An' now you're worried about a repeat of
dialog: history?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Entered our minds.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: I asked what you thought.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You scare me, Riddick. That's what you
dialog: wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it,
dialog: Can I get back to work now?
text: She finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves
text: closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin
text: pressure builds.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Think Johns is an do-right man? You
dialog: think I can trust him to cut me loose?
text: A beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Why, what'd you hear?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd
dialog: just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth
text: twice as much alive.
dialog: (reading her face)
dialog: Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's
dialog: got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --
dialog: he's just a merc and I'm just a payday.
dialog: That's why he won't kill me. The creed is
dialog: greed.
text: It knocks her off stride, but...
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on
dialog: each other -- no matter how hard you try.
text: Riddick moves right up behind her.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: I don't truly know what's gonna happen
dialog: when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I
dialog: do know that once the dyin' starts, this
dialog: little psycho family of ours is gonna rip
dialog: itself apart. So you better find out the
dialog: truth. Come nightfall, you better know
dialog: exactly who's standing behind you.
text: A monitor chirps the news: "HULL INTEGRITY --100%." EXHALING
text: GASSES, the hatch opens automatically.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask
dialog: why your crew-pal had to scream like that
dialog: 'fore he died.
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: CLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...
text: pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop
text: the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an
text: eager arm vein.
speaker_heading: FRY (O.S.)
dialog: Who are you? Really?
text: Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway.
speaker_heading: FRY (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not a real cop, are you? Just some
dialog: mercenary who goes around talkin' about
dialog: the law like --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I never said I was.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Never said you were a hype, either.
text: She moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a
text: shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: You have a little caffeine in the morning,
dialog: I have a little morphine. So what?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: And here you got two mornings every day.
dialog: Wow, were you born lucky?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (lashing)
dialog: You made it a problem when you let Owens
dialog: die like that. When you had enough drugs
dialog: to knock out a fucking mule-team.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
text: Owens was already dead. His brain just
dialog: hadn't caught on to that fact.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Anything else we should know about you,
dialog: Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play
dialog: games with our lives when --
text: He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing
text: her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP
text: of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: My first run-in with Riddick. Went for
dialog: the sweet-spot and missed. They had to
dialog: leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can
dialog: feel it, sometimes, pressing against the
dialog: cord.
dialog: (giving her hands back)
dialog: So maybe the care and feeding of my
dialog: nerve-endings is my business.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You coulda helped. And you didn't.
text: O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for
dialog: "Captain, Captain...."
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
dialog: Right, "captain"?
text: It cuts deep.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes
text: gang-locked on...
text: An arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: What do my eyes see?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: It's starting....
text: They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two
text: suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: (to Fry)
dialog: If we need anything from the crash ship --
dialog: I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's
dialog: solar.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching
text: up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!
text: Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and
text: Audrey running, catching up.
speaker_heading: SHAZZA
dialog: We stay together! C'mon!
scene_heading: INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the
dialog: door...
scene_heading: EXT. INCINERATOR - SETTLEMENT - DAY
text: ...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Don't wanna miss this.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Lookit. Lookit!
text: They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting
text: over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.
scene_heading: EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY
text: The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the
text: massive ribcage...
text: The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris
text: steals a look at...
text: The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.
scene_heading: INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the
text: deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his
text: shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders
text: his cell and stumbles after.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY
text: Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it
dialog: and the ship.
text: The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.
text: Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second.
text: They're racing the eclipse and each other.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK
text: As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK
text: It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in
text: light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Don't stop, don't stop....
text: But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...
scene_heading: EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK
text: The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DUSK
text: As the rings eclipse the red sun.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
text: A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,
dialog: beholding...
scene_heading: EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK
text: Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,
text: it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these
text: are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their
text: first nightfall.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Jesus, how many can there....
text: They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,
text: the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves
text: from another -- and does a quick about-face.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
dialog: flee.
speaker_heading: FRY
text: Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.
dialog: lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
text: They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...
text: Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE
text: descending on them...
text: Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just
text: inches overhead.
text: CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being
dialog: underwater.
text: CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a
text: kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he
text: eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled
text: down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.
text: The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the
dialog: cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Tell her to stay there. Stay down.
text: SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!
text: Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the
text: hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her
dialog: feet...
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: No, no, NO, NO, NO....
text: ...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK
text: Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a
text: last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in
text: the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
text: Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone
text: about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands
text: clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...
text: A rising GANG-CLICKING.
text: CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.
scene_heading: EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK
text: The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK
text: Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.
text: PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
text: jaguar eyes.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult
text: hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,
text: hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the
dialog: world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What is it? What's happening?
text: RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,
text: SOUNDING, searching.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry
dialog: about.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT
text: The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.
text: The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.
text: Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
text: cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What if...what if she's still out there...
dialog: still alive....
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions
dialog: here...but 'member that boneyard? These
dialog: just might be the fuckers that killed
dialog: every other living thing on this planet,
dialog: okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that
dialog: door anytime soon are just about zero
dialog: squared.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't
text: a natural die-off.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Quiet, please. Everyone.
text: Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up
text: alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Why do they do that? Make that sound?
speaker_heading: IMAM
text: Perhaps the way they see. With sound,
text: reflecting back.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Echo-location. That's what it is....
text: Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find...
text: Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down
text: the tunnel-like hold.
text: A volley of looks. <i>"How the fuck could one get in here?"</i>
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Breach in the hull. I dunno.
text: More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I'd rather piss glass.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Well, you got the big gauge.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Wanna rag your fat mouth?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam,
dialog: are you still --
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: No, no, no, I do not believe --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody
dialog: bugfuck with those things. Why don't you
dialog: just lose the goddamn....
text: More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Big beads.
text: Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...
text: The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly
text: around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases
text: his head and a light around the door to spot...
text: Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (to others)
dialog: Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones
dialog: that musta --
text: Something WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It
text: catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...
text: A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.
text: In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Very big beads.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Not staying in here another....
text: He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
text: Fry lunges for him.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Christ, you don't know what's out there!
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: I know what's in here!
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Everybody come, this way and we should be
dialog: safe. Hurry, please....
scene_heading: INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.
text: At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a
text: SCRATCHING.
text: Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts
text: the gasses to illuminate...
text: The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY
text: BLOWS drive everyone back.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (to Johns)
dialog: Can you do sumpin' else with that?
dialog: 'Sides holding it in my fucking face?
text: Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between
text: containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
dialog: blades of the predators.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the
text: escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...
scene_heading: INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,
text: sweeping, hunting.
scene_heading: INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch
text: just as the predators break into the container being vacated,
text: always entering darkness.
scene_heading: INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and
text: Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
text: cargo with their bodies.
text: Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
text: cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Hello, hello?
text: ...and moves to the front of the container where darkness
text: prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the
text: open container, the one where Johns found predators.
text: Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,
text: eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.
text: Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.
scene_heading: PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.
text: (NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression
text: without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with
text: echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
dialog: subject in 3-D space.)
text: Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,
text: Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.
dialog: <i>"Where's Riddick?"</i>
text: He's in a stare-down with a predator.
text: Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
text: caught in a vice-like grip.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Don't. Move.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This
text: one reaches down with its scythe blade...
text: And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made
dialog: of.
text: CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.
text: More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.
text: One test-slices Riddick's shirt.
scene_heading: INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the
dialog: escape hatch:
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Imam? Where are they?
scene_heading: INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's
text: skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES.
speaker_heading: IMAM (O.S.)
dialog: Hasan?
speaker_heading: FRY (O.S.)
dialog: Riddick?
text: TIGHT on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has
text: stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: No....
text: The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.
text: Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
dialog: escape hatch as...
text: Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick
text: HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...
text: The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the
text: beast HOWLS and flails back.
text: HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it
text: really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked
text: up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: 'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
text: They give him a look. <i>"Sure you did."</i> Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS
text: to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
dialog: pattern. <i>"Christ, he did kill one."</i>
text: Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.
text: Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: There....
speaker_heading: PARIS
text: Like the light is scalding it.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: It hurts them. Light actually hurts
dialog: them....
text: VULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the
text: scraps of the pilgrim.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Is that...Hasan?
text: Riddick nods.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.
scene_heading: INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT
text: Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors
text: gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --
text: has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: ...one cutting torch...one handlight here,
dialog: two more in the cabin...I think two
dialog: more....
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: How many bottles?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Not sure. Ten?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Those umbrellas, the ones that mist.
dialog: Would they burn?
dialog: (reading his face)
dialog: If you got a receipt?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Possibly.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Enough for what?
text: Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind,
dialog: I pray you go insane.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (to others)
dialog: We can stick to the plan. If we get four
dialog: cells back to the skiff, we're off this
dialog: rock.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
dialog: ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: We'll have to carry the cells...drag
dialog: them...whatever it takes.
text: Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on
dialog: the floor growing dimmer?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: You mean...tonight? With all those things
dialog: still out there?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Back it up. How long can this last? Few
dialog: minutes? Couple hours?
dialog: No one knows for sure.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: I had the impression...from the model...
dialog: that the two planets were moving as one.
dialog: That there would be...a lasting darkness.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Those suns gotta come back sometime. And
dialog: if these animals really are phobic about
dialog: light, we just sit tight till then.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I'm sure that's what someone else said.
text: Locked inside that coring room.
text: A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Look, we gotta think about everyone now --
dialog: the kid especially. How scared is she
dialog: gonna be out there?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke
dialog: screen.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Smoke screen for what?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: For your own fear.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (eyes narrowing)
dialog: Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two
text: seconds and let someone else come up with
dialog: a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
text: Two seconds pass.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: How much you weigh, Johns?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: What the hell's it matter?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: 79 kilos.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white
dialog: meat, and that's why you can't come up
dialog: with a better plan.
text: He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps
text: the underside of Riddick's chin.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Think about that reward, Johns.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: How 'bout a cut in your gut?
text: Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds,
text: poised for evisceration.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Please...this solves nothing...please....
text: Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (to Audrey)
dialog: They're afraid of our light. That means
dialog: we don't have to be so afraid of them.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: And you're certain you can find the way
dialog: back? Even in the dark?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: No, I'm not. But he can.
text: She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET - NIGHT
text: The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal
text: light remains, we see clouds forming.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
text: Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is
text: pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.
text: Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not
text: to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...
text: The main cabin. Blackness inside.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Riddick.
text: He lifts his goggles.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage
dialog: but no life.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
text: Looks clear.
text: Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up
dialog: inside...
text: A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off
text: into the night.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Fuck me. You said "clear."
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Said "looks clear."
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Well, what's it look like now?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (rechecking)
text: Looks clear.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Just get the goddamn lights on....
text: They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.
text: He isn't amused.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
text: PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...
text: yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon
text: cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs
text: with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
text: Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He
text: unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a
text: lover's look. Behind him...
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Ready, Johns.
text: He palms the shell.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: He'll lead you over the first cliff.
dialog: You know that, don't you?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: We're just burnin' light here.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: You give him the cells and the ship --
dialog: and he will leave you. He will leave you
dialog: all out there to die.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn
dialog: valuable in your life that you're worried
dialog: about losing? Huh? Is there anything at
dialog: all? Besides your next hype?
dialog: (no response)
dialog: Got no right to be so scared. Neither one
dialog: of us.
scene_heading: INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
text: As hands yank the last power cell.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
text: Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his
text: shotgun in the dark.
scene_heading: EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to
dialog: create...
text: A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,
text: BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...
text: Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside
text: him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into
dialog: the chains. The hands belong to...
text: Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping
text: his captor into chains.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (to all)
dialog: Keep the light going. That's all we have
dialog: to do to live through this. Just keep
dialog: your light burning.
text: Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light
text: down his back. A beacon.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (to Fry)
dialog: Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want
text: light on my back -- but not in my eyes.
dialog: And check your cuts. These things know
dialog: our blood now.
text: CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some
dialog: kind of deal. Just in case, you know,
dialog: this actually --
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (shaking head)
dialog: Had it with deals.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: But I just wanted to say --
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.
dialog: I fuckin' knew better.
dialog: It worries Fry. <i>"If he doesn't expect to go free...."</i>
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Been a long time since anyone's trusted
dialog: me. That's somethin' right there.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: We can, can't we? Trust you?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Actually...
dialog: (completely genuine)
dialog: That's what I been askin' myself.
text: He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a
dialog: terrible, terrible mistake.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT
text: The drag-sled begins moving.
text: SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,
text: eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like
text: malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-
text: guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position
text: carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling
text: along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every
text: shadow a threat. They are a train of light.
text: CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles
dialog: of booze.
text: CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT
text: Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their
text: lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,
text: the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from
text: above, awaiting their chance.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT
text: FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: So you noticed too?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Riddick. Riddick.
text: The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on
text: breathers as they muster inside the light.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't
dialog: we still following them?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Saw something I didn't like.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Such as.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...
dialog: but looked like a bunch of those big boys
dialog: chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought
dialog: we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
text: Paris looks over his shoulder. <i>"We went around what?"</i> Nearby
text: CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Let's move.
dialog: (to Audrey)
dialog: Just a detour. He'll get us there.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Can we switch?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What, switch what?
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: I think I twisted my ankle running
dialog: backwards like that. And I'm not sure I
dialog: can....
dialog: (off their stares)
dialog: Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to
dialog: be alone back there anymore. If you could
dialog: just give me a few minutes up front here --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: She's the pilot, she should stay close to
dialog: the cells.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Oh, so I'm disposable?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just
dialog: get this train moving!
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT
text: They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.
text: At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING
text: never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his
text: torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Light, please, need light here....
text: Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he
text: refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.
text: PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.
text: A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam
text: lunges at the last nanosecond...
text: And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...
text: CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.
text: Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator
text: is long gone.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (trembling)
dialog: Please...have we been cut? Can someone
dialog: tell me if....
text: He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.
dialog: Broken.
text: In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something
text: slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Oh, sweet Jesus....
text: The bottle drops.
text: The blood flows.
text: The CLICKING STOPS.
speaker_heading: PARIS
dialog: Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
text: LIGHT OVER HERE!
text: Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...
text: Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.
text: Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a
text: youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't
text: find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the
text: youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators
text: start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a
text: pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS
text: AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey.
text: CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.
text: CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.
text: Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What do you see? Riddick?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - NIGHT
text: As clouds mass.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT
text: Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.
text: Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS
text: at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly
dialog: well, until...
text: The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch
dialog: from Audrey.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Bottle-count.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Four fulls, one half. That mean we're
dialog: halfway there? I hope?
dialog: Good question. They've just been blindly following...
text: The light on Riddick's back.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Can we pick up the pace?
text: Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. <i>"If you think you
text: can do better...."</i> Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest,
dialog: spotting...
text: A sled-track. In front of them.
text: Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...
text: Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun
text: into the back of Riddick's neck.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: We aren't completely stupid.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in
dialog: the fucking --
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: We crossed our own tracks.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: He's running us 'round in circles. Look
dialog: for yourself. Look!
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Riddick? What the hell are you --
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Listen.
text: Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of
text: plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some
dialog: time to think.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Think about what?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: About how to kill us and still get these
dialog: cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just
dialog: doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (answering Fry)
dialog: About the girl.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What about her?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: What it's gonna be like when we hit that
text: canyon. With her bleeding.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not
dialog: cut.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (agreeing)
dialog: No. She's not.
text: It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (confessing)
dialog: I didn't want you to leave me there...
dialog: back at the ship...that's why I didn't
dialog: say anything....
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you
dialog: shoulda told me sooner.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (finally getting it)
dialog: Aw, this can't be happening to me....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: They been nose-open for her ever since we
text: left. They go off blood.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Well...we must keep her close, then.
dialog: Here, she'll be safe if we put her
dialog: between --
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (scanning)
dialog: There is no "safe."
text: An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears
text: fill with CANYON SOUNDS.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.
text: Johns brays.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Hey, you're the one who got me out here,
dialog: turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An'
dialog: now you 'spect me to go back like a
dialog: whipped dog?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay?
dialog: Now let's just go back to the ship.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces --
dialog: you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Are you fucking high again? Just listen
dialog: to --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be
dialog: afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of
dialog: meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say
dialog: mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred
dialog: meters, after that we're in Skiff City!
dialog: So why don't you just butch up, stuff a
dialog: cork in that kid, and get --
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: She's the captain, we should listen to --
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Listen to her? Her? When she was willing
dialog: to sacrifice us all?
text: A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What's he talkin' about?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: During the crash, she --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (a warning growl)
dialog: This does not help us, Johns.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: -- she tried to blow the whole fucking
dialog: passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Just shut up, okay?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris
dialog: had it right -- we are disposable. We're
text: just walking ghosts to her.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!
text: She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: We're not alive because of her -- we're
text: alive in spite of her.
text: He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes,
text: her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: We cannot go through there....
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (lording)
dialog: How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (pushing him back)
dialog: Fine, fine, you've made your point. We
dialog: can all be so scared as you.
text: Johns snatches a light away from Imam.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: (to all)
text: Verdict's in. The light moves forward.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
text: They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run.
text: At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now
text: draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
text: Johns falls in step with Riddick.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Ain't all of us gonna make it.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Just realized that, huh?
text: CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound
text: away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Six of us left. If we could get through
dialog: that canyon and lose just one, that'd be
dialog: quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Not if I'm the one.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: What if you're one of five?
text: Riddick stares. <i>"I'm listening."</i>
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What're they doin' up there?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Talking about the canyon, I suppose.
dialog: How to get us through.
text: Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick
text: walking side by side, like equals. Like partners.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no
dialog: different than those battlefield doctors
dialog: when they have to decide who lives and who
dialog: dies. It's called "triage," okay?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Either way, figure it's something you can
dialog: grab onto.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (doping it out)
text: Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave
text: it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket
dialog: of chum.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
text: Trawl with it. There's a cable on the
dialog: sled. We can drag the body behind us.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Nice embellishment.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just
dialog: keep 'em off our scent.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (looking back)
dialog: So which one caught your eye?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Don' look, don' look, don' look....
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
text: Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Imam. Slow down.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Don't stop, just slow down. Little more
dialog: space 'tween us and them.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: I would rather we all stay--
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Do what I say. Please.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: What's her name, anyway?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: What do you care?
dialog: Riddick shrugs. <i>"I don't."</i>
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Then let's not name the Thanksgiving
dialog: turkey, okay? I assume you still got a
dialog: shiv.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: What, you 'spect me to do it?
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: What's one more to you? Like this is the
dialog: one that sends you to Hell?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They
dialog: oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere.
dialog: Or forget the museum -- maybe they should
dialog: just hang you.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
text: As Fry and the others keep slowing.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the
dialog: others off your back.
text: Riddick stops. Reconsiders.
speaker_heading: JOHNS (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (shakes head)
dialog: Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger
dialog: piece of chum.
speaker_heading: JOHNS
dialog: Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
text: EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new
text: partnership splintering apart: <i>"Like Mr. Johns."</i>
text: Riddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
text: As the fight erupts:
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Bring the light!
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What're they doing? What're we --
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
text: FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of
text: illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick
text: and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE
text: CLICKING AWAY.
text: The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it
text: into the night. And then pulls his shiv.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's
dialog: the only rule.
text: Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts
text: poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark.
text: Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.
text: Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two
text: cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,
text: forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns
text: makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...
text: Riddick shivs open his back.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Remember that moment?
text: Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
text: Riddick dogs him.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.
dialog: You were one brave fuck, before. Now look
dialog: at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass
dialog: with your gauge...with your chains....
text: Johns finds the shotgun. <i>"And I'm still Billy Bad-ass."</i> He
text: sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...
dialog: Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?
text: CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...
text: Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the
text: night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his
text: head, he whirls again and takes aim on...
text: Another bull-rushing predator.
text: Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the
text: shotgun for another try. He's too late.
text: BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.
text: Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator
text: lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle
scene_heading: CLICKING-COOING SOUND.
text: PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams
text: forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,
text: splitting him in two.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT
text: Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling,
text: trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry
text: looks over her shoulder...
text: And crashes into Riddick. He was just standing in the dark,
dialog: waiting for them.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Back to the ship, huh?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Get out of our way.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: So everybody huddles together till the
dialog: lights burn out? Until you can't see
dialog: what's eating you? That the big plan?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Where's Mr. Johns?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Which half?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: You mean....
text: Conflicted, they all look back. Audrey starts to puddle up.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Gonna lose everybody out here....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: He died fast. And if we got any choice,
dialog: that's the way we should all go out.
dialog: (to Audrey, softly)
dialog: Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING...
scene_heading: BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH
text: and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the
text: survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,
text: just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.
scene_heading: EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.
text: CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be
text: countless predators ahead.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: How many you see?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: One or two.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Audrey?
speaker_heading: AUDREY
text: Three full bottles. But almost time to
dialog: refill.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,
dialog: does it?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Only see one way. Turn the sled over and
dialog: drag it like that, girl down low. Light
dialog: up everything we got -- and run through
text: like dogs on fire.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (understanding)
dialog: The sled as a shield....
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: And what about the cells?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: I'll take those.
text: She looks at him hard.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: We're just here to carry your light,
dialog: aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Let's drop back an' boot up.
scene_heading: EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT
text: START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one
dialog: queue.
text: Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from
text: the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: What're you doin'?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Blessing you like the others.
dialog: (off his look)
dialog: It's painless.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: And pointless.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: I see. Well, even if you don't believe
dialog: in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: You don't see.
text: Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (CONT'D)
dialog: 'Cuz you don't spend half your life in
dialog: lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
dialog: and not believe. And you surely don't
text: start out in a liquor store trash bin with
dialog: an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
dialog: and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe
dialog: in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: He will be with us. Nonetheless.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Give my blessing to the girl. She needs
text: a spare.
scene_heading: EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.
text: Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a
dialog: torch.
text: Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.
text: Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
text: metal carapace.
text: Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will
text: surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: As fast as you can.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You sure you can keep --
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: As fast as you can.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield
text: fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along
text: behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
text: tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
text: somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,
text: flank them in fire.
scene_heading: EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: As predators launch from the rim.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --
text: then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next
text: come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Don't look.
text: Thin blue liquid spatters them.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Do not look up.
text: More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...
text: A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and
text: weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
text: OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry
dialog: eels.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Keep going, keep going, keep going,
dialog: keep going!
text: His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry
text: keeps her eyes down and speed up.
text: More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
dialog: out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: (a muttered mantra)
dialog: "So dark the clouds around my way
dialog: I cannot see,
dialog: But through the darkness I believe
dialog: God leadeth me.
text: I gladly place my hand in His when
dialog: all is dim,
dialog: And, closing my weary eyes, lean
dialog: hard on him...."
text: Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims
text: of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
dialog: mess.
text: Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,
text: drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.
scene_heading: EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Riddick? RIDDICK?
text: Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: What? What is it?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
dialog: GO OVER IT!
text: Steeling themselves, they start climbing.
text: But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her
text: hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...
text: One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...
text: And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.
text: PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
dialog: different predators.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Audrey!
text: Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...
text: A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
dialog: the metal...
text: And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.
text: Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
text: to rip free of the shield.
text: Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.
text: The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...
text: Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the
text: beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
text: CLICKS MADLY at him.
text: PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.
text: The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
text: its skull-blade.
text: Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...
text: ...yanks his shiv...
text: ...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
text: predator falls, disemboweled.
text: REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.
text: They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one
dialog: person short.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Suleiman!
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Get the girl back under. Keep going.
speaker_heading: IMAM
speaker_heading: SULEIMAN!
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
text: Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by
text: unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
text: a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone
text: again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out
dialog: of existence.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: They flail on. And now, finally...finally....
text: The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The
text: WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened
dialog: faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh
dialog: Circle of Hell. But then...
text: The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.
text: Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.
text: Blood falls anew.
text: One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.
text: Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this
text: blood has no hue.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Oh, no. No, no, no....
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Rain.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and
dialog: ground.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch
text: goes out -- and won't relight.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: So where the hell's God now, huh?
dialog: (no answer from Imam)
dialog: I'll tell you where! He's up there
dialog: PISSING ON ME!
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Riddick? How close?
text: Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he
text: sees -- nor what he's thinking.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Tell me the settlement is right there!
scene_heading: RIDDICK, PLEASE!
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: We can't make it.
text: HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.
text: Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Here...hide here....
text: He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Inside...inside....
scene_heading: EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his
text: back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over
dialog: to the crevice...
scene_heading: EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: ...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Why's he still out there?
text: Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?
scene_heading: EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.
text: He stops at the top, peers through the rain.
scene_heading: RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.
text: Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,
text: slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.
scene_heading: EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: He's not coming back, is he?
text: Fry checks Imam's face. <i>Did Riddick say anything to you?"</i> Imam
text: wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see
text: his face.
speaker_heading: FRY
text: There's light in here.
text: It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover
text: small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What are they?
text: CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Larva....
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Glow worms....
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (mind racing)
dialog: How many bottles we got? Empty ones?
scene_heading: INT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: Riddick boards the dark craft.
text: Connects the power cells to the battery bay.
text: Watches the ship come to life.
scene_heading: EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: More, more, we need more....
text: They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their
dialog: world.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,
text: looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?
text: Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...
text: Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and
text: closes the hatch behind him.
scene_heading: EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's
text: Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she
dialog: spies...
text: The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.
scene_heading: INT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT
text: As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.
scene_heading: EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is
text: all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the
text: shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He
dialog: can't see much until...
text: A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up
dialog: the glow-worm light to see...
text: More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The
text: light drives them away. For now.
scene_heading: INT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's
text: actually startled by the sight of...
text: Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her
dialog: over.
dialog: Eye-lock.
text: Riddick opens the hatch.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,
text: Riddick in the light.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Strong survival instinct. Admire that in
text: a woman.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You're not leaving. Not until we go back
dialog: for the others.
text: He laughs at that.
speaker_heading: FRY (CONT'D)
dialog: I promised them we'd go back with more
dialog: light. And that's exactly what we're
dialog: gonna do..
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Think you've mistaken me for somebody who
dialog: gives a fuck.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: What, you're afraid?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was
dialog: his monkey. I only deal in life and
dialog: death. All that stuff in between? Some
text: shade of grey my eyes don't see.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I
dialog: trusted that some part of you wanted to
dialog: rejoin the human race.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
text: Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With
text: desperation edging her voice:
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.
dialog: Just give me more light for them.
text: He tosses her a light. The broken one.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Just come with me!
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Got a better idea. Come with me.
text: Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK (CONT'D)
dialog: They're already dead. Get on board.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: 'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't
dialog: leave you here. If you believe anything
dialog: about me, better be that.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: No, you see, I promised them...I have
dialog: to...I have to go and....
text: She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --
text: and he keeps slashing away.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Step aboard, Carolyn.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: (tortured)
dialog: I can't....I can't....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (approaching, extending
dialog: a hand)
dialog: Here. Make it easy on you.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Don't do this to me....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Just give me your hand.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: But they...they could still be....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my
dialog: hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
text: A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.
text: They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I will not give up on them! I Will not
dialog: leave anyone on this rock with those
dialog: fucking things, even if it means --
text: In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is
text: history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely
text: calm. Curious. Even gentle.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: You'd die for them?
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I would try for them.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: You barely know them.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: But I'm human. I know you view that as a
dialog: weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear,
dialog: theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes.
dialog: I would die for them.
scene_heading: EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready
dialog: to do battle with...
text: Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: (big-eyed)
dialog: You came for us....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed.
dialog: Anyone not ready for this?
scene_heading: EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
text: Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four
text: remaining survivors head out.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Tighter, tighter....
scene_heading: EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Stop.
text: They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: I don't hear --
text: He covers her mouth.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise.
text: A predator drinks there.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: (on his breath)
dialog: Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another.
text: Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major
text: gathering place.
text: Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare
text: is far from over.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Get behind me.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the
text: pool. A slim gap appears.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
text: When I go, we go. Full-throttle.
text: CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Ready...ready....
text: RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.
text: A gauntlet within a gauntlet.
text: Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its
dialog: shoulder.
text: PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.
text: The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing
text: through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to
dialog: reach...
text: The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...
text: And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...
text: Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles
text: her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her
text: slip-sliding down the other side.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: You know the way!
text: Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the
dialog: rise at us.
scene_heading: EXT. NIGHT
text: Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.
scene_heading: PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT
text: Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a
dialog: corner and see...
text: The light of the skiff.
scene_heading: EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey
text: vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we
text: follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly
text: a predator is right there, right in our face.
text: PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look
dialog: up.
text: RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the
text: building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.
text: PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing
text: himself. Ready to blade it out.
scene_heading: EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the
text: headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.
dialog: Waiting.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: Captain....
text: He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes
text: sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for
text: Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:
dialog: There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.
text: Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...
text: And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...
text: A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...
text: Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to
text: fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.
text: Around them both.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: It's me, it's me, it's me!
text: She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face
text: clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry
text: grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them,
dialog: not you.
text: He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start
text: moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the
text: predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.
speaker_heading: FRY
dialog: Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep
dialog: turning...that's right...others're already
dialog: 'board, waitin' for us right now...five
dialog: steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...
dialog: almost there...we're almost --
text: Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.
text: EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got
text: slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Not for me....
text: In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no
text: scream. No cry. No final words. Just...
dialog: Blackness.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT
text: Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It
text: resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits
dialog: escape velocity.
scene_heading: INT. SKIFF - NIGHT
text: CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a
text: rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.
text: In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares
text: hypnotically at the stars ahead.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Probably okay to talk to me now.
speaker_heading: AUDREY
dialog: Not sure where to go. I was just runnin'
dialog: away when this whole thing started.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Where you goin'?
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Not sure. I was just runnin' away when
dialog: this whole thing....
text: Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes
text: a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Might interest you....
text: Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: New Mecca....
speaker_heading: RIDDICK
dialog: Think a soul could get lost there? With
dialog: all those pilgrim-types?
speaker_heading: IMAM
dialog: It's more a place where souls are found,
dialog: Mr. Riddick.
text: As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NEW DAWN
text: The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its
text: light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog:
