scene_heading: SHOOTING DRAFT
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M.
text: We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets,
text: blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small
text: containers. With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up
text: colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little
dialog: color-coded rows. Wait, this container has three Equals and
text: four Sweet 'n' lows. The hand quickly plucks the mutant
dialog: Sweet 'n' Low. There. Symmetry.
text: We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his
text: domain. Something about him. He's extremely compelling,
text: uniquely handsome. But it's more than that. Those eyes,
text: they sparkle with the wonder of a child. Life's cynical edge
text: has not etched it's path across this face. They light on a
text: COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Double double decaf low-fat Cap.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: You got it, buddy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Good choice very good choice.
text: Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet
text: 'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Mocha rumba Frappuccino no whipped, half
dialog: low, half non. Excellent choice. Very
dialog: good choice.
text: He stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the
text: logos all face the same way. His boss GEORGE approaches.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sam, they called. It's time for you to
dialog: go.
text: Sam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam, did you hear me?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "It's time for you to go."
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's time.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Good luck.
text: Without another word, Sam walks straight out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY
text: Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street.
text: He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for
text: anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk. Sam WALKS RIGHT
scene_heading: BETWEEN THEM.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It's time. It's time.
text: Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping.
text: Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT! Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: It's time, it's time for you to go.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LATER
text: Sam plows down the hall and comes to room 324.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Rebecca!
text: Sam pushes the DOOR OPEN. And we REALIZE we are entering: A
scene_heading: HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL.
text: REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction. Her face is
text: the opposite of Sam's. Hardened. She lets out a scream that
text: stops Sam dead in his tracks. GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black
text: Nurse, looks up from the monitor.
speaker_heading: GERTIE
dialog: You the one responsible for this?
text: Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: GERTIE
dialog: Too late for sorries, daddy, get over
dialog: here and hold her hand.
text: Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand. She pulls it away. ANOTHER
text: CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams. Sam SCREAMS.
speaker_heading: NURSE
dialog: You got a live one, Gert.
scene_heading: INT. LABOR ROOM - LATER
speaker_heading: DR. JAMISON
dialog: Okay, this is it!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (spins in circles)
dialog: This is it! This is it!
speaker_heading: DR. JAMISON
dialog: And it's a girl...
text: The BABY lets out her first cry. Sam watches, awestruck.
text: Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to
text: Rebecca. Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW. Gertie walks
text: over to Sam.
speaker_heading: GERTIE
dialog: There's someone who's been waitin' an
dialog: awful long time to see you, Sam.
text: She places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS. Suddenly Sam's whole
text: body RELAXES and becomes very still. He looks to Rebecca,
text: but she has turned away. He meets Gertie's eyes. Then in
dialog: quiet amazement:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is it.
speaker_heading: GERTIE
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (looks at clock)
dialog: Let me see let me see let me see.
text: 12:17, March 2nd. Lucy in the Sky with
dialog: Diamonds. Recorded March 2nd. 1967.
dialog: Lyrics by John Lennon, music by Paul
dialog: McCartney. Lucy Diamond Dawson.
text: We hear LIKE A LULLABY, "Picture yourself on a boat in a
text: river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies..."
scene_heading: EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING
text: Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out,
text: walk down the steps of the hospital holding their
text: complimentary plastic baby bag. Sam is nervous haling the
text: precious cargo and Becca is agitated. They see the bus
text: pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they
text: can hurry and catch it. As he approaches the bus, he looks
text: to Becca by his side, but she is not there. He looks around
text: and no sign of her.
text: Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of
text: her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street. He
text: screams.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Becca! Becca!
text: The more he screams the faster she moves away. Till there's
text: no trace of her. Sam stands in the middle of the busy block
text: holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.
dialog: We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but
dialog: she's gone."
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
text: Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest. Next to him is
text: the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two
text: cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk. Sam is
text: surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground
text: at night. Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two
dialog: against the world.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN
text: A marvel of organization. A closet reveals clothes on
text: hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded
text: T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color. A
text: carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift
text: bookshelves.
text: Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls. Becca's
text: things sit in one corner. An island of chaos in an "Hold
dialog: Everything" showroom. The kitchen counter has been
text: transformed into a changing table. Bottles and pacifiers
text: lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers. Underneath, a
text: clothes line of baby clothes.
text: The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence. The camera
text: follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a
text: blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs. An
text: exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock. He
text: swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back
dialog: to sleep.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Didn't you just fall asleep, little
dialog: girl?
dialog: (Lucy cries harder)
dialog: Okay, if you say it's time to get up,
dialog: then it's time to get up, time to get
dialog: up.
dialog: (Sam sniffs the air)
dialog: Oh my, oh my, oh my. Quite a bit of
dialog: business.
text: He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's
text: pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with
text: promotional buttons: one says "Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals",
text: the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads "Go, Lakers,
text: Go!" Sam undoes it.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Let me
dialog: see let me see let me see.
text: Sam attempts to clean and diaper her. He finally manages to
text: pin the buttons so that it at least stays on.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: You look very beautiful this morning,
dialog: very beautiful.
text: He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf:
scene_heading: HUGGIES, PAMPERS, EXTRA ABSORBENT PAMPERS, LUVS...
scene_heading: INT. WALMART - DAY
text: Sam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed. He reaches
dialog: for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the
text: Huggies. Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in
text: place. Sam decides on one of each. He heads to the FORMULA
text: AISLE. Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified. He
text: stops. Lucy WAILS. WE HEAR THE SONG "HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY"
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 9 P.M.
text: Sam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 11:25 P.M.
text: Sam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock. He's exhausted,
text: but she's just getting started. He puts another blanket on
dialog: her.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 1:30 A.M.
text: Peace. A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the
text: cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate.
text: He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - "YES!" He doesn't
text: get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming. Defeated, he
text: picks her up. HELP. The PHONE RINGS. HE PRESSES speaker.
speaker_heading: RASPY WOMAN (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell are you doing to that
dialog: baby?!
text: He looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor
text: on the phone, watching him through her window. She is a
text: strange creature with very thick glasses. We sense a
text: uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Everything's so tiny, tiny. Tiny.
dialog: Everything. Won't you please come over?
dialog: Help. I need somebody. Won't you
dialog: please please help me.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You know I can't do that. What does her
dialog: mother say?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Her mother? Her mother said "This isn't
dialog: my life. I'm outta here when she comes.
dialog: It didn't mean anything, Sam. It was
dialog: just one night. The two of you. That's
dialog: all I need..." Annie, what if she's
dialog: sick?
scene_heading: EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: ANNIE has her door open a crack. Annie feels the baby's
text: forehead. Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: She's overheated and not eating enough.
dialog: How often are you feeding her?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A lot, Gerber, Carnation, Gerber.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What's a lot?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Three
dialog: squares hot.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Babies need food every two hours, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh. I'm sorry Lucy Diamond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What time does the little diamond wake
dialog: up?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She never really goes to sleep.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Okaaaay. Well, let's assume she's up at
dialog: six. Keep your TV on Nickelodeon. I
dialog: want you to feed her first while
text: "Bewitched" is on. Then again, when
text: "Hogan's Heroes" starts. After that,
dialog: well until "Father Knows Best..."
speaker_heading: CUT:
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING
text: We are watching "Hogan's Heroes". We hear SHULTZ'S INFAMOUS
text: RESPONSE: "I know nothing, absolutely nothing!" Sam feeds a
dialog: content Lucy.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - LATER
text: "Father Knows Best" on TV. Lucy blissfully falls asleep in
text: Sam's arms. Euphoric, he tiptoes to the cradle and places
text: her ever so gently, when suddenly, the FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN.
text: Sam's BEST FRIENDS DESCEND inside: IFTY, a Pakistani
text: gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a
text: large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it. BRAD, who sees
text: himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah
text: Fawcett T-shirt; and ROBERT, highly paranoid, thinks the
text: world's out to get him. Lucy WAILS. Sam RUNS to the CRIB.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What are you doing here now?! Her first
text: sound sleep, not a sound, not a sound.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Eight years every Thursday Video Night
dialog: and you forgot?!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh my god, Video Night. First Thursday
dialog: of the month. Video night at Sam's
dialog: house. I'm sorry, I forgot.
speaker_heading: IFTY
text: Becca's gone. "Gone with the Wind" is a
dialog: very sad movie.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Oh here we go...Everything changes now.
dialog: Soon you'll forget about Wednesday night
dialog: Denny's and Friday night Karaoke. And I
dialog: got hit by a car today.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You did?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: It's probably that guy from the V.A.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: What guy?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: (closing window)
dialog: I can't discuss it. And now this.
text: Ifty makes ORIGAMI BIRDS out of newspapers. Lucy's rapt.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She looks smart, doesn't she?
speaker_heading: IFTY
text: Of course, look. She's already reading
dialog: the newspaper. I have five smart
dialog: sisters in Pakistan. I am only brother.
dialog: "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers" was a
dialog: wonderful movie I forgot to bring last
dialog: week for Video Night...
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Did you get "Blade Runner" for tonight?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Now it's all my fault?!
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Don't tell me you forgot again. I broke
text: a date with a daydream to come here.
text: There's a knock at the door. Ifty goes to get it. Brad
text: moans when he sees his 65 YEAR OLD MOTHER, ESTELLE, standing
text: in the doorway.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Mom! I told you Video Night's over at
dialog: nine! It's only six-thirty!
speaker_heading: ESTELLE
dialog: (unaware of the baby)
dialog: Sorry. I'll wait in the lobby.
text: She exits. Lucy begins to CRY. Brad takes her - like a hot
text: potato, Robert takes her - now Ifty runs around in circles.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: She needs motion. My father drove my
text: sisters in his taxi to get them to go to
dialog: sleep. Two-fifty surcharge on all
dialog: taxi's from the airport...
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I got hit by a taxi on Tuesday.
dialog: And it all starts again and we --
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BUS - NIGHT
text: An empty bus makes its way through the city at night.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - NIGHT
speaker_heading: BUS DRIVER
dialog: Main and Temple...again. She out yet?
text: The camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the
text: back. Sam lies with Lucy spooned into the crook of his arm,
text: almost asleep.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Almost there, almost there. One more
dialog: round and she'll be down for the night.
text: We hear the song "Golden Slumbers". In a SERIES OF
text: DISSOLVES, we see Lucy and Sam in DIFFERENT SLEEPING
text: POSITIONS on the bus seat. Gradually, she GROWS in HIS
scene_heading: PROTECTIVE EMBRACE --
text: ONE MONTH, THEN TWO. NOW FIVE. She's BIG AND ROUND at SIX
text: MONTHS. And on and on into the night...
scene_heading: INT. WALMART'S PHOTO BOOTH - DAY
text: We see Sam and Lucy CRAMMED into the booth, wearing birthday
text: hats, taking HER FIRST BIRTHDAY picture. We see the PHOTO
text: STRIP as it comes out of the slot. Sam's shoulder with
text: Lucy's ear - Lucy's nose with Sam's elbow, their faces never
dialog: made it into the picture.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - 8:30 A.M.
text: The place is packed. Sam moves from table to table,
dialog: cleaning.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Double macciatto, low foam, low-fat.
dialog: Good choice, very good choice.
text: Sam turns and WE SEE LUCY attached to him in a handmade
text: snugly, crocheted by Annie. She faces outward, all hands,
text: all 16 MONTHS of her; too big for the snugly. She grabs a
text: croissant from a customer. George looks confused. Then
text: makes a SWIPE for a customer's coffee, knocking it to the
text: ground. It SPLATTERS all over an anorexic, on-her-fourth
text: double-latte WOMAN in a designer exercise outfit. She begins
text: shrieking. George looks at Sam, this can't go on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Sam, Lucy by his side, has his foot in Annie's door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Please, Annie! She's too big to take to
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm not a baby-sitter. I'm too busy.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Annie, Annie, Annie...
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (suspicious)
dialog: Did you teach her that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It was her first word. Very first word.
text: Annie opens the door, takes Lucy's hand, and pulls her in.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: And people worry you're not smart.
scene_heading: INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - ONE WEEK LATER
text: The apartment looks like a fallout shelter. The kitchen
text: contains enough canned goods to last a year. Brightly
text: colored crocheted doilies - Annie's hobby - adorn every
text: available surface. The BRIGHTLY COLORED WEB of an
speaker_heading: AGORAPHOBE.
text: Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson. WE
text: SEE LUCY'S TINY FINGERS on the keys. In a SERIES OF
text: DISSOLVES, it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note,
text: now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord. Until finally
text: the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of "Twinkle,
dialog: Twinkle, Little Star".
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: This is Mozart. He did twenty-two
dialog: variations of "Twinkle Twinkle Little
dialog: Star". You smell good. You can tell a
dialog: lot about a person by their smell. If
dialog: they've got too much perfume on they're
dialog: covering something up. You gotta watch
dialog: someone who smells like soap. Gotta
dialog: wonder what their priorities are.
dialog: Nervous people. People who try too
dialog: hard. They smell like fish. But you.
dialog: You smell like milk. Milk and hope.
text: Lucy leaves the piano and toddles over to Annie's loom and
text: plays with a ball yarn.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Groceries, Annie.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Thanks.
text: Annie opens the door to pull in the groceries. The ball of
text: yarn ROLLS OUT the door and Lucy chases after it. Annie,
text: terrified, bellows:
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lucy! Come back here! Come back!
text: It becomes obvious Annie can't walk outside. Trembling:
speaker_heading: ANNIE (CONT'D)
dialog: "Lucy in the sky with diamonds..."
text: Hearing the familiar tune, Lucy stops and toddles back.
text: Annie sweeps her up, relieved and we --
scene_heading: INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
text: Sam on stage, with Ifty and Brad as his back-up singers,
text: continuing the song in the oddest, most heartfelt version to
text: Lucy who sits on Robert's lap and in heaven.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - DAY
text: A beautiful blue sky. And "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"
text: continues as Lucy's THREE YEAR OLD laughing face SWINGS INTO
text: FRAME on a swing then DISAPPEARS out THE OTHER END OF FRAME.
text: Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again...
text: Sam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and
text: then disappears. Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by
text: MOTHERS and KIDS at the park.
speaker_heading: LUCY (V.O.)
dialog: Daddy, where does the sky end?
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: Let me see, let me see. I've never been
dialog: there but they say it's somewhere near
dialog: China.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER
text: Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FOUR, sitting on Sam's lap,
dialog: swinging.
speaker_heading: LUCY (V.O.)
dialog: Are lady bugs only girls or are there
dialog: boys, too. And if there are, what are
dialog: they called?
speaker_heading: SAM (V.O.)
dialog: The Beatles.
scene_heading: EXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER
text: Then Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FIVE, followed by Sam.
speaker_heading: LUCY (V.O.)
dialog: Do I look more like you or Mommy?
speaker_heading: ON SAM'S FACE
dialog: He knew this moment would come.
scene_heading: INT. DENNY'S - THURSDAY NIGHT DINNER - EVENING
text: Lucy and Sam are having a serious talk over breaded Sole.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: If you and Mommy liked each other enough
dialog: to have me, how come you're not together
dialog: anymore?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think she fell out of love with me.
dialog: Not you, never you. Me, just me.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: When you fall out of love where do you
dialog: land?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Somewhere in Florida, I think.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Do you think she'll ever come back?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (long pause)
dialog: Paul McCartney lost his mother when he
dialog: was fourteen. John lost his mother
dialog: twice. First when Julie gave John to
dialog: her sister Mimi to raise. And then
text: again when Julia was hit by a car. They
dialog: say God picks certain people, special
dialog: people. That's what they say.
text: Lucy takes this in. Sam begins to shift his tomatoes just
text: so... his potatoes just slightly to the left. Lucy watches.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Daddy, did God mean for you to be like
dialog: this or was it an accident?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you mean - what do you mean?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I mean you're different.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What do you mean? I mean, what do you
dialog: mean?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You're not like the other daddies.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm not am I. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Don't be sorry. I'm lucky. Nobody
dialog: else's daddy ever comes to the park.
speaker_heading: ON SAM'S FACE
text: Filled with relief. Bursting with love.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: We are very lucky, aren't we?
text: Grace approaches with two plates of pie, ice cream on the
dialog: side.
speaker_heading: GRACE
text: Ice cream on the side.
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: Not on top. Not on top.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Good choice. Very good choice.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - THURSDAY NIGHT VIDEO NIGHT
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Brad, I know it was your turn. I'm sure
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I swear to God it was Robert's turn.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Why is it always my fault?
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: I keep track, last time, I say to
dialog: myself, I say, write it down... Bank of
dialog: America give away beautiful calendar,
dialog: every month a picture of wild animal,
dialog: look June, an Elk. Elke Sommer...she
dialog: starred in the remake of "Prisoner of
dialog: Zenda"... Three stars Leonard Maltin
dialog: video movie guide.
text: As they go on, Lucy matter-of-factly PULLS A VIDEO OUT OF HER
text: BACKPACK, and puts it in the VCR. She turns it on. It's
text: "Kramer vs. Kramer". Everyone stops their arguing and stares
dialog: at Lucy.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Annie let me borrow it.
scene_heading: INT. CHILDREN'S SHOE STORE - DAY
text: A row of brand new children's shoes on display. Lucy tries
text: on dozens of school shoes, surrounded by Sam and her
text: "Godfathers": Ifty, Brad and Robert.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You need a good sturdy school shoe.
dialog: Arches are very important.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: Sturdy is boring. Red shoes bring good
dialog: luck.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: But red doesn't got with green.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: Except on Christmas.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: No brown clodhoppers. Everyone will
dialog: make fun of her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: NO ONE will make fun of Lucy.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: She might be stupid.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: No she's not --
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Did they test her?
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: You don't know for sure.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes I do.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: But if she is, don't make her go to
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Don't let her in the lunch room. Johnny
dialog: Marzettie's there.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: And gym. Get her a pass. The rules for
dialog: volleyball are so hard to remember.
dialog: "Rotate Rackman Rotate."
speaker_heading: IFTY
text: Throw the ball at his forehead and the
text: water on his brain will come out his
dialog: nose.
text: Meanwhile, Lucy has been trying on a simple brown shoe.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I like these.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She know what she likes. She likes
dialog: these. How much are they?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
text: Forty-nine ninety-nine.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: One penny less than fifty. These shoes
dialog: are one penny less than fifty?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: It's okay, Dad. I don't really like
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, no no no no.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: We'll all give ten dollars.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: I've only got three plus five. But I
dialog: need one for stamps.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Don't pull your wad out in front of
dialog: people.
text: They all dig in their pockets and begin counting very slowly.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thank you, thank you. We are rich in
dialog: friends. That's what our fortune cookie
dialog: said. 1, 2, 3, 4, quarters that makes
dialog: one.
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: I'll count it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is it enough?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: If there's a God.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Do we get a balloon with these?
speaker_heading: SALESMAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: All of us, or just her?
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STREET NEAR SHOE STORE - DAY
text: Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of
text: man's shoes. We move up from those shoes to see FIVE PAIR OF
text: HANDS tightly clasping their balloons as they march
text: victoriously down the street. We MOVE IN on Lucy's little
text: brown shoes skipping with joy and --
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - DAY
text: Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black
text: soccer cleats. We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a
text: fierce kids soccer game.
text: Score's tied. The ball comes to Lucy. She kicks and misses.
dialog: From the sidelines we hear:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Beautiful kick! Very close!
text: Lucy looks up at her dad proudly. The ball comes again.
dialog: Nobody could miss this one. But Lucy does.

dialog: Thatta girl! Thatta girl! They're
dialog: getting scared now!
text: The game continues. The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES,
text: handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son:
speaker_heading: MR. RHODES
dialog: C'mon, Conner! On your toes! They're
dialog: all counting on you!
text: Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure. Meanwhile, down
text: at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy. She kicks it!
text: Hard. Right into her team's own goal. The crowd GROANS.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hurray, Lucy! You're getting the hang
dialog: of it now! You've got them scared now!
text: Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and
text: NAILS IT! The ball goes flying. The parents in the stand
text: are completely baffled! Sam is completely ecstatic!
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: L-u-c-y! That's our battlecry!
text: The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie,
text: Conner. Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan
dialog: reaming his son --
speaker_heading: MR. RHODES
text: The whole game was right in front of
dialog: your nose! I leave work early to watch
dialog: you blow the whole game!?
text: Conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away.
text: Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy.

text: A child's hand double jumps across a checker board.
speaker_heading: CONNER (O.S.)
dialog: Ha!
text: Lucy and Conner are playing checkers while Sam cooks dinner.
text: Two carrots cut into ten pieces. Bow Tie Pasta - 35 pieces
dialog: each.
speaker_heading: CONNER (CONT'D)
dialog: What's wrong with your father? Why's he
dialog: acting like a retard?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: He is.
text: Their hands graze against each other on the check board - he
text: pulls his hand away.
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: Are you?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: He told me.
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: But he's a retard.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Yeah well it takes one to know one!
text: He crowns her - her eyes shift to Sam in the kitchen, for the
text: first time a bit uneasily.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: Sam's reading Lucy her homework book.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "They perched in sisisi..."
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: "Silence."
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "...silence for a long time." Boy.
dialog: Your teacher chose a hard book this
dialog: time. "How can we be so difdifdif..."
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: "Different."
text: Sam glances up at Lucy self-consciously. Lucy grabs the book
text: from Sam, tosses it on the pile and picks up another.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't like that book - let's read
dialog: "Green Eggs and Ham".
text: Relieved, Sam plunges into the book, which is more memorized
dialog: than read.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: "I am Sam, Sam I am. Do you like green
dialog: eggs and ham? I do not like them, Sam I
dialog: am!"
text: They both laugh, delighted. Lucy looks sleepy.
speaker_heading: MATCH DISSOLVE:
text: Lucy is getting drowsy. Sam is just getting started.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: "And I will eat them here and there.
dialog: Say I will eat them ANYWHERE. I do so
dialog: like green eggs and ham, thank you thank
dialog: you, Sam I am!" One more time!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Daddy, I have school tomorrow...I don't
dialog: wanna be too sleepy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Just the part about the boat and the
dialog: goat in the rain in the train?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Daddy, Hamburger Hamlet has twelve
dialog: different kinds of hamburgers. Can we
dialog: go there Wednesday instead of Denny's?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But Wednesday night's Denny's,
dialog: Thursday's Video Night, Friday Night
dialog: Karaoke.
text: Lucy nods, a little deflated.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: How about one more time, just the
dialog: beginning? "I am Sam, Sam I am..."
text: Lucy sighs and closes her eyes against her father's chest.
scene_heading: INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Lucy draws a picture while everyone reads aloud from
text: "STELLALUNA".
speaker_heading: MISS WRIGHT
dialog: Lucy, your turn. Start where Sara left

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I can't.
speaker_heading: MISS WRIGHT
dialog: Sure you can.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: "They perched in sisisisi..."
speaker_heading: MISS WRIGHT
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (throws down book)
dialog: There. I told you. It's too hard.
speaker_heading: MISS WRIGHT
dialog: Lucy! I know you can read this!
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No, I can't! And you can't make me!
text: Lucy runs out of the class.
scene_heading: EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK
text: Sam, in sunglasses, waits for the BUS. A YOUNG WOMAN, LILY,
text: sits down next to him. The WIND CATCHES her floral dress
dialog: that's just left of innocent; just right of alluring. She
text: reads a TABLOID.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Look here. "Premature baby claims he's
dialog: cupid - has the arrow to prove it." Do
dialog: you believe that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Well, if he has the arrow.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yeah. You got a good point.
text: She crosses her legs. A tuft of pink dress falls on Sam's
dialog: knee.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're a good reader.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Yeah, I've always been smart.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're lucky. I'm looking for a smart,
dialog: good mother.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I can be a mother. A real good mother.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, good. Good.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I could even spank you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh no no no. I don't believe in that.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Okay okay. I can be very gentle.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Gentle. Gentle. Yes. Do you tell
dialog: stories?
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: I got stories up the wazoo. Why don't
dialog: you come with me. I'll tell you a nice
dialog: story.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I have to pick up Lucy at Annie's first.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: A menage a toi?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: French, French the language of France.
dialog: You could teach my daughter, Lucy.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Your daughter?! Can't you pick her up
dialog: after?!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: After?! No no, Lucy comes too.
speaker_heading: LILY
dialog: Whatever.
text: She takes Sam's hand, they move to get on the bus JUST AS
text: ANOTHER HAND brusquely lands on theirs.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Not so fast. You're under arrest.
dialog: Solicitation.
speaker_heading: LILY

dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - THAT NIGHT
text: Sam blinks as his MUGSHOT is being taken. Now the profile.
text: He turns so they can get the back of his head. Now the
scene_heading: FINGERPRINT.
text: Now Sam, in the corner of the room, on the phone making
text: thumbprints on the wall. While the COP discusses his case
text: with a social worker, MARGARET BROWN. Over the years she's
dialog: seen it all, and to get through it has had to pretend it's
dialog: just a job.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: It's the first time in nineteen years I
dialog: actually believe the guy when he says he
dialog: didn't know she was a hooker --
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: You say that like it's a good thing.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: ...Your teeth don't sound like they were
dialog: brushed. Do it with me now.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Let him go. He says he's never spent a
dialog: night away from his kid... Come with me -
dialog: I got a guy who beat the shit out of his
text: two year old. Again.
text: Her cell phone beeps.
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: Yes. I am seeing you tomorrow, Mr.
text: Rabins. She's still screaming? No,
dialog: McDonald's won't help...she's four
dialog: months old.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thirteen up...not on the gum line not on
dialog: the gum line, 1, 2, 3.
text: Margaret watches Sam as he talks to Lucy on the phone.
scene_heading: INT. PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY
text: The WALLS are lined with CHILDREN'S ART. Various
text: interpretations of the family. We stop at one of a very
text: small man and a very big little girl with her arm around him.
speaker_heading: MISS WRIGHT
dialog: It gives us a great deal of insight into
dialog: what she must be feeling. And in the
text: classroom, it's becoming clear she's
text: holding herself back. It's as if she's
dialog: literally afraid to learn.
text: We PULL BACK and see Sam staring at the picture. Mrs. Wright
text: and the principal watch him.
speaker_heading: MISS WRIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: No one doubts that you love your
dialog: daughter, Mr. Dawson. But the
dialog: Department of Social Services contacted
dialog: us. They shared with us that your
dialog: records show that your intellectual
dialog: capacity is around that of a seven year
dialog: old. Our concern is what happens when
dialog: Lucy turns eight?
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Mr. Dawson, do you understand what Miss
dialog: Wright is trying to tell you about Lucy?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No one wanted The Beatles to break up.
dialog: But you can hear it on the White Album.
text: They were going in different directions.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: It's bedtime. Sam and Lucy are reading from "STELLALUNA".
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: How can we be so dif..dif...I don't know
dialog: that word.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes you do. It starts with a "d" --
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'm tired.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't believe you.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Are you calling me a liar?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes. Now read the word.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (crying)
dialog: No...I'm stupid.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I don't want to read it if you can't.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: It makes me happy. I'm happy hearing
dialog: you read it.
text: He holds the book open for Lucy. Now Lucy, pushing through a
text: mountain of resistance, reads. And reads beautifully.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: "Why are we different and so much
dialog: alike?"
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLOWEEN PARADE - AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: Two children, dressed as Batman, march followed by
text: CINDERELLA. We see Lucy dressed in NEWSPAPER - an ORIGAMI
text: BIRD. And behind her, marching more proudly than any child,
text: is Sam, dressed as PAUL McCARTNEY, in the black suit era -
text: with Beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest. Sam is
text: the only adult participating in the parade.
text: Music BLASTS over the loudspeaker. Sam begins to dance with
text: joyous abandon. Lucy joins him. They dance together
text: happily.
text: Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning
text: to laugh. She slows and watches through their eyes Sam pony
text: around the room. Conner pulls up his pants high on his waist
text: and begins to imitate Sam. Another kid joins him.
speaker_heading: KID
dialog: I'm a Super Freak!
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: And I thought my dad was a dork.
text: Lucy's face hardens for the first time. In a corrupt world
dialog: the pure can only stay pure for so long.
scene_heading: INT. HAMBURGER HAMLET - EVENING
text: Sam and Lucy sit in a booth. Lucy's ecstatic. Sam's trying.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: They have eleven different kinds of
dialog: hamburgers. This is so great.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A new place. Your choice. I said we'd
dialog: go to a new place. And here we are.
text: Sam anxiously rearranges the condiments on the table. Lucy
text: tries to fold a napkin into an Origami bird.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You know what else I want for my
dialog: birthday, Daddy? I want a hundred
dialog: birds.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: The napkins are much stiffer at Denny's.
dialog: They make better birds. There's not so
text: much stuff on the tables there either.
dialog: Why do they have two kinds of mustard on
dialog: every table?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Coffee?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, no coffee. Sam's system can't
dialog: handle coffee.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Okaaay! What can I get you folks?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I'd like the Benito Bandito burger and a
dialog: chocolate chip milkshake, please.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll have the fish special, side of
dialog: potatoes, salad with Thousand Island
dialog: Dressing, cherry pie, and...
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: I'm sorry, sir. We don't have a fish
dialog: special. There's fish and chips. It
text: comes with a dinner salad.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Chips, chips? You mean potato chips? I
dialog: don't want potato chips. I want a side
dialog: of potatoes.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: You want french fries?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, a side of potatoes, like at Denny's.
text: A side of potatoes.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: They're little red potatoes.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: We don't have new potatoes...
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Denny's has new potatoes. Six new
dialog: potatoes parsley garnish parsley
dialog: garnish...
speaker_heading: ON LUCY
text: Her smile fades.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DENNY'S - HALF-HOUR LATER
text: Sam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes.
text: Lucy's untouched dinner sits in the middle of the table. She
text: doodles on the placement - drawing a man sitting with a pile
text: of new potatoes in front of him; larger than he is.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fish and chips fish and chips. I will
dialog: not eat fish and chips.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: I will not eat them here or there! I
dialog: will not eat them anywhere! I will not
dialog: eat green eggs and ham! I will not eat
dialog: them, Sam I am!
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Balloons and a banner reading "Happy Birthday, Lucy!" For
text: Lucy's birthday, Sam has rented a moon bounce - which sits in
text: the center of the apartment and filling the entire place -
text: leaving no room for the few kids and their parents. Brad
text: stands too close to a young attractive mother. Robert shakes
text: all the presents suspiciously.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Now when they come through the door,
dialog: everybody yell "Surprise!" Do you want
dialog: to rehearse again?
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: No. I bet she already knows.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I didn't tell her. Did Brad say I did?
text: There's a KNOCK at the door.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Is that Lucy? Annie's supposed to call
dialog: and warn us. Shhhh, everyone.
text: Brad hits the lights. Sam OPENS THE DOOR and everyone yells
text: "SURPRISE!" But instead of Lucy, it's the Social Worker.
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: I don't know if you remember me. I'm
dialog: Margaret Brown from Children's Social
dialog: Services. We met at the police station.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Put your present over there - Hurry up!
text: Lucy might be on her way.
dialog: (the phone rings)
dialog: Hello? Annie says she's coming up the
dialog: stairs. Everyone be quiet. Assume
dialog: surprise positions!
dialog: (Conner keeps talking)
dialog: Be quiet! Assume surprise positions!
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: Oh brother!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Why are you such a party pooper?!
dialog: Assume surprise positions!
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: Make me!
text: Sam puts a hand over Conner's mouth; Conner struggles against
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: MR. RHODES
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's gonna ruin the surprise! He's
dialog: gonna ruin the surprise!
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: He touched me! I've got cooties! I've
dialog: got cooties!
speaker_heading: MR. RHODES
dialog: Get your hands off my boy!
text: Conner's father hurls Sam across the room - Sam gets tangled
text: in the MOON BOUNCE! To get attention, Conner bursts into
text: tears. We hear FOOTSTEPS outside the door - Brad hits the
text: lights. We hear a CRASH! And in the light, the DOOR SHEDS
text: as it opens, Lucy and Ifty see - that MOONBOUNCE, swaying.
text: Then from within the Moonbounce:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Surprise! Happy Birthday!
text: Lucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Daddy?!
speaker_heading: CONNER
dialog: You don't have to call him "Daddy".
dialog: (in Sam's face)
dialog: She says you're not her real father,
dialog: anyway. She's adopted!
text: Humiliated, Lucy RUNS AWAY! The Social Worker watches,
text: profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone.
scene_heading: EXT. WALMART - DAY
text: A police car pulls into the parking lot. Sam and Margaret in
text: the back. Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling
text: from beneath the curtain of the photo booth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'll go get her.
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: It would be better if you stay here.
dialog: I'm sorry to say this, Mr. Dawson, it's
dialog: clear how much you love your daughter,
dialog: but we're going to have to remove Lucy
dialog: from your home.
text: Sam's baffled. One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder,
text: restraining him. The OTHER heads toward the photo booth.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, no no no. It's her birthday! It's
dialog: her birthday!
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: I know how hard this must be...
dialog: (cell phone rings)
dialog: ...Hello, Betsy. I'm scheduled to come
dialog: to your apartment at four. No, not five
dialog: every two hours. It's two every five
text: hours. She only weighs thirty pounds
dialog: for chrissakes...
dialog: (back to Sam)
dialog: The city has given me the difficult task
dialog: of deciding when to intervene on behalf
dialog: of the child. Unfortunately, I've
dialog: learned the hard way that it's better
dialog: too soon than too late. For now the
dialog: court will decide what's in Lucy's best
dialog: interest.
text: Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain.
text: Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Run, Lucy, run!
text: We see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his
text: grasp. She flies out the booth, holding that balloon. She
text: runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a
text: cop follows. Sam struggles.
speaker_heading: ON SAM
text: Reeling, devastated, we HEAR A JUDGE speaking:
speaker_heading: JUDGE (O.S.)
dialog: Given the fact that the father was
dialog: arrested for solicitation, did not
dialog: cooperate with the police...
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: Sam sits ALONE. At another table, Margaret Brown and a
text: lawyer, along with several people from the CPS.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: ...could not control his emotions,
text: endangering other children. Miss Brown
dialog: also cites Mr. Dawson's mental
dialog: deficiencies which raise serious
dialog: questions about his ability to properly
dialog: parent. I agree to grant petition.
dialog: The child shall be removed from the home
dialog: until a forma jurisdictional hearing.
dialog: Mr. Dawson, is there anything you'd like
dialog: to add?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes. I just wanted it to be a nice
dialog: surprise party. I had gotten the plates
text: at Pic-N-Save. Pink and yellow, pink
text: and yellow. Like a princess. And the
dialog: balloons at --
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Mr. Dawson, it sounds like a lovely
dialog: party, but right now I want to talk to
dialog: you about your legal rights. I would
dialog: strongly suggest you get yourself legal
dialog: counsel and allow your attorney to
dialog: present your case at the jurisdictional
dialog: hearing on February 13th. Counsel, are
dialog: you available?
speaker_heading: COUNSEL
dialog: Ted, I have a trial that day.
speaker_heading: JUDGE
text: February 20th. 8:00 a.m.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: Twenty-two days? Lucy will come home
dialog: and you want me to bring Lucy back in
dialog: twenty-two days?
speaker_heading: JUDGE
dialog: No, Mr. Dawson. You'll have supervised
dialog: visits twice a week for two hours. Now
dialog: I'm sorry, we have thirty more cases to
dialog: see today. Next! Hopkins vs. Clifford.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: Sam's on the phone, a teddy bear in his hand. Robert, Ifty,
text: and Brad all sit with Yellow Pages open in front of them.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Thursday? Today is Monday, Mrs. Brown.
dialog: That's three days away. That's too
dialog: long. She can't sleep without Mr.
dialog: Jeeters. Well if you're not available
dialog: until Thursday, maybe I could see her
dialog: without you there...
dialog: maybe the Judge made a mistake - maybe
dialog: he doesn't know that for seven years I
dialog: played with her without you there...No
dialog: Mrs. Brown, I'm not trying to violate
dialog: the court...
dialog: (the other line hangs up)
dialog: Mrs. Brown?
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I bet they were recording the whole
dialog: conversation. Check your phone. You
dialog: can't make a move. You need a lawyer.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Call Jerry Spence. He has his own show.
text: He must know what he's doing.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: No. Johnny Cochran. He has his own
dialog: show, too.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Yeah! He can even get a guilty person
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: So you think I'm guilty?
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: No. You didn't kill anybody.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But she said I'm not her father.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: She didn't say that. That runty kid
dialog: with the blue shirt and the mean father
text: whose voice sounds like the man on the
text: Channel Four News who has a toupee.
dialog: Toupees are expensive.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But Ifty. She said it.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: But she didn't mean it. I said I hated
dialog: my mother once. "Once upon a time..."
dialog: is how stories begin.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: You should get a personal injury lawyer.
dialog: You've been personally injured.
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Here - look at this - "Sebastion
dialog: Gibson." He can do anything.
text: Pedestrians. Back and neck. Uninsured
text: Motorist. Dog attacks.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The Social Worker said it's a custody
dialog: case.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: Then get a divorce lawyer.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: When Dustin Hoffman was trying to keep
text: Billy from going back to Meryl Streep,
dialog: his lawyer said it was going to cost him
dialog: fifteen thousand dollars - and that's if
dialog: we win!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fifteen thousand dollars!

text: panoramic of Los Angeles. Now the dots in the Lichtenstein
text: on the wall WHIRL PAST US. Now the DOOR SWINGS OPEN AND --
text: RITA HARRISON and her assistant burst in. Rita moves in
text: opposite circles around the room. Looking for something. In
text: fact, as we watch Rita, we realize that she never stops
text: moving. Period. Ten steps ahead of anyone, too much energy,
dialog: too much caffeine, not enough food. If she slowed down a

text: Annie plays even harder. Frustrated, he POUNDS the piano.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: We can't lose her.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I can't. I'd make it worse for you. I
dialog: can't do it. Don't you think I would if
dialog: I could?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
dialog: We HEAR A VOICE:
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: All rise for the Honorable Judge Phillip
dialog: McNeily.
text: Sam stands along with others in the courtroom. The Judge
text: enters and sits. Everyone else sits now, too. Except Sam.
text: Who continues to stand until Rita pulls him down. Now we
dialog: see:
text: Ifty, Robert, Brad - and Brad's MOTHER, who sits several
text: seats behind Brad knitting. Robert holds up a handmade sign
text: from the back of the courtroom "Free Lucy Dawson".
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER
text: Turner, the prosecuting attorney, examines his first witness.
dialog: He's disheveled, but don't let the rumpled suit fool you.
text: This man is razor-sharp. The THERAPIST who evaluated Sam is
text: on the stand. Sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the
text: desk he sits at with Rita. Projected on a SCREEN is a SLIDE
dialog: of the drawing Lucy made in school.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: ...there is an unhealthy reversal of
dialog: roles here.
dialog: As you can see from her drawings, she
dialog: has an exaggerated sense of
dialog: responsibility. Lucy feels she has to
dialog: take care of her father. Although at
dialog: her birthday party her true feelings
dialog: about her father were revealed.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection. "True feelings revealed"?!
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: The state is paying Miss Geller for her
dialog: opinions -
speaker_heading: RITA
text: Then every child who rages because they
dialog: didn't get to stay up for that extra
dialog: hour of TV -
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Objection your honor -
text: Sam TUGS at Rita's sleeve. She ignores it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: ...in fact any child who said they hated
dialog: their parents because they didn't want
dialog: to take a bath would be a prime
dialog: candidate for Foster Care.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think they want you to stop.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Really?! Thank you, Sam.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: We all appreciate your assistance Mr.
dialog: Dawson - continue with your witness, Mr.
dialog: Turner.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Now Ms. Geller, I assume in your therapy
dialog: session, Mr. Dawson extolled his
dialog: parenting abilities.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: On the contrary, Mr. Dawson admitted he
dialog: felt profoundly inadequate - that he was
dialog: terrified he'd made and would continue
dialog: to make - and I quote: "Huge mistakes,
dialog: huge mistakes, mistakes that are huge."
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: No further questions.
text: Rita starts to scribble notes furiously. So does Sam.
text: Turner smugly sits down. Rita confidently strides toward the
dialog: witness.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You're a mother, aren't you Ms. Geller?
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Would it be fair to say that as a
dialog: parent, you've felt confused from time
text: to time, possibly overwhelmed on
dialog: occasion, even though you're a wonderful
dialog: mother?
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Objection. It's Mr. Dawson's parenting.
dialog: Not Ms. Geller's that's at question
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: But if Ms. Geller has never had a moment
dialog: where she felt confused as a mother it
dialog: would bias her opinion. And it is her
dialog: expert opinion we're all after, isn't
dialog: it, Mr. Turner?
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: Overruled. I'll allow it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Thank you, your Honor. Ms. Geller, I
dialog: know there have been many moments as a
dialog: parent where I've felt I've made huge
dialog: mistakes - mistakes that are huge. And
dialog: I've had to admit them to myself. My
dialog: husband. But most importantly, to my
dialog: therapist. Which is the guise Mr.
dialog: Dawson thought he was seeing you under,
dialog: isn't that right, Ms. Geller?
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: Get to the point, Ms. Harrison.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: The point is you've never had those
dialog: moments, have you Ms. Geller? Moments
dialog: that every parent I've ever spoken to
dialog: has - moments when you've felt the task
dialog: is so unbelievably challenging that you
text: feel retarded, disabled in some way.
dialog: Moments when you feel everyone has the
dialog: key but you. But you've never had those
dialog: moments, have you Ms. Geller?
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: I -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yes or no?
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: I -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Let me rephrase the question. When your
dialog: son od'ed -
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: But if Ms. Geller didn't feel she had
dialog: made mistakes - mistakes that were huge
dialog: it might bias her opinion toward Mr.
dialog: Dawson.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: I will -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Thank you. So Ms. Geller - yes or no -
dialog: when your son od'ed, did you feel you
dialog: might have made mistakes, mistakes that
dialog: were huge?
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: (tearfully)
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Sam and Rita go down the cafeteria line.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Only in there.
speaker_heading: SAM

speaker_heading: RITA

speaker_heading: CAFETERIA WORKER
dialog: Absolutely.
text: Sam is anxiously separating his Lima beans and corn into

speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My treat. My treat.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Don't be ridiculous. I'll get it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I said it's my treat. That means I'll
dialog: get it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sam, do you really want to get it or are
dialog: you just trying to --
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Trying to what?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You know, trying to act like a -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Like a what?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Like a...a...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: A real man?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I didn't say that.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're my lawyer and you think what they
dialog: think. I don't have a chance. No
dialog: chance at all. Even with an expert
dialog: witness.
text: Rita looks at him. He's right. She chooses her words
dialog: carefully.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I think...you deserve...a fair trial.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Answer the question.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay okay okay. What was the question
dialog: again?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Do you think what they think? Sam can't
dialog: order food. Sam can't pay a check. Sam
dialog: can't take care of Lucy?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It doesn't matter what I think - it
dialog: matters that we win.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're my lawyer it matters what you
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Hey, it doesn't matter to them what I
dialog: think.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Me. It matters to me.
text: He reaches for the receipt, and faces the CASHIER defiantly.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Fourteen thirty three. That's 5 ones, 2
dialog: quarters and 16 cents less than twenty.
text: He slowly counts his money, takes his tray and walks away.
text: Rita watches him, with a trace of remorse and a hint of
dialog: admiration.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: DR. DONOVAN, an attractive soft-spoken woman is on the stand.
text: Rita is working the room. Sam, having a hard time
text: concentrating, is following a crack up the wall and onto the
dialog: ceiling.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Dr. Donovan, the American Medical
dialog: Journal named you one of the country's
dialog: leading oncologists. Isn't that
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: DR. DONOVAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What kept you going the twelve years you
dialog: were in medical school?
speaker_heading: DR. DONOVAN
dialog: Caffeine. Sugar. And my mother's
dialog: confidence in me.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I wish I had a mother like that. She
dialog: must have been smart.
speaker_heading: DR. DONOVAN
dialog: She had great instincts.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Do you have any idea what her IQ was?
speaker_heading: DR. DONOVAN
text: In the lower ranges. About eighty.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: So your mother, this woman with the IQ
dialog: of a nine-year old had the wisdom to
dialog: recognize that you would be a great
dialog: doctor. I guess her disability didn't
dialog: seem to hold you back in life.
speaker_heading: DR. DONOVAN
dialog: No. My mother's condition taught me
dialog: what they can't teach you; compassion
dialog: and patience.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Traits most doctors have in spades.
dialog: Thank you, no further questions.
text: Sam runs to hug Dr. Donovan, bumping into Rita who sits him
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: How'd you get through medical school?
dialog: Where'd you live?
speaker_heading: DR. DONOVAN
dialog: We lived with my mother's parents.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Oh, Grandma and Grandpa. Would it be
dialog: fair to say your grandparents were of
dialog: normal intelligence?
speaker_heading: DR. DONOVAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: And didn't these people - your
dialog: grandparents - with normal intelligence -
dialog: have the real responsibilities?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (relishing this)
dialog: Objection! I hear Mr. Turner's mother
dialog: in-law lives with him! She must help
dialog: out. Does that mean he doesn't have the
dialog: real -
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Motion to strike that from the record.
text: Irrelevant, immaterial and immature -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Irrelevant?! Any parent has a right to
text: a support system.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: I'm not talking about the rights of the
dialog: parent, I'm talking about the rights of
text: a child.
dialog: (the gavel bangs)
dialog: I'm talking about entrusting an eight
dialog: year old's welfare in the hands of
dialog: someone whose records show he was
dialog: diagnosed with infantile autism, mental
dialog: retardation...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection! Motion to strike that from
dialog: the record. It's clear that one's
dialog: intellectual capacity has no bearing on
dialog: their ability to love. You Honor, would
dialog: you please instruct council to proceed
dialog: with a modicum of sensitivity?
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Oh, I'm sensitive. I'm real sensitive
dialog: when I see people like you --
dialog: (the gavel BANGS!)
dialog: come here and try to give meaning to
dialog: your life by screwing up somebody
dialog: else's!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: That's enough. Both lawyers approach
dialog: the bench!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (both approach)
dialog: And I suppose tearing apart a family is
dialog: truly noble work, Mr. Turner.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: That's it. I fine you both for
dialog: contempt. Two-hundred fifty dollars.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: What's that to her? She gets that for
text: picking up the phone.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, that's what this is about.
speaker_heading: TURNER

speaker_heading: ON RITA AND SAM

speaker_heading: TURNER

speaker_heading: LUCY

speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yes. Short and sweet.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: Yes. One sentence. Short and sweet.
dialog: My aunt was short and sweet. But her
dialog: cooking was too spicy she...
text: Rita's twitching foot knocks over her purse. Out spill
text: several Snickers Bars with the chocolate picked off them.
text: Embarrassed, she kneels to pick them up when she and Sam see
text: something that stops them both, awestruck. In the corner of
text: the corridor, huddled on a bench in dark sunglasses, sits
text: ANNIE IN A PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS SUIT. Sam runs to her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Annie! I can't believe it!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (visibly trembling)
dialog: Tell them to take me quickly.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Give me one minute with the judge.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
text: Annie, wearing her dark glasses, is being questioned by Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Besides being Lucy's godmother, aren't
dialog: you also Lucy's piano teacher?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Lucy's very lucky. Didn't you graduate
dialog: Magna Cum Laud from the Julliard School
dialog: of Music?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Summa Cum Laud.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (delighted)
dialog: Excuse me. Now Ms. Cassell, in all the
dialog: time you've known them, have you ever
dialog: questioned Sam's ability as a father?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Never?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Never. Look at Lucy. She's strong,
text: she's able to display true empathy for
dialog: people, all kinds of people. I know you
dialog: all think she's as bright as she is
text: despite him. But it's because of him.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Turner stands where Rita did.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Can Sam add?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: How about multiplication?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: He's learning.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: So what you're saying is that Sam can
dialog: not even multiply two times two?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't know about you, Mr. Turner, but
dialog: my fondest memories of my parents have
dialog: nothing to do with times tables or state
dialog: capitals.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: I bet he's knocking on your door all the
dialog: time with questions.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Yes. All the time. The last question
dialog: was whether to use Biz or Clorox to get
text: the grass stains out of Lucy's soccer
dialog: uniform.
speaker_heading: ON RITA AND SAM
dialog: This is too good to be true.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: So let's see..he doesn't know math...he
dialog: can't even wash her clothes. How about
dialog: puberty? I can only imagine how much
dialog: insight he'll bring to approaching the
dialog: sensitive issues of a young girl's
dialog: development.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Mr. Turner, show me a father, any
dialog: father, who knows how to do that and
dialog: I'll give them the Parent of the Year
dialog: award.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: And you've had plenty of opportunity to
dialog: observe fathers, haven't you?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: But the fact that Ms. Cassell hasn't
dialog: come out of her room in years might have
dialog: some effect on her perception.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: I'll allow it.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I had twenty eight years in the world to
dialog: observe all kinds of fathers.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: What about your father, Ms. Cassell?
dialog: Since you appear to be an expert on
dialog: father-daughter relationships.
text: A long pause. Sam watches as Annie visibly tightens.
speaker_heading: TURNER (CONT'D)
dialog: Excuse me, Ms. Cassell, I didn't hear
dialog: your response. What about your father?
text: Annie reaches for her water glass. We see her hand SHAKE.
text: It knocks over the glass, shattering it on the floor.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Objection! No further questions!
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Dawson?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I said that's enough! I will not allow
dialog: it! Overruled! Overruled!!
text: Rita doesn't stop him. The Judge hesitates, incredulous,
text: then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK
text: Rita sits in her Porsche with Annie and Sam. Annie is curled
text: into a tight ball in the passenger seat. Sam is tucked into
text: the shelf in the back. His legs kick Rita in the face with
dialog: every gear shift.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Thank you again, Annie. You were truly
dialog: extraordinary.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Extraordinary. Truly extraordinary.
text: Annie doesn't move.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay okay okay okay. Well, Sam has his
dialog: big day on the stand tomorrow and we
dialog: need to work a little bit so that he's
dialog: as effective as you were.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Effective. Very effective.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: On a Porsche, the, uh, the door handle
dialog: is a little hidden by that thingamajig,
dialog: so if you're having a hard time finding
dialog: it I'll just --
text: Rita reaches across to open Annie's door when she SCREAMS!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Noooooooo!
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Annie's not quite ready to go outside
dialog: yet.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay, we'll just take our time.
scene_heading: INT. PORSCHE - TWO HOURS LATER
text: It's dark now. Annie is still catatonic. Rita's on the car
text: phone, the kind that voice activates and she's yelling.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Home! Home! HOME GODDAMNIT! Juanita,
text: help Danny with his English assignment.
dialog: Ayude Danny un story...story...STORIO!
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (rising from the dead)
dialog: I'm ready now.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Good, fine, Sam? Annie's ready.
text: Sam's fallen asleep.
scene_heading: EXT. RITA'S LAVISH BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT
text: Rita and Sam enter.
scene_heading: INT. RITA'S BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT
text: Sam is awestruck at the magnificent home.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay okay okay okay. We'll work in the
text: library. It's down the hall and to the
dialog: left.
text: They pass another room and see Danny zoned out in front of
text: the wide-screen TV watching MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Danny.
dialog: (no answer)
dialog: Where's your father?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: (staring at TV)
dialog: Guess.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't want to guess. Where is he?
dialog: (Sam watches Rita)
dialog: I told you I don't want to guess.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Well where was he last night?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Working late.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: There you guessed it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: He said he was working late?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: That's what he said.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well who did he say was taking care of
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You. But you said you were working
dialog: late.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I am working late.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Then go work.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How was your day?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: You have to work. Go work.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No. How was your -
text: Her CELL PHONE goes off. Rita moves into the hallway to
text: answer her phone. Sam moves into the den, sits on the couch,
text: the sound of Rita arguing with her husband drifts into the
text: room. Sam looks sideways at Danny who remains stonefaced.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is my favorite part. Hey Dommy,
text: this one looks like he's suffering from
text: shell shock.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Boy I guess we can shell it out... It
dialog: was a shell of a good hit.
text: Rita stands in the doorway watching Sam have a longer
dialog: conversation with her son than she's had in months. She
dialog: retreats.
scene_heading: INT. RITA'S DEN - LATER
text: Danny and Sam eat popcorn watching the movie.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (bellowing)
dialog: "Turtles in the half-shell, turtle
dialog: power!" Rita! Come this is the best
dialog: part.
text: He heads towards Rita.
scene_heading: INT. PANTRY - CONTINUOUS
text: In the half-light Sam catches a glimpse of Rita standing in
text: the pantry unconsciously stuffing marshmallows into her
text: mouth. Their eyes lock for a moment.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You eat too fast. Come watch the movie.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's getting late. We have to get to
dialog: work.
dialog: (handing him a suit)
dialog: This is my husband's. He won't notice.
dialog: He's got ten more just like it. Try it
dialog: on.
scene_heading: INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Sam comes out of the bathroom in the new suit. Rita stares
text: at him astonished. He looks incredibly handsome. Rita,
text: attempting to stifle her reaction, turns away from Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Bad?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: No. Very, very good. But your tie's
dialog: crooked.
text: Rita stands behind Sam with her around him showing him how to
text: do his tie properly. Their images are reflected in the
dialog: mirror.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Cross over once. Loop it around on the
dialog: inside of your neck.
text: (her hand grazes his neck)
text: Slide the other side through the loop,
dialog: then tighten.
text: Rita comes around to the front and straightens and tightens
text: the tie. They are both nervous. The room is charged.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay okay okay okay. Our strategy is
dialog: that we're aggressively pursuing a
dialog: support system. I'm going to ask you h
dialog: ow are you prepared to help Lucy in
dialog: school?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let me see let me see let me see.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sam! I told you you have to stop that!
dialog: It makes you look stupid! Okay okay
dialog: okay. Try again.
dialog: (endless pause)
dialog: You say you will find her a tutor. Then
dialog: I say, "How will you pay for it?"
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Could you slow down? Why do you eat so
dialog: fast?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: We've gone over this a million times.
dialog: You've found a free tutoring service for
text: her at the YMCA.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: But I didn't. You did.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Can't you grasp the concept of
dialog: manipulating the truth? Not lying.
dialog: Just a little tweak here and there.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No...You're so lucky. You get to play
dialog: with Danny all the time.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: He doesn't want to play with me.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes he does. He does he does. He
dialog: thinks you don't want to.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh that's ridiculous of course I want
dialog: to.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Tweak, tweak.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: I drove around after work yesterday 'til
dialog: 9:30 looking for a goddman razor
dialog: scooter!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (in his own world)
dialog: Tweak, squeak, peek peek...
text: Rita shifts uneasily, embarrassed by her overreaction.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - LATER
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Okay, why did you harass that young boy
dialog: at your home?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You know I didn't harass him, Rita. You
dialog: know that, you know that!
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sam, I'm pretending to be Mr. Turner,
dialog: remember? Okay?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. I didn't harass
dialog: him, Mr. Turner. Mr. Turner -
dialog: (Sam can't keep a straight
dialog: face)
dialog: You don't look like him.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: That's a blessing.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're so much prettier.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (suddenly shy)
dialog: Thank you. Now.
dialog: What makes you think you can take care
dialog: of a woman - I mean a young child - when
dialog: you have a hard time taking care of
dialog: yourself?
scene_heading: INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - TWO HOURS LATER
text: Rita is relentless. Sam is exhausted but determined.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: But who are you kidding? Isn't Lucy
dialog: already smarter than you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: In some ways. But in other ways, she's
dialog: not, I think.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You think?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sam. You've got to be firm on this.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I think in other ways I'm smarter than
dialog: her. Smarter than you are, Mr. Turner.
dialog: In fact, in some ways I'm smarter than
dialog: you, Judge McNeilly.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Whoa! Bring it down.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What parent doesn't want more for their
dialog: child? To be more than the sum of the
text: parts of the whole of them.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yeah yeah yeah, but it's one thing for a
dialog: little girl to love her daddy when she's
text: a baby, but once she loses respect for
dialog: you, what will you do?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (fierce)
dialog: I won't let that happen. I won't.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How can you say that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Respect is not just about how smart
dialog: someone is. Smart is not just about how
dialog: smart someone is.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: But what about Lucy? Aren't you being
dialog: selfish? Doesn't she deserve a better
dialog: life? Don't you think she's just
dialog: pretending she's happy to not hurt your
dialog: feelings?
text: Sam jumps up from the table, trembling with anger.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Lucy is happy! We have fun! We go to
dialog: Denny's, we go to video night. I know
dialog: how to love her. I know I'm not going
dialog: to able to go to law school and learn
dialog: how to be a mean person, but I know how
dialog: to love. I know how to be her father,
dialog: Mr. Turner!
text: By this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard,
text: overcome with emotion. Rita is unexpectedly near tears.
text: Suddenly before she knows it, she is HOLDING SAM. The room
text: charged. She speaks tenderly, moved by this awkward boy/man.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I know you do, Sam. I know you do.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING
text: Sam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You look great, Sam. What time do you
dialog: have to be in court?
speaker_heading: SAM
text: Half day, half day. I take the stand at
dialog: two.
text: George leads him behind the counter. THE STAFF BEAMS.
text: Euphorically, Sam approaches the huge espresso machines.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Okay, we need two grande cappucinos, non
dialog: fat.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sprinkles or Cinnamon?
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - 11:00 A.M.
text: Sam is doing great. He's humming as he prepares a triple
text: latte with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - 12:00 P.M.
text: The place is packed, including a GROUP OF JAPANESE TOURISTS.
text: Sam zips around, trying to juggle between the blender, the
text: espresso machine, steamed milk, icemaker, all the while
text: glancing up at the clock. Sam hands three cups to customers,
text: the foam overflowing, coffee spilling out.
text: A CUSTOMER takes a sip and SPITS IT OUT.
speaker_heading: GUY
dialog: What is this? I ordered an Americano,
dialog: not a latte.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Americano, Americano, not a latte.
text: Working as fast as he can but still NOT FAST ENOUGH, Sam
text: unconsciously drinks the latte.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - 12:45 P.M.
text: Hyped on coffee, Sam is zooming around and he's a mess.
text: Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild.
text: Frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns
text: it ON. A mint mocha frappuccino SPLATTERS HIM in the face.
text: At that moment, George comes out of his office.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I'm going to be late! I'm going to be
dialog: late!
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'll call a taxi.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, no, I can't wait. I can't wait.
dialog: I've got to go right now.
text: Sam heads out, the coffee drink still dripping from his face.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - DAY
text: Walking a hundred miles an hour, Sam barrels down the street
text: out of his mind. Cars are jammed up. He walks over them, a
text: man possessed.
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - DAY
text: Everyone is in their places, waiting.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Your Honor, if the defendant doesn't
dialog: have enough interest in his daughter to
dialog: even show up -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Your Honor, I'm sure he'll be here any
dialog: moment. This is an extremely important
dialog: day to Mr. Dawson.
text: At THAT MOMENT, Sam bursts through the doors. Suit stained,
text: hair sticky with frappuccino. Rita's jaw drops.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Your Honor, may I have a moment with my
dialog: client?
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: Make it brief, Ms. Harrison.
text: Rita heads towards Sam. Up close, he looks even worse.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: What the hell happened?
dialog: (sniffing the air)
dialog: What is that smell? Mint?
text: Sam, determined, heads for the stand. Rita grabs Sam's
text: shoulders and tries to focus him. Looks deep into his eyes.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam, look at me. Look at me!
dialog: (he does)
dialog: I will guide you like last night.
dialog: (Sam hugs her)
dialog: Not that part of last night, the other
dialog: part. Now you can do it. I know you
dialog: can. Lucy needs you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (a mile a minute)
dialog: Lucy needs me.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Yes, slow down because Lucy needs you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Lucy needs you.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: Ms. Harrison. We need you!
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Sam, on the stand, talks a mile a minute from the coffee.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: How will you be able to pay for private
dialog: tutoring?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: There's a free program at the YMCA.
dialog: Lucy can go there.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: But don't you ever think it would be
dialog: better for Lucy if she lived with a
dialog: permanent foster family and you could
dialog: visit whenever you wanted?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: The Fosters don't know her. Why can't
dialog: she live with me and they can come visit
dialog: if they want to. I'm firm on this. And
dialog: I'm getting firmer. Lucy belongs with
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Why?
text: Sam puts his finger to his chin and starts his "Let me
text: see..." Rita gives him a look; he lowers his finger and
text: starts talking very fast from the coffee. The STENOGRAPHER
text: desperately tries to keep pace.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Paul wrote the first part of the song
dialog: "Michelle". He said to John, "Where do
dialog: I go from here?" John had been
text: listening to Nina Simone. There was a
dialog: line in it that went something like, "I
dialog: love you, I love you, I love you..."
dialog: They put that into the song. It
dialog: wouldn't be the same song without that.
dialog: It made the song complete. That's why
dialog: the whole world cried when they broke up
dialog: on April 10, 1970.
speaker_heading: ON RITA
dialog: Well, he has some kind of point.
text: MARY, the Stenographer, is still typing.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: Did you get that, Mary?
scene_heading: INT. COURTROOM - LATER
text: Turner fires questions at Sam - a mile a minute.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: When you were Lucy's age, were you
dialog: living at home?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Were you living with your mother and
dialog: father?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Well then where were you living?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (very quietly)
text: In an institution.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: So your parents put you in an
dialog: institution?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Only after my mom got sick.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: What about your father? Where was he?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Gone with the wind when Sam was born.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: So, you weren't raised by your mother?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I saw her I saw her.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: When?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Christmas, Easter and my birthday.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Oh, once a year on your birthday. So in
dialog: a way, the people at the institution
dialog: were your parents. Were they nice to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Some yes. Some on. Some yes.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Did they hit you?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sometimes. Sometimes they did
dialog: sometimes.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Like when you hit Lucy's friend at her
dialog: birthday party?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection! Nobody hit anybody!
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Let me rephrase that, strong-armed. So
dialog: what role model do you call upon as a
dialog: father when you're parenting Lucy? The
dialog: head of the institution? The Principal
dialog: the warden?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. Not Mr. Whitehead. Not him.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Then who?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Myself.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: you have the mental capacity of a seven
dialog: year old. So you ask yourself, a seven
dialog: year old -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I am not a seven-year old.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: How to parent a fellow seven-year old?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes. No. What was the question?
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: The question is: what makes you think
dialog: you can be a parent? Your background?
dialog: Your IQ? Your friends who can't even
dialog: testify for you?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My friends -
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: My friends love Lucy even if Rita
dialog: thought they weren't smart enough to
dialog: testify. Even if she said you'd wipe
text: the floor with them.
speaker_heading: ON RITA
text: Trying to telepathically reach Sam.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Dawson, your lawyer just
dialog: objected; that means you didn't have to
dialog: answer the question. You can't even
dialog: follow the simple rules you've watched
dialog: here day after day. You really think
dialog: you can raise a seven-year old? A ten
dialog: year old? A thirteen-year old?
dialog: (in his face)
dialog: That means she'll be six years more
dialog: advanced than you.
text: Sweat pours down Sam's coffee stained collar. He searches
text: for words. Then from the clearest place inside himself:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've had a lot of time to think about
dialog: whatever it is that makes somebody a
dialog: good parent. It has to do with
dialog: constancy. It has to do with patience.
dialog: It has to do with listening. To
dialog: pretending to listen when you can't even
dialog: listen anymore.
text: The court is riveted by Sam's eloquence. Rita's amazed.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: It has to do with love, like she says...
text: Rita's antenna goes up: who's "she?"
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: And I don't know where it's written that
text: a woman has a corner on that market,
dialog: that a man has any less of those
text: emotions than a woman. Billy has a home
dialog: with me! It's not perfect! I'm not a
dialog: perfect parent! Sometimes I forget he's
dialog: just a little kid...
dialog: (whispers from the courtroom)
dialog: We built a life together and we love
dialog: each other and if you destroy that, it
dialog: may be irrep, irrep, irrep...
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: Irreparable.
text: All eyes TURN to the back of the room. Ifty is there trying
text: with all his might to help his friend.
speaker_heading: IFTY (CONT'D)
dialog: Joanne, don't do that, please. Don't do
dialog: it twice, not to him. Then Meryl Streep
text: can't even look at Dustin Hoffman after
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Right, "Kramer vs. Kramer." Thank you
dialog: for the commentary, Mr. Bhutto. It's
dialog: hard to find words isn't it, Mr. Dawson.
dialog: It's confusing. It's confusing to know
dialog: what to say to Lucy half the time, isn't
dialog: it?
text: Mortified, so uncomfortable in this strange world, so at a
dialog: loss how to swim through it, beginning to believe everything
text: Turner's saying, Sam looks out at the faces in the courtroom.
text: Rita, stunned and incredulous; Turner and his associate
text: smirking at him; Ifty, shaking his head; Robert, his face in
dialog: his hands; Miss Wright, Margaret Brown, the State's Expert,
text: almost willing him to fail. Are they right? Are they?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No, yes, no.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: No what?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Let me see let me see let me see.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: You don't know what?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Yes. You're right, you don't know. You
dialog: don't know enough to really raise your
dialog: daughter?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection. These aren't questions,
dialog: these are attacks.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (frantic)
dialog: I am Lucy's father.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Are you? Are you really? I'm not
dialog: talking about the fact that you got some
text: homeless woman pregnant.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection your Honor. I motion a
dialog: recess.
speaker_heading: JUDGE MCNEILY
dialog: Denied. Get to the question, Mr.
dialog: Turner.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: The question is if you love your
dialog: daughter as much as they say you do
dialog: don't you think she deserves more?!
dialog: Don't you? In your heart of hearts,
dialog: secretly question yourself every day?
dialog: Don't you?!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Was that a "yes?"
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Objection.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Yes. She does. She deserves
dialog: everything. In my heart of hearts.
speaker_heading: TURNER
dialog: Yes she does. And you agree with
dialog: everyone, you can't give her that?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (in unbearable pain)
dialog: Maybe. Maybe everybody's right.
speaker_heading: ON TURNER
dialog: There. He got it.
speaker_heading: ON RITA
text: Anguished. Watching Sam unravel as he stands up and starts
text: walking around in a circle in the witness box.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: No more no more! Let it stop! No more!
dialog: No more! No more!
text: The Judge watches Sam, sad and stunned. The verdict is
text: obvious. Sam has passed judgement on himself.
scene_heading: EXT. CHILD AND FAMILY PROTECTIVE SERVICES - HALLWAY
text: Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward
text: Margaret Brown's office. Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam
dialog: both see -
speaker_heading: LUCY
text: Sitting, hopeful on the bench. She searches Sam's face for
text: the verdict. The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she
text: knows. She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: No Daddy! No Daddy! No Daddy!
text: In a SERIES OF WORDLESS DISSOLVES, they hold each other in
text: the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit. The
text: only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the
text: background. Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy.
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: C'mon, Lucy. It's time to say goodbye.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: NOOOO! Don't let go don't let go don't
dialog: let go -
text: Sam's tears mix with Lucy's as they sob, clinging to each
text: other. With such fierce love; a parent and a child.
speaker_heading: LUCY (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't let them Daddy don't let them!
dialog: Don't ever let me go!
text: He can't let her go. That he can't do. Margaret, steel
text: herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done
dialog: this.
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: Please help me.
text: Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago,
text: shakes her head, NO. Now, Margaret literally has to wrench
text: Lucy away from her father's arms. Lucy bellowing as she
text: pulls her down the hallway. Sam is frozen in incalculable
dialog: pain.
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: We hear "Fool on the Hill". We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID
text: melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile
text: of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY
text: ICE CREAM. Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the
text: record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: The CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW. Inside, the lights are dim.
text: Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike. Sam, curled into a
text: ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over
text: again against the wall, overcome with grief.
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the
text: doorway, watching her sleeping child. This stranger that
text: she's raised. She moves to cover him, this tough little boy,
text: when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm. She tucks them
text: both in, tenderly.
scene_heading: EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY
text: Saturday in idyllic suburbia. Sam, directions and a map in
text: his hands, tentatively rounds the corner. A small bouquet of
text: flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT --
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress. She
text: stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock
text: and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS. There's a tiny
text: chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY
text: The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Your teacher told me you were an artist.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You wear too much perfume. You're
dialog: trying too hard.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: I am, aren't I. Maybe you could teach
dialog: me how to paint.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: My daddy's coming today. We're going to
dialog: open my birthday presents. Why don't
dialog: you just go do something.
speaker_heading: BACK TO SAM
text: From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything
text: she deserves. He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand -
text: feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers
text: from a garden he's passing. Puts them in his bouquet. Then
text: stops. Feels guilty. Tries to put the flowers BACK. He
text: stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.
text: Lucy sits on the steps. Randy sits right next to her.
speaker_heading: BACK ON SAM
text: Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE. The flowers lay in
text: the dirt. From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits. And
text: waits. And waits.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - DAY
text: It's Saturday. The place is buzzing. Sam listlessly cleans
text: the tables, without the usual energy and verve. A TODDLER
text: marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his
dialog: parents.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Excuse me, my kid knocked over a coffee,
dialog: could you clean this up?
text: Sam sees a FAMILY at a table covered with spilled coffee.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I said I need a refill and a towel over
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: You need a towel? A refill? A glass of
dialog: water? You need more than you already
dialog: have? You have everything -
dialog: (all his fury and frustration)
dialog: Everything. But it's not enough. Take
dialog: my daughter, too!
text: Sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he
text: backs into a shelf of MUGS he so carefully arranged. They
text: CRASH onto the floor.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CARPENTER PORCH - DAY
text: Paints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS
text: THEM OVER. Totally out of control.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You gave him the wrong address! You're
dialog: hiding me from him!
text: As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her.
scene_heading: EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DUSK
text: Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch. Her eyes
text: swollen from crying. Finally, she gets up and moves to the
text: tiny chair that Randy put out for her. Straightens the easel
text: and begins to paint.
text: The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her
text: face and hair. Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel
text: and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint. Randy and
text: Lucy paint in silence for a long time. Then -
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You're going to send me away now, aren't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: No.
text: We hear what sounds like a child's hand playing the song
dialog: "Here, There and Everywhere..."
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING
text: We see SAM sitting at Lucy's miniature toy piano as he plays
text: with one finger. IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES, as DAYS and WEEKS
text: PASS, we see SAM'S HANDS at the PIANO -
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
scene_heading: EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY
text: With Lucy and Randy's hands as they PAINT side by side to
text: Sam's sad melody. Lucy's pictures start ANGRY, angular with
text: blacks and blues, then GRADUALLY soften and the dark figures
text: recede. By the END, there is a BRUSHSTROKE of the red of
text: Randy's smock peeking into the corner of Lucy's picture.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: We come back to Sam, having withdrawn completely into himself
text: serenading no one.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: We see Lucy and Randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the
text: birthday presents. TIME HAS PASSED. They look close, almost
text: like a mother and daughter. Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's
text: present and we see a stack of ONE HUNDRED DENNY'S NAPKINS.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Oh, he must've forgotten to put the gift
dialog: in.
text: Randy picks up one of Lucy's pictures and moves to the wall.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, this wall really needs
dialog: something special on it.
text: Lucy half-smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the
text: Denny's napkins into an origami bird. Then crushes it. Then
dialog: cautiously:
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: What's the longest any one of those kids
dialog: stayed with you?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Megan stayed a little over a year.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (averting her eyes)
dialog: Did you ever want any of them to stay
dialog: longer?
speaker_heading: ON RANDY
dialog: Moved herself. Understanding how huge a question this is
dialog: coming from this bruised little heart.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - WEEKS LATER - DAY
text: Sam sits in a dark corner; maniacally folding newspaper into
text: an odd origami pattern. There's a knock at the door - Sam
text: doesn't move, he just continues folding his paper.
speaker_heading: RITA (O.S.)
dialog: Sam it's me! Open up!
text: He doesn't answer it, just methodically folds.
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Rita stands there impatiently.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't have time for this! You were
dialog: supposed to show up for your first
dialog: evaluation. And I leave work early to
dialog: get there and where the hell are you?!
dialog: Open the door! Sam! Open the goddamn
dialog: door!
dialog: (nothing)
dialog: Alright. If you don't care enough to
dialog: open the goddamn door I'm outta here!
dialog: I've ruined my practice, I've alienated
dialog: my colleagues - I sent my kid off on a
dialog: fishing trip with his father so I could
dialog: work with you and you won't open your
dialog: goddman door for me?! Fine! THAT'S IT!
dialog: I've had enough!
text: She starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and - with
text: the mastery of a karate black belt - RUNS AND KICKS the door
dialog: down.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: Rita bursts through the door and then stops. Sam has created
text: an origami wall of newspapers, intricately woven together.
text: A fortress against the world. He keeps folding - doesn't
text: even look at Rita. He's more far gone than she could
text: imagine, she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sam, it's Rita. Can I come in?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No room. No room.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Hey. I lived in the East Village. I
dialog: don't need a lot of room.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Sam makes life too hard. Sam makes life
dialog: too hard on everyone.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sam, I can go at least nine more rounds.
dialog: But you gotta let me in. Please Sam.
dialog: Please.
text: He pulls out one small brick of origami, opening a window.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thank you. Now I can see your kind
dialog: eyes...George told me you needed a break
dialog: from work.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't want to work there anymore. Too
dialog: many people.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Maybe we could find you a quieter job.
dialog: Because remember one of the judges
dialog: conditions is you have to earn more
dialog: money; you've got to keep earning more
dialog: money for when we get you Lucy back.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Lucy doesn't need me anymore. She has a
dialog: new family. She doesn't need me
dialog: anymore.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Is that what she said?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She didn't have to say it. I may be
dialog: stupid, but I know. I know.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Well that's the first stupid thing I've
dialog: ever heard you say.
text: Sam looks at her through the window. A CHINK in the wall.
speaker_heading: RITA (CONT'D)
dialog: Sam, Sam you can get her back. The
dialog: court favors reunification. The only
dialog: thing that can block you is if the
dialog: foster family petitions to adopt. And
dialog: from what I've heard, Lucy's making
dialog: their life miserable - that's our girl.
text: Sam, fight for her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I tried. I tried.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Try harder.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't know. You don't know.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I don't know?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You don't know what it is to try and try
dialog: and never get there. You were born
dialog: perfect, perfect.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Is that right? Everyone else is perfect
dialog: but only Sam feels loss and pain?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: That's right. People like you don't
dialog: know.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: People like me?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: People like you don't know, don't know
dialog: what hurt feels like, people like you
dialog: don't feel, don't feel anything.
text: She slaps him. STUNNED, he slaps her back. STUNNED, she
text: slaps him again. HE SLAPS HER. She rips the newspaper wall
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: You think you got the market cornered on
dialog: human suffering? Well let me tell you
dialog: something about "People like me."
dialog: People like me feel little and lost and
dialog: ugly and dispensable. People like me
dialog: have perfect husbands screwing someone
dialog: far more perfect than me and my son, my
dialog: son hates me, I try too hard and I push
dialog: and he knows it and I talk in that
dialog: voice, that voice I promised I'd never
dialog: use, and I've screamed, I've screamed
text: horrible things to him, a five year-old
dialog: because he doesn't want to get in the
text: car at the end of a day and he stares at
dialog: me with such anger and I hate him then.
dialog: I know I'm failing you, I know I'm
dialog: disappointing you, I know you deserve
dialog: better but get in the fucking car! It's
dialog: like every morning I wake up and fail,
dialog: and I look around and anybody, anybody
dialog: can pull it off, but somehow I can't.
dialog: And I know, I know I have everything,
dialog: and I'm still miserable and it's
dialog: pathetic. I know it's pathetic. No
dialog: matter how hard I try, something about
dialog: me will never be enough.
text: She's crying too hard to continue. He pulls her to him.
text: Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him
text: tightly. He whispers in her ear.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're enough. You're so much more than
dialog: enough.
text: He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the
dialog: intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity. And
text: staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling.
text: He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes,
text: her tears. And something ignites between them - something
text: confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate
dialog: ache.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Lovely Rita...
text: On a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come
text: together, whole again.
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: Sam rounds the corner walking - or rather being walked by SIX
text: DOGS, all shapes, all sizes. He heads up the walkway to
text: Randy's house. She comes out of the house and shuts the door
text: behind her, stopping him.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: You're early.
speaker_heading: SAM
text: All the lights were green.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: There's a reason for the court schedule.
dialog: You stopped showing up. Lucy has had to
dialog: rebuild her life.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I want her back. I can do it. I know I
dialog: can.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: That's not up to me, but I'm telling
dialog: you, I will do everything in my power to
dialog: prevent Lucy from getting hurt again.
text: Sam hangs his head. A dog barks at Randy.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whose dogs are these?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Supplemental income supplemental income -
text: bathe, walk and feed. Sam Dawson meets
dialog: your canine needs.
dialog: (to dogs)
dialog: Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!
dialog: 
text: All the dogs sit but a BIG BLACK LAB. Randy heads into the
text: house. The front door opens and Lucy comes out. She runs
text: down the stares to Sam. Thrilled, Sam opens his arms to her.
text: She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent
text: up fury.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: You never came! You never even called!
dialog: You forgot about me! How could you
dialog: forget me!
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I never forgot you. I forgot me.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: I hate you I hate you I hate you!
text: Lucy pulls away. A long charged silence. Lucy refusing to
text: even look at her father.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Lucy, I tried to write you a letter last
dialog: night...
text: A BASSET HOUND SNEEZES.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
text: Gesundheit, Buster. Buster has a cold.
dialog: But the letter had too many big words.
dialog: Pokey, sit.
text: The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers. Lucy stares
text: forward. Sam speaks tentatively, carefully:
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Dear Lucy. Pokey sit. Dear Lucy, I'm
dialog: sorry that I hurt you. Every moment of
dialog: the day I thought about you. Lucy in
text: the hammock, Lucy at school. Lucy in
dialog: the sky...XXOO. Daddy. P.S. I love
dialog: you, recorded September 11th, the day
dialog: you took your first step.
text: Lucy raises her head and looks at Sam for the first time.
scene_heading: INT. DENNY'S - DAY
speaker_heading: ON SALAD BAR
text: Rows of carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers and - uh-oh, a tomato's
text: in the peas. A hand comes into frame and carefully places
text: the tomato just so, in the tomato bin. Now it moves to the
dialog: olives. Shouldn't all the pimentos be facing up?
speaker_heading: PULL BACK
text: To reveal Sam, in white apron and hat, deftly filling the
text: containers of the elaborate salad bar as people fill their
dialog: plates.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Napa cabbage, excellent choice. Purple
text: and green, purple and green. Very rich
dialog: in Vitamin C. Good choice. Very good
dialog: choice.
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
text: Sam walks toward the courtroom when we see Rita approaching
text: from the other end of the hall. They both slow down when
text: they see each other. Rita unconsciously fixes her hair. Sam
text: adjusts his tie.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Hello, Sam. Mr. Dawson. Sam. Dawson.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Hello, lawyer.
text: They almost shake hands - realize that means touching each
text: other and don't. Rita motions toward the door.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Shall we?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No. We already did. Don't tell
dialog: anybody.
text: They nervously walk through the door, bumping into each
dialog: other.
scene_heading: INT. SMALL COURT ROOM - LATER
text: She's very aware of Sam. He looks away, over compensating
text: obviously. Throughout the scene, Rita's hair falls in her
text: eyes. She attempts to put it in place.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Furthermore, my client has found a new
dialog: job, and is making every effort to find
dialog: a bigger apartment so that -
text: Rita's hair falls in her eyes again. Sam stands up, pulls
text: HER BARRETTE from his pocket, the one she left at his house.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Here.
text: Rita stares at the barrette as if it were the murder weapon.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Oh, thank you. What a...a lovely
dialog: barrette, Mr. Dawson. It will look
dialog: great on Lucy. Who I'm sure you bought
dialog: it for. Furthermore, so that...there
dialog: will be more room for Lucy as she grows
dialog: up.
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: All of that is well and good but the
dialog: fact that Mr. Dawson quite his job,
dialog: missed his hearing, and did not even
dialog: show up for his visits with his
dialog: daughter...
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: The fact that my client went through
dialog: profound depression is the most natural
dialog: reaction any parent could have.
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: But once again he had no idea how his
dialog: behavior during that depression impacted
text: on his daughter.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: In these next months, Mr. Dawson will be
dialog: expanding his support system to include
dialog: Social Service programs, tutors --
scene_heading: MARGARET BROWN
dialog: It's too late! The foster family is
dialog: petitioning the court for sole custody
dialog: of Lucy and I fully support their
dialog: request.
text: Sam turns to Rita. This can't be happening.
scene_heading: INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT
text: Sam, Rita, Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in a booth. With one
text: extra person, it's a little tight. Rita picks at her
text: Salisbury Steak special, trying to deal with the business at
dialog: hand.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: Isn't it illegal? It's illegal to go
dialog: through stop signs. It's illegal to
text: cross on the red.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: It's not illegal. It's very
dialog: complicated. When a strong foster
dialog: parent lobbies for a child it changes
dialog: the equation.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
text: They're reaching right through Sam as if
text: he doesn't exist. As if he's a ghost.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: There's one option we've never talked
dialog: about, Sam.
dialog: (very carefully)
dialog: I know what you went through the last
dialog: time you took the stand. We could
dialog: settle out of court, ask for the most
dialog: incredible visitation rights - it would
text: almost seem like joint custody.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You're saying I don't have a chance.
dialog: That's what you're saying.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I'm not saying you don't have a chance.
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: That's what you said last time and look
text: where he is now.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Stop. Rita's not saying I don't have a
dialog: chance. Are you? Tell me I have a
dialog: chance.
text: Too long a pause. Ifty looks at the clock.
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: Oh my God! 6:35 is Video Night at my
dialog: house and I'm not even there!
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: If we get there before you do we'll wait
dialog: for you - check!
speaker_heading: BRAD
dialog: Sam get your dessert to go.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: This is very hard to say. I'm having my
dialog: dessert here. With Rita. I'm not
text: coming to video night.
text: Devastated, Ifty, Robert and Brad solemnly gather their
dialog: things.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Sam - if you want to go...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I said no, Rita.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I know, but if you -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: What? Do you want me to go?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I didn't say that. But do you want to
dialog: go?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Nevermind.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Fine.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Fine.
scene_heading: IFTY, ROBERT &amp; BRAD
dialog: Fine.
text: They leave in a huff. The WAITRESS delivers the check with
text: dessert and coffee.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I've got it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've got it.
text: Long pause. Rita slowly eats her pie.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: It's good to chew. You're eating more
text: slowly.
text: Rita laughs and nods.
speaker_heading: SAM (CONT'D)
dialog: Coconut Rhubarb. Sidebar, we need to
dialog: talk. Sidebar.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Yes we do.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I need to get Lucy back. We need, we
dialog: need - to be professional.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Do you know what that means?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: When dealing with Starbucks' customers,
dialog: be friendly but not familiar. I can be
dialog: your friend.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (oddly touched)
dialog: Thank you, Sam.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You need to leave your husband.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (her armor up again)
dialog: Oh, my marriage isn't so bad.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: 'Life is very short and there's no time
dialog: for fussing and fighting, my friend.'
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (undone)
dialog: It's just...it's just that...I've never
dialog: lost anything.
scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL - DAY
text: Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school. We
text: follow Lucy - suddenly a BIRD SAILS THROUGH THE SKY and LANDS
text: IN FRONT OF LUCY. It's an ORIGAMI BIRD. She looks around -
text: but doesn't see Sam anywhere. But she feels him. She walks
text: toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up
text: that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches. There. They
dialog: made contact.
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: It's later that week. Lucy walks proudly down the street in
text: a GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM, selling cookies. Randy is by her side,
text: beaming.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: We've made $22.36. That's seven
dialog: dollars, 64 cents less than thirty.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Well that's one way of looking at it.
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER
text: DISSOLVE as they move through the neighborhood. Finally we
text: see her bound up the steps to an apartment building. She
text: knocks on the door. It opens - and Lucy and Randy's JAW
speaker_heading: DROPS.
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
text: Sam stands there. Holding three kittens. WE see various
text: dogs in arm chairs, the couch...
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Daddy?!
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I live here. This is where I live.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: This is where you live? So close to me?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I wanted to be close to you. I wanted
dialog: to be closer. Look at my apartment
dialog: number.
dialog: (it's number 9)
dialog: John was born on October 9th. His son

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: John met Yoko on November 9th.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: His mother lived at 9 Newcastle,

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Newcastle. 9 letters. Liverpool - 9
dialog: letters...
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Lucy, give me one minute with your
dialog: father. Sam, I consider myself an
dialog: understanding person but I don't
dialog: understand this. You can't close the
dialog: distance between you and Lucy with a new
dialog: address. We go to court in a week -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I don't want to spend half my visit with
text: Lucy on the bus getting to Lucy. I
dialog: don't want to waste one more minute.
text: Buster sneezes.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: (from the doorway)
dialog: Does Buster still have his cold?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: He's better, much better. Now I'll have
text: one box of mint chocolate cookies.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: That'll be three-eighty six.
speaker_heading: LUCY &amp; SAM
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Let me see let me see let me see...
dialog: That's one dollar and 14 cents less than
dialog: five.
text: Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy
text: effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY
text: From the window, Randy watches as Sam hands Lucy four leashes
text: and the two of them get pulled down the street by the dogs.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.
text: Lucy lies in her hammock, unable to sleep. Staring at the
text: little origami bird on her window sill. She moves it, opens
text: the window wide, quickly takes Mr. Jeeters - and within a
text: moment she's out the window and onto the limb of the tree.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT
text: "The night grows teeth..." stray dogs fight over garbage - a
text: wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks Lucy
text: in her pj's. Mr. Jeeters tucked under her arm. Lucy crosses
text: the street. HONK! the screeching of tires...
scene_heading: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER
text: We're looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly
text: we make out a figure climbing higher and higher. It's Lucy.
text: We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign
text: across the street blinks on and off.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Sam's asleep. Suddenly his eyes open wide. And like an
text: animal sensing danger, he gets up. We HEAR THE SOUND of
text: something THUMPING AGAINST RUNG AFTER RUNG OF THE FIRE
text: ESCAPE. He rushes to his window and looks to see --
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT
text: Lucy climbing the fire escape! Sam opens the window and
text: reaches for her.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Lucy Lucy. What are you doing?! You
dialog: could have really hurt yourself. What
dialog: are you doing?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: I couldn't sleep. Daddy, did you know
dialog: that Warren G. Harding was the twenty
dialog: ninth President of the United States?
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Remember - the twenty-ninth President.
text: In case the Judge asks.
scene_heading: EXT. RANDY'S STREET - NIGHT
text: Sam, in his pajamas, holds a sleeping Lucy in his arms. He
text: turns a corner and heads up the walkway to Randy's house. He
text: knocks on the door. Finally the door opens and we see Randy
text: and Bill in their pajamas SHOCKED at seeing Sam and Lucy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: She couldn't sleep.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Give me my daugh -
dialog: (she stops herself)
dialog: Give me - I'll take Lucy.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Maybe if you rub her tummy twenty-three
dialog: times, tell her two stories and give her
text: half a Denny's blueberry muffin and a
dialog: third of a glass of milk she'll sleep.
dialog: Good night.
text: Randy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks
text: purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on
text: the quiet street.
text: SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. --
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Lucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street.
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT
text: Lucy knocks on Sam's window.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Lucy and Sam walk back down the street to Randy's house.
scene_heading: EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT
text: Lucy lugs encyclopedias to Sam's windowsill.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
text: Lucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house.
scene_heading: INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Until FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house
text: looking out the windows, which have now been completely
text: covered with BARS. Her room is filled with origami birds
text: from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift. Lucy gets
text: out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly
text: opening the door.
scene_heading: INT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the
text: stairs. She gets to the front door. It's been DEAD BOLTED
text: where she cannot reach it. From the darkness we hear --
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: Lucy. Come here.
text: Randy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF
text: MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I made us a midnight snack.
text: Lucy stares at the muffin and milk. Torn.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I understand that you want to see your
dialog: daddy. And I don't want to keep you
dialog: from him. I honestly don't. So you
dialog: tell me when you want to see him. You
dialog: can see him anytime you want. But we
dialog: have to arrange it first. Do you
dialog: understand?
dialog: (Lucy nods)
dialog: Now would you like a snack?
text: Lucy nods. Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch.
text: But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up
text: the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Thank you. Goodnight.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (words caught in her throat)
dialog: Goodnight, Lucy.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: We PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a
text: YELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER. A KNOCK
text: at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there,
text: looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: My husband left this when he moved out.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (entering)
dialog: Nice place. I worry. I worry
dialog: sometimes...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: You worry you did the wrong thing?
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: I worry that I've gotten more out of
dialog: this relationship than you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: No no no. I'm the lucky one. I have
dialog: the lawyer that never loses.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (covering)
dialog: That's me...okay, let me see, let me
dialog: see, let me see.
dialog: (pulls out notes)
dialog: They're going to put Bill and Randy on
dialog: the stand first and then you.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Them first, then me. They're a nice
dialog: couple. They have a nice house. She's
dialog: pretty. She's smart, too. I can tell.
dialog: The manager of the salad bar is gonna
dialog: testify, isn't he? That will help us.
text: For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam
text: overwhelms her.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Nobody believed that George Harrison
dialog: could really be a song writer. But he
dialog: wrote "Here Comes the Sun". John and
dialog: Paul said it was one of the best songs
text: on ABBEY ROAD.
speaker_heading: RITA
dialog: (tenderly)
dialog: George was always my favorite Beatle.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Lucy's was Paul.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.
text: Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something. She
text: opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Now.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: What honey?
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Now. I want to see him now.
scene_heading: INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - 3:30 A.M.
text: We see Sam sleeping in bed. There's a KNOCK at the door.
text: Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers.
text: We see that he's wearing the Armani suit. Sam opens the door
text: to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: She fell asleep on the car ride over. I
dialog: was gonna turn back and tuck her in to
dialog: her bed...with the pink canopy...and the
dialog: quilt I made...But I was afraid she'd
dialog: wake up at our house...
dialog: (fighting the ache in her soul)
dialog: ...and want to come home.
text: Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion.
speaker_heading: RANDY (CONT'D)
dialog: I was gonna tell the judge that I could
dialog: give Lucy the kind of love she never
dialog: had. But I would be lying.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I hope I hope I hope that you're saying
dialog: what I think you're saying even though
dialog: you're not saying it.
text: Randy nods and hands the sleeping Lucy into Sam's strong
text: arms. For a moment they BOTH HOLD LUCY between them in the
text: most unique embrace. Randy finally lets go and struggles to
dialog: say goodbye.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Goodnight. I'll see you in court. Save
dialog: me a seat...on your side.
text: Randy walks away. Stunned, Sam watches her, holding Lucy in
text: his arms. Then, from a very brave place:
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Randy! If I tell you I can't do it
dialog: alone, will you tell the judge?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: (turns gently)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Promise?
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Promise...
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: I've looked and looked for a mother for
dialog: Lucy.
dialog: Help, I need someone, help, not just
dialog: anyone. You're the red in Lucy's
dialog: painting.
speaker_heading: ON RANDY
text: So unexpectedly bonded to them both.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY
text: A glorious sunny day. Lucy and her team are in the middle of
dialog: a fierce game. A foul is called when we hear -
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Penalty! Rules broken. Penalty,
dialog: please!
text: Sam, wearing a UNIFORM and whistle around his neck, walking
text: his inimitable walk, races up the field, COACHING THE TEAM.
text: Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in the bleachers. Robert, in
text: sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him. Brad follows
text: around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to
text: her. Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.
text: They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride. Lucy
text: and a kid named PHILLIP go after the ball.
speaker_heading: OBNOXIOUS MOM
dialog: Get her! Phillip, you get her!
speaker_heading: ROBERT
dialog: I saw that! You gave him a secret
dialog: signal! Didn't you?
speaker_heading: IFTY
dialog: Keep both eyes on the ball, Lucy - balls
text: are round - on sale at Kmart. The earth
dialog: is a ball, too...
text: Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he
text: can. Sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Penalty! Repeat! Rules broken!
dialog: Penalty!
speaker_heading: RITA (O.S.)
dialog: Penalty?! Sue him! Kick his ass outta
dialog: the game!
text: It's RITA! With Danny - hollering from the stands.
speaker_heading: ON LUCY
text: Looks over at her father. Sam does every coaching gesture,
dialog: and referee hand signal from every sport known to man. It
text: looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.
speaker_heading: ON LUCY
text: She does it right back at him. Their secret code. The code
dialog: that will bind them for the rest of their lives.
text: ON THE CROWD AND PLAYERS
text: All watching. What the hell was that? Sam blows his
dialog: whistle.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: Play ball! Play ball!
text: The game heats up. Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed
text: toward the goal. Sam is running right alongside them, so
text: excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and
text: intercepts the ball! Sam runs valiantly down the field with
dialog: it! We hear "Here Comes the Sun"...
dialog: Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter. Little
dialog: darlin', it feels like years since you've been here. Here
dialog: comes the Sun...Here comes the sun...And I say, "It's
dialog: alright..."
text: And the CREDITS ROLL.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
