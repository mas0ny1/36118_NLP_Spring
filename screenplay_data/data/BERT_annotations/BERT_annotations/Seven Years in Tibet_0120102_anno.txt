scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: "I wish we'd said goodbye at the front door and it was
dialog: finished. And you could have a nice and pleasant journey on
dialog: your own."
text: Harrer turns to her, fed up.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Why must you be this way? Why is there always a problem? It's
dialog: a good question. Life is not always convenient."
dialog: (pretending to humor her)
dialog: Do you want to go home, do you want to turn around?"
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: "Yes."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "It's the Himalayas! How long have I been talking about the
dialog: Himalayas? How long?"
text: Ingrid seems to retreat into herself, shaken.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: "Far too long."
text: A meek man - HORST IMMENDORF - drives the car, pretending to ignore the tensions in the back seat.
text: Ingrid leans forward.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: "Horst, when we get there, can you give me a hand?"
speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: "Yes, of course."
text: Harrer rolls his eyes, thinks she's begging for sympathy.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Oh, Ingrid. Stop it."
scene_heading: EXT. GRAZ TRAIN STATION - DAY
text: The car stops across from the busy station; NAZI SOLDIERS stream toward the entrance, above which
text: hangs a huge swastika flag. Harrer gatheres his rucksack, takes Ingrid's hand and leads her through
dialog: the crowds.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Try to make this pleasant."
scene_heading: INT. GRAZ TRAIN STATION TICKET ROOM - DAY
text: The station is teeming with more Nazi soldiers. Harrer drags Ingrid past TRAVELERS waiting in line to
text: purchase tickes, searching for someone.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Where is that idiot who's supposed to meet us?"
text: Spotting Harrer, a tall thin MAN of exquisite precision approaches him: PETER AUFSCHNAITER.
text: Aufschnaiter has a stack of tickets in his hand.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Mister Harrer? I have your tickets - "
text: Harrer grabs the tickets from Aufschnaiter's hands.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Fine. I'm late. Take me to my train - "
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "No, no, no. You don't understand...
dialog: (modestly)
dialog: I am Peter Aufschnaiter. I'm leading the expedition. How do you
dialog: do?"
text: Smiling shyly, Aufschnaiter extends a hand. Sizing up this unprepossessing man, Harrer shakes
text: Aufschnaiter's hand, wearing an expression of acute disappointment.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN STATION AND PLATFORMS - DAY
text: As Harrer, Ingrid, and Horst emerge from the ticket room into the station, they see two platforms up
text: ahead where the crowd of German SOLDIERS file onto trains.
text: As Harrer, Ingrid, and Horst make their way toward their train, a robust NAZI
text: OFFICIAL spots Harrer and makes a beeline toward him.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: "Ah, here's our celebrity.
dialog: (reaches Harrer)
dialog: May I say, Mr. Harrer, on behalf of the Reichssportsfuhrer, we
dialog: are honored to have such a great German hero on the team."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Thank you. But I'm Austrian."
text: Leading Harrer past throngs of people, the Official gestures to the Photographer
text: who hurries over as the Official grandly presents Harrer with a small Nazi flag. The Photographer
text: snaps a photo.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: "Yes, but I'm sure that, as a distinguished member of the
dialog: National Socialist Party, you will be proud to plant our
dialog: country's flag on the summit of Nanga Parbat...when you reach
dialog: it." (slowing down)
dialog: I am quite sure the man who conquered the Eiger North Wall can
dialog: subdue the gods
dialog: of "our mountain" in the Himalayas."
text: Harrer takes the flag. CAMERAS FLASH. They reach a car where Aufschnaiter is waiting with two other
text: climbers: HANS LOBENHOFFER and LUTZ CHICKEN, a kind of German Frick and Frack duo. The two teammates
text: extend their hands to offer introductions to Harrer.
speaker_heading: LOBENHOFFER
dialog: "Hans Lobenhoffer."
speaker_heading: CHICKEN
dialog: "Lutz Chicken."
text: Harrer dutifully shakes their hands. CAMERAS FLASH:
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: "And a picture with your lovely wife."
text: Harrer shoots Ingrid an imploring look, pulls her close to him. She smiles wanly when the CAMERAS
text: FLASH. The official gestures to Horst.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: "And Mister..."
speaker_heading: HORST
dialog: "Horst Immendorf. Family friend. No picture necessary."
text: As the Photographer fires off a few more shots, Harrer flashes a bright, exuberant smile - in sharp
text: contrast to the impacted sorrow underlying Ingrid's smile. He has perfected a breezy public persona,
text: and the effortlessness of his act only adds to her misery.
speaker_heading: OFFICIAL
dialog: "When is the little one due, Mrs. Harrer?"
text: He is pointing to Ingrid's belly. And for the first time, the CAMERA REVEALS
text: what has been hidden: Ingrid is seven and a half months pregnant. The question
text: strikes her deep in the heart and causes Harrer's smile to fade.
speaker_heading: INGRID
dialog: "Approximately the same time as my husband reaches base camp."
text: With that, she breaks away and visibly struggles to keep her emotions in check.
text: Harrer grabs her, drags her away from the media onslaught.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Why don't you tell the whole country our problems?"
text: Her eyes brim with tears; she is close to breaking down.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I'm getting on that train. Is there anything you want to say
dialog: to me?"
text: She stares mutely at him, appalled by his lack of feeling.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Fine. Go. Leave. I'll see you in four months."
scene_heading: EXT. PLATFORM - POV - THROUGH WINDOW:
text: Ingrid and Horst turning away from the platform, heading through the station. She is crying
text: uncontrollably. Horst wraps his arm around her, tries to console her.
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN - DAY
text: Harrer watching, consumed with guilt. He moves down the aisle, passing a
text: compartment where the three other members of his team are already seated. An
text: empty spot is waiting for Harrer.
text: Unable to face them, Harrer keeps moving, heads into another compartment.
scene_heading: CLOSE UP - MAP OF WORLD
text: A map showing the course of Harrer's journey, through Europe by train, into Asia
text: by boat. Toward a mountain peak in the Himalayas - the name, Nanga Parbat.
text: Harrer's voice narrates as we follow the winding path toward his destination.
speaker_heading: HARRER (V.O.)
dialog: We will travel five thousand miles. When we reach India, we
dialog: will head for the
text: Himalayas and the ninth highest peak on Earth, Nanga Parbat.
dialog: The name means
dialog: "Naked Mountain." Germany calls it Unser Berg, "Our Mountain."
dialog: Before us, four
text: German expeditions attempted it. All failed. Eleven climbers
text: were killed in storms and avalanches. By now, the conquest of
text: Nanga Parbat is a national obsession, a matter of German pride.
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER
dialog: "Let's hope Germany retreats from Poland as quickly as you did
dialog: from "your
dialog: mountain" , Herr Harrer. It might reduce your prison time."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "What's is this?"
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER
dialog: "You are under arrest."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "What's the charge? Failure to reach the summit?"
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER
dialog: "I'm afraid not."
speaker_heading: BRITISH OFFICER
dialog: "War has broken out between His Majesty's Government and
dialog: Germany. All enemy
dialog: aliens on British Empire soil are prisoners of war."
speaker_heading: HARRER(V.0.)
dialog: October 15, 1939. Reaching prison camp, I make a promise to
dialog: myself...
text: Each step into the camp plunges Harrer deeper into despair. Then his gaze lights on something which
text: lifts his spirits. He keeps staring straight ahead, at POV-THE HIMALYAYAS: The mountains form a white-
text: rimmed, rocky spine to the north.
speaker_heading: HARRER(V.O.)
dialog: I will be lying beside Ingrid before summer solstice of the new
dialog: year. The mountains are right in front of us. It will be easy
text: to escape and get lost in them.
speaker_heading: CHICKEN
dialog: "Would you like to come with us?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Why?"
speaker_heading: CHICKEN
dialog: "After all, you're the authority on jailbreak around here."
speaker_heading: LOBENHOFFER
dialog: "We could benefit from your experience..."
text: Exasperated, Aufschnaiter interrupts.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Please stop this gruesome charade.
dialog: (Pauses)
dialog: Every time you escape, Heinrich, patrols are doubled and
dialog: tripled. It's making life difficult for the rest of us."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I prefer to travel on my own. But thanks for thinking of me."
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON MESS HALL - DAY
text: Hundreds of prisoners swill gruel at long tables. Harrer, by himself, eats quickly, never looking up.
text: Aufschnaiter passes by, sets something beside Harrer's plate.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
text: The mailman has come.
text: Harrer glances down at a THICK ENVELOPE addressed to a guard at the camp.
text: From Ingrid Harrer in Austria. Harrer picks up the envelope, overwhelmed. Looks
text: around to thank Aufschnaiter. But he's already seated at another table with Chicken and Lobenhoffer.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON BARRACKS -DAY
text: Harrer lowers himself onto his cot. Opens the envelope and pulls out a SHEAF OF
text: STAPLED PAPERS. A NOTE flutters to the ground. As he studies the sheaf of
text: papers, his eagerness turns to confusion, then despair. CLOSE ON SHEAF OF
text: PAPERS: They are divorce papers drafted by an Austrian lawyer.
text: Harrer reaches down, plucks the note from the floor. Read it.
speaker_heading: INGRID(O.S.)
dialog: Dear Heinrich, Please sign the enclosed divorce papers and send
dialog: them to my
dialog: lawyer. Horst and I intend to be married as soon as the divorce
dialog: is finalized. As for your letter, yes, your son Rolf Harrer was
dialog: born while you were climbing the
text: mountain. He is now two years old and calls Horst "papa." When
dialog: he is old enough,
dialog: I will tell him his real father was lost in the Himalayas. It
dialog: seems the kindest thing to say, considering you never wanted
dialog: the child anyway. Needless to say, I have no intention of
dialog: "resolving our differences," as you suggested. They were
dialog: resolved the moment you left Austria. I am sorry you have been
dialog: imprisoned in India and hope this dreadful war will soon be
dialog: over, for everyone's sake. Ingrid.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON CAMP - DAY
text: Rain stil pours. Harrer steps out of the barracks and walks the perimeter of the
text: yard. He stops, leans against the wall of barbed wire, holds onto it for support. It takes him a
text: moment to realize he has grasped the wire so hard, his hands are bleeding. As if pulling himself from
text: a trance, he steps back. Stares at the fence. Then hauls off and kicks it with all his strengh--
text: cursing and slamming his boots into the barbed wire until he's too drained to continue.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I'm coming with you."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Take two and sleep it off. I'll send you a bill in the
dialog: morning."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: (groans)
dialog: "What are you doing here?"
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "I missed you so much, Heinrich, I thought I'd stop by for a
dialog: visit."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Where are the others?"
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "The Italians were caught outside Nelang. Lutz and Hans took
dialog: ill and had to turn
dialog: back."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I'm sorry to hear that."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "I'm sure you're heartbroken.
dialog: (exhausted)
dialog: May I impose upon your generous nature and camp here tonight?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Please....be my guest."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Very gracious of you."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "You might be interested to know...I've heard the Japanese have
dialog: retreated all the
dialog: way to Shanghai. Even if you reach the Chinese border, you may
dialog: never catch up
dialog: with them."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I don't care if the Japanese get repelled all the way back to
dialog: Tokyo."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "You will if you plan to get back to Austria."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "But I don't."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "You don't what?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Plan to go back..."home"."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Why not?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "No particular reason.
dialog: (feigning boredom)
dialog: But when you get there, tell my wife that two years in prison
dialog: camp was roughly
dialog: equivalent to four years of marriage. And I'm glad to be free
dialog: of both."
text: His bitterness gives Aufschnaiter pause; he hesitates before speaking.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "I'm not going back either. At least until this shameful war is
dialog: over."
text: Now it's Harrer's turn to be surprized.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Where are you headed?"
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Not negotiable. My father gave it to me when I climbed Mont
dialog: Blanc."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Everyone's climbed Mont Blanc, Peter."
dialog: (reprovingly)
dialog: "If I had a watch like that, I'd trade it."
text: Aufschnaiter stiffens with resentment, then removes his watch and commences
text: trading with the vendor.
text: Harrer drags himself to his feet, staggers over to the edge of plateau. Beyond, the Tibetan plain
text: spreads out as vast and wide as an ocean. Harrer slowly wanders the perimeter of the plateau, scouts
dialog: for their Guides.
text: Aufschnaiter, lying on the ground, turns his head, his eyes only inches from Harrer's open knapsack. A
text: few provisions spill out. Aufschnaiter sees something shiny inside the pack, tilts his head closer to
text: get a better look, dismayed by what Harrer has hidden. He reaches in, pulls out three WATCHES tied
text: together with a rubber band, and Harrer's gold wedding band. Aufschnaiter scrambles to his feet and
text: marches over to Harrer, who's still at the edge of plateau.
scene_heading: EXT. EDGE OF PLATEAU - LATE DAY
text: Harrer turns when he hears footsteps. Faces Aufschnaiter.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Know what time it is?"
text: Harrer is shocked to see mild-mannered Aufschnaiter flushing with rage.
text: Aufschnaiter hurls the watches toward Harrer.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Refresh my memory. What did you say at the bazaar back there?"
dialog: (livid)
dialog: ""If I had a watch like that, I'd trade it." You don't have
dialog: one, you cheap lying
dialog: bastard, you have three!"
text: Harrer straightens up, unruffled.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "You have a problem, Peter?"
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "You think I'm so happy to travel with you, I should foot the
dialog: bill? You're such a big man you don't need to contribute?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: (dangles the watches)
dialog: "This is junk. From some Italian prisoners."
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "I don't give a shit! Haven't you ever heard of a principle?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: (derisively)
dialog: "Go ahead. Take one. And keep your principles."
text: Handing Aufschnaiter the packet of watches, Harrer starts moving, tries to put
text: some distance between them.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Look at you. Caught being a selfish prick and you're
dialog: gloating."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "You sound like an old woman, Peter. What do you want me to
dialog: do?"
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Try Apologizing. Try feeling a little remorse. If all else
dialog: fails, try
dialog: wiping that smirk off your face."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: (pushes him)
dialog: "Take a watch and shut up! I don't need another boring sermon
dialog: from some
text: frustrated , glorified tour guide."
text: Aufschnaiter spins around, takes a few steps, and grabs his knapsack.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "No wonder you're always alone. Who could stand your miserable
dialog: company?"
text: Tossing the watches back to Harrer, Aufschnaiter turns and stalks down the trail. Watching him
text: descend, Harrer shrugs his shoulders: no big loss. Then, as
text: Aufschnaiter gets farther away, Harrer goes slack with remorse. Abruptly grabs his pack and streaks
text: like a bullet down the center of the hill, bypassing the switchbacks until he is gaining on
dialog: Aufschnaiter.
scene_heading: EXT. HILL - LATE DAY
text: Reaching Aufschnaiter, Harrer pauses to catch his breath. Cautiously extends his
text: hand. In it are the watches and Harrer's wedding ring.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Please take them."
dialog: (pauses, embarrassed)
dialog: "It was wrong to hide them."
text: It's probably the first time in his life he's admitted he was wrong. Aufschnaiter accepts the watches
text: but removes the wedding ring.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Keep this."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "No. I didn't deserve it, either."
text: He shoots such a plangent look of remorse, Aufschnaiter is oddly moved, quietly
text: accepts the ring.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "...He's about three and a half years old now. Pretty soon,
dialog: she'll tell him I got lost in the Himalayas. So he'll have a
dialog: dead father. Which is fine with me."
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT
text: Harrer and Aufschnaiter lie wrapped in their blankets.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Why?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Better a dead father than a lousy father."
text: A long silence as they stare up at the sky.
speaker_heading: AUFSCHNAITER
dialog: "Write him a letter and tell him you're alive."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Dear Rolf Harrer, I am a person you don't know. A man you've
dialog: never met...But
dialog: you are someone who occupies my mind...and my heart...in this
dialog: distant land where
dialog: I've gone. If you can imagine a hidden place, tucked safely
dialog: away from the
text: world...concealed by walls of high, snow-capped mountains...a
dialog: place rich with all
dialog: the strange beauty of your nighttime dreams...Then you know
dialog: where I am."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "In the country where I'm traveling - Tibet - people believe if
dialog: they walk long
dialog: distances to holy places...it purifies the bad deeds they've
dialog: committed...They believe
dialog: the more difficult the journey, the greater the depth of
dialog: purification."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "...In this place where time stands still, it seems that
dialog: everything is moving. Including me. I can't say I know where
dialog: I'm going. Nor whether my bad deeds can be
dialog: purified...there are so may things I've done which I regret.
dialog: But when I come to a full stop, I hope you will understand that
dialog: the distance between us is not as great as it seems...With deep
dialog: affection, your father...Heinrich Harrer."
scene_heading: INT. DESK AT HARRER'S HOUSE - LATER
text: Harrer rips open the envelope, reads the letter. And deflates. In a hollow whisper, he reads it aloud.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Dear Mister Heinrich Harrer, You are not my father. Please
dialog: stop writing me letters.
dialog: Rolf Immendorf."
scene_heading: INT. RECEPTION ROOM - DAY
text: Entering first, Harrer takes a few steps and involuntarily looks up to the Dalai
text: Lama's high throne. He is shocked to see the thirteen-year-old avatar grinning
text: excitedly at him, like a long lost friend. A look of surprise and deep, overwhelming pleasure lights
text: Harrer's face. The two of them lock eyes, staring. Utterly scandalized, the Dalai Lama's mother bows
text: and prostrates. Harrer dutifully bows. Tries a clunky prostration and nearly trips. The Dalai Lama
text: laughs with delight.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Your Holiness, it is a great honor to meet you."
text: He heads back to his seat. Remembers he's not to turn his back to the Dalai Lama
text: and awkwardly attemps walking backwards. He takes his seat and politely waits for the Dalai Lama to
dialog: speak first.
text: With urgent seriousness, the Dalai Lama begins the audience.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Do you like movies?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Well...I haven't seen one in about eight years. But as I
dialog: recall, yes, I do."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "So do I."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I'm glad to know that, Your Holiness."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "I have a movie projector. And films. One of female dancers
text: being hatched out of
dialog: eggs."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "That could be a bit racy.
dialog: (the mother clears her throat)
dialog: It sounds wonderfully educational, Your Holiness."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "I want to build a movie house. Here at the Potala. With seats
dialog: and everything."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Seats would be advisable."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Can you build it?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Excuse me?"
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Can you build a movie house for me? My advisors cannot
dialog: disapprove and you will
dialog: be well paid."
text: The mother knits her eyebrows in consternation. She wasn't informed of this plan.
text: Now the Dalai Lama speaks in a fast torrent of words, desperate to say everything
dialog: at once.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "And you will have to come here every day to build it. Every
dialog: single day. And when
dialog: you're here, you will visit me. We can have conversations. On
dialog: many topics. I would like to learn about the world you come
dialog: from.
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: For example...where is Paris, France? And what is a Molotov
dialog: Cocktail? And who is
dialog: Jack the Ripper?"
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: "Kundun..."
text: Realizing she has interrupted her son, she stops herself. The Dalai Lama knows he's going out on a
text: limb, but is determined to have his way.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "You can tell me many things."
text: Harrer folds his hands together, bows his head. Then glances surreptitiously at the Dalai Lama, full
dialog: of admiration.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I am proud to be of service, Your Holiness."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "When you face the light, it's day. When you're in shadow, it's
dialog: night. So when the
text: sun in rising in Lhasa, it's setting far to the west, in New
dialog: York City, for example. That's why it's not the same time
dialog: everywhere.
dialog: (solicitously)
dialog: Does that answer your question?"
text: Nodding, the Dalai Lama spots the poker-faced Master of the Kitchen approaching
text: and he quickly hops onto his throne. Both are silent as the Master serves the Dalai Lama butter tea,
text: covering his mouth with a hand so as not to breathe on the serving.
text: Taking his leave, he walks backwards. The moment he's gone, the Dalai Lama
text: scrambles off the throne, impulsively takes Harrer's hand in his.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Tell me more, tell me more."
text: Holding the boy's hand in his, Harrer basks in happiness.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "What do you want to know?"
scene_heading: INT. ATTIC STOREROOM IN POTALA - DAY
text: In a dark hidden corner, Harrer sets up a radio while the Dalai Lama holds a
text: flashlight for him to see. Harrer attaches wires from a large portable battery to the back of radio.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "In a few minutes, you'll be entering the world of mass media,
dialog: Your Holiness."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "I can hear news from all over the planet?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I don't know if they have live broadcasts from the Tonga
dialog: Islands, but generally
dialog: speaking, yeah."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Do you listen to news from your country?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: (busy working on radio)
dialog: Austria? Not very often. Give me some light over here."
text: He points and the Dalai Lama shines the flashlight on the side of the radio.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Why? It's your home."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Not any more."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "But don't you have friends and family there?"
text: The Dalai Lama is so intrigued, he keeps turning to look at Harrer, moving the
dialog: flashlight.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "A few friends. No family. Hold the light steady. Your
dialog: Holiness."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Why? Is everyone dead?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Do you know, there's another sentence construction aside from
dialog: the question. You
dialog: might try it some time.
dialog: (goes back to work on the radio)
dialog: I was married. But I'm divorced."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "What did you do?"
text: Harrer makes a great effort to appear busy with his task, doesn't want the Dalai
text: Lama to see his face. But he also can't lie to him.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "I didn't want a child. So I ran away to climb a mountain."
text: Dalai Lama is shocked.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "You have a child, Heinrig?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Though I've never met him.
text: With great relief, he manages to get the radio working and a loud CRACKLE OF
text: STATIC bursts through the box. He turns to the Dalai Lama, anxious to drop the
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Here. Let me show you how this works."
scene_heading: INT. DALAI LAMA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The Dalai Lama sits on the edge of his bed, weeping uncontrollably. Standing
text: awkwardly in front of him, Harrer doesn't know whether he should sit on the Dalai Lama's bed or not.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "They were destroying the village I was born in - Takster.
dialog: In Amdo. It was terrible."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "You had a bad dream, Kundun. It was just a dream."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "But it was so real. Where did it come from?"
text: Harrer is at a loss to explain that.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "My mind could never imagine such terrible things."
text: Throwing protocol out the window, Harrer sits beside the Dalai Lama and wraps his arm around him.
scene_heading: INT. DALAI LAMA'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Unable to sleep, Harrer stares out at POV - THROUGH WINDOWS: The
text: snowcapped Himalayas glowing milky white in the darkness.
text: HARRER hears the DOOR OPEN. Looks up as the Dalai Lama steps into the
text: waiting room and sits down.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
text: "I can't sleep. I'm afraid the dream will come back."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "We could have an insomniac's slumber party."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Tell me a story, Heinrig.
dialog: (looks out at mountains)
dialog: Tell me a story about climbing mountains."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "That's one way to fall asleep. Those stories bore even me."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Then tell me what you love about it."
dialog: Harrer wasn't prepared for that.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "What do I...?"
text: He thinks a moment.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "The absolute simplicity. That's what I love.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: You have a purpose. Your mind is clear. And calm. Suddenly, the
dialog: light becomes
dialog: sharper. Sounds are richer. All you feel is the deep, powerful
dialog: presence of life.
dialog: (pauses, embarrassed)
dialog: I've only felt that way one other time before."

dialog: "When?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "In your presence, Kundun."
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "You should leave Tibet, Kundun. Your life is at great risk if
dialog: you stay here."
text: The Dalai Lama cocks his head, listening with detached curiosity.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "If you'll forgive my presumption, I've made all the
dialog: arrangements to escort you out safely. We can leave after the
dialog: enthronement ceremony. The Chinese would never expect you to go
dialog: then."
text: The Dalai Lama carefully absorbs this, moved by Harrer's concern.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "How can I help people if I run away from them? What kind of
dialog: leader would I be?"
text: He has struck such a deep nerve. Harrer can't respond.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "I have to stay here, Heinrig. Serving others is my path to
dialog: liberation."
text: There's a pause before Harrer speaks.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Then I won't go either."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Why not?"
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "Because you are my path to liberation."
text: He seeks to make eye contact with the Dalai Lama, but the Dalai Lama looks away.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "The Buddha said, "Salvation does not come from the sight of
dialog: me. It demands
dialog: strenuous effort and practice. So work hard and seek your own
text: salvation diligently.
dialog: (looks at Harrer)
dialog: I am not your son. And I never thought of you as my father. You
dialog: were much too
dialog: informal with me for that."
text: Afraid he might lose the slender hold on his emotions, Harrer close his eyes. The Dalai Lama pauses a
text: moment before speaking again.
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Do you ever think about him?"
text: Too overwhelmed to speak, Harrer nods his head.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "All the time. Every day."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "And what do you think about?"
text: Harrer takes a deep breath, trying not to cry.
speaker_heading: HARRER
dialog: "It's not a conscious thought anymore, Kundun. He's just always
dialog: there.
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: He crossed Tibet with me. He came to Lhasa with me. When I
dialog: visit you, he's there
dialog: beside me...
dialog: (pauses)
dialog: He's just always there. I don't even remember how I pictured
dialog: the world without him in it."
speaker_heading: DALAI LAMA
dialog: "Then you should go home and be his father."
