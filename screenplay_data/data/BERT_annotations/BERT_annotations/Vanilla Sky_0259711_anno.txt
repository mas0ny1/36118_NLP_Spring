speaker_heading: A WOMAN'S VOICE

scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - MORNING
text: David regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully-tiled

scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- MORNING
dialog: The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is

dialog: All the electricity is on. There is absolutely nobody in
text: sight. David begins to run, searching for humanity. The

speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: But they're going to find a way to
dialog: get you out. They're lined up for
dialog: your office -
text: David scans the room. Beneath the good cheer, he sees the
dialog: other layer. Lying. Disloyalty. All part of the
text: institution he enjoys forgetting exists. Each word bashes
dialog: his soul.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: -- your job. Your life. Your
dialog: position. They are working day
dialog: and night. to cheat you out of your
dialog: 51% vote. And they are going to
dialog: sell this tradition, this
dialog: tradition of words, so they can
dialog: eat at a better cafeteria. And
dialog: what they don't know is this -
text: (gestures grandly to
dialog: books that surround
dialog: them)
dialog: - people will read again.
text: David's gaze falls upon Sofia, who is looking directly at
text: him. And for one blinding moment, something passes between
text: them. She looks away. He feels saved.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (interrupting with
dialog: finality)
dialog: I got it.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: They even have a nickname for you
dialog: behind your back.
text: David smiles faintly. Understandingly. Tipp kisses him
text: on the cheek, boldly and drunkenly. He feels like a hero
dialog: to himself.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: Citizen Dildo.
text: David flinches, just a little.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: Now you've got great instincts.
dialog: But I say this with complete love.
dialog: Claim your life... Learn to be an
dialog: Asshole... Don't be -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 19
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (extracting himself)
dialog: Two's enough -
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: Don ' t be-
dialog: (immediately)
dialog: Okay. Forgive me. I still
dialog: believe in this family. Even if
dialog: it's only you.
text: David continues tracking Sofia as he slips over to Peter
dialog: Brown.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Get Tipp out of here, drive him
dialog: home, and in the morning tell him
text: he's re-hired with a 50% raise.
text: Set up a meeting with the other
dialog: attorneys. I'm going to be in
dialog: early tomorrow --
dialog: (a look from Peter Brown)
dialog: -- earlier than usual.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: David enters, shuts the door and sets Sofia's present down.
text: A party dress is on his bed.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Hello handsome.
text: He turns to see Julie Gianni in the bathroom doorway,
text: wrapped in a comforter.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I've come to wish you happy
dialog: birthday.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn't invite you, Julie.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Yeah, that was a little weird -
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But that's how it works with
dialog: parties. You have to be invited.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I'm mad at you, you dick. We made
dialog: love four times the other night.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 20
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is that good?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Two is good. Three is very good.
dialog: But four -
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (fishing for a
dialog: compliment)
dialog: Four is pretty good?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: No, four is... four is... just
dialog: hold me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Four is what?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Hold me, and then I'll leave, and
dialog: you can go talk to that cute
text: brunette.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Four is what?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I don't want to meet your fancy
dialog: friends. I knew 'em all back when
dialog: I was fancy too.
text: He holds her. They talk in between friendly kisses.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Four is what?
text: She pulls away, and talks plainly to him.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
text: She looks like a moth, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A moth?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Sometimes I worry about one of
dialog: these clever girls in a big silly
dialog: coat who'll play you in just the
dialog: right way, and I'll lose my
dialog: friend. And there'll be no more
dialog: chicken soup parties for you and
dialog: me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 21
text: She kisses him again. David very gently, and skillfully
text: resists. She gets the message.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: When will you call me? And don't
dialog: say soon. I hate it when you say
dialog: "soon."
scene_heading: INT. PARTY -- NIGHT
text: Sofia eyes a framed smashed guitar handsomely mounted in a
text: glass display case.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: So this is what's become of rock
text: and roll. A smashed guitar behind
text: a glass case displayed on some
dialog: rich guy's wall.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It was a gift, actually.
text: She turns and sees it's David, engaging smile in place.
text: She jumps slightly.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: I like it.
text: She turns and walks away, David following close behind.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: - how did you get all this stuff,
dialog: this apartment, this life -
text: David is looking just over her shoulder. She turns to see
text: an almost disturbingly large portrait of David Aames, Sr.
text: She turns back.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How about if you help me? Unless
dialog: I'm horning in here.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: You are, but the food's good.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 22
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (playful, like a spy)
dialog: See, I've got a little problem.
dialog: I've got a stalker.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
text: It doesn't. sound life-threatening.
text: Someone passes, bumping her slightly, into him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I need a cover. I need for you to
dialog: pretend we're having a
dialog: scintillating conversation. And
dialog: you're wildly entertained. I know
dialog: it's tough.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'll improvise -
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She's right across the room and
text: she's burning a hole in my back
dialog: right now, isn't she?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Red dress, strappy shoes?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes_
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (beat, jarred)
text: -- wow, she's really staring at
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Shit.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
text: And she seems to be growing...
dialog: less happy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hmm.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I think she's the saddest girl to
dialog: ever hold a martini.
text: Julie Gianni sits on the steps watching. The girl, and the
text: dress, looked much happier in the bedroom. Julie rises and
text: begins to move.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 23
speaker_heading: ON BRIAN
text: Brian holds a drink, attempts to crash a conversation
text: between two models. His debonair act is shaky.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE -- NIGHT
text: David and Sofia race up the stairs. Bad kids having fun.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: You have another apartment?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sort of a day office. Come on -
text: They arrive at the door to a smaller upstairs apartment.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'm not going in there.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well I am. Goodnight.
text: He enters and shuts the door. Frustrated, she stands for a
text: moment, listening to the music streaming from the
text: downstairs apartment. We watch her private moment as she
text: decides to leave him, turns, feels the emotional pull,
text: dances back and knocks sharply three times.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
text: I hear her coming.
speaker_heading: DAVID (0.5.)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: No.
text: David pulls her inside. Shuts the door behind them.
scene_heading: INT. PARTY - NIGHT
text: Julianna and Brian, both looking for David, discover each
dialog: other.
scene_heading: INT. HOME APARTMENT/OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Artwork on the walls. Sofia is drawn to a powerful
dialog: Monet... and it is not a copy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're safe. And I've got nothing
dialog: to drink...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 24
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Who did these paintings?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is Joni Mitchell. This one
dialog: is Monet. And this one is done by
dialog: me.
dialog: (as a tour guide)
text: It is a snowboard.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Well, two of them are geniuses.
dialog: (laughs)
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (off the Monet)
dialog: It's the real thing. His
dialog: paintbrush painted that vanilla
dialog: sky. His canvas. It. was my
dialog: mother's.
scene_heading: INT. PARTY - NIGHT
text: Julianna and Brian hold their private conversation by a
text: piano. They are bonded, almost mesmerized by their mutual
dialog: fascination for David.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S OTHER APARTMENT -- NIGHT
text: David and Sofia laugh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You know what I think? You're
dialog: either a very good actress or you
dialog: really do sort of like me.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I am an actress.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: There's probably not too much you
dialog: aren't great at.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Are you about to compliment, my
dialog: phone voice?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's pretty good, you know -
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Oh, I'd only disappoint, you. See
dialog: - I'm not. qualified. I can spell.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 25
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm surprised you're available.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'm surprised you're surprised.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't keep this banter going.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Me neither.
text: Beat. They drop the act. A powerful, awkward moment... and
text: the door opens.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I caught you.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Brian! Come in here!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's going on --
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Your friends are fun and I'm
dialog: drunk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (cheerful)
dialog: Julie Gianni is stalking me.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: She looked dangerous.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Nobody stalks me. So I drink.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, we're out of drinks up here.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Here, finish my Jack and Coke.
text: He messily tries to hand his drink to David, but spills it
text: embarrassingly. All his cool is gone, and what's left are
text: his friends covering for him, cleaning up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: These stupid glasses -
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: No, it's the stupid guy holding
dialog: it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 26
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Don't worry. I'll get. us all
dialog: something. Jacks and Cokes?
text: She exits, leaving the two friends.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I better hit it. I drank too much
dialog: and I didn't fucking eat.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't be stupid. The party's just
dialog: starting.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (moving away)
dialog: For you it is.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can't go. You're my guest of
dialog: honor.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Fuck you, David. You're paying me
dialog: to write my novel, so you own me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't own you. You're
dialog: brilliant, you're good-looking,
dialog: you're handsome.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But why'd you have to hit on
dialog: Sofia?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: No one's hitting on Sofia.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Fine. Whatever you say. I'm
dialog: crazy, I'm blind.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, you're not blind. You're just
dialog: drinking Jack Daniels. And when
dialog: you drink Jack, you start. in with
dialog: that Frank Sinatra, "She Shot. Me
dialog: Down," gimme a cigarette, King of
dialog: Sad thing...
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: That. I do. Gimme a cigarette.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 27
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll find one.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But wait. You're rich and women
dialog: love you and I'm from Ohio and I'm
dialog: drunk. Can I tell you the truth?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Everyone does.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I dig her. And I've never said
dialog: this to you before, about any
dialog: girl. But she could be... could
dialog: be could be could be... the girl
dialog: of my fuckin dreams.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're not from Ohio.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: But if she fucks tip our friendship
dialog: - she can go to hell. I won't
dialog: allow it! We are bros.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I feel the same way.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (wishes he believed it)
dialog: Sure you do.
text: Brianprepares to leave, as Sofia returns with drinks.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I am Frank. And Frank must go.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I good you bid evening.
text: Sofialooks at her watch, and the situation.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Hang on, I'll go with you.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 28
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Stay, baby.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll give you a lift home later.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: No, I have to work tomorrow.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're in great. hands.
dialog: (beat, realizing it's
dialog: over)
dialog: I'm just humoring myself that my
dialog: opinion matters.
text: Brian looks at the two of them. Life is telling him, and
text: he knows it's time to go. Portrait of a man who will not
text: get what. he wants. David notes the poetry in his friend.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (leans in close to David)
dialog: You will never know the exquisite
dialog: pain of the guy who goes home
dialog: alone. Because without. the
dialog: bitter, baby, the sweet ain't as
dialog: sweet. Have a good time.
text: He exits like a champ, a glorious sad-sack, with a hand
dialog: flourish.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: The Sweet and Sour speech again.
scene_heading: INT. PARTY
text: Julie Gianni dances, her eyes closed, her hand around a
text: strange man's neck.
scene_heading: EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT __ NIGHT
text: They stand nervously out in front of her apartment. In the
text: distance, rain.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: A lot of people are scared of
dialog: heights. It's not the heights
dialog: that bother me, it's the impact
dialog: that terrifies me.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: I won't stay long.
text: She laughs. It was never his decision to make.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 29
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl
text: apartment. A life is lived here, a bed on the back-room
text: floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew. She
text: makes no attempt to clean it up. He soaks in the details,
text: including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and
dialog: shelves.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Hey Paulo!
text: A large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds
dialog: to slather David with love too.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm glad he protects you. This is
text: a lethal canine.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (from other room)
dialog: I love living here. And I refuse
dialog: to clean up!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I've got to work around the clock
dialog: to keep this place.
text: David eases the dog away as he examines the oddly exquisite
text: dolls. He grabs a look at her in the other room. A bit of
text: leg between boot and skirt. As he admires the dolls:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So you're really a dancer, huh?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: For 14 years. But I don't dance
dialog: like you dance.
text: She laughs to herself, steals a look at him. Turns away.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Do you want something to drink?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure.
text: David looks at her refrigerator. A note reads: Call Dad!
text: An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 30
text: that represent a hard-working, hard-earned, committed and
dialog: passionate life.
text: Shot moves across the photos. A young girl living a young
text: girl's hard-working and happy life. Group photos of co-
text: workers. A few from a vacation. A whole new cast of
text: characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to
text: him. And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San
text: Lucas, raising a toast with friends.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I like your life.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Well, it's mine and you can't have
dialog: it.
text: David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of
text: a sloshed Sofia, a guy's arm reaching for her breast.
dialog: Dedication reads: To Sergio! Marry me!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I do not want to know the story
dialog: behind this photo. Who's Sergio?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: It's a nickname.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Your nickname is Sergio?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: It's a long story, and we don't
dialog: know each other.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So many secrets.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: That's because I'm really an arms
dialog: dealer.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I've never known an arms dealer.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: You do now. What about you?
dialog: What's your nickname?
text: David freezes. And then decides what the hell - to tell
dialog: the truth.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Citizen Dildo.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 31
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: You're not staying over.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still stung over
dialog: nickname)
dialog: Never run a company. Stay an
dialog: artist. Stay an arms dealer.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Oh please. Somehow, I can't play
dialog: the violin for you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Although. It must be hard
dialog: controlling all those people's
text: lives. Everyone at that party is
dialog: connected to you for survival in
dialog: some way, it seems.
text: David looks at her, mentally assessing her level of guile.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Ever been married?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. Ever accept any of your
dialog: 12,000 proposals?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (playful, self-
dialog: deprecating)
dialog: 12,008.No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And you moved to New York. To
dialog: dance and paint and act and deal
dialog: arms.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Right.
dialog: (going through CDs)
dialog: Do you want to hear Jeff
dialog: Buckley... or Vikki Carr?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jeff Buckley... or Vikki Carr?
dialog: Both - simultaneously.
text: He continues looking. Flashes of the photos on her
dialog: refrigerator.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Everyone said "don't go to New
dialog: York." But I just think good
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 32
dialog: things will happen if you're a
dialog: good person with a good attitude.
dialog: Doncha think?
text: He regards her. He's a little restless, and a lot
dialog: enchanted. Is she for real?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: You think I'm naive.
text: He decides she's for real. He turns back to the photos on
dialog: her fridge.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I really don't.
speaker_heading: DAVID (V.0.)
dialog: I dug her completely. Somehow, I
text: had found the last semi-guileless
text: girl in New York City.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I have to get to sleep.
dialog: Truthfully -- I'm also working
dialog: mornings as a dental assistant.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Boy, am I going to the wrong
dialog: dentist.
speaker_heading: MCCABE(V.0.)
dialog: And you didn't immediately want to
dialog: sleep with her?
speaker_heading: DAVID (V.0.)
dialog: Well you know - I'm a pleasure
dialog: delayer.
speaker_heading: MCCABE (V.O.)
dialog: (interested in his
dialog: romantic style)
dialog: How does that work?
speaker_heading: DAVID (V.0.)
dialog: (toying with the shrink)
dialog: Pleasure delaying... you don't
dialog: know? You keep the relationship
dialog: casual until the absolute breaking
dialog: point.And then, one night, or
dialog: afternoon, or morning... it could
dialog: be months from now... oh, you know
dialog: how it works -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 33
text: His vision moves across the bright blue sky of one of
text: Sofia's photos. A single crimson cloud.

scene_heading: WEEK/INTERROGATION # 2
text: David sits with the mask, facing McCabe. McCabe is hanging
dialog: on every word.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: - actually no I don't. I've been
dialog: married for twenty-two years.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ah, you've got dinner with your
dialog: daughters.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: That's right. I do.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Back then I had intricate systems
dialog: with women you wouldn't believe.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Like... what...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey Doc. Don't get all melancholy
dialog: over the thirty seconds you were
dialog: single a long time ago.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: That's what you think I'm doing?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Well, you may have a point.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM NIGHT
text: David with artist's notebook in hand. Across the table,
text: Sofia holds the other notebook.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just our shortcomings. That's all
dialog: we're allowed to draw.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (confidently)
dialog: I've never drawn such a true
dialog: likeness before.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Mine's finished.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Already? Hang on. Okay - done.
text: Sofia offers her drawing. It's a caricature of a good-
text: looking guy surrounded by money, cars and very thin girls.
text: He snatches it, studies it, and what he sees hurts him in
dialog: surprising ways.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (embarrassed laugh)
dialog: Jesus. That's how you see me?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Maybe I didn't add enough money --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. It's wonderful. It's
dialog: something you'd see on the wall of
dialog: a steak-house in hell, but it's
dialog: wonderful. Sign it.
text: Sofia's face falls a bit. She sees she's hurt him. She
text: takes the drawing and signs it, a little guilty.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Let's see yours.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
text: She grabs it. Its a rich portrait, filled with detail,
text: humor and style. She is rocked by its elegance.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Wow. I feel bad.
dialog: (regarding it carefully)
dialog: You said to draw a caricature.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know. I couldn't. I saw you
dialog: like that.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 35
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Well, it's very good.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll sell it to you.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: You monster. How much for?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: One kiss.
text: She smiles. Something is developing between them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That smile is gonna be the end of
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (serious)
dialog: And what happens when your friend
dialog: calls you tomorrow?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He only met you a few hours before
dialog: me. He would do the same.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I see that friendship is important
dialog: to you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It is. But as his best friend, I
dialog: also know that he's trying to
dialog: finish a novel about inadequacy
dialog: and rejection. So the longer I
dialog: stay, the better it is for his
dialog: career.
text: Sofia smiles, shakes her head. And yawns.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Your career is one I'd worry
dialog: about.
text: David looks down. She's hit a nerve.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'm sorry -
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, no. You're more right then
dialog: you even know. I used to be one
dialog: of those guys who was just
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 36
dialog: snowboarding through his life,
dialog: with no focus whatsoever.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: When did you change?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (pause, confesses)
dialog: About five minutes ago.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (direct, slightly
dialog: whimsical)
dialog: Every passing minute is another
dialog: chance to turn it all around.

scene_heading: INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER
text: Sofia is asleep on the sofa. Clothes still on. David
text: gently strokes her hair. Television in b.g. It's one of
dialog: those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously
dialog: compelling. The perfect thing to bond over on a great,
dialog: lingering date.
scene_heading: INTERVIEWER ON T.V.
dialog: And to those who think that you're
dialog: a charlatan?
scene_heading: OLDER MAN ON T.V.
dialog: I understand. The perception of a
text: head frozen somewhere waiting for
dialog: reanimation - it sounds like
dialog: science fiction.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: What are you watching?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's the greatest show... it's
dialog: called "Sofia."
text: Sofia looks at him and smiles. They look back to the

speaker_heading: SOFIA

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How would you ever know?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Good point.
scene_heading: INTERVIEWER ON T.V.

scene_heading: OLDER MAN ON T.V.
dialog: Take the case of Benny the dog.
text: Benny is a dog who was frozen for

speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Oh, well that's comforting. It's
dialog: safe for Benny. I'm in!
text: David moves closer to her.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: We better watch out.
text: They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa.
text: It's true. The promise is too great to not savor it, and
text: walk away for now. Thrill remains in the air.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I left my number on your fridge.
text: He makes a courtly bow and turns. She feels the loss of
dialog: his company.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Come here, I want to tell you a
dialog: secret.
text: He pauses a moment, and turns. In this instant, a fleeting
text: instant, it's the oddest thing. He can see their entire
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 38
text: life together. He returns to her. Tentatively, she grabs
text: a quick sweet kiss on his mouth. He stays for an extra
text: moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to
dialog: the potential of their future. And then... very close she
dialog: says:
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I meant that to be your forehead.
text: David stands. He looks around the small apartment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank you for the inspiration. I
dialog: will now attempt to run my
dialog: company, showing compassion for
dialog: the seething throng of my partners
dialog: who root quietly for me to fail.
text: She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business
text: crossroads. Silently, she roots for him like crazy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For things you don't even know -
dialog: thank you. I'm going to go to
dialog: work. I have a company to run.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Pleasure delayer.
text: He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl.
dialog: He actually wants to run his company.
scene_heading: EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY
text: David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the
text: alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...
text: because David is a man with a brand new buzz. The city is
text: his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.
text: Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with
text: its lights still on starts and advances alongside. Behind
text: the wheel is Julianna Gianni.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: David Aames.
text: David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Julie Gianni. You're following
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: only a little. I wanted to
dialog: finish what we were talking about.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 39
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And _-
speaker_heading: JUL IANNA
dialog: How'd it work out with our Moth
dialog: Girl? Did she turn into a
dialog: butterfly for you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes she did.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: But I can see from your walk that
dialog: you didn't sleep with her.
text: David turns.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Let me see if I can guess. You
dialog: haven't slept with her because...
dialog: it's more fun when you can draw it
dialog: out. Sex just isn't as good if
dialog: the woman hasn't told all her
dialog: friends she'd never sleep with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're right on the money, Julie.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
text: She must be exhausted from trying
dialog: to be witty for you all night
dialog: long.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey, Julie.
speaker_heading: JUL IANNA
dialog: Sorry. You're just never there
dialog: for your friends until they've
dialog: already given up on you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm not blowing you off! I just
dialog: want to be alone for a little bit.
dialog: Trust me - I have a lot of things
dialog: I gotta take care of. If we're
dialog: friends, which we are, you'll
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: (simple, honest)
dialog: I'm sorry I got weird. I missed
dialog: an audition and I just felt bad
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

text: It zings him. David turns, considers her.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Do you want to make it up to me?
dialog: I won't tell a soul.
text: Slowly, he is drawn to her. His old self rallies one last
text: time. He gets in the car.
scene_heading: INT. JULIANNA'S CAR -- EARLY MORNING
text: The streets are empty. She plays a CD of a romantic sweet
text: pop track with a feeble vocal.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Would you do a story about me if I
dialog: made a CD?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sure I would -
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Do you like my music?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (winning, truthful)
text: It's vivid.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: If I weren't me, I would buy a CD
dialog: by me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, you know, if you can reach
dialog: one person.
text: Julianna is a little hurt, hides it well.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: What is happiness to you, David?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (considering)
dialog: what is happiness?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: For me, this is happiness. Being

speaker_heading: JU.LIANNA
dialog: One thing bothers me. Why did you
dialog: tell Brian I was your fuck-buddy?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I didn't tell him that. I didn't
dialog: say that.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: When did you stop caring?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (watching the road)
dialog: About what --
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: About the consequences of the
dialog: promises you made.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Promises - I thought we had an
dialog: understanding.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Do you know how hard it is to
dialog: pretend to be your "buddy?" I
dialog: love you, David. You fucked me
dialog: four times in one night. You have
dialog: been inside me and I have
dialog: swallowed your come. That means
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Julie...
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Four times, David! That means
dialog: something. Four times.
text: He grabs at the wheel. She won't let go, and speeds up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: stop the car!
text: She picks at things on the dashboard, as she talks with a

speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Twenty-four hours a day I live

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (caring, almost. pleading)
dialog: Take me to your house. We'll talk

dialog: live. I want you to stop the car,
dialog: Julie. I want you to stop the
dialog: car!
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Don't you know, David? Every time
dialog: you sleep with someone... your

dialog: do or not?
scene_heading: PROFILE OF DAVID AAMES JR.

speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Tell me something, David. Do you
dialog: believe in God?
text: Sweet pop music swells. She bursts the barrier of the
text: winding road, and the car sails into an embankment of a

text: music. Ethereal, almost wondrous. This music continues.
speaker_heading: TO BLACK
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - HALL OF TREES - DAY - DREAM
text: David walks the hall of trees. It's the gentle seductive
dialog: whoosh of a new day, the way the world sounds when you're
text: in love. Vibrant. Alive. Ironically rich in the beauty
dialog: we all take for granted when we're not in love. He looks
text: impossibly drawn forward to Sofia, who stands waiting to
dialog: meet him.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Hello.
text: He steals a kiss. They both feel like they're getting away

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Did you get to work alright?
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, well, actually... I had a
dialog: horrible dream.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: You dreamed you'd never see me

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I left your house. I went to the
dialog: car, and my friend the stalker had
dialog: been following me.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Julie.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes. She followed me down the
dialog: street. She wanted to talk, and I
dialog: had that buzz... from you and me,
dialog: and I think my mind was on that
dialog: terrible drawing of me... and, you
dialog: know, I got inside. And she drove
dialog: me off a bridge and committed
dialog: suicide with me in the car.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I thought you were going straight
dialog: to work.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: But I survive! I survive with my

speaker_heading: SOFIA

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What party? A party?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: The PARTY. Remember? Red

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tell me. Bring it on.
speaker_heading: DR. POMERANZ
dialog: It's sometimes useful in the early

text: The assistant opens a black-leather bound box. In it is
text: the mask - molded from David's own face, locked into a

speaker_heading: DAVID
text: A facial prosthetic.
speaker_heading: DR. POMERANZ
dialog: The aesthetic replacement does

speaker_heading: OTHER DOCTOR
dialog: (helpfully)
dialog: And the plastic in the aesthetic
dialog: shield also filters out abusive

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DR. POMERANZ

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Good. Because for a minute there

text: David's mirror is restored. He studies himself. Raises
text: his arm higher than he has been able to. In the next room
dialog: we hear Conan O'Brien welcoming:
speaker_heading: CONAN (O.S.)
dialog: . please welcome, Benny the Dog.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: David watches Conan. The Owner of Benny sits with Benny
text: himself. He wears a t-shirt reading: L.E. Benny is not
text: the most excitable dog in town. In fact, he seems rather
text: spacey.
speaker_heading: CONAN (O.S.)
dialog: I have so many questions. To
dialog: start off, tell us all just what
dialog: has happened to Benny. What's
dialog: Benny been through?
speaker_heading: OLDER MAN/OWNER
dialog: Benny fell into the water near our
dialog: home, and was frozen in the
dialog: Skykomish River. And I went
dialog: fishing, thinking he'd gone three
dialog: months earlier', and there he was
dialog: in a block of ice, and...
text: David grabs the phone, and dials a number.

speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: (off the dog's
dialog: complacency)
dialog: He is thawed out, right?
text: Laughter on the t.v. Riding the buzz of what he's
text: watching, David dials.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey listen, it's David. I'm back
dialog: in your life. I saw you earlier
dialog: tonight. I was just watching our
dialog: old friend Benny the Dog on... on
dialog: Conan... and I thought of you.
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Whatever. I loved seeing you
dialog: today. So I'll see you soon.
dialog: You're a great dancer!
text: He hangs up and feels instantly mortified. He looks at the
text: phone in his hand.
speaker_heading: TO BLACK
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood
text: dance club. He wears a facial prosthetic. In the
text: darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much. He spots Sofia
text: and Brian, chatting, waiting for him. The sight of the two
text: together recalls happier times. Sofia is dressed down.
text: Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better. His
text: clothes are nicer. He wears them with confidence. David
text: has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together.
dialog: He will be trying too hard, all night long.
text: They regard him in the mask.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (a little too big)
dialog: Hi!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (equally big)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What are you drinking?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 55
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I am in the mood for cheap sugary
dialog: overpriced rum-and-cokes. You
dialog: want one?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (spreads arms)
dialog: Is there any other kind?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'll go get us some -
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Where's the bathroom?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
text: Behind... over by the place next
dialog: to the door by the chick... I
text: mean, girl who looks like Bjork.
text: She leaves. David turns to Brian immediately.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You look good, man. How's your
dialog: book?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Take it off.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't. It's a facial shield.
dialog: It's an antiseptic prosthesis to
dialog: stop infections. These fucking
dialog: doctors.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (with all love)
dialog: Take off the mask! It's freaking
dialog: me out.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't. It's my face. This is
dialog: my face.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh no. Trust me. It's a little
dialog: different.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey, if you're embarrassed, just
dialog: go. Nobody asked you to chaperone
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 56
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Sofia asked me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She didn't want to be alone with
dialog: me?
dialog: (Brian regrets his words)
dialog: That's bullshit. Because I think
dialog: I'm being pretty fucking cool
dialog: about the whole thing.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Talk to a shrink! Or you can
dialog: call me sometime, instead of
dialog: hiding in your apartment. Don't
dialog: take it out on a girl you only met
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (stung)
dialog: Did she say that? I met her
dialog: "once?" Did she say I met her
dialog: "once?"
text: Brian looks away. He's said too much.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Cut it out. I miss the old you.
dialog: We all miss the old you. Because
dialog: the new guy is shit.
text: David turns away. The perfectly wrong thing to say.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh. Man. Wait. That came out
dialog: wrong. I love you - period.
dialog: How's your arm, man?
text: David shakes his head, moves toward the bar.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fuck you, Brian. How about no
dialog: more sympathy? How about if
dialog: that's the deal we make with each
dialog: other? Okay?
text: David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his
text: mask. His head thuds from a migraine.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of
text: tequila.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 57
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: (avoiding eye contact)
dialog: What kind of tequila?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What did you say to me?
speaker_heading: BARMAN
text: (leans closer, still
dialog: looking down)
dialog: I said - What. Kind. Of.
dialog: Tequila.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why don't you ask me to my face,
dialog: bitch?
text: The barman looks up, expressionless.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Patron. If you have it.
scene_heading: ON DAVID - LATER
text: watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Another shot, another Bud.
text: He throws bills on the bar.
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: No. This is on the house.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why -
speaker_heading: BARMAN
dialog: (odd compassion)
dialog: It just is. Bitch.
text: David looks across the club to see Sofia. A Clubgoer Guy
text: whispers something in her ear. She shakes it off. He
text: pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the
dialog: Barman.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Patron!
text: David regards a video monitor behind the bar. Someone's
text: camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another
text: good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good-
text: looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 58
dialog: over lo those many nights ago at her apartment. He pounds
text: back another drink.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Weaving at the urinal, David pees. Squeezes his temples to
dialog: ward off a headache.
speaker_heading: CLUBGOER # 1
dialog: Dude, fix your face!!
text: The Clubgoers laugh. David laughs too. Suddenly, he feels
dialog: better.
scene_heading: INT. CLUB - NIGHT
text: David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of
text: belonging. The music swirls, and takes him along with it.
text: He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is
text: anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes
text: the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In
text: profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David
text: sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the
text: club. He approaches her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hello again.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Hello again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Idea. Let's start all over.
text: He regards her for a moment, sees her apprehension and
dialog: discomfort.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How about if you help me? Unless
dialog: I'm horning in here -
dialog: (beat, does her)
dialog: You are. But the food is good.
text: He continues, taking a step.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: See, I've got a little problem.
dialog: I've got a stalker.
dialog: (does her)
text: It doesn't sound life-threatening.
dialog: (does himself, self-
dialog: deprecating)
dialog: I need a cover. I need for you to
dialog: pretend we're having a
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 59
text: scintillating conversation and
dialog: you're wildly entertained. I know
dialog: it's tough.
dialog: (does her, with head nod)
dialog: I'll improvise.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (a touch playful)
dialog: I don't talk like that.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: She's right across the room and
text: she's burning a hole in my back
dialog: right now, isn't she?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Red dress, strappy shoes?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: That's right!
text: Their heads are close together, looking off into the club.
text: David doesn't notice that Sofia is having a hard time
text: playing along with this game. She is overwhelmed, holding
text: it in. David continues.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I think she' s the saddest girl to
dialog: ever hold a martini.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (about to burst)
dialog: David --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's wrong? Is it me?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'll tell you later.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on. Tell me now.
dialog: Something's wrong. Tell me
dialog: everything. Let's talk about it
dialog: right now.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 60
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'll tell you in another life...
dialog: when we are both cats.
text: David looks at her. His eyes flash at her choice of words.
text: Perhaps there is hope. Sofia stares at. him, worried about
text: his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn
text: of a phrase. Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal
dialog: with the discomfort of this moment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't believe you just said
dialog: that. That. is the best thing I've
dialog: ever heard. That is hilarious.
dialog: God, that just killed me. The way
dialog: you said that. See - that's what
dialog: I love about you. "I'll tell you
dialog: in another life when we are both
dialog: cats."
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB STREET - NIGHT
text: David, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in
text: silence. David weaves. They are anxious to pretend it was
dialog: a wonderful evening.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Well, this is where I leave you.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Wait. I'll walk you to your door.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: No, I live just around the corner.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I've got my bike here.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'd rather walk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don't be a drag. Can't you see
dialog: she wants to go on her own?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Shut up, you're drunk.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I may be an idiot, but I'm not
dialog: drunk.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog:

speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Seriously, I don't need you to

speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Okay then. So. We'll call you.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (unconvincing)
dialog: Great. We'll go catch a movie or
dialog: something.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: So. We'll meet up soon.
text: The word sounds a lot like goodbye and they both know it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We'll meet up soon.
text: Sofia turns and runs away.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (lacking all pride)
dialog: We'll call you again to go out
dialog: with me!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: We'll call you.
text: David and Brian walk on. Brian turns back to see Sofia
text: running to the corner.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Well, it's been a real blast,
dialog: David. I bid you good evening.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: My bike. It's back over there.
dialog: We'll hang soon. Bring your mask
dialog: if you want. I'm getting used to
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: BRIAN

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You drank a little too much. Call

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (starts in Sofia's
dialog: direction)
dialog: No you won't. You just need to
dialog: sleep.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (Brian's itching to go)
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What did you say to Julie Gianni
dialog: the night of the accident?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You told her she was a "fuck
dialog: buddy."
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Never.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And she was a little more than
dialog: pissed about it.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (a little guilty)
dialog: Have you been harboring this shit
dialog: all along? I never talked to her.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whatever. I mean - who am I, if I
dialog: can't. be the one who tells you
dialog: you're not ugly? Aw, give me a
dialog: courtesy laugh. Come on!
text: Brian shakes his head, starts running.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 63
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Brian!! I'm so fucked up. I'm
dialog: just so fucked up!
text: Brian stops one last time, irritated, at the far end of the
dialog: street.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We're best friends! We're bros!
text: Brian needs to rid himself of David. He turns and runs in
dialog: the direction of Sofia.
text: David feels the deep pangs of rejection. Breathing hard.
text: His head hurts. His body hurts.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Come on, man, we're bros.
text: Beat. He sprints down the middle of the street after
dialog: Brian.
scene_heading: EXT. CLUB STREET/SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
text: David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing.
speaker_heading: HIS MIND
text: Brian catches up to Sofia. She turns, relieved. They kiss
text: messily, hungrily. Her shoes arch to reach his height.
text: David runs the streets, nearing her home. The images are
text: tearing his mind apart. He stops and leans against a car,
text: unsteady and nauseous. Holding his head in pain, he
text: manages to run further.
text: David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs
text: overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out,
text: mouth agape. The empty street visible in the b.g., his
text: hand loosens its grip on the mask.

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
text: This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
text: David wakes up and looks into the kind face of Julie

speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Boo!
text: He recoils. His vision sharpens. In the morning shadows,
text: with increasing focus, we see that it is actually Sofia.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, I'm okay -
speaker_heading: DAVID POV
text: Sofia examines him with a look of concern and
text: understanding. Everything takes on a clear and sharp
text: focus. Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: And it worked. Get up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ugh -
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (helping him up)
dialog: That's right. I agree. Ugh.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is a joke.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (touches his cheek)
dialog: David. I'm not going to lie to
dialog: you. I liked the way you looked.
dialog: But if you don't pull it together,

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (groggy)
dialog: I'm still that guy. I'm still

speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I don't. have a mother-savior bone

dialog: You're coming inside. But if this

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: SOFIA

speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: He went with you, didn't he?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: (shaking head at his own

dialog: I thought you guys hooked up.

speaker_heading: SOFIA

dialog: I wish you hadn't gotten in the

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (a long apology is

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MCCABE

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No. I did not sleep.

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: MCCABE

dialog: not anymore. Do you remember?!
dialog: (with certainty)
dialog: They did fix your face. Take off

speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Well, at the risk of boring you, I

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How bad is it?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Well, your ears are in the right

dialog: not too bad at all.
text: Tenderly she kisses, and hugs him.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- DUSK
text: Sofia and David make love, looking into each other's eyes.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Do you love me? I mean, really
dialog: love me... because if you don't,
dialog: I'll just... have to kill you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: In my next life I want to come
dialog: back as this mole -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 72
dialog: (points out mole between
dialog: her breasts)
dialog: - seriously, this mole. I mean,
dialog: you'll have to wear bikini tops to
dialog: work, or loose-fitting shirts so I
dialog: can breathe, but -
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I love you. I love you. I love
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: - I could live right there.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Is this a dream?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh absolutely.
text: She grabs his face, kisses him... a powerful moment, like

scene_heading: EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY
text: Portrait of the couple together, moving down the middle of
text: the street on fresh snow.
speaker_heading: DAVID (V.0.)
dialog: We talked about the big things,
dialog: the little things, and the big
dialog: things. But in truth, with Sofia,
dialog: it was the in-between times.
scene_heading: INT. FLORENTINE'S BAR AND GRILL - DAY
text: Sofia laughs. A perfect laugh. David admires her, sits
text: next to her, holding her hand. Theirs is the unmistakable
text: closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual
text: relationship. They share a giddy open secret. Across the
text: table, we reveal Brian. He's got a tiny high-tech camera.
text: Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish.
text: David replies knowingly - "si" - every few words. It's a
text: deep communication. She exits.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: What, did she say?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (in love)
dialog: I have no idea.
text: Brian shakes his head.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 73
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How's things, Brian?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Fine.
text: David's face is huge in the Brian's viewfinder.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How's things, Brian?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.
dialog: Besides - Sofia is great, but by
dialog: no means one-of--a-kind. She was a
dialog: proximity infatuation.
text: Brian, naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous, spots a
text: writer at a nearby table making notes.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (to writer)
dialog: And don't use that, it's mine.
text: The writer looks busted.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where'd you get the camera?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I'm into things... you have no
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well, as long as you're okay.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: And anyway, we're friends, aren't
dialog: we?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Always.
text: David offers his hand. They shake.
speaker_heading: DAVID'S POV
text: David's gaze moves to a 40 year-old man staring at him with
text: a bemused smile. A plate of food sits in front of him.
text: His eyes suggest a piercing intellect, he looks at David
text: with deep familiarity. David can't quite place the face.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 74
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Hey what's up with your face?
dialog: Fuck, there's a seam opening or
dialog: something!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (mounting horror)
dialog: What - what are you talking about?
text: Brian laughs. The spell is broken. Friends again.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You asshole!
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: David sleeps next to Sofia. He sits up, takes a glass of
text: water from the night-stand, admires his girlfriend and
text: moves to the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: He turns on the light, fills the glass with water. Looks
text: up into the restored mirror. His face is disfigured. He
text: recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking
text: to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the
dialog: lower cabinet.
text: Sofia bolts upright. She sees him on the floor across the
text: room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her
text: arm, screaming.
scene_heading: INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: He awakens suddenly. Sofia is next to him, smiling.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: Was I snoring?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (still breathing heavily)
dialog: No, I think it was me. Thirsty,
dialog: that's all.
text: She kisses his hand reassuringly.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: I'm dreaming about you. Mmmmmmm.
text: He gets up and goes to the bathroom.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 75
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: Tentatively, he flips the light on. A very relieved David
text: regards his restored face. He shuts off the light quickly,
text: and fills the glass of water. Splashes some water on his
dialog: face.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: David climbs back into bed.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (small laugh)
dialog: I could listen to you say "mmmmm"
dialog: for the rest of my life.
speaker_heading: SOFIA
text: They kiss. The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of
text: her neck. He caresses her body. She kisses his
text: fingertips. Her back to him. Tangled in sheets, they ease
text: into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant
text: for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.
text: His hand stops. It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns
text: her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of
text: the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling
text: to the floor, the sheet tangled around him. He turns on
dialog: the light.
text: Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night
text: animal caught in the intrusive glare of day.
text: When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: (scared, uncomprehending)
dialog: Baby, what's wrong?
text: He gasps for breath, backing away. Totally terrified.
text: Paralyzed. In a low voice:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where. Is. She.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Who?
dialog: His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he
text: pounces on her with a manic will to survive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 76
text: Julie Gianni looks a little loopy, almost stoned.
text: Taunting.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: (taunting, sweet)
dialog: I'm Sofia.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT - MINUTES LATER
text: David dismantles the phone, takes the cord. He ties her
text: willing hands to the posts of the bed. She protests oddly,
text: like an actress playing a part.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Now I'm going to make sure that I
dialog: tie this four times. Do you know
dialog: why, Julie? Because four times
dialog: really means something.
text: David pulls his pants on, frantically opens the wardrobe
dialog: closet. No Sofia. Goes to the kitchen. No Sofia. Julie
text: sobs quietly, sweetly, tied to the bed. She behaves and
dialog: acts like Sofia.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: David, don't hurt me.
text: David returns and sits across from her on the bed,
text: terrified and barely hanging on.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Okay, I'm freaked out. It worked.
dialog: So just tell me right now - where
dialog: is Sofia?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I am Sofia.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: In one minute I'm going to call
dialog: the police --
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: (heart breaking)
dialog: Don't do it, honey.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I knew you'd survived the
dialog: accident.
text: She looks at him with tearful eyes.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: What. accident?
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 77
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whose body was it? Who's the one
dialog: who hired you? The Seven Dwarves?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I haven't had any accident!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, of course not. It wasn't an
dialog: accident at all. It was attempted
dialog: murder!
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: Honey, please.
text: He picks up the phone. Dials 911.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Police Department? I've captured
text: an intruder who's entered my home.
text: He turns to her. Her eyes are yearning.
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
text: The flash of mug shots. We see David sitting, sweating,
text: agitated waiting in a Police station holding room.
text: Suddenly, the door opens and Thomas Tipp enters, flanked by
dialog: other Detectives.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: Guys, can you give us a minute
dialog: here? Detective Larson...
dialog: Detective Andrews... thank you.
text: The room empties, and Tipp approaches David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They think that I had something to
dialog: so with this.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: I'm going to handle this exactly
dialog: the way your father would have
dialog: handled this. I've got it solved.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You've got it solved? Where is
dialog: she?
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: She's going to be fine.
text: David hugs Tipp.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 78
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Thank God you're here, man. I
dialog: love her.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: Yeah... Now, I want you to look
dialog: at these photos and then I'm going
dialog: to destroy them. Sofia's
dialog: testimony is also in here. It
dialog: won't exist. She's not going to
dialog: press charges.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Press charges against. me?
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: David, wake up. As your friend, I
dialog: think you should see what you did
dialog: to Sofia. The press won't get
dialog: hold of this if you get. away
dialog: quickly.
text: David leans back in his seat. It's all of them - everybody
text: - against him. Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two
text: computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,
text: moving it into the light so he sees it clearly. Julie
text: Gianni, battered.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This is Julie Gianni. That's not
dialog: Sofia. This is Julie Gianni. I
dialog: didn't do that do that to her.
dialog: (beginning to shut down)
dialog: Tommy, someone's setting me up.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: David, the Board and I have taken
dialog: care of everything. They've been
dialog: really great, actually. All of
dialog: this is going to disappear. We're
dialog: all behind you... even the Board.
text: David looks at Tipp. It's very clear now. He's one of
text: them. David attempts calm.
speaker_heading: TIPP
dialog: (quiet, helpful)
dialog: Get out of here.
text: A migraine is thundering in David's head. His world is
text: spinning backwards.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79
scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION -â¢ NIGHT
text: David strides down the hallway. A Man in a crystal blue
text: sport coat stands, waiting. As David passes, the Man
text: confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable
text: secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child
dialog: saying: "Mommy, mommy."
scene_heading: MAN IN BLUE COAT
dialog: This is a revolution of the mind.
scene_heading: INT./EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
text: Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're in fucking sad shape, man.
dialog: Don't fucking ever hit a girl,
dialog: man. Hit me, but don't fucking
text: EVER hit a girl.
text: David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on
text: them - pulls Brian out of the station.
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh... it was Julie Gianni. So,
text: Sofia was abducted by Julie, and
text: now Julie is posing as Sofia.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You're in O.J. land, man. Julie
dialog: Gianni is fucking dead!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know what the cops have
dialog: told you, but let me assure you -
text: Julie Gianni is alive alive ALIVE.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I didn't talk to the cops. I
dialog: talked to Sofia!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I just dropped Sofia off. And I
dialog: saw everything you did to her.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Let me tell you something - I did
dialog: not do that to her. Look me in
dialog: the eye and tell me that it was
dialog: the same girl you brought to the
dialog: party. Tell me it was your dream
dialog: girl, your "proximity
dialog: infatuation."
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: (raw, finally)
dialog: Yes! And you stole her from me!
text: David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: The one girl I really wanted, and
dialog: you took her from me. You're
dialog: insane. You're losing it, man.
text: David nods powerfully. He now understands. Brian is one
dialog: of them too.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You have revealed yourself.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh yeah, I'm with them.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where'd you get the coat, Brian?
dialog: Where'd you get the camera? How
dialog: much did they pay you?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Listen to me, 'cause it's the last
dialog: time we're ever gonna speak. I
dialog: was your only friend.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You have revealed yourself to me.
scene_heading: INT. FLORENTINE'S - NIGHT
text: David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily. He's been
text: crying. His head aches with this thought - maybe I am
text: insane. A man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting
text: himself to sit at the table. His bedside manner is
text: impeccable. His smile offers infinite compassion. He was
text: the man staring at. him in this same restaurant. He is

speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: There's an explanation for all
dialog: this, David.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: You and I know each other. You
dialog: found me on the Internet.
text: Silence. David stares at the man.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you want? Why are you
dialog: following me?
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: I'm here to help you. And first
dialog: of all, it's very important that
dialog: you calm down.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Calm down?
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: You must overcome your fears and
dialog: regain control. Take hold of your
dialog: life again. It's as easy as
dialog: holding that glass. What if I
dialog: told you that you can take control
dialog: of all of this... everything...
dialog: even me...
text: David turns to him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Look. I'm straight, okay?
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: David, look at these people. It
text: seems as though they're chatting
dialog: away, doesn't it? Nothing to do
dialog: with you -
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 82
text: David listens, as he looks at the spirited Saturday night
text: crowd, lost in their revelry.
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: -- and yet, they might only be here
dialog: because you wanted them to be.
dialog: You are their God. And not only
dialog: that, you could make them obey
dialog: you... or even destroy you.
text: David shakes his head, exhausted and in no mood. He shuts
text: his eyes, fights off a headache.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: What I'd like them to do is shut
dialog: up! Especially you!
text: Silence. David opens his eyes. They're all staring at
text: him. Casually waiting for orders.
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: You see?
text: David looks at him with horror, backing away. Receding in
dialog: his vision:
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: You and I signed a contract,
dialog: David.

speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Can you tell the difference

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course. Can you?

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: That's right. Who is Ellie?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I... I don't know what's real.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: What happened that night, David?
dialog: Somebody died.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't want to remember.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Do you understand that you hold

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It wasn't Sofia.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Who was it?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Who was it?

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: MCCABE

dialog: Tell me what your heart and soul

text: David shudders. It's coming.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Did you kill Sofia?

scene_heading: INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK
text: The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear
text: the front door kicked in. David enters, slamming the door
text: behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such
text: happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now
text: horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the
dialog: refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact
text: expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier
text: visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.
text: He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the
text: drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He
text: rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment
text: until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...
text: Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends
text: down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her
text: hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.
text: Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around
dialog: sweetness of Sofia.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I thought you were a vandal.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (with difficulty)
dialog: Who... are... you?
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I'm Sofia.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You are not Sofia... you're not
dialog: Sofia...
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 85
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: I'm Sofia.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whatever.
text: Julie starts to cry. Battling tears, she offers her heart
dialog: and soul.
speaker_heading: JULIANNA
dialog: David, honey. This will all be
dialog: over soon. We'll be together
dialog: again. You'll forget Julianna and
dialog: I won't be afraid of you. Let me
dialog: get you a cold towel.
text: She exits. He struggles to rise. His head is a swirling
dialog: mess. And then:
scene_heading: ON KITCHEN DOORWAY
text: Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.
text: David advances, and faints into her arms.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sofia?
speaker_heading: SOFIA
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Yes, David, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia.
text: He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her.
text: They kiss, gently, then more powerfully.
scene_heading: INT. SOFIA'S BEDROOM - DAY
text: They make love, emotionally and deeply. Two bodies
text: yearning to possess the other. Camera moves across their
text: bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move
text: continues onto her back.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Where were you...
text: Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't want to know.
dialog: (thrusting)
dialog: Just tell me you love me.
text: David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'. He doesn't
text: want to look. The passion gives way to a mounting dread,
text: as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 86
speaker_heading: JULIANNA (O.S.)
dialog: I love you. I'm afraid of how
dialog: powerful this is.
text: He continues moving passionately, harder now. Julie
text: responds to the overwhelming surge within David. She gives
text: over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a
text: rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and
text: pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his
dialog: own.
text: Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.
dialog: This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking
text: it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What the fuck is happening?
text: Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an
text: advanced lovemaking session.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I want to see your face!
text: She grabs at the pillow.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I want to see your face!
text: David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.
text: Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He
text: loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent
text: attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut
text: it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her
text: hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.
text: She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a
text: whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's
text: confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want
dialog: to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.
text: He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With
text: true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand
text: will reveal who he's just killed.
speaker_heading: ON HER TORSO
text: as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-
text: inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top
text: of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY

text: He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror.

speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: David, who...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm in a dream...
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: . was the man at the restaurant?
text: David shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: (pained)
dialog: Sometimes the mind behaves as if
text: it were in a dream. Faces change,
dialog: people become other people. The
dialog: subconscious is a powerful thing.
dialog: You treated Julie carelessly,
dialog: didn't you, David? Your feeling
dialog: of responsibility or guilt over
dialog: Julie might have easily turned
dialog: Sofia into Julie.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Do you know what derangement is?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: All I know is, you killed your

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What will you plead?
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Temporary derangement. It's your

dialog: me.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What do you believe?
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Believe it or not, I care about
dialog: you. You've become like family to
dialog: me. I don't want to give up on
dialog: you.
text: David looks at, him oddly. Suddenly, the archetype seems
text: very familiar. McCabe continues with the noble concern of
text: a towering father figure.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: (continued)
dialog: But I needed more. I needed an
dialog: answer. I... I even thought there
dialog: was more than a good chance
dialog: someone was playing tricks on you.
dialog: Maybe it was the board. But I
dialog: can't exceed my duties here. I'm
dialog: just a psychologist, and I have to
dialog: leave you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Will I see you at the trial?
speaker_heading: MCCABE

scene_heading: INT. AARON'S CUBICLE - NIGHT
text: Through the glass of the psychiatric unit, we see McCabe
text: and Aaron exit. Only Aaron's television, sitting on a
text: stool, remains. Push in on the television, which is
text: playing the L.E. Infomercial.
text: Push in on the reverse. It's David at the window as he
text: realizes the true meaning of "Ellie" -- L.E. He bangs on
text: the glass, at first slow, then faster, yelling for McCabe.
text: The L.E. Infomercial and Benny the Dog are reflected on the

scene_heading: INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

text: tall, moving forward, like Atticus Finch with Tom Robinson.
scene_heading: INT. CAR
text: McCabe watches David closely. Aaron the Guard turns to
text: look at David behind the glass partition that separates
text: them. David looks out the window at the world he's missed.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA - DAY
text: The police vehicle pulls up in front of a crowded business
text: plaza. McCabe exits with David. Always watching his every

text: into the sky.
scene_heading: INT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY
text: A Building Guard guides them through the lobby. McCabe

speaker_heading: GUARD

speaker_heading: MCCABE

speaker_heading: DAY
text: The elevator door opens to reveal a very pleasant and

text: words: Life Extension Corporation. Two more Guards meet
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 90

text: overwhelming David, as they approach the reception station.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Her name is Libby.
text: A stunning young woman rises and moves to greet them.
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Good morning. I'm Libby. I'm
dialog: here to assist you.
text: Libby stares at David's masked face. It's slightly

speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: He's my son. He's very shy.
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: (smiling professionally)
dialog: You're not. with the media or part.

speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: Welcome to Life Extension. Have a

dialog: follow me.
text: She-offers them two bound folders featuring the logo - L.E.

speaker_heading: MCCABE

dialog: You can wait out here.
speaker_heading: LIBBY
dialog: You'll be meeting Rebecca

speaker_heading: PATIENT #2

scene_heading: INT. LIFE EXTENSION OFFICE - DAY
text: Aames and McCabe sit and wait in a warm wood-paneled
text: office, proposals in hand. A glimpse shows words like Re-
text: Evolve and Re-Experience, peppered with colorful photos of
text: simple, life-affirming portraits of everyday life. It's
text: well-appointed and well-marketed organization.
text: McCabe regards David as the victim of a lunatic's scam.
text: Injustice fuels McCabe.

dialog: "Cryonization - a journey of re-

text: Account Liaison REBECCA DEARBORN enters with paperwork.
text: She is an electric presence. Efficient, caring and oddly

speaker_heading: DEARBORN
dialog: Mr. McCabe, how are you? I'm
dialog: Rebecca Dearborn.
dialog: (quick notice of mask)
dialog: Life Extension, or L.E. as we like
dialog: to refer to it, is a glimpse of
dialog: the future... a ticket... not in
dialog: the juvenile sense, but in the
dialog: deeply meaningful sense that can
dialog: only be borne in the human heart.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 92
dialog: The DNA codes of the human body
text: have been broken. Soon, heart
dialog: ailments, cancer and so much more,
dialog: will be a thing of the past. Very
dialog: simply, your anguish... your
dialog: discontent... even your death is
dialog: no longer necessary in a
dialog: traditional sense. Whatever
text: malady that hides behind that
dialog: mask... is temporary.
text: She looks directly at David, and it stirs him. McCabe
text: studies her, and the operation. He thirsts for clues.
text: David flips through the folder - toward the back, a panel
text: of photos of storage tanks. Lavishly and warmly
text: photographed, just like next year's cars in a magazine.
speaker_heading: DEARBORN
dialog: Within an hour of your passing,
dialog: L.E. will transfer your body to a
dialog: vessel where you will be sealed
dialog: and frozen at 196 degrees below
dialog: zero. Power outages, earthquakes,
dialog: nothing will effect your

speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Did you sign this contract, David?
text: David looks down at pamphlet, looks up.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's the "Lucid Dream" option?
speaker_heading: DEARBORN
dialog: Good choice. The Lucid Dream is
dialog: Life Extension's newest option.
dialog: For a little extra, we offer the

dialog: entertainment.
speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: (rueful, skeptical)
dialog: "Cryo-tainment. "

speaker_heading: DEARBORN
dialog: I love you, David. Te Quiero.

speaker_heading: DAVID

dialog: No.
scene_heading: ON DAVID - IN ELEVATOR

scene_heading: CLOSE ON VENTURA
text: The client is starting to understand.
speaker_heading: VENTURA
dialog: Yes. Just like Benny the Dog.
dialog: Your face and body can now be

speaker_heading: MCCABE
dialog: Mortality as home entertainment.
dialog: This cannot be the future. Can

text: David regards McCabe. Once dynamic, McCabe now seems
