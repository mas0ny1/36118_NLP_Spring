text: In the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O)
dialog: In between the years when the
dialog: oceans drank Atlantis and the rise
dialog: of the Sons of Aryas, there was an
dialog: age undreamed of, when shining
text: kingdoms lay spread across the
text: world like blue mantles under the
dialog: stars. Hither came Conan, the
text: Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a
dialog: king born of battle.
dialog: 
text: Muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the
text: guttural CRIES of combat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UNBORN BABY
dialog: 
text: Eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its
text: tip not an inch from the baby's head.
dialog: 
text: As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we
text: travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE.

scene_heading: EXT. CIMMERIA - MUDDY FIELD - DAY
dialog: 
text: A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
text: sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian
text: beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody
dialog: stomach.
dialog: 
text: Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling
text: snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built
text: CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Islene!!!
dialog: 
text: Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin
text: cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never
text: leaving Islene.
dialog: 
text: The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
text: earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AESIR
dialog: Now, now little whore. Did I get
dialog: you or your little one?
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Islene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
text: fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the
text: sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
text: Aesir's armor -- at his groin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISLENE
dialog: I'd ask you the same.
dialog: 
text: The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the
text: killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The
text: Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.
dialog: 
text: Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees
text: beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands
text: back they are coated in blood.
dialog: 
text: Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a
text: knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISLENE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take your child.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: I cannot.
dialog: 
text: Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses
text: against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISLENE
dialog: There is no time, husband. I would
dialog: see my child's face.
dialog: 
text: Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the
text: knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife
text: to use. Never once does she scream.
dialog: 
text: A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up
text: through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISLENE (CONT'D)
dialog: A boy. He will be strong. A warrior
dialog: with no equal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Do not speak, love.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ISLENE
dialog: You have never been able to still
dialog: my tongue, and you will not this
dialog: day. He will be wild, Corin. You
dialog: must temper him.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,
text: a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.
dialog: 
text: Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young
text: CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the
text: air, giving it an ethereal haze.
dialog: 
text: At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior
dialog: speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: URAN
dialog: A Cimmerian warrior is like any
text: other man. A Cimmerian warrior
text: feels hunger. He feels cold. Like
dialog: other men he may lie and cheat.
dialog: (stares the boys down)
dialog: But when a Cimmerian warrior
text: hungers, he hungers only for the
text: blood of his enemy. When he feels
text: cold, it is the cold steel of his
text: sword. When he lies, he lies in
dialog: wait for his enemy. And when he
dialog: cheats, he cheats death itself!
dialog: 
text: Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good
text: two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,
text: but his face is as stoic, driven.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: URAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Conan! You are too young to be
dialog: here. Withdraw.
dialog: 
text: CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN
text: menacingly steps up to the smaller boy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LARGEST TEEN
dialog: He said leave, motherless whelp.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm
text: towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the
text: teen in the throat.
dialog: 
text: The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for
dialog: air.
dialog: 
text: A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced
text: by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,
text: ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the
text: large stones in their mouths.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: URAN
text: In the black crag in the high pass
text: stands a wooden training sword. The
text: one who claims it, with stone still
dialog: in his mouth, will have earned the
dialog: right to train with the warriors.
dialog: 
text: The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: URAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well? What are you waiting for?!
dialog: 
text: And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the
text: other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel
text: their stones. One or two succeed.
dialog: 
text: Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
text: into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff
dialog: face.
dialog: 
text: Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CLIFF FACE
dialog: 
text: And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.
text: They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock
text: face as though it were a ladder.
dialog: 
text: The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,
text: trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds
text: another path. In moments he is ahead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - DAY
dialog: 
text: Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger
text: boys right behind him.
dialog: 
text: They race through the forest, heading uphill --
dialog: 
text: When Conan spots movement ahead. He pauses --
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
text: boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an
text: AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.
dialog: 
text: All the boys stop. Out of the dense forest come
dialog: 
scene_heading: FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES
dialog: 
text: Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand
text: axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their
dialog: waist.
dialog: 
text: The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They
text: turn and run in the opposite direction.
dialog: 
text: Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CIMMERIAN BOY
dialog: Conan! Run!
dialog: 
text: But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. He
text: turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.
dialog: 
text: The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LATER
dialog: 
text: Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS.
text: They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT, escaping in the
text: other direction. One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit.
text: Corin desperately searches for his son.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Conan? Conan?!
dialog: 
text: Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered
text: in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked
dialog: to pieces.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What have you done, boy?
dialog: 
text: Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his
text: father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: They killed one. I killed three. I
dialog: am a warrior now.
dialog: 
text: Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.
text: Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts, they are
text: aghast. Conan looks confused. Why aren't they happy?
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: A warrior? What you have done a
dialog: jackal would do. Never a warrior.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: They would have done the same --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: As I said, jackals.
speaker_heading: (TO URAN)
dialog: He is not ready. I will forge him
dialog: myself.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: TRAINING MONTAGE:
dialog: 
text: Conan is tested under Corin's watchful eye:
dialog: 
text: - Forced to sleep in the snow, while his father keeps warm
dialog: inside.
dialog: 
text: - A heavy boulder on his shoulder blades while he balances on
text: wet river rocks.
dialog: 
text: - Climbing a cliff face, his bare hands leaving blood behind
text: on the jagged rocks.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CIMMERIAN FORGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Flames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the
text: bellows of the forge. Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he
text: stokes the blaze.
dialog: 
text: Corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. Conan cannot take his
text: eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Stoke your fire, boy.
dialog: 
text: Conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: "Stoke your fire, chop your wood."
dialog: I have slept where wolves dare not.
dialog: I have balanced a thousand river
dialog: stones. When will you teach me the
dialog: sword?
dialog: 
text: Corin stares his son in the eyes. Judging.
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Think you're ready? Then tell me:
dialog: what is a sword's purpose?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: To slay ones enemies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: No. That is what it does. Its
dialog: purpose is why you use it.
dialog: 
text: He tosses Conan two lumps of ore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me, which makes the best
dialog: sword?
dialog: 
text: Conan takes the two lumps, testing them. He hands his father
dialog: back one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: The stronger ore, eh? Then we shall
dialog: make a sword of it, and tomorrow
dialog: you will show me what brute
dialog: strength yields.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DUSK
dialog: 
text: With a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin.
text: Conan attacks with fury. Corin defends with grace. Until the
text: boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that
scene_heading: SHATTERS CONAN'S SWORD.
dialog: 
text: Corin simply turns and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle
dialog: what happened.
dialog: 
text: Corin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving Conan to
dialog: puzzle what happened.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Conan works the bellows, putting his back into it. Corin
text: places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Why did it break?
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Because it had no life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword
text: with hammer. Corin nods at Conan, who sprinkles the glowing
text: blade with ash.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The strongest blade isn't made of
dialog: the hardest steel, boy. The hardest
dialog: ore is what a man will die for. It
text: is strong and unyielding. It
text: neither cowers nor concedes. But
dialog: without the softer ore, it can be
text: shattered like glass.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack
text: tub, only to place it right back into the flames.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: The softer ore is what a man lives
dialog: for. It is flexible and lasting. It
dialog: survives, even against the greatest
dialog: of foes. But too much of the soft
dialog: ore, the blade will not cut deep
dialog: enough when it must.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Corin fashions the blade's hilt, engraving the guard and
text: pommel. It is a work of art.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: A sword must be tempered, the two
text: ores united through fire and ice.
text: Through its suffering the sword
text: comes to hold both life and death.
dialog: 
text: Corin hands Conan the sword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now tell me, what is this sword's
dialog: purpose?
dialog: 
text: Conan furrows his brow, trying to puzzle the answer. He
text: can't. Corin's disappointment shows. He takes the sword from
text: Conan's hands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: This one is not ready yet.
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Blood rushes to Conan's face but he says nothing. He rushes
dialog: out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frustrated, Conan slashes through a field of reeds, cutting
text: everything within reach of him, expending his rage.
dialog: 
text: Behind him something moves in the forest. We catch just a
text: glimpse of the PICT, the same one that escaped Conan in the
dialog: earlier scene.
dialog: 
text: Conan's instincts cause him to spin around -- but then
dialog: there's nothing there.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CIMMERIAN SCOUT POST - DAY
dialog: 
text: Built into the side of a huge tree, fifty feet up, this
text: wooden structure houses two CIMMERIAN SENTRIES. A BIRD CRIES
text: in the woods, causing one of the sentries to investigate.
dialog: 
text: THWICK! He suddenly stands up straight, unmoving. The one
text: still sitting in the structure notices.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CIMMERIAN SENTRY
dialog: See something?
dialog: 
text: The standing sentry falls backwards, revealing an ARROW
text: piercing his right eye. Shocked, the remaining sentry reaches
text: for the WARNING HORN mounted on the wall.
dialog: 
text: But as he reaches for it, his shadow becomes three
dialog: dimensional, MORPHING into
dialog: 
text: A SHADOW SCOUT
dialog: 
text: A thin, feral humanoid, bodies covered in tattoos, from the
text: deepest jungles of Zingara. The scout lashes out with his
text: black sword and cuts straight across the sentry's throat.
dialog: 
dialog: This Shadow Scout's name is REMO.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SCOUT POST - DAY
dialog: 
text: Remo exits and stares down at CHEREN, a BLIND ARCHER clad in
text: lamellar armor and a conical sedge hat. Cheren has an arrow
text: notched and ready, but somehow he knows not to fire.
dialog: 
text: Cheren lowers his bow and lets out a BIRD WHISTLE --
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: And the forest comes alive. The forces are an odd
text: combination; massive KUSHITE TRIBESMEN, dark-skinned savages
text: from the savannahs of Kush, and a LEGION OF AQUILONIAN
text: MERCENARIES, heavily armored knights drawn from the cities of
dialog: Aquilonia.
dialog: 
text: Their leaders, respectively, are the six foot-five Kushite
text: chief UKAFA, gold-toothed, his body painted for battle, and
text: the handsome, silver-armored Aquilonian LUCIUS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: That's the last of their guard
dialog: towers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: All this sneaking around for a
text: lowly tribe of barbarians.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
dialog: This lowly tribe of barbarians have
dialog: buried every warrior ever to set
dialog: foot on this land, Lucius.
dialog: 
text: KHALAR SINGH, a warlord atop a black horse, rides through the
text: fog-shrouded trees.
dialog: 
text: He bears a nomadic visage, with tanned skin and almond-shaped
text: eyes. While his voice is calm, his eyes burn with malice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: That is only because they have
dialog: never faced my legion.
dialog: 
text: Khalar regards Lucius with amusement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Then show us. But should you fail,
dialog: remember the plan.
dialog: 
text: Lucius scowls as he delivers a bow to Khalar Singh.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Corin walks out of the forge, looking around for Conan.
text: Various other Cimmerians go about the daily routine, but
text: Conan is nowhere to be seen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Conan?
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick
text: fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out
dialog: there.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors
text: burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength.
dialog: 
text: But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds
text: they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious
dialog: charge of their own.
dialog: 
text: SLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash
text: into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones --
dialog: 
text: Where the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead
text: the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing
text: their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over
text: the Aquilonian's shorter weapons.
dialog: 
text: And quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin
text: squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating.
text: Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Retreat!
dialog: 
text: As a unit, the Aquilonians race back into the woods. In
text: seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Wait! Hold your ground!
dialog: 
text: But it's too late, nearly half the Cimmerian warriors are
text: gone on the chase.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CLIFF FACE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Lucius and the Aquilonians race up to a sheer cliff face.
text: Nowhere left to run. They turn to see the Cimmerians
text: gathering in front of them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: URAN
text: Death is in the air, invaders. Can
dialog: you taste it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
speaker_heading: (SMILES)
dialog: Indeed. I savor it.
dialog: 
text: Uran notices something is wrong. His eyes go skyward. Atop
text: the cliff stand Cheren and a dozen more of his blind archers,
text: bows at the ready with FLAMING ARROWS.
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading
text: right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit
text: the tree trunks beside them.
dialog: 
text: And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they
text: notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows.
text: The flames lick at the substance --
dialog: 
text: KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian
text: warriors are burned alive.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Conan spins, started by the sound of the explosion. He sees
text: flames rising above the treetops beyond.
dialog: 
text: He races back home.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Corin sees the flames in the distance as well. Suddenly,
text: Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed
text: with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining
text: Cimmerians, savage against savage.
dialog: 
text: But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians
text: comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing
text: loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN
text: HORSEMEN into the village.
dialog: 
text: The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack
text: with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands
text: and dragging them to the ground.
dialog: 
text: The Horsemen quickly gather up the women while Ukafa and his
text: men keep the Cimmerian warriors all too occupied.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Conan rushes through a river, now tinged red with blood, and
text: reaches the far end of the village.
dialog: 
text: Huts burn, women are chained, only a handful of Cimmerians
text: still stand. Lucius and his Aquilonian mercenaries are
text: helping the Spearmen slay the wounded.
dialog: 
text: Conan grabs a fallen sword and rushes for the nearest
text: Aquilonian and RUNS HIM THROUGH. A ZINGARAN spots him and
text: rushes him with his spear. Conan readies himself for the
speaker_heading: CHARGE --
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: When the Zingaran loses his head, lopped off by Corin's
dialog: blade.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Father!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Come.
dialog: 
text: Corin, sporting a deep gash to his abdomen, pulls a reluctant
text: Conan from the battle, back toward the forge.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The flames of the forge still burn as Corin pushes Conan into
text: the room. He bolts the door behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Do we need more weapons?
dialog: 
text: Corin drops his sword, then struggles to lift a heavy grating
text: in the dirt floor. Beneath it a trough of cooling water leads
text: under the hut and away from the village.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Go. There is a hunting lodge in the
text: North Pass with provisions.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: No! I will fight!
dialog: 
text: Corin grabs Conan by his tunic, pulling him up to his face.
text: Corin's eyes are half-crazed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: This fight is over, but yours has
dialog: just begun. You wanted to be a
dialog: warrior of the tribe, Conan--now
dialog: you must be its last.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Father, I am not afraid to die.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Good. Make your death have purpose.
dialog: 
text: BOOM. Something slams at the door. It does not budge. Again,
speaker_heading: BOOM.
dialog: 
text: A shadow appears under the door, sliding into the forge, and
text: MATERIALIZING into the form of Remo. Remo quickly slides away
dialog: the bolt.
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In rush enter Lucius and Ukafa. Corin and Conan face their
text: attackers, fighting in close quarters. Lucius rushes at
text: Conan, only for Conan to duck under his attack and --
dialog: 
text: THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising
text: up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a
dialog: crisp.
dialog: 
text: Corin fights Ukafa to a standstill, until Remo emerges from
text: the shadows behind him and drives a short sword into his
dialog: back.
dialog: 
text: Corin falls to his knees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Lucius delivers a massive backhand, sending Conan flying
text: backwards -- and demolishing one of the Forge's main support
text: beams.
dialog: 
text: Half of the forge comes crashing down on top of Conan,
text: pinning his bleeding form to the ground, just a few feet from
text: his fallen father.
dialog: 
text: Enraged, Lucius turns his anger to Corin, raising his sword
text: to deliver the killing blow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
dialog: I said I wanted a word with him.
dialog: 
text: Lucius stays his hand as Khalar Singh steps into the forge.
text: Beside him stands the PICT who escaped from Conan earlier,
text: grinning from ear to ear.
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh hands him a bag of gold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: As promised.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PICT
dialog: (strange dialect -
speaker_heading: SUBTITLED)
dialog: Their heads. You promised me their
dialog: heads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: All you wish, once we are gone.
dialog: 
text: The Pict nods and heads off, drawing his knife. Khalar Singh

speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: I take no pleasure in this day,
dialog: barbarian. Your people are fierce
dialog: warriors, deserving of every story
dialog: told of them. But now you must
dialog: choose the story for yourself. I am
dialog: Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked
dialog: from the best Hyboria. My second,
text: Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo
dialog: and his Shadow Scouts from the
dialog: jungles of Zingara. And countless
dialog: others. They all had a day like
dialog: this one. They all chose a way
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
text: Into the forge walks Cherin and Akhun. The lieutenants stand
text: behind Corin, eyeing Corin with malice.
dialog: 
text: Corin catches a glimpse of Conan, buried but staring back at
text: him, unable to move. Corin quickly turns away, careful not to
dialog: give his son away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: What is it you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: I seek neither gold nor steel, but
text: flesh and blood. The last of a
dialog: royal line that goes back three
dialog: thousand years.
dialog: 
text: Corin LAUGHS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Royalty in Cimmeria? Never. Each
dialog: man is free here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: But I seek a woman.
dialog: 
text: Khalar looks outside the door of the forge. The Cimmerians
text: women are being herded by the slavers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
text: A queen in hiding. Point her out
dialog: and you'll spare the lives of your
dialog: own. Perhaps even your wife?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: My wife was killed, long ago, by
dialog: swine such as you.
dialog: 
text: Khalar nods, understanding.
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Then our stories began in the same
dialog: place, Cimmerian. I too lost my
dialog: wife to marauders. How many men, in
dialog: how many lands have suffered so?
dialog: The only answer is power, strength
dialog: unfettered, the kind of which can
dialog: unite all Hyboria under a single
dialog: crown. That is the legacy I seek.
dialog: Will you join me?
dialog: 
text: It's a powerful, convincing speech. But Corin holds his
text: tongue, unmoved.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Very well. Then death will be your
dialog: story. Your men will die. And your
dialog: women too, when I am done with
dialog: them. None will survive to carry
dialog: your name forth, and over time,
dialog: even your enemies will forget you
dialog: ever were. You will be wiped from
dialog: the pages of history.
dialog: (to his men)
dialog: Take your blood, but leave the
dialog: kill.
dialog: 
text: One by one, the lieutenants beat and stab Corin, taking
text: pleasure in his pain.
dialog: 
text: Conan struggles, trying to move, to yell, to do anything
text: other than lie there. But a huge timber lies upon his back,
text: pinning him to the ground.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Fariq! Come!
dialog: 
text: Entering the wrecked forge is FARIQ, the six year old son to
text: Khalar Singh. He stares at Corin's bleeding form with the
text: dispassion of a sociopath.
dialog: 
text: Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged
text: together, the one Corin took away. He admires it, then hands
text: it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for
text: his son to lift alone. He instructs his son as if teaching
dialog: him multiplication.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Before you lies our enemy. His
text: tribe waits for him in the beyond.
dialog: What would you do?
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: I would cut out his eyes, father,
dialog: so that he will not find them. So
dialog: he will wander the afterlife
dialog: forever.
dialog: 
text: Khalar smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Show me your strength, Fariq.
dialog: Without it, you will never rule.
dialog: With it, you will never be
dialog: forgotten.
dialog: 
text: Fariq DRIVES THE SWORD INTO CORIN'S EYE. Corin doesn't make a
text: sound. Once Fariq has ripped out Corin's eyes, Khalar runs
text: Corin through.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: You have your desire. Death has
dialog: found you.
dialog: 
text: Corin spits out his last words, also meant for Conan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Soon -- it comes for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN'S POV
dialog: 
text: Conan glimpses around the faces of Khalar and his men, each
text: image seared into his memory as if ablaze.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Burn this place. It no longer
dialog: exists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The forge is lit afire from a half dozen torches, thrown onto
text: its roof and inside its windows. Khalar and the other watch
text: as the building roars into flame.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Smoke fills the air. Conan struggles, still unable to move.
text: He COUGHS, dying.
dialog: 
text: But then the fire collapses more of the forge, and the
text: falling beams shatter the one that pins Conan to the ground.
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Slowly, painfully, Conan drags himself into the cooling
text: trough that runs beneath the hut.
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Conan exits the forge only to see the entire village burning.
text: The bodies of everyone he has ever known litter the
text: landscape. Nothing stirs. Until he hears a strange CHOPPING
speaker_heading: SOUND.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE PICT
dialog: 
text: Conan spots the Pict, who is decapitating a dead Cimmerian
text: warrior, adding to the collection of heads at his tattooed
dialog: waist.
dialog: 
text: The Pict doesn't notice as Conan slips up behind him, then
text: RUNS HIM THROUGH.
dialog: 
text: As the wide-eyed Pict dies, Conan takes the sword and CUTS A
text: NOTCH into his arm.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NOTCHED ARM
dialog: 
dialog: Where there was once a single notch, there are now FIVE such
text: notches, on a much broader arm that struggles to pin another
text: powerful looking arm.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR - MESSANTIA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront. Out the window we
text: see a port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush.
dialog: 
text: The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants of
dialog: those ships, and those who desire to part them from their
text: hard-earned money; Zamoran thieves, Hyborean mercenaries and
text: Brythunian whores. Most of them watch the arm wrestling match
text: taking place at the back of the bar.
dialog: 
text: A pair of CITY GUARDS, short swords sheathed at their sides,
text: enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by the
text: harried BARKEEP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARKEEP
text: He's back there.
dialog: 
text: The barkeep motion to the arm wrestlers.
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CITY GUARD #1
dialog: What's this one done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARKEEP
dialog: What's he done?! What hasn't he
dialog: done? He's bedded six of my whores
dialog: and finished off three casks of
dialog: mead--and he hasn't paid so much as
text: a silver piece for it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CITY GUARD #1
dialog: So have your men deal with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARKEEP
dialog: I did.
dialog: 
text: Behind the bar, six men each hold down two HULKING MEN
text: YELLING in agony as their horribly broken arms are snapped
text: back into place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CITY GUARD #2
dialog: Sounds like a real problem. Too bad
dialog: we have other places to be right
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: The Barkeep shakes his head, knowing the routine. He slips a
text: pair of silver pieces into the soldier's hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BARKEEP
dialog: Just get that behemoth out of here.
dialog: 
text: The two City Guards make their way to the back of the bar.
text: His back to them, the DRUNKEN MAN they're after struggles to
text: pin his opponent, cobras beneath each of their wrists, ready
text: to strike at the loser. A pair of voluptuous WHORES watch,
text: caressing the Drunken Man's sinewy back.
dialog: 
text: The Drunken Man YELLS in fury as he SLAMS the other man's
text: hand down upon the cobra, which immediately bites its prey.
dialog: 
text: As the soldiers arrive, the drunken victor throws his tankard
text: of ale at the Barkeep, who's now back behind the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DRUNKEN MAN
dialog: Piss-water! You'll serve my friends
dialog: and I your best, barman, or you'll
dialog: taste steel!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CITY GUARD #1
dialog: Time to leave, northerner.
dialog: 
text: The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on his
dialog: shoulder.
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a powerfully
text: built man, broad-shouldered with sun browned skin lined with
text: battle scars. Only the piercing blue eyes and square cut
text: black mane remain from the boy we last saw.
dialog: 
text: Conan stands to his full height, looming over the smaller
text: City Guards, who instinctively take a step back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: No, my small friends. It's time to
dialog: die. Now--
dialog: 
text: Conan sways. The room spins. He falls on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's first --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Conan, unconscious, is dragged down the street by the two
dialog: City Guards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CITY GUARD #1
speaker_heading: (STRUGGLING)
dialog: By the gods, he's as heavy as a
dialog: horse.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CITY GUARD #2
text: Even a dead horse smells better
dialog: than this.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The City Guards drag Conan into a broad prison yard. Many of
text: the INMATES are shackled together, hacking with picks at the
text: rock walls on their work detail. Those in no condition to
text: break rock are left in their own filth to rot. Some are even
text: dead already, the rats gnawing at the remains.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PRISON GUARDHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The two City Guards drag Conan into the guardhouse, where a
text: LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner.
dialog: 
text: The Lieutenant doesn't even bother to look up from his meal.
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: What's the charge?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CITY GUARD #2
dialog: Public drunkenness. Another damn
dialog: hill ape who can't handle his
dialog: liquor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: Is that so, boy? How do you plead?
dialog: 
text: Conan yawns in response. One of the City Guards slaps Conan,
text: hard, across the face. Conan slowly opens his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Where's the Captain of the Guard?
dialog: 
text: SCREAMS OF PAIN come from down the hall, past a locked door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
text: In the cells, interrogating a
dialog: prisoner. And you'll get the same
dialog: if you don't answer. You're accused
dialog: of public drunkenness. How do you
dialog: plead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: In truth, I've been guilty of much.
text: Jewels stolen from the crowns of
text: kings, men's heads split in battle
dialog: for the price of a night's drink.
dialog: But through that I've searched and
dialog: waited and hunted my prey.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Conan shifts upright, looking more sober than he did
dialog: a moment ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But drink? Haven't had a drop all
dialog: night.
dialog: 
text: The guards holding Conan up by his arms, suddenly find those
text: arms wrapped around their heads. Twist, twist. SNAP. SNAP. He
text: breaks both their necks in an instant.
dialog: 
text: The Lieutenant is horrified. He goes for his sword. Conan
text: bats it out of his hand, slamming his head against the back
dialog: wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
text: The key to the cells.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: I don't have it. There's a guard
text: inside the door. Only he can open
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Conan picks up the Lieutenant's sword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
dialog: You can't kill me! He'll only open
dialog: the door for me!
dialog: 
text: A FLASH OF STEEL as Conan delivers a blow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CELLS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door. Behind
text: him, the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained ONE-EYED
text: PRISONER to a pulpy mess.
dialog: 
text: There's a KNOCK at the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MUFFLED VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Need to see the Captain.
dialog: 
text: The Guard exhales, frustrated. He stands up, getting his keys
text: out. He stops. Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into the other
dialog: room.
dialog: 
text: The Lieutenant stares back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Fine, fine.
dialog: 
text: He opens the door--
dialog: 
text: Only to see Conan standing there, holding the decapitated
dialog: head of the Lieutenant.
dialog: 
text: The shocked Guard goes for his sword. Conan swings the
text: Lieutenant's head, smashing it into the Guard's jaw and
text: putting him down for the count.
dialog: 
text: That's when the Captain of the Guard turns around. And WE
text: RECOGNIZE HIM! He's LUCIUS, the disfigured Aquilionian who
dialog: was one of Khalar Singh's lieutenants.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Men!
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: From around a corner come five more Guards, drawing their
text: weapons. Lucius draws his as well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You've made a huge mistake, ape.
dialog: You'll never make it out of this
dialog: place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I came for you, Lucius.
dialog: 
text: Lucius nods to the guards, who advance on Conan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: You talk as though you know me,
dialog: ape.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I do. And I am no ape. I am
dialog: Cimmerian.
dialog: 
text: As recognition crosses Lucius' face, Conan springs into
text: action. He KICKS the table at the men, sending the knives and
text: other torture implements flying right into the first guard.
dialog: 
text: The second guard tries leaping over the falling table. Conan
text: just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster into the
text: iron bands of the prisoner cells.
dialog: 
text: Lucius lunges at Conan, Conan steps in on him, grabbing his
text: sword hand. In a show of strength, he twists Lucius' own
text: sword until points down at the floor, then THRUSTS IT THROUGH
text: LUCIUS' FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW.
dialog: 
text: Lucius BELLOWS in pain, pinned to the spot.
dialog: 
text: The next three Guards rush forward, forcing Conan to deal
text: with three weapons attacks at once.
dialog: 
text: The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps around
text: Conan's sword and he tries to yank it free from Conan's grip.
text: Instead, Conan pulls him in a wide circle, sending him flying
text: into a wall-mounted torch. The guard burns like dry kindling.
dialog: 
text: The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand, carving a
text: deep gash and causing him to drop his sword.
dialog: 
text: Conan turns to face him, eyes filled with rage. The guard's
text: face goes pale. Conan head butts him with all his might and
text: the guard goes down, bleeding from mouth, nose and ears.
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: However, the last Guard is upon Conan before he can react.
text: The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax to lift
text: Conan off his feet and back against the far wall, pinned by
dialog: the neck.
dialog: 
text: Conan struggles to breathe, the polearm shaft driving his
text: throat into the wall. The thickness of the Cimmerian's neck
text: gives him time to reach into his bracer, pulling out a hidden
text: knife which he buries into the Guardsman's eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the burning
text: guard, and lifts the table back onto its legs. Then he pulls
text: the sword out of the floor, a thick plume of blood rising out
text: of Lucius' now liberated foot.
dialog: 
text: Conan takes Lucius' face and smashes it against the table.
text: Lucius looks, aghast, as Conan takes his injured hand and
text: places it over the torch flame, searing the wound closed. The
text: Cimmerian never even bats an eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: What do you want? Who are you?
dialog: 
text: Conan turns his face to the burnt side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I'm the one who made you pretty.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Impossible! You're dead!
dialog: 
text: Conan shows Lucius the FIVE SCARS running down his forearm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: No. I am death. And I came a long
dialog: way for you.
dialog: 
text: Conan lifts the sword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Wait!! Wait!!
speaker_heading: (CONAN PAUSES)
dialog: I can tell you where the rest are.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Where?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: The end of the earth. You kill me,
dialog: and you'll never find them.
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Who are you offering?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Who do you think? All of them.
text: Ukafa, Remo, Cheren, Akhun -- and
dialog: Khalar Singh himself. But you have
dialog: to swear you won't kill me.
dialog: 
text: Conan thinks about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You have my word. You tell me where
dialog: I will find Khalar Singh, and I
dialog: will not kill you.
dialog: 
text: Conan lets Lucius go. Lucius hobbles to his chair.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
text: He is in a city called on the edge
text: of the Eastern Sea. On the edge of
dialog: Hyboria. Khor Khalba.
dialog: 
text: Conan looks him in his eyes, sizing him up. He likes what he
text: sees. In a flash, Conan grabs Lucius' head again, yanking it
text: back, exposing his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS (CONT'D)
dialog: You gave your word!
dialog: 
text: Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring. He drops it in
text: Lucius' throat. The big man chokes instantly. A second later,
text: Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as well.
dialog: 
text: Lucius swallows the key, gasping for breath as Conan releases
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Toasting, to our deal.
dialog: 
text: Conan swings his sword and cuts the One Eyed Prisoner from
text: the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Go. You are free.
dialog: 
text: One-Eye looks at his wrists and ankles, still hobbled by
text: shackles.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ONE-EYED PRISONER
dialog: I won't get far like this.
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Conan hands him a fallen Guardsmen's sword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: The key to your shackles sits in
text: the Captain's gut. Happy hunting.
dialog: 
text: The One-Eyed Prisoner grins with malice. As he closes in on
text: the terrified Lucius, Conan heads for the door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCIUS
dialog: Barbarian! I had your word! You
dialog: said you would spare my life!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: No. I said I wouldn't kill you.
dialog: 
text: We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into the
text: night, cutting another notch into his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT SANDSTORM - DAY
dialog: 
text: KHALAR SINGH looks older. Worn. He squints as he stares into
text: a howling sandstorm.
dialog: 
text: UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him. The
text: sandstorm is so blinding we don't see him until he is less
text: than five feet away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: Khalar Singh, we've lost half our
dialog: cavalry legion, and still Fariq
dialog: presses on! We must turn back!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: He says the Queen is here.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
text: He leads us in circles. He knows
dialog: nothing of leading an army --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Take care, Ukafa. You hold a
dialog: special place in my kingdom, but
dialog: blood you are not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: My apologies, Khalar Singh. I am
dialog: simply concerned for your army.
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: And I would gladly sacrifice every
dialog: last man to get my hands on the
dialog: Queen. And in that respect, Fariq
dialog: has my confidence. He knows more of
dialog: the legends of Acheron than anyone.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, two forms race at them from the blinding sand. REMO
text: and FARIQ. No longer a child, Fariq is now a man in his
text: twenties, but he is hardly the strong warrior his father is.
text: His frame is slight, his eyes beady.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: Father, they are here! The hidden
text: oasis, just as it was written.
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh looks to Remo for confirmation. The misshapen
text: and shadowy Remo nods.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE TUNNEL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Remo and Fariq lead Khalar and Ukafa into a natural tunnel
text: carved out of rock. Inside, the sandstorm no longer rages.
dialog: 
text: And on the other side of the tunnel --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OASIS - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: A protected rock oasis, heavy vegetation crawling up the
text: encircling cliff walls, herds of sheep grazing on fields of
text: grass. At its far end, beyond a deep blue pond, lies a Greek-
text: influenced monastery and several tiled-roof, mud-brick
dialog: houses.
dialog: 
text: And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going about
text: their simple chores. They wear long flowing white linen robes
text: and turbans.
dialog: 
text: The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter of
text: the oasis. But beyond it, the sandstorm rages all around,
text: sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the air, swirling
text: around the oasis as though it were the eye of some mystical
text: hurricane, protected by an unseen force.
dialog: 
text: A row of robed YOUNG WOMEN kneel in front of one of the
text: reflecting pools, quietly reading from prayer books and
text: softly striking their right breast with a left hands wrapped
text: in thorns.
dialog: 
text: One girl, ILIRA, mischievously taps the shoulder of the girl
text: next to her with her thorn. The girl, TAMARA, squeals in
text: pain, angry her prayer was interrupted.
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ilira is the fun-loving dilettante of the relationship.
dialog: Tamara the studious good girl.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Stop it! I'm trying to pray!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ILIRA
dialog: I'm bored.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Then hit yourself.
dialog: 
text: Tamara hits Ilira back with her thorn. Ilira SQUEALS, then
text: hits a grinning Tamara back. Tamara grabs her, but as they
speaker_heading: TUSSLE--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR (O.S.)
dialog: Is that how one shows penitence?
dialog: 
text: Both girls instantly stop as FASSIR appears behind them.
text: Fassir is an elder monk and leader of the monastery. He
text: shakes his head, both out of fondness and disappointment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR (CONT'D)
dialog: I expect more from a queen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ILIRA
dialog: I'm sorry, Fassir. I just tire of
dialog: saying the same prayer every day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR
dialog: Then you should be able to
dialog: translate it from its original
dialog: Acheronian.
dialog: 
text: Ilira's face scrunches, unsure. Tamara steps in to help Ilira
dialog: save face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Of course she can. She even taught
dialog: it to me. "Never again."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR
dialog: Go on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Never again will we stand by as
dialog: darkness consumes the world. Never
dialog: again will innocents suffer for
dialog: others' power. Never again will the
dialog: Queen suffer so Acheron may rise.
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR
dialog: Very good, Tamara. You must have
dialog: taught her very well indeed, Ilira.
dialog: 
text: A smile on Fassir's face confirms he knows the truth.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, the monastery's BELL RINGS OUT. A moment later, a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHAOS
dialog: 
text: The monks scatter in every direction, but wherever they turn,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR (CONT'D)
dialog: The Queen must not be captured.
dialog: Take her out the North Gate.
dialog: Quickly!
dialog: 
text: Tamara grabs Ilira and pulls her through the flaming

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ILIRA
dialog: We can't leave them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: If you are caught, everything we
dialog: live for is lost!
dialog: 
text: WHIP! A whip encircles Ilira's waist. A massive TURANIAN
text: pulls her to him. Tamara grabs the whip, pulling Ilira the
text: other way. But she is no match for the huge slaver. He yanks
text: on the whip pulling both of them to him --
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Only then does he notice Tamara's unsheathed knife which she

scene_heading: INT. NORTH PASSAGE - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Tamara and Ilira run for the gate, only for the shadows of
text: the alleyway to move and shift -- REMO and three of his
dialog: shadow scouts.
dialog: 
text: They advance on the women, drawing dark shortswords.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
text: No swords. Khalar needs them alive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Good to know.
dialog: 
text: Tamara lunges for the nearest shadow scout with her knife,
text: but when she strikes, she hits nothing but shadow. It reforms
text: behind her and grabs her.
dialog: 
text: Another grabs Ilira. Tamara launches her body into the air,
text: executing a backflip that puts her behind the shadow scout. A
text: quick knife strike and he goes down.
dialog: 
text: And with one continuous motion, she vaults over the shadow
text: scout holding Tamara, cutting his throat as well.
dialog: 
text: Remo and the remaining scout give chase, blending in and out
text: of shadows. But each time they strike, Tamara defends Ilira.
text: They near the far end of the alleyway, the North gate looming
text: ahead with the desert beyond.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. MAN OF WAR - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Remo materializes out of a shadow atop the Man Of War, next

dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: The north gate. Destroy it.
dialog: 
text: Cheren and the other archers turn their fire to the gate at
text: the end of the passage. They fire a volley of fiery arrows.
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. NORTH GATE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Tamara and Ilira run for the whirling sands just ahead --
text: when the flaming arrows land before them.
dialog: 
text: Ilira hesitates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Run!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ILIRA
dialog: We'll die!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: We'll die if we stay!
dialog: 
text: She locks eyes with Ilira, who nods. Together they run right
dialog: for the arrows.
dialog: 
text: But at the last minute, Ilira falters. She falls to the
dialog: ground.
dialog: 
text: Tamara turns to see Ilira lying in the gateway a moment too
dialog: late.
dialog: 
text: THE ARROWS EXPLODE causing a cave in that closes the gateway.

scene_heading: EXT. SANDSTORM - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tamara stumbles through a stretch of barren wasteland, the
text: plumes of the oasis' sandstorm now off in the distance behind
dialog: her.
dialog: 
text: The sun mercilessly beats down upon her face, her lips are
text: already chapped. She falls to her knees, unable to go on.
dialog: 
text: She looks up, as the heat streams off the desert floor,
text: creating a swirling mirage. Through which the silhouette of a
text: rider appears, followed by others.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAVER CARAVAN
dialog: 
text: The horse-drawn carts of the caravan are lined with iron
text: bars, and behind the bars are a bevy of young women, mostly

dialog: 
text: The HEAD SLAVER rides ahead, and walks up to the heap of
text: white cloth that is Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Water -- please --
dialog: 
text: He lifts her barely conscious head, eyeing her features, a
text: greasy paw examining her body. He smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEAD SLAVER
dialog: The gods are good.

scene_heading: EXT. OASIS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The Man of War dominates the center of the oasis, its torches

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: All these years searching the ends
dialog: of the earth. And here you are.
dialog: Just a two day ride from Khor
dialog: Kalba. I can scarcely believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR
dialog: (in Acheronian, to monks)
dialog: Say nothing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
speaker_heading: (IN ACHERONIAN)
dialog: Yes. Say nothing. Maybe he doesn't
dialog: know who we are. Maybe he's not
dialog: looking for the Queen.
dialog: 
text: Several of the women look up at him, shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: That's right, my brethren, you have
dialog: been lied to all your lives. Told
dialog: you must hide yourselves, told you
dialog: were alone. I want you to look at
dialog: me, and see me for what I am. A
dialog: brother. A friend. I have come not
dialog: to hurt you, but liberate you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR
dialog: You come for your own dark
dialog: purposes, to raise Acheron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Yes. I come to resurrect the
dialog: greatest empire Hyboria has ever
dialog: known.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR
text: An empire of evil, soaked in blood
dialog: sacrifice and the blackest of
dialog: magic.
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh becomes infuriated, eyes blazing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Have you hidden from the world so
dialog: long that you cannot to see? Blood,
dialog: magic, death: it is everywhere.
dialog: Acheron is no different than any
dialog: other kingdom, but for its glory.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: And in place of that glory, you
dialog: offer shame? I knew shame, but that
dialog: was before I was shown my true
dialog: lineage.
dialog: 
text: Khalar draws closer to the women, looking them each in the
dialog: eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: When I was but a child, raiders
dialog: destroyed my village, cut our
dialog: fathers to ribbons, and burned our
dialog: women as sacrifice to foreign gods.
dialog: Those few who survived, we ran for
dialog: our lives, chased into caves at the
text: edge of the Eastern Sea, left with
dialog: nothing to live for. But then we
dialog: discovered it. Acheron. The temple
dialog: that spawned an empire. We learned
dialog: that we were not broken goat-
text: herders on a desolate coastline. We
dialog: were the sons and daughters of
dialog: kings.
text: (stares in Ilira's eyes)
dialog: And queens.
dialog: 
text: He motions to Fariq, who brings the iron box forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: For thirty years I have searched
dialog: for you. In that time I built both
text: an army and empire, but they are
dialog: nothing compared to what we can
dialog: create together. We can raise
dialog: Acheron again. Never again will we
dialog: hide like rats. Never again will we
dialog: watch as our loved ones are
dialog: slaughtered. I call forth the
dialog: Queen. Stand and join me, and this
dialog: day will have a joyous end.
dialog: 
text: No one moves.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FASSIR
dialog: You would have all the world
dialog: suffer, as you have suffered. We
dialog: will die before we help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Yes. You will.
dialog: 
text: He nods to his son. He paces in front of the female monks,
text: the box in front of them.
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
text: The caves beneath Khor Khalba
dialog: contain all manner of creature,
dialog: many -- altered -- by centuries of
dialog: blood magic. But one, in
dialog: particular, has developed a special
dialog: connection to the blood. A thirst.
dialog: It is said that only the Queen of
dialog: Acheron itself can resist its
dialog: embrace.
dialog: 
text: He stops, one woman away from Ilira.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: So what say you? Will you be the
dialog: lucky one, or will you tell me who
dialog: is?
dialog: 
text: A tear falls down her face, but she stays silent. There's the
text: sound of SLITHERING as Fariq opens the box. She stares down
dialog: inside the box --
dialog: 
text: AND SCREAMS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: She awakens to the SCREAMING of a whipped SLAVE GIRL.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Tamara's eyes are met by a dozen others, SLAVES of every
text: color, chained together with her in a CAGED WAGON. The SLAVE
text: TRADER swings his whip twice more, hitting the cowering women
text: in the cage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAVE TRADER
text: Wake up, slags! Smile! A new owner
dialog: approaches!
dialog: 
text: Tamara makes eye contact with the Slave Trader.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Let me go. I promise you'll be
dialog: rewarded.
dialog: 
text: The Trader just laughs, leering at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAVE TRADER
dialog: And I would sample that reward,
dialog: fair one, but you wear white.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell me, have the stars aligned and
dialog: delivered a virgin slave into my

dialog: 
text: He eyes her lasciviously. Tamara turns away and does not
dialog: answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAVE TRADER (CONT'D)
dialog: No matter. I'll know soon enough.
speaker_heading: (TURNS AWAY)
dialog: Good day, sir! A lone rider in a
text: desolate land. The perfect customer
dialog: for what I sell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Rides out of the sun, his massive form silhouetted by the
text: bright desert sky. He stares at the slave wagons.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SHEMISH WOMAN
dialog: Please, master! Your gold can free
dialog: me from this hole! I can bring you
speaker_heading: PLEASURE--
dialog: 
text: The Slave Trader immediately WHIPS her, incensed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAVE TRADER
dialog: Silence whore!
dialog: 
text: The Slaver goes to whip her again, but before the blow can
text: fall, Conan grabs his arm. The Slave Trader looks furious,
text: but Conan's size holds him back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Khor Kalba. Which way?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SLAVE TRADER
dialog: This is the road to Khor Kalba.
text: Ahead. Past the Great Wall.
dialog: 
text: The Slaver nods to the east and Conan releases his arm.
dialog: 
text: The Slaver continues whipping the slave. Conan just rides on -
dialog: - not his problem.
dialog: 
text: But as Conan passes Tamara, for a brief moment their eyes
text: meet. Something about her. Conan stares a moment, then spurs
text: his horse on.
dialog: 
text: Just then, the ground around them RUMBLES. Horses rear, the
text: women SCREAM. Conan turns and looks up. His eyes go wide.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ENORMOUS BOULDERS
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Coming thundering down the hills on all sides. The SLAVERS
text: see them a moment to late.
dialog: 
text: SLAM. Several of the horses and carts are smashed by the
text: rolling boulders.
dialog: 
text: Conan kicks his horse, trying to outrace the boulders. But
text: when the wagon next to him is hit, its axle spears his horse
text: in its side, and Conan goes down.
dialog: 
text: Pissed, he draws his sword. The Slavers scramble around the
text: broken wagons, in chaos.
dialog: 
text: Only a pair of wagons still stands. One of them holds Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Use your whips on the horses' legs!
dialog: 
text: The Slavers are confused. Then they notice
dialog: 
scene_heading: TURANIAN HORSEMEN
dialog: 
text: racing down the hill, behind the boulders.
dialog: 
text: As the riders bear down upon the slavers, the Slavers do as
text: they're told, entangling the legs of the first wave of
text: horses, throwing their riders.
dialog: 
text: More than a few riders SNAP their necks as they're driven
text: into the desert floor. The remainder fight hand to hand, and
text: are cut down by either Conan's blade or the slavers' tulwars.
dialog: But their victory is short lived --
dialog: 
text: As a SECOND WAVE OF RIDERS comes thundering towards them,
text: before the Slavers can re-establish their perimeter. The
text: riders start cutting the slavers down where they stand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Conan lodges his sword in a still-rolling boulder. As it
text: rolls, it pulls him up on top of it. From this height, Conan
text: launches himself down at the horsemen below.
dialog: 
text: WHAM! He knocks a rider off his horse, Conan landing square
text: in the saddle. He kicks the horse straight at the other
text: riders. They don't see him coming until it's too late. He
text: cuts them down where they sit.
dialog: 
text: The last remaining CARAVAN DRIVER whips his horse team,
text: trying to pull his wagon out of the fight. Conan spins to see
text: a FLASH of steel and the rider's neck plumes in blood as he's
text: decapitated.
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Which is strange since the cavalry are nowhere near the
dialog: wagon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: 
text: The explanation comes as the shadow behind the driver MORPHS
text: into Remo, the spindly Shadow Scout. He takes the reins,
text: stopping the wagon.
dialog: 
text: Conan spots him, recognition in his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You!
dialog: 
text: There's a SCREAM. Conan turns to see the other two SHADOW
text: SCOUTS already hacking their way through the slaves on one of
text: the caged wagons. A Shadow Scout gets to Tamara, only to have
text: her FIGHT BACK.
dialog: 
text: Tamara kicks the first Scout in the face, slamming his head
text: into the bars. However, the second one clubs her unconscious
text: from behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Leaps from his horse, launching his body at Remo. Remo dives
text: and rolls away. Small and misshapen, he is nonetheless very
dialog: fast.
dialog: 
text: Conan strikes again. Again Remo dodges out of the way.
dialog: 
text: The Shadow Scouts draw swords, but Remo waves them off,
text: speaking in the broken language of a savage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: The girl! Bring her to Khalar!
dialog: 
text: Conan launches an all out attack. Remo leaps over his sword
text: and vaults Conan, landing on his back. He draws his sword,
text: preparing to cut Conan's throat --
dialog: 
text: When Conan hurls his body backwards, into one of the huge
text: rolling boulders. The impact crushes Remo and he loses his
dialog: grip.
dialog: 
text: Conan spins to strike again, only to see Remo MELT INTO THE
text: SHADOW OF THE BOULDER.
dialog: 
text: Conan turns his attention towards the other two Shadow Scouts
text: as they drag the unconscious Tamara away.
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Conan mounts one of the cavalry horses and gallops towards
text: the Scouts. They see him coming and let go of Tamara. THEY
text: MELT AWAY INTO HER SHADOW AND DISAPPEAR.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: Dazed, she struggles to her feet. Conan appears beside her,
text: his dagger out. Tamara gasps in fear but Conan only reaches
text: out and breaks the lock on her chains.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Who are you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I am nobody.
dialog: 
text: He cuts the bonds on her feet. Tamara rises up, the battle
text: scene revealed to her.
dialog: 
text: Dead bodies of the Slavers and Turanian horsemen lie sprawled
text: in every direction. Tamara takes in the gruesome sight,
text: shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Many died to capture nobody.
dialog: (motions to his horse)
dialog: Get up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: And if I don't wish to ride with
dialog: you?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Conan rides his horse, Tamara trailing on foot, wrists
text: tethered to Conan's saddle by a long rope. Tamara looks

dialog: 
text: They reach a gallery of broken columns, spires of fossilized
text: coral that juts out of the desert.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Stop! I want water.
dialog: 
text: Conan just keeps riding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Perhaps the slavers took your
dialog: orders. I don't.
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I never knew men could be so cruel.
dialog: Now I wonder if the world is filled
dialog: with animals such as you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You speak of animals as if they
dialog: were less than men. But animals
dialog: don't stab their brothers in the
dialog: back or steal their mother's only
dialog: possession. And they never lie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I haven't lied.
dialog: 
text: Conan get off his horse, unties Tamara and gives her a water
text: sack. Tamara greedily drinks down the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Very well. Give me your name.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I am Tamara Amelia Karushan. And
dialog: you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I am Conan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Conan? That's it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: What more names do I need?
dialog: 
text: Conan then grabs Tamara around her waist, putting her atop
text: his horse. He then mounts behind her, their bodies close.
text: Conan's mouth is only inches from her ear as he speaks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: There is only one truth I need from
dialog: you, Tamara Amelia Karushan. Why
dialog: does Khalar Singh want you?
dialog: 
text: Tamara looks away, but doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Then let's hope it's for your

scene_heading: EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: A campfire amidst several large boulders, a line of windmills

text: comes over and smells the pot; his face scrunches from the
dialog: odor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Trying to poison me?
dialog: 
text: Tamara steps back and gets down on her knees, her hands
dialog: clasped.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Before we eat, I must pray.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Crom! What would you pray for? That
dialog: a bone may not get stuck in your
dialog: throat? No words nor gods will give
dialog: you one more moment than fate
dialog: allows you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Then you have no faith. And I am
dialog: sorry for you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I need no pity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: But you do. You live in a world
dialog: that is harsh and short. Where fate
dialog: is unyielding and hope is a cruel
dialog: joke. I live in a world with a
dialog: purpose that guides me, where faith
dialog: sustains me.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Conan KICKS DIRT PAST TAMARA, ONTO THE FIRE. The
text: fire goes out, plunging everything into darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Why did you--
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, there's the sound of FIGHTING. Grunting, blows
text: being interchanged, then a LOUD SNAP AS BONES ARE BROKEN.
dialog: 
text: A moment later, the flames of the fire are stoked up again,
text: revealing Conan standing over the groaning REMO. The other
text: two SHADOW SCOUTS are dead.
dialog: 
text: Tamara instinctively jumps back.
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Don't worry. His back is broken. He
dialog: won't be slinking away this time.
dialog: 
text: As Tamara gapes at Remo, Conan simply pulls the cooking pot
text: off the fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now, let's eat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: But -- what about him?!

scene_heading: BENEATH IT--
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ACHERON - NIGHT - MOVING

dialog: 
text: We GLIDE DOWN past hundred foot high pillars of flames,

dialog:

scene_heading: ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Only the red irises of their eyes peer through. That and

text: splashing in streams of BLOOD which flow from the
dialog: 
scene_heading: ACHERONIAN PYRAMID
dialog: 
text: Up ahead looms a colossal pyramid, surrounded in a semi-

text: CROWN PIERCING THE WOMAN'S FOREHEAD, HER SCREAMS ECHOES
text: THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
dialog: 
text: Blood streams down the woman's face as she turns toward the
text: torchlight.
dialog: 
text: IT IS TAMARA.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tamara leaps up, startled. Her face is covered in sweat, her
text: eyes as terrified as the victim from her dream.
dialog: 
text: Nearby we hear screaming of another type. Remo.
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: MUFFLED SCREAMS. We pull out of Remo's wide mouth, stuffed
text: with cloth, trying to bellow in uncontrollable agony.
dialog: 
text: A hand comes in and pulls out the cloth. It's Conan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: Please! Mercy!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You are more fit to inflict torture
dialog: than to endure it. Your life is not
dialog: nailed to your spine as my peoples
dialog: are.
dialog: 
text: We PULL OUT, revealing that Remo arms are spread-eagle,
text: attached to ropes pulled taught by opposing tree limbs.
dialog: 
text: Conan nudges him with the point of his sword. Remo SCREAMS in
text: agony, then speaks in his savage, broken dialect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: Stop! Stop! I know how make you
dialog: rich! Rich! You hear name Khalar
dialog: Singh? You have what he want. The
dialog: girl, yes? Khalar give you anything
dialog: for her. More!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Why would he?
dialog: 
text: Remo pauses, not wanting to answer. Conan put the blade back
text: to Remo's neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: She could be the one.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: One what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: The one. The Queen.
dialog: 
text: Conan's mind races, remembering Khalar's words from long ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
text: A queen in hiding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: Yes! Yes! I sent to find her. Bring
dialog: her. He wait for me now, at Great
dialog: Wall. He pay you anything. More!
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: So I should ransom her to your
dialog: master? Not exactly loyal -- but
dialog: still, a good idea.
dialog: 
text: Conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper from Remo's
dialog: tunic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll help me deliver it.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Torchlight dots the heights of a fifty-foot high stone wall,
text: erected between giant rock formations, an impassable barrier
text: that runs countless miles.
dialog: 
text: The wreckage of old siege equipment dots the hillside before
text: the wall.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CATAPULT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: An aging catapult looks down upon the wall below. Slowly, it
text: begins to turn.
dialog: 
text: Conan pushes the catapult until it aims towards the Great
dialog: Wall.
dialog: 
text: We hear MUFFLED SCREAMS, and find Remo tied to a boulder
text: cradled in the catapult. Conan pulls the gag out of Remo's
dialog: mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REMO
dialog: Please! Please! I help you! I do
dialog: anything you wish!
dialog: 
text: Conan stuffs a parchment in his mouth. He takes out his sword
text: and cuts another NOTCH into his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Good. Die.
dialog: 
text: He then cuts the rope and WHOOSH! The catapult fires tossing
text: Remo and the rock he's tied to high into the night sky.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GREAT WALL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: BOOM! Patrolling SOLDIERS are crushed beneath the massive

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: KHALAR
dialog: 
text: Stares down at Remo's broken body. Ukafa and Fariq stand

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: He brought a message?
dialog: 
text: Ukafa hands him the bloodied parchment. Khalar reads it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Gold, for the girl. A ransom, for
dialog: me to deliver in person.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: I'll find them -- and come back
text: with their heads.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: You let the girl escape once,
dialog: Ukafa. What makes you think you can
dialog: do better now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: I did what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: I found the monastery. It was my
dialog: understanding that you were in
dialog: charge of its capture --
dialog: 
text: Ukafa's anger grows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Enough! We will take no chances. We
dialog: will pay this thief what he wants,
dialog: and more.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BRIDGE TO NOWHERE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Conan returns from the nearby hills, carrying a pair of
text: rabbits he's hunted and skinned.
dialog: 
text: He looks around, surprised not to find Tamara. He hears a
text: yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the
dialog: clearing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: She's tied up and gagged and she's wormed her way this far,
text: muddying and scraping herself all along the way. She lets out
text: a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her back up and
text: carries her back to the outcropping.
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned rabbit at
text: her feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Here. Eat.
dialog: 
text: Tamara squirms away from the carcass, disgusted.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Couldn't you at least cook it
dialog: first?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
text: Fire draws attention.
dialog: 
text: Conan tears into his rabbit, chewing on the raw meat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Does it bother you, blood on your
dialog: hands?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: The only blood on these hands I
dialog: claimed with my own sword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Clean hands mean nothing. Kings and
dialog: Queens claim more lives than I will
dialog: ever meet, and not a drop is
text: spilled in their presence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What are you talking about? I've
dialog: done no harm to you. I've done no
dialog: harm to anyone.
dialog: 
text: Conan confronts her, enraged.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You lie. You are the very reason my
text: people are dead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Are you mad? I never met your
dialog: people.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: But Khalar Singh has. He destroyed
dialog: my people, looking for you.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Tamara understands.
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: The one who came for us? His name
dialog: is Khalar Singh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You know this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: We did not know who sought us, only
dialog: that we were sought.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You hid from him. And while you
dialog: did, others died in your place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: If we did not hide, countless more
dialog: would have been killed! You do not
dialog: know what purpose he has for our
dialog: queen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: And I do not care, for he will not
dialog: live to see it bear fruit!
dialog: 
text: Tamara is shocked.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Wait -- you seek to kill this
dialog: Khalar? We have the same aim. He
dialog: takes my queen to Khor Kalba. I
dialog: have sworn an oath to protect her.
dialog: I can help you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Enough lies.
dialog: 
text: Conan puts the gag back in her mouth and binds her hands.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROCK RIDGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Conan watches the Great Wall silently, absently playing with
text: a DAGGER in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along
text: the wall. The archers. The barrels of oil. The cavalry.
dialog: 
text: He feels eyes upon him and looks down at Tamara, still bound
text: and gagged, her eyes burning holes in his forehead. Conan
text: pulls out her gag.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You will keep quiet.
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What use is talking? You won't
dialog: believe a word I speak. I only want
dialog: to know this -- how will you kill
dialog: Khalar? You are too big to play the
dialog: assassin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You will be the lure that will draw
dialog: me close. Then I will scale the
text: wall and cut him down where he
dialog: stands.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: And the archers and cavalry? They
dialog: will be napping?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: They will not be a problem.
dialog: 
text: Tamara thinks about it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No. Not good enough.
dialog: 
text: Conan is shocked by her brazen response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Did I ask?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Should you fail, I'll be left
dialog: without a weapon, helpless in my
dialog: enemies hands. Let me help, Conan.
dialog: 
text: Conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I will not fail.
dialog: 
text: But still Tamara glares at him -- and we can see the hint of
text: Conan's resolve bending.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GREAT WALL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh stands atop the wall, awaiting Conan. Fariq
text: draws close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: Let me take care of this thief,
dialog: father. He's beneath your notice.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: He killed Remo, likely his cavalry
dialog: legion as well. Whatever he is, he
dialog: is more than a mere thief.
dialog: 
text: Then, off in the distance, at the far edge of the desert
text: clearing, two figures step out from amongst the boulders.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN AND TAMARA
dialog: 
text: Conan holds a squirming, but bound Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Be still!
dialog: 
text: Conan thrusts Tamara in Khalar's direction.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling to Khalar)
dialog: I have what you want! Where's my
dialog: gold?!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR
dialog: 
text: Khalar reaches down and lifts a heavy sack of gold coins.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
speaker_heading: (YELLING BACK)
dialog: Triple your price. Come and claim
dialog: it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: GATES OF THE WALL - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The gates open and Khalar strides out into the clearing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN AND TAMARA
dialog: 
text: stand a hundred feet ahead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Send her to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Send the gold.
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh throws the gold sack. It lands halfway between
text: them. He sends Tamara ahead, her mouth gagged.
dialog: 
text: But the moment Tamara reaches the gold --
dialog: 
text: From out underneath the sand, FOUR HORSEMEN rise up out of
text: the desert floor. They each bear weighted nets and spiked
text: lances, and they surround Conan.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The first rider gallops towards Conan who simply LOPS OFF THE
text: HORSES FRONT LEGS. As the beast collapses, Conan crushes the
text: rider's skull with his broadsword.
dialog: 
text: The next two riders attack together, but Conan dodges their
text: nets and rips away one of their spears, only to lodge it into
text: the other rider's chest. He dives at and tackles the first
text: rider, TOPPLING HIM, ALONG WITH HIS HORSE. He snaps the
text: second rider's neck.
dialog: 
text: The last rider comes at Conan, who horizontally slashes RIGHT
text: THROUGH THE HORSE'S NECK AND THEN THE RIDER'S NECK. Both
text: human and animal head tumble to the desert floor.
dialog: 
text: All four riders are dead, in a matter of seconds.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR
dialog: 
text: Smiles. He's got Tamara by the neck.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: You're fast. But are you fast
dialog: enough?
dialog: 
text: Conan's eyes go to the top of the wall, where CHEREN and his
text: archer prepare to fire. Conan rushes forward as the flaming
text: arrows stream toward him.
dialog: 
text: EXPLOSIONS rip through the air where Conan was, throwing up a
text: huge dust cloud.
dialog: 
text: Conan bursts out of the dust cloud, lunging in an attack.
dialog: 
text: But Khalar Singh is not there. He has withdrawn inside the
dialog: gates.
dialog: 
text: Baring his teeth, Conan runs at the wall itself.
dialog: 
text: Cheren and the archers let loose another volley at Conan, who
text: evades and strikes away the falling arrows with his sword.
dialog: 
text: Explosions fill the air, but none of them scorch Conan as he
speaker_heading: REACHES
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GREAT WALL
dialog: 
text: Conan hits the base of the wall at full stride, like a
text: mountain lion. Reaching out, he launches himself up, taking
text: half the vertical of the wall in a single leap.
dialog: 
text: Digging his hand into the seam of the wooden beams, he stops
text: only to vault up again, taking the forty foot wall in two
text: upward bounds.
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WALL WALK
dialog: 
text: Conan leaps upon wall walk, the passageway atop the Great
dialog: Wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: 
text: Tries to hide his surprise. Even as he draws his sword, Conan
text: takes out the four SOLDIERS in his way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: You should have run, while you
dialog: could.
dialog: 
text: Conan looks at the sword. It strikes a chord in him. IT IS
text: THE SWORD HIS FATHER FORGED! Enraged, Conan charges the
dialog: slight Fariq.
dialog: 
text: Fariq partially parries the attack. He's obviously well-
text: trained, but he's no match for Conan. The tip of Conan' blade
text: cuts a large gash in Fariq's cheek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Fariq!
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh arrives, grabbing his son by his collar and
text: flinging him away from the barbarian. Fariq struggles to
text: stand, trying in vain to hide his embarrassment.
dialog: 
text: Conan and Khalar Singh size each other up on the narrow wall
dialog: walk.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I was wondering what it would take
dialog: for you to stop cowering.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
text: I wasn't cowering. I was studying.
dialog: You're quite gifted with a sword,
dialog: but it's not from schooling. Your
dialog: speed and power makes up for a lack
dialog: of -- finesse. I've seen such
dialog: fighting before -- Cimmerian.
dialog: 
text: Enraged, Conan charges Khalar Singh. He swings down on Khalar
text: Singh's head, only when the sword reaches it, it finds
text: nothing but air. Khalar is fast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Cimmerian it is. Now it makes
dialog: sense. You came for blood, not
dialog: gold.
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Conan responds by lunging in, swinging his broadsword in a
text: broad arc, with all his might. Even in the small space,
text: Khalar's lateral speed is dizzying. He sidesteps Conan's
text: attack and backhands Conan's face with the flat of his
dialog: tulwar.
dialog: 
text: Conan's resolve wavers momentarily, knowing Khalar could have
text: just as easily sliced his throat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Your people barely afforded me a
dialog: challenge. You're little more than
dialog: beasts.
dialog: 
text: Conan comes at Khalar with twice as much fury, smashing
text: entire posts as he hacks at the warlord, who simply evades
dialog: the attack.
dialog: 
text: Down the wall walk they move, Conan attacking while Khalar
text: seems complacent enough just to defend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: You've come a long way, barbarian,
dialog: only to fail.
dialog: 
text: Khalar ducks Conan's last wild swing and gashes Conan twice,
text: both deeply in his midsection. Khalar then KICKS Conan,
text: sending the Cimmerian slamming onto the rock parapet.
dialog: 
text: CRUNCH. Conan lands directly on his back, his sword
text: clattering away from him. Khalar's men back away into a
text: circle. Conan struggles to get on all fours.
dialog: 
text: Khalar KICKS Conan in his shattered chest, lifting Conan off
text: the ground with his might. He follows up with a devastating
text: punch to Conan's face, one which lands like a piledriver.
speaker_heading: CRUNCH.
dialog: 
text: Conan can only bleed as Khalar looms over him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: So much for vengeance.
dialog: (to his soldiers)
dialog: Get me oil -- and a torch.
dialog: 
text: Soldiers quickly bring over a bucket of oil and a lit torch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that really the best you could
dialog: do? Is that as far as you could
dialog: think ahead? Just rush in and kill
dialog: me?
dialog: 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Behind Khalar Singh, Conan spots Tamara being brought up, her
text: hands bound. Her eyes show an intense fear, but resolve as
dialog: well.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA' HANDS
dialog: 
text: Between the bonds she slips down a blade. It's CONAN'S
text: DAGGER. She quickly cuts her bonds.
dialog: 
text: With all the attention focused on Conan, no one is quick
text: enough to stop her as GRABS THE TORCH FROM THE SOLDIER,
text: LIGHTING THE ARROWS IN CHEREN'S QUIVER.
dialog: 
text: Cheren spins around, sees the flames reaching his pitched
dialog: arrows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHEREN
dialog: No!!
dialog: 
text: But it's far too late. Tamara hits the floor, beside Conan.
speaker_heading: BOOM.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: EXPLOSION
dialog: 
text: The blast sends parts of Cheren flying in every direction.
text: Ukafa, Fariq, and the wall guards are flattened by the
dialog: concussion.
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh, who was standing closer to the explosion, is
text: THROWN AGAINST THE WALL!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: 
text: The warlord slowly rises, his head pounding from the
text: explosion. He looks up. The entire parapet is on fire.
dialog: 
text: He grits his teeth and climbs the wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ATOP THE WALL
dialog: 
text: A thick wall of flame rages before Khalar. Conan and Tamara
text: are gone. He looks over the far side of the wall, where two
text: figures on horseback ride off into the distance, Tamara
text: holding Conan atop the horse.
dialog: 
text: Ukafa and Fariq rise and see what Khalar Singh sees.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Ukafa, you will take half our
dialog: forces North, to the Sea. I will
dialog: take the rest South.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: What of me, father?
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: You will return to Khor Kalba. You
dialog: will feed the women to the beast
dialog: until you find our Queen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: I will not. I will track the
dialog: barbarian with you --
dialog: 
text: Enraged, Khalar Singh grabs him by the back of his head,
text: pulling him in close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: You think I care what you wish?!
dialog: You want to play warrior? It is not
dialog: in you. One day you will be king,
dialog: but warlord, never.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: I can. Let me prove it to you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: You will not risk your life again.
dialog: You are my line, my successor. You
dialog: will not throw away all that I have
dialog: worked for.
dialog: 
text: A smile creeps up on Ukafa's face, watching Fariq's
text: embarrassment. He withdraws hastily, all eyes on him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: (without looking at Ukafa)
dialog: If I find you smiling before you
dialog: bring me the girl, I will take
dialog: every tooth I see.

text: left in Conan's wake.

scene_heading: INT. CORIN'S FORGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The flames become the blaze of the forge.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (O.S.)
dialog: More wood boy! We must test the
dialog: steel with our fire.
dialog: 
text: Conan, a young boy again, kneels beside the woodpile, pulling
speaker_heading: OUT LOGS--
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But when he hands them to his father, he notices his father
text: is covered with sword wounds, cut and bleeding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you waiting for? The fire
text: is dying.
dialog: 
text: Conan turns back to the wood pile. Instead of wood, the pile
text: is full of the bodies of those he recently killed: Lucius,
dialog: Remo, etc.
dialog: 
text: The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the
text: forge. Still the fire diminishes.
dialog: 
text: Conan turns and there is no more wood. And no more bodies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: It's not enough. I've failed you
dialog: father.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: It will never be enough, Conan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I don't understand --
dialog: 
text: He spins. Behind him TAMARA stands, a look of sadness on her
dialog: face.

speaker_heading: CORIN
dialog: Through suffering, you will learn
dialog: your purpose, boy. And you have not

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Conan's eyes pop open. He inhales sharply, gripped by the
dialog: dream.
dialog: 
text: The room is dark, surrounded by thick draperies. Conan lies
text: on a straw bed with white sheets, soaked through with his
text: sweat. He looks to his wounds, all bandaged.
dialog: 
text: He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I wouldn't move so fast. I bound
dialog: your wounds as best I could, but
dialog: I'm no healer.
dialog:

dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Where am I?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: On the Wasp. You told me where it
dialog: laid, just before you passed out.
dialog: Though I can't say as I feel much
dialog: safer here.
dialog: 
text: Conan's response is to rise again, his face contorting in
dialog: pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't embarrass me with thanks, I
dialog: only saved your life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You were -- adequate.

scene_heading: EXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - NIGHT

speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Look what we have here. A hill ape
text: in over his head.
dialog: 
text: Conan spins to see the rough, brightly dressed Zamoran pirate
text: ARTUS leaping down from the quarterdeck, his sword out.
dialog: 
text: The other ZAMORAN PIRATES draw near as well. Tamara sees the
text: scene, suddenly uncomfortable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I was just wondering what that
dialog: smell was.
dialog: (sniffs near Artus)
dialog: Now I know.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: We take no stowaways. Only paying
dialog: passengers. You've best be laden
dialog: with gold.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: If it's metal you seek, perhaps
dialog: you'd settle for steel.
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: In a flash Conan's sword lunges forward. CLANG. It meets
text: Artus's, sparking as they collide. Artus LAUGHS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Still fast Artus.

speaker_heading: ARTUS

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: We go to Khor Kalba?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I do.
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Conan puts a brawny arm over his tired eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No. We do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Just leave me to sleep.
dialog: 
text: But Tamara doesn't leave, forcing Conan to respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You would risk your life for
dialog: royalty? Why?
dialog: 
text: Tamara pauses, realizing she must trust Conan to gain his
dialog: help.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Because she represent freedom, not
dialog: just ours but all Hyboria's. What
dialog: do you know of Acheron?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
text: A tall tale. Meant to scare
dialog: children.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: It is no fable. It's my people's
dialog: history. Acheron was an empire that
text: swallowed all of Hyboria, led by
text: the King and his legion of demon
text: warriors. Unstoppable. Insatiable.
dialog: Immortal. But still it had one
dialog: weakness. For the true power of
dialog: Acheron laid not with its King, but
dialog: the Queen. Every twenty years, a
dialog: new queen from the royal line would
text: be coronated with a crown of iron.
text: Spikes would pierce her, slowly
dialog: drain her precious blood, and
dialog: through her suffering Acheron would
dialog: remain invincible. Until one of my
dialog: ancestors, an Acheronian himself,
dialog: put a stop to this tyranny. He and
text: others spirited the new Queen away,
dialog: hiding her from the empire and all
dialog: those who would raise it again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: What care I for queens and empires?
dialog: 
text: Conan turns to head back to his bed. Tamara grabs him,
text: incensed.
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Didn't you hear me? This evil faces
dialog: us all. All of civilization will
dialog: fall if the army of Acheron is
text: raised again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I heard. Only I would happily put
dialog: all of your "civilization" to the
dialog: torch myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: But -- you owe me a debt, you
dialog: thankless oaf!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: My only debt is to my people. And
text: it still lies unpaid.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MAN OF WAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The enormous siege vessel lies before a burning PORT CITY.
dialog: 
text: A SAILOR, crying, grovels on his knees before Khalar and his

text: The ship sails like a ghost over black water, the stars lit

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Try not to taste it going down
dialog: would be my advice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: You've known Conan long?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: We sailed with him for a while. I
dialog: would like to say I know the man.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: He is a riddle to me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Aye, he's that too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: We have the same goal. Why will he
dialog: not trust me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Why would he? He's a stranger in
text: every land he trods. A man with no
dialog: home, no people, none but the
dialog: company of ghosts. And he bears the
dialog: weight of their deaths every moment
dialog: of every day.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: That is no way to live.
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: He doesn't live. I've seen in him
text: great mirth, only to watch it
text: smothered by greater melancholy. He
dialog: owes a blood debt, and he can
dialog: entertain no other joy, no other
dialog: cause, until it is fulfilled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: And yet you call him friend, and
dialog: risk death to help him.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Let me tell you something of Conan.
dialog: He will never lie. He will never
dialog: break a trust, once given. And he
dialog: will never, ever give up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: He's a stubborn ass.

scene_heading: INT. DUNGEON - THE PIT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: AKHUN and his Turanian slavers lead the female monks into a
text: large circular chamber, lit by many torches. Before them lies
text: a PIT, dark and foreboding, with a bamboo grid placed atop
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: Fariq enters, an AIDE holding the iron box he used earlier.
text: Fariq has a bandage on his face where Conan struck him, and
text: he looks even more angry and malevolent than before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: Here we stand again. Will the queen
dialog: reveal herself, or must another
dialog: innocent suffer?
dialog: 
text: Fariq walks past the row of women, each recoiling. He slaps
text: one. Then another, his rage only building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: My father, he tires of your
dialog: charade. He grows impatient. But I
dialog: have no such haste. I enjoy
dialog: watching you squirm.
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Fariq passes Ilira, slowing his pace. He closes in on the
text: YOUNGEST FEMALE MONK, a true innocent with terrified eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps you'd like to see the end
dialog: your sisters faced back at the
dialog: monastery?
dialog: 
text: Fariq slowly opens the box before her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACHERONIAN BOX
dialog: 
text: In the darkness of the box slithers a grotesque TENTACLE. The
text: tentacle is severed, but still alive, thirsting for blood.
dialog: 
text: Terrified as she is, the young monk says nothing. Fariq
text: closes the box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: No? Your fear is not enough yet?
dialog: Let's try harder.
dialog: 
text: Fariq nods to the slavers, who unchain her from the rest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: I've read all there is to know of
dialog: mighty Acheron. Why would true
dialog: Acheronians protect a traitor to
dialog: their own? You once held the entire
dialog: world in your grasp, now you hide
text: and cower like pitiful mice.
dialog: 
text: He pushes the girl. She falls to the grid, the sound echoing
text: down into the pit.
dialog: 
text: AN INHUMAN GROWL emits from the darkness. Something comes.
text: The girl looks below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: And mice are meant to be swallowed
dialog: whole.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a MASSIVE TENTACLE, ten times the size of the one
text: in the box, comes hurtling up through the grid. It grabs the
text: young monk, its barbs ripping into her, dragging her into the
text: darkness below.
dialog: 
text: Her SCREAMS echo.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: What was in the box could only
dialog: drink from you one at a time. But
dialog: the beast of Acheron, it will claim
dialog: four of you this night.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: Who will spare the rest and tell me
dialog: which of you is the queen?
dialog: 
text: Not a single woman moves, resolved. Ilira catches herself,
text: but also stays silent. She looks up to see Fariq staring at
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CU - ILIRA'S EYES
dialog: 
text: Her pupils widen in fear as Fariq's cold stare bores into
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I am here, swine.
dialog: 
text: Fariq turns -- only it is another FEMALE MONK that glares at
dialog: him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE MONK
dialog: I am the one you seek.
dialog: 
text: Fariq smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: At last. Some bravery. But of
dialog: course, you wouldn't expect me to
dialog: take your word, would you?

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. GALLEY - ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tamara awakens with a SCREAM, her body resting against the

speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No!!!
dialog: 
text: Tamara looks around with a panicked look, until she realizes
text: where she is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (O.S.)
dialog: I hope I awoke with less clamor.
dialog: 
text: Their roles reversed, now it is Tamara's turn to see Conan
text: sitting nearby, drinking from a flask of mead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: You're drinking? You were near
dialog: death this time yesterday.
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Is there a better reason to drink?
dialog: 
text: Tamara actually manages to LAUGH.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Do you think--I could try some of
dialog: that? I'm curious of its taste.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You've never tasted mead?
dialog: 
text: Tamara shrugs, embarrassed. Conan hands her flask. She takes
text: a deep swallow, some spilling out over her cheeks. But she
text: doesn't cough, and smiles brightly afterwards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: It's good.
dialog: 
text: Conan reaches for the flask, but Tamara ignores him, taking
text: another swig. It quickly loosens her tongue.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me ask you something. Once
dialog: you've killed Khalar and claimed
dialog: your vengeance, then what? You will
dialog: be free from your ghosts. What of
dialog: your future, Conan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I have no future. It died with my
dialog: people, as I should have.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: So your life is penance? For what,
dialog: for living? And when you too die,
dialog: what do you believe happens then?
dialog: 
text: Conan just shrugs, taking back the mead.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Nothing.
dialog: 
text: Tamara, her tongue loosened by drink, laughs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Nothing? I couldn't live without
dialog: some kind of belief in the world
dialog: after this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I believe in the cold of steel, the
text: warmth of flesh. All else is fairy
dialog: tales.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Perhaps. But I still die with faith
dialog: in my heart, belief in something
dialog: greater than one's self. What will
dialog: you die with?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Purpose. I die with purpose.

scene_heading: EXT. ZINGARAN GALLEY - MORNING
dialog: 
text: Tamara steps out onto the deck, grabbing her pounding head.
text: Her first hangover. She hears a THUMPING sound, followed by
text: ANOTHER, and walks towards the side of the deck.
dialog: 
text: Tamara looks overboard, to the water below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA'S POV
dialog: 
text: THE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES! Bloated, they float in blood
text: red water as flies buzz around them. One of them hits the
text: hull of the boat. THUMP.
dialog: 
text: Tamara blinks, unsure if the vision is real -- but then she's
text: joined by other PIRATES who gape at the bodies below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIRATE 1
dialog: To stations! To stations!
dialog: 
text: Tamara turns and up ahead spies --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACK WARSHIP
dialog: 
text: The larger warship cuts through the water, manned by a legion
text: of rowers. On the deck of the warship, UKAFA and his SPEARMEN
text: stand. The SAILORS get the most out of the billowing black
text: sails. The ship gains fast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GALLEY
dialog: 
text: Conan exits his room, sees the danger. Artus appears at his
dialog: side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: What do you think? They have us
dialog: outnumbered, but we might beat
dialog: their speed.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: That is what they wish. They drive
text: us to another force, approaching
dialog: from the south.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Then we fight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: No. We give them what they think
dialog: they want.
dialog: (to the Pirates)
dialog: About ship! Now!
dialog: 
text: The pirates leap into action, tacking and turning the galley
dialog: with great speed and efficiency.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE WARSHIP
dialog: 
text: Ukafa smiles, his gold teeth shining. The ship's CAPTAIN
text: stands beside him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
text: They're turning to run.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: Good. We only need stay close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE GALLEY
dialog: 
text: Is turned around now, fleeing. ARCHERS from the Warship fire
text: arrows that barely reach the Galley. The Pirates dodge the
text: few that land on deck.
dialog: 
text: Tamara reaches Conan and Artus. She's worried to say the
dialog: least.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: And now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Let us show them why she is called
dialog: the Wasp.
dialog: 
text: Artus smiles. He was hoping Conan would say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Why is she called the Wasp?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Open astern! Load the stinger!
dialog: 
text: The Pirates rush to the back of the ship.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE BLACK WARSHIP
dialog: 
text: The Captain stares ahead, confused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: They are doing -- something.
dialog: 
text: Sure enough, the stern of the ship begins to part, revealing -
dialog: 
text: A MASSIVE CROSSBOW
dialog: 
text: Mounted with a barbed harpoon, fifteen feet long.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Fire!
dialog: 
text: They fire the weapon. The harpoon races for the bow of the
text: Warship, a thick rope trailing it. It smashes into the wood,
text: ripping through it like it was paper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Rip her apart!
dialog: 
text: The Pirates grab the heavy rope and run, pulling the rope,
text: and the harpoon back towards the Wasp.
dialog: 
text: As it's pulled out, the barbs of the harpoon rip a wider hole
text: in the warship.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WARSHIP
dialog: 
text: The Captain and crew are in a panic. Men rush to patch the
text: gaping hole in the hull.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SAILOR
dialog: We're taking on water!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: Hard to port!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: No. Let them fire again!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
dialog: We will sink.
dialog: 
text: Ukafa guts the captain with his spear.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: So be it.
dialog: (to his spearmen)
dialog: Get below. Be ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALLEY
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The pirates load the harpoon in the crossbow device a second
dialog: time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Fire!
dialog: 
text: It fires, smashing again into the wooden hull of the Warship.
dialog: 
scene_heading: WARSHIP - INSIDE
dialog: 
text: The harpoon lodges deep inside the hull -- where Ukafa and
text: his spearmen wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: Now!
dialog: 
text: They rush forward and grab onto the harpoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GALLEY
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: Bring her back!
dialog: 
text: Again, the pirates pull the harpoon back out. It falls into
text: the water as they pull on the rope tied to it.
dialog: 
text: They do not notice Ukafa and his dozen spearmen clasping the
text: very same rope as its pulled toward the Galley.
dialog: 
text: Artus looks at the Warship. It's foundering and sinking
dialog: quickly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS (CONT'D)
dialog: She's dead in the water!
dialog: 
text: A CHEER goes up among the pirates --
dialog: 
text: And then one PIRATE takes a spear through the chest. All eyes
text: turn to the side of the Wasp, where Ukafa and his men climb
dialog: aboard.
dialog: 
text: Conan's eyes alight with fury.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Good. I was growing weary with
dialog: boredom.
dialog: 
text: Conan motions to a pair of pirates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hide her below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BATTLE
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Spearmen rush to the attack. The pirates spring to the
text: defense of the ship, countering the Spearmen with cutlass and
text: dagger. Ukafa marshals his men as a fierce battle rages.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: Find the girl!
dialog: 
text: The Spearmen quickly make their way to the interior of the
text: galley, throwing the dead bodies of the pirates overboard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Conan grabs the nearby jib, swings over, and plants both feet
text: in the face of one of the spearmen, knocking him over the
dialog: side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: 
text: The sea captain proves dangerous in his own right, grabbing
text: the head of one of the Spearmen and violently pulling it down
text: to the gunwale of the ship, impaling the Spearman's eye on a
text: handspike.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA
dialog: 
text: The massive warrior shows incredible speed as well, dodging
text: one cutlass attack only to turn the weapon upon another
dialog: pirate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: The Cimmerian cuts through a Spearman, his gaze focused on
text: Ukafa. Ukafa stares right back as he runs through a pair of
text: pirates. Finally, the two warriors stand only feet apart.
dialog: 
text: The two warriors eye each other with satisfaction. Ukafa's
text: frightening, sharpened gold teeth shine as he smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA (CONT'D)
dialog: We are each the last of our tribe,
dialog: Cimmerian. Yours dies this day.
dialog: 
text: Conan responds by lunging forward, swinging his sword in a
text: broad arc. Ukafa is just as quick, stepping back and allowing
text: his spear to block the swing.
dialog: 
text: Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles, forcing Conan to
text: parry, stepping back beyond the spear's reach.
dialog: 
text: The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth, neither
text: able to gain the advantage.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA (CONT'D)
dialog: Your head will top my spear today,
dialog: but know Khalar's pig son will soon
dialog: share your fate.
dialog: 
text: Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest, and Conan
text: decides to drop his sword, grabbing the spear as it passes by
dialog: him.
dialog: 
text: Conan then pulls on the spear, throwing Ukafa off his
text: balance, towards Conan. Conan then kicks the warrior in the
text: chest, hurtling Ukafa backwards.
dialog: 
text: Now Conan turns the spear on its master. Ukafa, unarmed, is
text: forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him. A pair
text: of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his chest and
text: arm, but he manages to knock the spear from Conan's hands.
dialog: 
text: The battle goes to hand-to-hand. It's primal, each of them
text: covered in blood. Ukafa bear hugs Conan, then resorts to
text: using his teeth to bite into Conan's shoulder.
dialog: 
text: Conan YELLS IN PAIN, butting Ukafa's head and knocking him
text: back. Conan falls to the stern of the ship, his back against
text: the harpoon crossbow.
dialog: 
text: Ukafa shakes off the head butt, and sees his spear nearby. He
text: picks it up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: UKAFA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now finally, you die.
dialog: 
text: He raises up to hurl the spear through Conan, only to see
text: Conan manning the harpoon, NOW TURNED TO FACE UKAFA.
dialog: 
text: The crossbow fires and the harpoon punches a massive hole
text: through Ukafa, its momentum throwing him off the galley, into
text: the sea beyond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: She hides inside a small compartment of the ship. She hears
text: FOOTSTEPS walking past, then returning. An ARM suddenly
text: reaches in and grabs her.
dialog: 
text: As she's pulled out, Tamara SCREAMS right in Conan's face. He
text: doesn't even flinch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Time to go.
dialog: 72.

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. GALLEY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The battle ended, the pirates toss the dead Spearmen into the

dialog: 
text: Meanwhile, Conan lashes his sword to his back, standing by
text: the gunwales with Tamara and Artus, a SMALL DINGHY waiting
dialog: below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ARTUS
dialog: I could get you closer. Another
dialog: half day along the coast --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I need you head west, to draw off
dialog: our pursuers. I'll find another

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: So you are taking me with you to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I never said that. But I won't
text: leave a virgin onboard a pirate
text: ship, alone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I -- but -- who said I was a
dialog: virgin?
dialog: 
text: Conan just shakes his head as a parting fog reveals a large
text: Colossus head, the fallen remains of an enormous statue,
text: lying agape on the shoreline.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - DUSK
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Will I awake alone? Do you intend
dialog: to leave me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I would do you a kindness. Khor
dialog: Kalba will bring only death.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Please, Conan. Artus told me of how
dialog: you lost your tribe. I too had to
dialog: watch as my people were taken from
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: Conan ignores her, gathering wood for a fire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: All I ask is that you let me travel
dialog: with you. I too have a purpose. I
dialog: must get to the queen. I would
dialog: rather you kill me here, than fail
dialog: her again.
dialog: 
text: Conan continues collecting, infuriating Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I was wrong about you. You are no
dialog: fearless warrior. Your heart is
text: closed to all but fear -- and hate.
dialog: 
text: Conan draws flint, starting the fire. Only once his task is
dialog: complete does he answer Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: We leave at dawn. I will not break
dialog: stride for you. Not once. I will
dialog: get you into Khor Kalba. Beyond
dialog: that I have my purpose, and you
dialog: yours.
dialog: 
text: Tamara offers a thankful nod, her anger subsiding.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Nice fire. Does it mean you'll

dialog:

text: floating there, harpoon still lodged in his chest.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The ship's CAPTAIN approaches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN
text: The pirate ship sailed to the west.
dialog: Even under full sail it'll be no
text: easy task to overtake her.
dialog: 
text: Just then, a FALCON approaches. The Falconer retrieves it, a
text: parchment tied to its talon. He passes it on to Khalar Singh.
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh reads it, a smile creeping upon his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Fariq has done well.
dialog: (to the Captain)
text: Head east, back to Khor Kalba.

scene_heading: EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY
dialog: 
text: Tamara watches Conan from a distance. He silently stalks prey
text: with nothing more than a knife.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: A BOAR
dialog: 
text: Its ears listen intently, aware. Suddenly, it bolts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Is just as quick, racing through the forest on a intercepting
text: course with the great beast. He leaps over a fallen log,
text: throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm.
dialog: 
text: The boar goes down, the blade through its jugular. Conan
text: walks up to the struggling beast, showing no satisfaction as
text: he mercifully SNAPS its neck.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. COLOSSUS HEAD - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire. Conan
dialog: turns the meat.
dialog: 
text: Behind him, Tamara approaches. She has cleaned herself up,
text: her white robe translucent in light of the fire, her wet hair
text: glistening.
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Conan can't help but notice her supple skin, her curves. He
text: stops chewing.
dialog: 
text: Tamara notices. Embarrassed, she turns so that he can only
text: see her side. Conan returns to his food.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What were the women of your tribe
dialog: like, Conan?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
text: They fought beside the men.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: So they were equals. And your
dialog: mother?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: She died in battle, even as I was
dialog: born.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: So you never knew her. It was the
dialog: same with me. I've always known
dialog: being a mother was somehow not my
dialog: fate. But--
dialog: 
text: Tamara falters, unsure. But Conan's quiet eases her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: You said earlier Khor Kalba will
dialog: bring only death. Were you trying
dialog: to scare me, or do you really
dialog: believe our end lies there?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I don't lie.
dialog: 
text: Tamara nods, having heard as much about Conan. She turns back
text: to face him, no longer hiding her body.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Then we don't have much time. Your
dialog: mother perished too young, but at
dialog: least she died having known the
dialog: touch of one who cared.
dialog: 
text: Tamara steps closer to Conan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: So -- do you care, Conan?
dialog: 
text: Conan rises to her, his broad form looming over her slight
dialog: build.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But Conan shows surprising gentleness as he removes her robe
text: and pulls her naked body into his, their mouths meeting in a
text: desperate kiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOVE SCENE
dialog: 
text: Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire, their sinewy limbs
text: intertwined, fingers locked together. He thrusts into her,
text: causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain.
dialog: 
text: The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top, undulating as
text: their pace quickens. Tamara CRIES OUT in ecstasy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AFTERMATH
dialog: 
text: Tamara stares into the fire, her body wrapped around Conan's.
text: She gently caresses the notched scars cut into his arm.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I've only ever heard you speak of
dialog: what you'd die for, Conan. What
dialog: would you live for?
dialog: 
text: Conan, his eyes closed, keeps them shut.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Do you ever tire of talking? Let me
dialog: rest, woman.
dialog: 
text: Tamara reaches down between Conan's legs. His eyes open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I thought that may work.
dialog: 
text: Conan growls and pulls himself atop Tamara. Looking down at
text: her face, her hair loose and wild, she's beautiful in the
text: soft glow of the firelight.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I see you clearly now, finally,
dialog: after all this time.
dialog: (she kisses him deeply)
dialog: I would be that which you live for,
dialog: Conan, if you would have me. You
dialog: may have faith in nothing, Conan --
dialog: but I have faith in you.
dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY
dialog:

text: down in the vista below:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHOR KALBA
dialog: 
text: Surrounded on three sides by the coastline, the stone
text: fortress of Khalar Singh rests on a plateau, overlooking a
text: bustling, tented city below.
dialog: 
text: Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their way
text: towards town, driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: We'll slip in, along with those
dialog: traders. But you'll need a change
dialog: of clothes, those monks' robes will
dialog: draw attention.
dialog: 
text: Tamara looks down at her loose-fitting robes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What will I wear?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. KHOR KHALBA - ENTRANCE - DAY
dialog: 
text: The caravan rides up to the walled entrance to the city,
text: guarded by Khalar's troops. Blended in amongst the others,
text: Conan now wears the elaborate head scarf and clothes of
text: Shemish traders, obscuring all but his eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: Tamara is dressed like a Shemish serving girl, her taut body
text: barely covered by silken drapings. She glares at Conan,
dialog: miserable.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: I don't understand why I couldn't
dialog: be dressed as you are. I look like
dialog: a whore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: And what better disguise for a
dialog: monk?
dialog: 
text: Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster. The
text: Camel BRAYS and rears. Conan yanks harder and the camel flies
text: forward, its eyes wide.
dialog: 
text: Conan meets its eye.
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do not test me, beast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Is there not a living thing you can
dialog: be at peace with?
dialog: 
text: They ride into the city, past the troops.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Conan and Tamara walk through the town's teeming market, a
text: otherworldly bazaar replete with animal sacrifices, veiled
text: faces and not a hint of morality.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: 
text: A FIGURE, his form hidden beneath a cloak, spots Conan and
text: Tamara as they enter, and begins to follow them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WOODEN PLATFORM
dialog: 
text: The city ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the
text: plateau. There stands a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a
text: massive winch, unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising
text: back up to the fortress above.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: It's probably only way into
dialog: Khalar's fortress. I'm sure it is
dialog: heavily guarded at all times, day
dialog: and night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: So we must try to scale the cliff.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: And dodge arrows as we do so?
dialog: 
text: Conan motions up to the winch. Standing beside it are a half
text: dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: During the day, we'd easily be
dialog: spotted on the climb. And it would
dialog: be useless to even attempt at
dialog: night. No, we must find another
dialog: way.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STRANGER'S POV
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALLEYWAY
dialog: 
text: Conan and Tamara reach a less crowded area of the village
text: when a VOICE rings out behind them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Halt.
dialog: 
text: Conan spins, sword at the ready. From out of the shadows
text: comes a pair of MEN, their beady eyes fixed on Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Thieves. You'll regret finding me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I think not.
dialog: 
text: From out of the shadows steps the ONE-EYED THIEF, the same
text: one who Conan saved from Lucius' beatings. He smiles at
text: Conan, lifting a KEY from a rope around his neck
dialog: 
scene_heading: ONE EYED THIEF
dialog: It took longer than you think to
dialog: cut this out of Lucius' stomach.
dialog: After all that work, I figured I'd
dialog: keep it -- for old times' sake.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THIEVES' TAVERN - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: A rundown hall, built beneath the city. Wooden supports hold
text: up the buildings of the entire city block overhead.
dialog: 
text: And within the hall, a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES.
text: They're a flinty collection, many of them missing fingers or
text: even hands, evidence of Khalar's cruel justice.
dialog: 
text: They eat and drink, sharing tales and tips, WENCHES and
text: SERVING WOMEN their cautious eyes following the Cimmerian
dialog: outsider.
dialog: 
text: The One Eyed Thief takes them to an open table, and
text: immediately three of the serving women descend upon Conan,
text: caressing him.
dialog: 
text: Tamara watches this, jaw dropped, and manages a COUGH, even
text: as a SERVING GIRL delivers mead to the table.
dialog: 
text: Conan just smiles as he enjoys the silky bodies of the nubile
text: women, their breasts practically framing his face.
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: What? Do you wish to join in?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
text: Conan cleans mead from his face, scowling at Tamara, as the
text: One-Eyed Thief uses the tabletop to explain the fortress.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ONE EYED THIEF
dialog: --so you were right about the
dialog: platform. You'll be long dead
dialog: before you make it top. Same with
text: scaling the cliff. There's no known
text: way to break into the fortress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: So that's it?
dialog: 
scene_heading: ONE EYED THIEF
dialog: I didn't say that. I just said
dialog: there's no known way in -- because
dialog: no one has ever tried to. But
dialog: breaking out -- that's another
dialog: story. It's not much easier, but
dialog: it's possible.
dialog: 
text: The One Eyed Thief offers the same gap-toothed grin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ONE EYED THIEF (CONT'D)
dialog: You just need to find someone crazy
dialog: enough to show you the way.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SEWERS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Tamara is the last to follow Conan, the One Eyed Thief and
text: the three THIEVES from before down a short ladder. Below lies
text: a darkened catacomb, lit only by their torches.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ONE EYED THIEF
text: These catacombs run underneath the
text: entire city, even to the cistern
text: that drains out from the fortress
dialog: dungeon.
dialog: 
text: Tamara's foot drops into knee high water. She immediately
text: grabs her nose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Catacombs? You mean sewers.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ONE EYED THIEF
dialog: Piss and shit are the last things
dialog: you need to worry about down here.
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tamara eyes the muddy water, nothing visible beneath its
text: murky surface.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. OTHER SEWERS - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The group wades through the water, single file. Conan notices
text: HIEROGLYPHICS and carvings on the wall of the catacomb.
text: Massive creatures of the sea, dark sorcery, ritual sacrifice.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: What is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
text: A warning. These catacombs are
dialog: connected to the sea. It says that
dialog: the beasts of Acheron protect its
dialog: secrets.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Not from me.
dialog: 
text: Conan presses on, into the darkness.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CISTERN - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The catacomb widens out to a giant circular cistern, its
text: walls rising up high into the darkness. As the torches bring
text: light to the space, we see HUNDREDS OF DEAD, ROTTING BODIES.
dialog: 
text: As Conan and Tamara walk forward, the One Eyed Thief and the
text: other stop at the entrance.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ONE EYED THIEF
dialog: Sorry, friend. We stop here. We've
dialog: heard too much about what lies
dialog: within to go any further.
dialog: 
text: Conan simply nods and the thieves depart. Conan raises his
text: torch, illuminating the near wall.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Where now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Around. Up.
dialog: 
text: Conan heads off one direction, leaving Tamara to navigate the
text: other half. Her torch illuminates the grizzly path ahead. She
text: inhales deeply and takes her first step.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Following the slick wall, he passes many DEAD BODIES, but
text: only one catches his eye. He stops before it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEAD WARRIOR
dialog: 
text: Nothing more than a skeleton, picked clean by the rats. But
text: he still bears his leather armor, and a horned helmet that
text: resembles his father's own.
dialog: 
text: Conan takes the helmet and places it on his head. It fits
dialog: perfectly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: Tamara is gingerly making her way through the knee high
text: sewage water and the dead bodies submerged within.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Oh!!!
dialog: 
text: Tamara leaps up, swinging the torch down towards the water.
text: Conan, nearby, unsheathes his sword.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Something touched me. Something
dialog: slimy.
dialog: 
text: Conan walks over, the torchlight revealing something on
text: Tamara's leg. It's a SLUG, which he flicks off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Crom! Stop wasting time.
dialog: 
text: But when Conan steps forward, something ROILS THE WATER right
text: before him. He spots a HUGE TENTACLE just before its
text: submerges back into the water.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Crom indeed.
dialog: 
text: Then Tamara SCREAMS as another tentacle rises up from the
text: water, wrapping around her waist. Tamara grabs hold of the
text: wall as the tentacle tries to pull her underwater.
dialog: 
text: Conan immediately SLASHES the tentacle, pulling Tamara away.
text: The squirming decapitated tentacle squirts black blood
text: everywhere, the knee high water seems to come alive with
text: roiling intensity.
dialog: 
text: Conan spins, finding a circular stone staircase tiled into
text: the far cistern wall.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's go.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIRCULAR STAIRWAY - CISTERN
dialog: 
text: As they work their way up the circular stairwell, towards a
text: thin shaft of firelight up ahead.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Carved out of solid black rock, both sides of the broad
text: corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel doors,
text: leading to prison cells.
dialog: 
text: Conan and Tamara emerge from a sewer drain, pushing their way
text: to the floor of the hallway. The heavy darkness presses in on
text: Conan's torch like a sentient, animate thing.
dialog: 
text: The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES, in
text: varying states of decay. There are buckets, filled with
text: entrails and feces, upended. Tamara put her hand over her
dialog: mouth.
dialog: 
text: Conan continues down the hallway. He and Tamara begin to hear
text: the sound of EERIE CHANTING.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: What is that?
dialog: 
text: Up ahead, the torch-lined dungeon plunges into darkness as
text: the torches end. Conan holds up his own torch, struggling to
text: peer into the black void.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Nothing good.
dialog: 
text: Conan takes a step forward when suddenly a POWERFUL WIND
text: blows out his torch. A moment later, there's the sound of A
text: GATE WHISTLING DOWN AND CRASHING INTO THE GROUND.
dialog: 
text: In the darkness, comes a DEEP, EARTHY CHUCKLE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Welcome.
dialog: 
text: A HOST OF OIL LIGHTS SUDDENLY COME UP, revealing that the
text: gate that closed behind them was actually just a door to a
text: vast CAGE built around a massive PIT.
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. THE PIT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The same pit where Fariq sacrificed the female monk, only
text: now, a half dozen COMBATANTS stand on the grid above the
dialog: void.
dialog: 
text: Hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other PRISONERS,
text: including Tamara's fellow female monks. Several of them YELL
text: out Tamara's name as they see her.
dialog: 
text: And watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage,
text: is the massive Akhun and several of his slavers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AKHUN
dialog: Which ever one of you slaves gets
dialog: me the girl, lives.
dialog: 
text: The Combatants all close in on Conan and Tamara, each taking
text: a different plank way to get to them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
speaker_heading: (TO TAMARA)
dialog: Stay behind me.
dialog: 
text: Tamara steps behind Conan, who blocks the others' path to
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Who dies first?
dialog: 
text: The first two COMBATANTS attack as one, the first wielding a
text: short sword, the other a pike. The pikeman thrusts first,
text: Conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending
text: the wielder off balance and into the abyss.
dialog: 
text: The prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better,
text: as Conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single
dialog: blow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: Tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the
text: top half of the metallic cage. She begins scaling the cage,
text: her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Three more COMBATANTS step in to replace the fallen duo.
text: Conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have
text: the combatant suddenly grabbed by a ENORMOUS TENTACLE, much
text: like the one Conan cut through earlier.
dialog: 
scene_heading: TENTACLED MONSTER
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a
text: gigantic octopus-like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that
text: feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth.
dialog: 
text: The creature reaches out and grabs another SCREAMING
text: combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in
text: its gnashing maw.
dialog: 
text: The creature reaches for Conan, who ducks underneath the
text: tentacle, the slices it off. He immediately turns back to
text: check on Tamara -- and he discovers she's not there.
dialog: 
text: He looks up to see Tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty
text: feet directly above him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Crom!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AKHUN
dialog: 
text: The massive warrior spots Tamara getting close to the
text: prisoner baskets and motions to his two Jailers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AKHUN
dialog: Get her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: She's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the
text: baskets when she spots the two Jailers closing in, climbing
text: towards her from either side.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Spotting Tamara overhead, Conan tries to keep beneath her,
text: evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety
text: planks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: She's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first
text: Jailer reaches out to grab her. She reacts by GASHING his
text: eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he FALLS TOWARDS
text: THE PIT.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen Jailer
text: SMASHES through the plank he was on, forcing Conan to jump to
dialog: another.
dialog: 
text: Just then another COMBATANT comes swinging for the Cimmerian,
text: forcing him to defend while still not balanced.
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: The next Jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. He
text: struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she BITES
speaker_heading: HIS EAR OFF.
dialog: 
text: The Jailer drops Tamara, who SCREAMS as she falls.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Conan spots Tamara plunging towards him. In one swift move,
text: he SLASHES his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing
text: tentacle, and reaches out to GRAB TAMARA BY THE ARM AS SHE
text: FALLS. His shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold
text: onto Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: 
text: She swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster
text: below her. Only a single splintering plank holds her and
text: Conan aloft.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: With a grunt, he swings Tamara and throws her to safety, at
text: the edge of the pit.
dialog: 
text: But as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive Akhun
text: entering the arena.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AKHUN
dialog: 
text: The giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as Conan.
text: He thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to
text: bend and warp.
dialog: 
text: Conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his
text: training in Cimmeria serves him well.
dialog: 
text: Akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his
text: legs. Conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank
text: close enough for him to jump to.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AKHUN (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll make a nice meal.
dialog: 
text: Akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time
text: Conan uses the momentum to SPRINGBOARD UP INTO AIR.
dialog: 
text: Conan soars into the air, his cat-like reflexes keeping him
text: focused as he lands right before the stunned Akhun. With one
text: great slash of his blade, Conan eviscerates Akhun.
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the
text: abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ARENA OF THE PIT - LATER
dialog: 
text: Conan lowers down the last of the baskets. Tamara use a sword
text: to smash open the lock, freeing the prisoners inside.
dialog: 
text: Tamara shares hugs of joy with the other monks of her flock.
text: The women look worn, but unbroken.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Where is Ilira?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FEMALE MONK
text: She was taken away by Fariq.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Then I'm too late.
dialog: 
text: One of the stronger looking women, an ELDER MONK, steps
dialog: forward.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELDER MONK
dialog: No. She was just taken this
text: morning. It's not yet midnight,
dialog: and Khalar still must bring her to
dialog: the cave of Acheron.
dialog: 
text: Tamara nods and the women begin to ARM THEMSELVES. Conan
text: shakes his head at the rag-tag group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You're going to fight Khalar's
dialog: troops? Just you?
dialog: 
text: The Elder Monk grabs and nearby pike and twirls it expertly
text: about her body, clearly well versed in it use.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Cimmerians aren't the only women
dialog: who know how to fight. And to kill.
dialog: 
text: Tamara looks at the other monks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Our duty was to keep the queen
dialog: safe. We failed. But if Khalar
dialog: brings her to Acheron, it will rise
dialog: again -- and all our peoples'
dialog: sacrifice is for nothing.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: So if the queen is not free by the
dialog: stroke of midnight -- she must be
text: already dead.
dialog: 
text: The other monks nod and they start to head off. Tamara is the
text: last to head off, her eyes burning into Conan's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You want my help again.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No. You kept your word, I'll keep

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELDER MONK
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Guard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
speaker_heading: (WHISPERING)
dialog: Don't kill him. We need to find out
dialog: which way Ilira was taken.
dialog: 
text: The Elder Monk nods and slips up ahead. We hear a SMASH.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CATACOMB ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The stunned GUARD lies before the assembled monks. Tamara
text: glares down at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Tell us where the last girl was
dialog: taken.
dialog: 
text: The Guard just LAUGHS at them through bloody teeth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (O.S.)
dialog: Let me ask.
dialog: 
text: The Guard's face drops as Conan steps out from the darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Your debt --
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Will be where your queen is.
dialog: 
text: Tamara smiles. She knows it is a half truth.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: As Conan and the monks enter, the throne room is empty,
text: scattered light barely illuminating the expansive chamber.
dialog: 
text: Ilira sits on the throne, crown on her slumped head. Tamara
text: runs over to her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Ilira!
dialog: 
text: She raises Ilira's head, only to discover lifeless eyes.
text: Tamara cradles her best friend's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
text: She's dead. It's over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Not yet.
dialog: 
text: Before the monks can react, ARROWS STREAK OUT FROM THE
text: DARKNESS, killing them all. Only Conan is quick enough to
text: dodge his arrow by diving aside.
dialog: 
text: When he comes up, Khalar has Tamara, his sword at her neck.
text: Several ARCHERS stand behind him, at the ready.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: It's only begun. Because that one
dialog: was not the heir to Acheron.
dialog: 
text: Khalar smiles down at Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: She is.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, what he's saying dawns on her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No. It can't be --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
text: Secretive, the traitors of Acheron.
dialog: It wasn't easy, but Fariq finally
dialog: wrung honesty from the girl. That
dialog: poor innocent was forced to live a
dialog: lie, even as the truth was kept
dialog: from the queen herself.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (TO CONAN)
dialog: And you did the rest, barbarian. My
dialog: thanks for delivering the Queen to
dialog: me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: No!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, a trap door opens beneath Conan and drops down in
text: the darkness, landing with a heavy THUD.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. FORGE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Conan awakens to the familiar sound of a hot blade SIZZLING
text: as it hits the cooling vat.
dialog: 
text: But this is no dream of his father's forge -- as he looks up
text: to see Fariq holding a sword, its tip still red hot, the
text: flames of the fortress's forge behind him.
dialog: 
text: Conan's thrusts forward, only to find his armed chained
text: around a heavy mortar and stone pillar.
dialog: 
text: Fariq strokes his newly acquired scar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: At last you awaken, Cimmerian. It's
dialog: been hours you've made me wait for
dialog: my fun.
dialog: 
text: Conan says nothing, but his eyes scan the room, taking in
dialog: everything.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: You made me lose face in front of
dialog: my father. That wasn't wise. But
dialog: what should I expect from a
dialog: Cimmerian?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: A swift end!
dialog: 
text: Conan strains at the chain, ripping the skin beneath his
text: shackles -- but a thin wisp of mortar comes loose from the
dialog: pillar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: Hardly. But that is a difference
dialog: between you and me. A swift end
dialog: would be a mercy I do not intend to
dialog: grant. No, you must suffer for your
dialog: transgressions.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ (CONT'D)
dialog: You must beg for your suffering to
dialog: end. Just as your people did.
dialog: 
text: He waves the glowing sword tip in front of Conan's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: You lie. I was there. My father
dialog: never uttered a sound.
dialog: 
text: Fariq LAUGHS, amused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: You were there? What were you
dialog: doing, warrior? Watching your
dialog: father die, without saying a sound?
dialog: Taking your eyes will be justice
dialog: indeed, coward.
dialog: 
text: Fariq pushes the hot tip of the sword against Conan's skin.
text: Conan's face reddens with pain, but he doesn't utter a sound.
text: But as Conan pulls on his chains -- more mortar falls. As
text: Fariq turns back to place the sword in the forge, Conan
text: notices one of the bricks the chains are fastened to is
speaker_heading: LOOSE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I saw my father die. Slain by one
dialog: who can only kill men already on
dialog: their knees.
dialog: 
text: Fariq turns, his eyes blazing. He glances over at the two
text: GUARDS by the door, who try not to listen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: I've killed many in battle, cur.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Really? Then why did your father
dialog: not let you face me before, when I
dialog: had sword in hand. He thought you
text: unequal to the task.
dialog: 
text: Fariq responds by pushing the red hot blade against Conan's
text: chest. Conan just YELLS back at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Coward! Prove your strength!
dialog: 
text: Again, Fariq pushes the hot blade against Conan's skin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Take my eyes, coward -- if you can.
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Fariq yells and thrust the tip of the sword at Conan's head.
text: Conan lifts his manacles, forcing the blade up into the brick
text: holding his chain.
dialog: 
text: Then Conan pulls on the chains with all his might, loosening
text: the heavy brick, which falls to the ground.
dialog: 
text: In one powerful movement, Conan begins SWINGING the chain
text: with the mortar block on the end, a homemade ball and chain.
dialog: 
text: The two Guards come forward, sword drawn, only to meet with a
text: CRUNCHING blow by Conan's weapon. Both their heads get caved
dialog: in.
dialog: 
text: Fariq rushes Conan, getting in too close for Conan's wide
text: swings. Conan simply meets Fariq's sword with the heavy
text: chains, then encircles Fariq's neck with the steel bonds.
dialog: 
text: Fariq CHOKES, falling to the ground, gasping for air. But
text: Conan doesn't kill him -- yet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE FORGE
dialog: 
text: A vat of molten steel bubbles in a cauldron within the forge.
text: Conan uses tongs to lift the cauldron out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ
dialog: 
text: Conan kicks him onto his back. Fariq's last vision is that of
text: Conan, tipping the cauldron, the hot iron descending toward
text: his eyes. Fariq SCREAMS.
dialog: 
text: Conan reaches down and picks up Fariq's sword. THE SWORD
text: CONAN'S FATHER MADE FOR HIM.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SEA PENINSULA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: By torchlight, Khalar Singh leads his black-armored PERSONAL
text: GUARD, two dozen men strong, across a rocky peninsula,
text: jutting out into the sea. On the back of Khalar's horse,
text: bound, rides the helpless Tamara.
dialog: 
text: As they round a large rock spire they spy a fearsome and awe
text: inspiring sight. A massive SKULL, seemingly a natural rock
text: formation, rises over the peninsula.
dialog: 
text: As they ride closer, we can make out one more detail -- the
text: mouth of the skull is actually a massive door, at least sixty
text: feet high, and seemingly made up of jagged bone. It has the
text: appearance of teeth, completing the skull illusion.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It takes the full complement of soldiers to open the enormous
text: doors. Khalar Singh rides in. Moonlight from the huge eyes of
text: the skull illuminate terrifying faces in the darkness. Faces
text: of demonic warrior statues.
dialog: 
text: At their feet lie the decaying bones of human skeletons, too
dialog: numerous to count.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: This is no empire, only a
dialog: graveyard.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: You see only with your eyes.
dialog: 
text: Khalar nods to his men. Two Guardsmen take their torches and
text: light other torches set in the walls. It sets off a chain
text: reaction. As far as the eye can see torches ignite revealing
dialog: the true scope of this place.
dialog: 
text: An enormous cave, the walls lined with monumental columns
text: that frame countless bas relief carvings of demonic origin.
dialog: 
text: And at the far of the cave, an ALTAR sits beneath a raised
text: THRONE, surrounded by a SACRIFICIAL POOL. The pool is empty.
dialog: 
text: Khalar turns to his guards.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Close the gates and stay here. Send
dialog: my son to me when he arrives.
dialog: (motioning to two of them)
dialog: You two, come with me.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ALTAR
dialog: 
text: Khalar dismounts at the sacrificial altar, carved of out of
text: purple-shaded rock. Around its edges are deep channels, for
text: the blood of its victims. And on its four corners -- shackles
dialog: of bone.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: The Acheronians had a wonderful
dialog: sense of balance, don't you think?
dialog: For one to ascend to royalty,
dialog: another must fall.
dialog: 
text: With the flick of a wrist, Khalar cuts Tamara's bonds.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tamara head butts him, struggling to escape, but Khalar
text: absorbs the blow effortlessly. He throws Tamara upon the
text: altar, his two guards shackling her in place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: For a hundred generations the kings
dialog: of Acheron were crowned, and the
dialog: queens were sacrificed.
dialog: 
text: Khalar snaps his fingers and two guardsmen bring an ornately
text: carved BOX MADE OF BONE, laying it before the altar. Like a
text: Chinese puzzle box, Khalar manipulates the carvings of
text: skulls, sacrifices, and creatures until the box UNLATCHES.
dialog: 
text: And from the box he lifts two items. A CROWN OF GOLD and A
text: CROWN OF IRON. The crown of gold is magnificent, ornately
text: detailed gold that glows in the firelight.
dialog: 
text: But the crown of iron is terrifying. Huge rough spikes extend
text: from it in every direction. It looks more like a weapon than
text: a crown.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: What a day for you. This morning
dialog: you were a handmaiden. Tonight, you
dialog: are a queen giving birth to an
dialog: empire.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Bloodied and weary, Conan approaches the Skull Rock. He has
text: nothing more than his sword, his loincloth and a small BURLAP
text: SACK tied to his hip.
dialog: 
text: He stumbles, falling to his knees. His wounds have taken a
text: grave toll. Still he stands and presses on.
dialog: 
text: He pushes on the doors. They do not budge in the least. He
text: puts his shoulder to the doors -- his every muscle straining
text: to their utmost. Again -- no movement.
dialog: 
text: Conan backs away, taking stock of the surroundings. He climbs
text: up the side of the rock.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ACHERON CAVE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh CHANTS in Acheronian. Ancient, harsh words, as
text: he lifts the two crowns overhead, offering them to the
text: statues of dark gods all around.
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Stop. You don't know what you are
text: about to do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: But I do. For thirty years I have
dialog: dreamed of this day. The day our
text: people rise from the ashes.
dialog: 
text: Khalar Singh continues his chant and places the gold crown
text: upon his head. As he does so, the light from the moon
text: reflects off the crown, bathing the sacrificial pool in an
text: unnatural glow.
dialog: 
text: THUMP-THUMP. A deep and foreboding sound echoes throughout
text: the cave, shaking everything like an earthquake. It sounds
text: like the heartbeat of a giant.
dialog: 
text: Khalar next places the iron crown around Tamara's head. She
text: thrashes and struggles but to no avail.
dialog: 
text: Once the crown is around her head -- THUMP-THUMP! The spikes
text: around the iron crown grow shorter AS THE SPIKES DRIVE
text: THEMSELVES INTO HER HEAD. She SCREAMS in agony.
dialog: 
text: Blood drips from beneath the crown, flowing into channels
text: around the edges of the altar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: It begins. You give birth to an
dialog: empire.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. THE SIDE OF THE SKULL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Conan climbs -- muscles straining -- slipping -- hanging on
text: by one hand -- and climbing again.
dialog: 
text: THUMP-THUMP. The statuary shakes, indeed the whole earth
text: does. Conan nearly slips, but keeps his grip.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Crom.
dialog: 
text: He reaches the eye of the skull.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: REVERSE ANGLE
dialog: 
text: With the moon over his shoulder, Conan stares down at the
text: unholy sight before him. We pull back revealing Tamara, her
text: blood draining from her body.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ACHERON CAVE - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Tamara, her face pale from blood loss, begins to pray in
text: pained whispers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: It's good that you pray. Gods will
dialog: be here soon.
dialog: 
text: Tamara struggles to speak, her body wracked with pain.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: He'll--be---here--sooner.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Who?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (O.S.)
dialog: Me!
dialog: 
text: Khalar turns to see the outline of Conan, framed by the
text: moonlight, looking down at Khalar from atop of one the
text: warrior statues. A thick vine dangles nearby, Conan's route
text: down from the cave roof above.
dialog: 
text: Conan then leaps down to the skeleton covered floor before
text: the altar. It is a killing floor.
dialog: 
text: The two Guardsmen leap for him, but Conan dispatches them
text: with a pair of strikes. Both fall down dead.
dialog: 
text: Conan meets Tamara's eyes, a look of determination,
text: assurance. He starts toward the altar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: I will say this for you, barbarian.
dialog: You are hard to kill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Let her go.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: You've faced me before and lost.
dialog: What do you think has changed now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: My purpose.
dialog: 
text: Conan lunges for Khalar, their swords meeting with a flash of
text: sparks. They fight to a brief standstill when ---THUMP,
speaker_heading: THUMP.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ALTAR
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tamara writhes in pain as the spikes drive deeper into her
text: head. More blood pours forth. The blood in the channels
text: speeds up and finds the channel leading down to the
text: sacrificial pool.
dialog: 
text: Conan makes another movement toward the altar, but Khalar
text: nimbly blocks his path.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: You are strong, Cimmerian, but we
dialog: both know you are not my equal.
dialog: 
text: Conan takes the burlap sack wrapped at his hip pulls it off.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Once you used my father to teach
dialog: your son a lesson about strength.
dialog: Now let me teach you.
dialog: 
text: Conan tosses out what is inside. It falls to the ground,
text: rolling to Khalar Singh's feet.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FARIQ'S HEAD
dialog: 
text: Khalar looks down at the ground -- at the head of his beloved
text: son, his eyes gone, replaced by molten metal. Khalar trembles
text: in shock and rage.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: No.
dialog: 
text: Khalar reaches for the severed head, giving Conan a brief
text: window to rush to Tamara's side. Conan tries to lift her off
text: the altar, but the bone shackles still pin her down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Cimmerian!!!
dialog: 
text: Enraged, Khalar CHARGES Conan throwing all his skill and
text: force into an all-out attack. Conan simply sidesteps it, then
text: shatters the bone shackle holding one of Tamara's wrists.
text: Before he can shatter the other, Khalar charges again.
dialog: 
text: Khalar swings, Conan spins, his blade catching Khalar's just
text: inches from his face. Conan throws Khalar off him, knocking
text: the warlord back ten feet. Khalar's attack is feral,
text: uncontrolled. He's lost his balance.
dialog: 
text: Spinning and striking blindly, Conan smashes the second
text: shackle on her wrist. He continues his motion, bringing his
text: sword around to meet Khalar's next strike.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Now Khalar looks like the enraged amateur, and Conan the more
text: polished warrior. Their battle takes them away from the
dialog: altar.
dialog: 
text: With her hands free, Tamara struggles to pull the spikes out
dialog: and remove the crown.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE KILLING FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Conan repels another Khalar attack, this time striking
text: Khalar's chest and drawing blood. The Guardsmen arrive from
text: the other side of the cave, drawing their swords.
dialog: 
text: Khalar waves them off, his fury aimed at the Cimmerian.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: The Queen. Shackle her!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ALTAR
dialog: 
text: In agony, Tamara pulls one of the spikes out, then another.
text: She pushes with all her might, lifting the crown of iron off
dialog: her bloodied head --
dialog: 
text: When the Guardsmen charge her, pin her down, and force the
text: crown back on.
dialog: 
text: THUMP, THUMP! The crown spikes imbed themselves even deeper
text: as Tamara SCREAMS. The blood now fills the channels of the
dialog: altar.
dialog: 
text: WE FOLLOW the trail of blood, down the side of the altar, in
text: a spiral channel around the leg, and in a wide circle around
text: the altar until reaching the channel's end --
dialog: 
text: THE FIRST DROP OF TAMARA'S BLOOD TOUCHES THE SACRIFICIAL
text: POOL. It BOILS instantly, multiplying itself exponentially,
text: bubbling forth and filling the entire pool.
dialog: 
text: AND ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. A massive earthquake jolts the
dialog: entire cave.
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE KILLING FLOOR
dialog: 
text: As Khalar Singh and Conan battle, the ground beneath them on
text: the wide cave floor CRACKS and SPLINTERS.
dialog: 
text: THUMP-THUMP! The earthquake intensifies and the entire floor
text: of the cave GIVES WAY, tumbling into an incredible abyss.
text: Conan and Khalar alike grab onto the only rocks they can
text: reach to prevent them from falling further.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Conan ends up against one of the walls on the side of the
text: cave. Khalar clings to the rocks on the edge of the sacred
dialog: pool.
dialog: 
text: Their bodies are illuminated by a fiery glow. They look
text: below, searching for the source of the glow.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACHERON
dialog: 
text: Another two hundred feet deep lies the golden spired city of
text: ancient Acheron. The cave is but a forechamber, the slightest
text: taste of the true glory and horror of Acheron.
dialog: 
text: And as they stare down into the ancient city, the shadows
text: there MOVE.
dialog: 
text: Is it a trick of the light? No. Whatever the dark forms are,
text: they are coming this way, climbing the tallest demonic spires
text: and leaping impossibly far to climb up after Conan and Khalar
dialog: Singh.
dialog: 
text: Khalar gazes down at the city with wide eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
dialog: Beyond my dreams --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ALTAR
dialog: 
text: Tamara, her body's blood nearly drained, is still shackled to
text: the altar, which now teeters over the edge of chasm, poised
text: to fall into the fiery depths.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Conan!!!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: On the other side of the abyss, Conan spots her and scales
text: the cave wall, up to a tiered plateau. He moves quickly,
text: trying to get to Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: 
text: Khalar watches, entranced, as the first of the creatures
text: rises out of the pit. They climb the walls like insects,
text: clinging to the walls, their heads swiveling like a praying
dialog: mantis.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
dialog: 
text: The look like the statues above -- a hybrid -- part human,
text: part demon. Their skin is a perfect black, armor carved of
text: black bone, faces once human but now demonic with blood red
text: eyes and gnashing teeth.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: They advance on Khalar Singh, who is furthest down now that
text: Conan climbs upward towards Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
speaker_heading: (IN ACHERONIAN)
dialog: I am Khalar Singh, King of Acheron.
dialog: I command you to kneel!
dialog: 
text: And this demonic horde advances right for him, their razor
text: sharp teeth bared. Unsure, Khalar grips his tulwars tight.
text: The demonic creatures draw close, and they -- kneel. They
text: climb out of the abyss and immediately lower their heads
dialog: before Khalar Singh.
dialog: 
text: Out of the corner of his eye, Khalar spots Conan, drawing
dialog: near.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (IN ACHERONIAN)
dialog: Show him the might of the army of
dialog: Acheron!
dialog: 
text: But they do not rush to follow the order. They stir. One of
text: them with more ornate bone armor than the rest looks over at
text: Khalar's Guardsmen.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ACHERONIAN COMMANDER
speaker_heading: (IN ACHERONIAN)
dialog: First, we feed.
dialog: 
text: Its voice is somewhere between a whisper and a hiss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: Fine. Take your fill. I will kill
dialog: him myself.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: Conan is on an intercept course with Tamara, leaping across
text: chasms from statue to statue. Just below him, the first wave
text: of Acheronian Warriors reach the Khalar's remaining
text: Guardsmen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR'S GUARDSMEN
dialog: 
text: Khalar's Guardsmen, who have been watching the events with
text: mouths agape, realize the danger too late. The horde of
text: Acheronian Warriors leaps on them and a massive battle ensues
text: between the demonic warriors and the soldiers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: 
text: His climbing is dizzying, reminiscent of his youth scaling

dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR
dialog: 
text: Intercepts Conan just below the altar, his tulwars at the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Your story ends here.
dialog: 
text: The two warriors square off, fighting even as they cling to
dialog: the statues.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ACHERONIAN WARRIORS
dialog: 
text: The demon warriors not only slay Khalar's Guardsmen, but rip
text: their still living bodies apart, dousing themselves in the
text: blood of their victims. It is a violent ritual, both
text: Bacchantic and gruesome.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR
dialog: 
text: Launches himself at Conan, his tulwars sparking off the stone
text: statuary. Conan leaps to another statue, parrying the blows.
text: Khalar overextends himself, and Conan's sword just barely
text: misses his throat.
dialog: 
text: Khalar pulls back, tries to settle himself. Conan's eyes
text: narrow, he knows what Khalar is doing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN (CONT'D)
text: Like a woman, Fariq cried and
dialog: begged me to spare him.
dialog: 
text: Khalar ROARS in rage, launching an all-out offensive. Conan
text: backs up slowly, waiting for his moment.
dialog: 
text: And it comes quickly. Conan ducks below the tulwars and CUTS
text: Khalar across the stomach. Khalar loses his balance and
text: falls, one hand grabbing a protruding statue arm, dangling
text: over the abyss.
dialog: 
text: Conan raises his sword to finish the job.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (O.S.)
dialog: Conan!!!
dialog: 
text: Conan glances down. The Acheronian Commander drank his fill,
text: and now moves to the altar itself, his claw stroking Tamara's
text: body. With one touch, the shackles open. He and the
text: Acheronian Warriors drag her pale body toward the abyss.
dialog: 
text: Khalar grins up at him through bloody teeth.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KHALAR SINGH
dialog: They take her to a place you can
dialog: never follow. Who will you fail,
dialog: Cimmerian? Your father or your
dialog: woman?
dialog: 
text: Conan leaps down to the altar. The Acheronian Warriors
text: attack. Standing atop the altar, Conan cuts down all comers,
text: cutting his way through the enemy, working his way to Tamara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: Tamara!!
dialog: 
text: They leap on Conan, impossibly fast. They stab him. They cut
text: him. But he does not stop. Even wounded, he throws them into
text: the abyss.
dialog: 
text: And he reaches Tamara, just before the Commander drags her
text: below. He grabs her arm. The Commander grabs her other arm,
text: baring his shark-like teeth.
dialog: 
text: BLAM! Conan punches him in the mouth with his free hand and
text: the Commander falls into the abyss.
dialog: 
text: The bloody Conan pulls Tamara up into his arms. Only for
text: Tamara to scream.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: Conan!
dialog: 
text: Conan spins just in time as Khalar strikes. Khalar's tulwar
text: narrowly misses, and Conan counters. His father's sword runs
dialog: Khalar Singh through.
dialog: 
text: Khalar's body falls into the abyss.
dialog: 
text: But the Acheronian Warriors surround them. Thousands climb
text: out of the abyss, teeth bared, closing in on the wounded
text: Conan. Tamara, badly weakened herself, grabs Conan.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Conan, you know what you must do.
dialog: Kill me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: It is the only way to end this. My
dialog: death gives others life.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONAN
dialog: I cannot.
dialog: 103.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA
dialog: You must. Your parents both
dialog: understood that purpose. Now it is
dialog: yours. Live, Conan.
dialog: 
text: A tear falls from Tamara's face. The demonic warriors prepare
dialog: to strike.
dialog: 
text: Conan drives his sword into Tamara's heart. The crown spikes
text: retract and it falls from her head, tumbling into the abyss.
dialog: 
text: BOOM! A seismic explosion shakes everything, an unearthly
text: GUST OF WIND pulling the Acheronian Warriors back down into
text: the abyss.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACHERONIAN CAVE
dialog: 
text: The cave begins to fall, massive sections of the roof
text: dropping in to decimate the pyramid and the city below.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALTAR
dialog: 
text: Conan pulls Tamara's body away, even as the world descends
text: into dust and debris.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Khalar's HORSE stands near the entrance. Conan puts Tamara's
text: body carefully atop the horse, then mounts it himself. He
text: positions her in front of him, his arms encircling her.
dialog: 
text: Conan gives her lifeless body one last kiss, her blood
text: staining his lips red, as his mother's did as a child.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH PLATEAU - DAWN
dialog: 
text: A blazing sun threatens to explode over the nearby mountains.
text: Conan holds a single torch in his hand. His look is hard.
dialog: Grim.
dialog: 
text: We pull back to reveal a funeral pyre, Tamara's body atop it.
text: Conan places the torch to the pyre. It quickly spreads.
dialog: 
text: We move in, closer and closer upon Conan's ice blue eyes, a
text: blazing fire erupting in them. A fire that will never be
text: extinguished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TAMARA (O.S.)
dialog: Live, Conan. Live.
dialog: 
text: FADE TO BLACK.
