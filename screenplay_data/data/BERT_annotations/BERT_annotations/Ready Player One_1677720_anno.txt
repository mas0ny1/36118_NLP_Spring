text: Based on the novel READY PLAYER ONE by Ernest Cline
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT - THE OASIS
text: We open on BETHESDA FOUNTAIN in the heart of New York’s
text: Central Park, then we pull up and away, hurtling backwards
text: over the city until we come to rest in TIMES SQUARE, which
text: has been blocked off for an EPIC STREET RACE.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
text: Huge crowds line the street, cheering on TWENTY EXOTIC
text: VEHICLES waiting at the starting line.
text: A MOTORBIKE straight from Road Warrior idles on the outside
text: lane. Most of the other racers are in STOCK CARS, every
text: driver wearing the same helmet.
dialog: These are SIXERS, we’ll get back to them later.
text: Interspersed with the Sixers are vehicles of every variety.
dialog: And when I say every variety I mean that some of them are
text: cars, and some of them are hover craft, and one of them is a
text: BLIMP with a jet engine on it.
text: Their drivers are every size, shape and color, too. They are
dialog: called GUNTERS. That too will be on the quiz.
dialog: The closer we get to the West Side of 7th Avenue, the more
text: Gunters there are. The second to last car is probably the
text: most bad-ass of the lot, a replica of DECKARD’S SPINNER from
scene_heading: BLADE RUNNER.
text: AECH, a handsome guy with the shoulders of a linebacker,
text: checks the OVERSIZED ENGINE strapped to the roof.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.)
dialog: Lemme guess - Mario Kart?
text: He turns to see PARZIVAL, standing beside his vintage
text: DELOREAN, literally the car from BACK TO THE FUTURE. He’s
text: nineteen years old, good-looking and fit.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: No. Designed it myself, actually.
dialog: Bad ass, right?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: It’s very Nintendo.
text: Their friendly rivalry requires busting on each other
dialog: constantly.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Better than your p.o.s. level 4
text: skin over a level 1 frame.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Weird that I’m still gonna outrace
dialog: you. What does that say?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: It says you’re delusional, Z. I’m
dialog: in the two spot. No way you get
dialog: farther.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Let’s see who makes it past 57th.
text: A SIREN signals the drivers to get in their cars. Parzival
text: makes a fist, Aech returns the salute.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: First to the key.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: First to the egg.
dialog: And they get in their cars.
scene_heading: EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE
text: A GUNSHOT starts the race and the cars roar onto Seventh
text: Avenue. Almost immediately, an Eighteen Wheeler runs a red
text: light and A THIRD OF THE CARS RAM RIGHT INTO IT.
text: And they literally explode. Just like that. Boom, half the
text: cars are incinerated. Nobody bats an eye or stops cheering.
scene_heading: IN THE DELOREAN
text: Parzival stomps on the accelerator, chasing Aech's dust. Cars
text: bump and jockey for position, but Parzival is careful to
text: avoid all of them, steering with tremendous precision.
scene_heading: ON 44TH STREET
text: Metal walls suddenly pop up from the street, incongruously
dialog: and with pretty much no logic to their placement. More of the
text: Sixer vehicles CRASH or SPIN OUT.
text: Aech has already passed them, and Parzival simply veers
text: through the debris.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Dumbasses. You don’t start from the
text: outside lanes.
text: He catches up with Aech, and, as they HANG a LEFT on 45th
text: street, he cuts past him on the inside.
dialog: Parzival’s winning. For now.
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS
text: Parzival hangs a RIGHT on 8th Avenue and puts the pedal to
text: the floor. On every block, a different obstacle emerges, and
text: each time another driver is taken out. SINKHOLES open at 47th
text: street, a MANIAC WITH A FLAMETHROWER sprays the intersection
text: at 50th street, and at 54th street...
text: A T-REX stomps out into the street and Parzival nimbly
text: swerves between its legs, just as its massive jaws POP THE
speaker_heading: BLIMP.
dialog: It’s not your typical street race.
scene_heading: EXT. 57TH STREET —- CONTINUOUS
text: Parzival turns right at 57th to get back over to Seventh
text: Avenue, and now AECH suddenly BOMBS OUT OF NOWHERE and PASSES
speaker_heading: HIM.
text: He flips Parzival the bird as he makes a left back onto
text: seventh. Parzival settles in behind him. Up ahead, a few
text: blocks away, is CENTRAL PARK.
text: But before that is 58th street. The whole block is in an
text: exaggerated state of construction, like an obstacle course,
text: leading up to A COLLAPSING CRANE.
dialog: It’s all a matter of timing and angle to get past the
text: collapsing crane, and Aech tries to take it AS SHARP AND AS
text: FAST as he can.
text: He clears the falling CRANE, but he’s going too fast. He
text: SKIDS OUT, and his car FLIPS OVER.
text: A MOMENT LATER, Parzival DRIFTS PAST HIM, going just a bit
text: slower. His DeLorean SKIDS, but he makes the turn.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yes!
scene_heading: HALF A MILE AHEAD --
text: A CEMENT TRUCK is backing up, narrowing the space Parzival
text: can drive through. He GUNS THE ENGINE, trying to get over
text: fast enough to get past the TRUCK before it seals him off...
text: But he’s too late. The DeLorean SLAMS into the truck, which
text: EXPLODES WITH WET CEMENT.
text: AECH APPROACHES the smoking, cement-covered DeLorean, as
text: Parzival climbs out through its dented gull-wing doors.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Really thought I was gonna make it.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I’m telling you, it’s rigged.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Dude, don’t go there.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: No other explanation.
text: Their conversation is interrupted by the ROAR OF AN ENGINE.
text: They turn to see the ROAD WARRIOR MOTORBIKE ZOOM PAST THEM,
text: seemingly headed straight for the truck, which now has the
text: street completely blocked off.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: This should be ugly.
text: The MOTORBIKE suddenly veers off the street and INTO THE
text: CONSTRUCTION ZONE. It plows over cones, then hits a stretch
text: of BROKEN SIDEWALK, one piece angled UP, and RAMPS OFF IT...
text: JUMPING THE TRUCK!
text: Aech and Parzival exchange a glance, then chase after the
text: motorbike.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY
text: THE ROAD WARRIOR BIKE speeds towards camera, fifty yards away
text: from the park entrance. The driver is stoic, completely
dialog: focused, absolutely determined to make it, and that’s when...
text: A METEOR (yes, I’m serious, a meteor) plunges from the sky
text: and slams into the street. The RIDER has to BAIL OUT as the
text: BIKE slams into the smoking rock and EXPLODES.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK —- CONTINUOUS
text: Parzival and Aech run up to the wreckage. The RIDER emerges
text: from the smoke, whipping off her helmet, revealing...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: A meteor?! Seriously?
text: Aech and Parzival gape at a woman in her early twenties;
text: raven hair, big hazel eyes, rounded cheekbones and a
text: perpetual smirk.
text: She HURLS HER HELMET at the Meteor. It too explodes.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: You almost made the park, you
dialog: realize how huge that is?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Do I have the key? No. Not huge.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: (star struck)
dialog: Hey. You’re Artemis!
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Yeah, I know.
text: She walks past them. Parzival, staring, has lost whatever
dialog: sense of cool he seemed to possess.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I love you. I mean... we love you.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: What he means is, we’re big fans.
dialog: We've read your stuff, seen your
dialog: channel...
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: You should come with us!
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: (to Aech)
dialog: He always like this?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: No.
dialog: (to Z, under his breath)
dialog: Dude, act like you’ve met a girl
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I just mean... to talk about
dialog: Halliday, and the Egg. And the
dialog: race.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: You guys are gunters? I mean,
text: serious, not just jerking off on
dialog: the weekend...?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
text: Not jerking off on weekends at all.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: My socially inept friend here was
dialog: the first to 49th, first to 55th...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wait a minute... you’re Parzival.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah, I know.
text: Artemis smiles, touche. She turns to Aech.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: So where is your place anyway?
scene_heading: INT. AECH’S BASEMENT - OASIS
text: A suburban rec room, circa the early 1980's. Movie and comic
text: book posters cover the wood-paneled walls. A vintage RCA
text: television is hooked up to a Betamax, a LaserDisc player, and
text: several vintage videogame consoles, most prominently an ATARI
dialog: 2600.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wow.
text: Aech leads Artemis in, Parzival right behind.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Show her the workshop.
text: Aech, ahead of him, kicks open the door to what should be a
dialog: closet...
scene_heading: ARTEMIS'S POV -- AN ENORMOUS WORKSHOP/GARAGE
text: Completely out of proportion to the room, Aech's garage is an
text: enormous space filled with exotic vehicles, including
text: replicas of the BATMOBILE, PEE WEE’S BICYCLE, and most
dialog: impressively...
text: An unfinished replica of a familiar GIANT ROBOT.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Is that...
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: The Iron Giant? Yeah, just got the
dialog: commission for it. No big deal.
text: Artemis checks out the surface of the enormous, stylized
text: robot. The unfinished parts of it are still a 3D grid.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Aech’s work is top rated on the
text: modboards.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: It’s mostly about getting the right
dialog: skins, what you can license, you
dialog: know? Like Matrix, Matrix kids,
dialog: forget it, but Star Wars, Marvel,
dialog: Dark Knight, the classic Ridley
dialog: Scotts...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Golden Age Spielberg?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Pre-Jurassic is a bitch.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Always wanted the Mothership from
dialog: Close Encounters.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Yeah, tough to find.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Tough to park.
text: Artemis laughs. Parzival lights up.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Never thought of that.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Oh, yeah, handling is an issue. I
dialog: mean you can’t build a Giant Robot
dialog: and have it ride like a Buick
dialog: Regal.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Buick... ?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
text: A shitty car from Halliday’s time.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Right.
text: Aech pulls the door shut. Music comes up... TEMPTATION, by
text: NEW ORDER, the original Factus 8 version, not the remix...
scene_heading: INT. AECH’S BASEMENT
text: Artemis bops around the room checking the place out. She
text: comes to THE HALLIDAY WALL, which is loaded with memorabilia.
dialog: (And no, we don’t know who he is yet, but we’re getting
dialog: there.)
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Whoa, great collection here.
text: Most prominently, the classic magazine cover from JANUARY 7,
text: 2040, the day Halliday died. It’s the photo of him in faded
text: jeans and a vintage Space Invaders T-shirt, the headline RIP
scene_heading: JAMES HALLIDAY, 1972-2040.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: So you're checking my private
dialog: Gunter stash - where's the quid pro
dialog: quo?
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: The jump.
text: Artemis debates whether or not to tell them.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
text: The sidewalk is cracked. Had to be
dialog: a reason, there always is with
dialog: Halliday.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Exactly. That’s what I’ve been
dialog: saying.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Please, not the “theory” again...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: “Theory”?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: The challenge is unwinnable. It’s
dialog: designed to drive us nuts.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Halliday wouldn’t do that.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Maybe he just made a mistake? I
dialog: mean, there was no one to bug test
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: No way, he never made mistakes.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Well... not totally true.
text: They both turn to look at him.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: He once screwed up a level of
dialog: Flunkie Sprat Three.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wow, that is some seriously deep
dialog: cut triv, Z. I gotta admit, you are
dialog: as hardcore a Halliday nerd as
dialog: anyone I’ve ever met.
text: Parzival blushes a bit. Aech notices this.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: We’re gunters. “First to the
dialog: key...”
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: “,.. first to the egg.”
text: She looks from Parzival to Aech, sizing them up.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: So how come you guys aren't ina
dialog: clan?
text: Parzival shakes his head.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Thank you, I’ve told him a million
dialog: times we'd be better off working
dialog: together. But Z thinks the only way
text: someone wins is solo.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Tell that to IOI and the Sixers.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: They won't win. Halliday won’t let
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: He’s dead, dude.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: The Oasis was his baby. He wouldn’t
dialog: set it up for some corporate borg-
dialog: spawn.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (aside, to Artemis)
dialog: He gets a little touchy about the
dialog: whole Halliday thing, thinks they
dialog: have some sort of bond.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: No, that’s not... I just think I
dialog: understand the guy, maybe
dialog: because...
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
speaker_heading: WADE!
text: Parzival is interrupted by a disembodied voice that echoes
text: out over the room, though only he seems to hear it.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Because why?
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
dialog: Wade! Have you seen my gloves?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Oh, crap.
text: Artemis looks at him quizzically.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry, it was awesome meeting you.
dialog: Gotta split.
text: And with that, PARZIVAL SUDDENLY DISAPPEARS...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CARGO VAN - THE REAL WORLD
text: And now we see WADE WATTS, the “real” Parzival, in the real
dialog: world.
dialog: 11.
text: He’s inside an 80’s vintage van with fogged over windows,
text: wearing a HAPTIC VISOR, which he quickly pulls off.
text: “Parzival” is an idealized version of Wade, in reality he is
text: shy and gangly, sporting worn corduroys and a baggy sweater.
text: And a pair of I0I-branded HAPTIC GLOVES.
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
dialog: They’re not on my desk. Where they
dialog: should be.
text: The conversation with his Aunt switches from the visor to a
text: mobile headset the size of a dime on his earlobe.
text: Wade tucks the gloves into a backpack and scrambles out of
text: the van, pushing past boxes of busted laptops, computer parts
dialog: and old car batteries.
scene_heading: EXT. CARGO VAN - NIGHT
text: The VAN is buried under other junked vehicles, arranged
text: perfectly so it’s hidden from the outside world. Wade locks
text: the door behind him, keeping the conversation going.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Why would I take your gloves?
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
dialog: Because you spend every waking
dialog: moment in the Oasis and you don’t
dialog: have your own.
scene_heading: EXT. JUNKPILE - NIGHT
text: Wade emerges from the mound of old cars into an empty
text: playground. He checks to make sure no one saw him come out of
text: his secret hideout, then keeps moving.
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
dialog: Where are you, anyway?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I’m out with some friends.
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
dialog: You don’t have any friends.
scene_heading: EXT. PORTLAND AVENUE STACKS - NIGHT
text: Wade has now arrived at his destination: THE STACKS.
dialog: 12.
text: Dozens of MOBILE HOMES stacked on top of each other,
text: connected by a makeshift network of recycled pipes, girders,
text: and support beams. There are a dozen Stacks in all, the
text: future’s version of suburban tract housing.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I actually just met someone I
dialog: really like.
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
dialog: A real person?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Funny.
text: The lower trailers -- and other empty wall spaces -- are
text: punctuated with the occasional bit of political graffiti.
text: Most of the references are to “IOI”, an organization that
dialog: seems particularly unpopular with people who like writing
text: slogans on walls.
text: As he runs through the streets, he passes two kids wearing
text: “REB” t-shirts; a picture of a leader called “JC3” in the
text: same vein as Che Guevara. They take potshots at overhead IOI
text: DELIVERY DRONES with air rifles.
text: They wing one of the drones which sputters and falls, almost
text: hitting a stray dog.
text: Wade MUTES his headset for a moment as he hustles past them.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell, guys?
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: IOI, brah. Gotta stop ‘em.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: By shooting someone’s tube socks
dialog: out of the sky?
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Stuff it in your suckchute, loser.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Suckchute, that's new.
speaker_heading: ALICE (0.S.)
dialog: Still need my gloves, Wade.
text: Wade jumps up and grabs on to the skeletal metal structure
text: that keeps the whole stack in place. He starts CLIMBING.
dialog: 13.
scene_heading: EXT. WADE’S STACK - NIGHT
text: We follow Wade as he scrambles up the outside of the stack.
text: The climb grows increasingly perilous as he goes. Physically,
dialog: Wade’s no specimen, but this is one thing in the real world
dialog: that he is actually good at.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Just remembered where they are.
text: He finally reaches his unit. He peers through the BATHROOM
text: WINDOW, then climbs through it.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: In the pitch dark bathroom, Wade cracks the door and can now
text: see his AUNT ALICE, 30’s and haggard in a meth-y kind of way,
text: standing in the living room.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: They’re in the kitchen. On top of
dialog: the fridge.
text: Alice turns to look at the kitchen, AWAY from Wade. When she
text: starts to walk in that direction, Wade makes his move.
scene_heading: INT. WADE'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
text: Wade dashes into the messy, cramped living room. He quickly
text: stashes the gloves under the COUCH CUSHIONS, then walks as
text: quietly as he can to the front door.
text: Alice, annoyed, paces back into the living room...
speaker_heading: ALICE (INTO HEADSET)
dialog: I can’t be late again.
text: ++. just as Wade walks IN through the front door.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: They're right there, Alice.
text: He points to the gloves, sticking out from under the couch
dialog: cushions.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: See? I didn’t have em.
text: Alice, slightly chastened, takes the gloves from him, then
text: settles into a recliner.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: RICK (0.S.)
dialog: That is bull pucky, amigo.
text: A FLUSH from the bathroom as RICK, Alice’s white trash
text: boyfriend, walks into the living room.
text: Wade grimaces, realizing...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You were in there when...
speaker_heading: RICK
text: Fell asleep, it was a long one.
dialog: (to Alice)
dialog: This lying bastard had the gloves.
text: Rick continues past them and into the kitchen. Alice glares
dialog: at Wade.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Damnit Wade, bad enough you don’t
dialog: have a job without screwing up
dialog: mine. Now you can’t use ‘em at all.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What? But I...
text: Alice waves him away, slipping on her IOI gear. She speaks
text: into her official IOI headset and waves her hands awkwardly.
speaker_heading: ALICE (INTO HEADSET)
dialog: (monotone)
dialog: This way, please...
text: Wade glares at Rick, now tugging on a beer. Rick shrugs.
scene_heading: INT. WADE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Wade enters the tiny slice of the unit he calls his room.
text: Outside his window, like a cruel taunt, is a giant billboard
text: advertising a SHAPTIC@ BRAND HAPTIC BOOTSUIT, a totally
text: badass immersion rig for logging in to the Oasis.
text: The BILLBOARD advertisement reads “Log In!” and features a
text: muscular guy modeling a suit that promises “Total Interface”
dialog: and “Real-time Neuromuscular Response!”
text: Hold on Wade, staring up at that ad.
dialog: 15.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY (REAL WORLD)
text: Wade wakes up, wipes the sleep from his eyes. It might be
dialog: from spending too much time in the Oasis, but there’s a
text: moment of hopefulness, like maybe he’s someplace awesome...
text: But nope, same crappy apartment, same billboard taunting him.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HOUSE - MORNING
text: Wade pours himself a bowl of cereal and milk water (milk-
text: flavored water). From the kitchen table, through an open
text: door, Wade can see into his aunt’s bedroom.
text: Alice is passed out from a long night of work, Rick lies
text: asleep on top of her, drooling. Wade cringes.
text: CLOSE ON -- the HAPTIC GLOVES and VISOR sitting on Alice’s
text: desk. They’re YANKED out of frame --
scene_heading: INT. CARGO VAN - DAY (REAL WORLD)
text: Back in his hideout, Wade slips his VISOR on, then logs in.
text: He sees the last three words anyone sees before leaving the
dialog: real world for the Oasis:
scene_heading: READY PLAYER ONE
scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET -- THE OASIS
text: INCIPIO, the MAIN PLANET of the Oasis, is a giant city filled
dialog: with every building or structure, real or fictional, you can
dialog: possibly imagine.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: When Halliday first built the
dialog: Oasis, it was an open-world,
text: massively-multiplayer online game.
dialog: Over time it grew into way more
dialog: than that.
text: Parzival suddenly appears, mid stride. He passes the Eiffel
text: Tower next to the Taj Mahal, with EXXON/WHOLEFOODS corporate
text: headquarters jammed between them.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: One of his biggest ideas was tying
dialog: your avatar into your DNA, using
dialog: their proprietary software. One
dialog: account per person, no exceptions.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Everyone started equal in the
dialog: Oasis. And it was free.
text: Parzival opens his HUD, his “heads up display” which appears
text: as a seamless interface with the world around him. He has
text: gamer attributes -- SPEED, STRENGTH, MAGIC, AIM -- and an
text: INVENTORY for weapons, spells, and vehicles.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.0O.)
dialog: Your avatar was fully upgradeable,
dialog: but that took experience. And
dialog: money.
text: The DELOREAN is in there, currently marked “damaged”. The
text: price to fix it is 5,000 gold coins. His account has a
dialog: balance of 4,560.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: (using a voice command)
dialog: Locate Aech.
text: An image of AECH comes up; like the graphics over any sports
text: broadcast, his avatar moves and poses and winks.
text: “LOCATING...” appears.
text: Wade continues on his way, passing through what looks like
text: the heart of the city. Off to his right is the main
text: GREGARIOUS GAMES headquarters, a gleaming, castle-like tower.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
text: Once the Oasis took off, Halliday'’s
dialog: partner Ogden Morrow got pushed
dialog: out. Since Halliday died, no one
dialog: knew exactly who ran the Oasis
dialog: anymore. But a good guess?
text: Just down the block from Gregarious is IOI HEADQUARTERS, a
text: massive, corporate monstrosity.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: IOI, Innovative Online Industries.
text: They build the haptic gear. The
dialog: gloves, the visors...
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HIDEOUT - THE REAL WORLD
text: Wade lies in his haptic rig, a series of quick cuts of THE
text: IOI LOGO, on Wade’s gloves, visor, the boots... IOI has their
dialog: name on everything.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: EXT. INCIPIO (OASIS)
dialog: Back in Incipio...
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Which means they control most
dialog: people’s access to the Oasis.
text: Parzival checks his HUD, Aech is still being “located”.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Halliday kept IOI in line. But now?
dialog: Well if you asked the rebels, IOI’s
dialog: plan was to turn the Oasis into a
dialog: hellish place where rules were
dialog: numerous and always followed.
speaker_heading: AECH (0.S.)
dialog: S'up, Z?
text: AECH now appears in a window in a close-up, clearly real time
text: footage. Wherever he is it’s loud and dusty, and bursts of
text: smoke and gunfire make it difficult to see and hear.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I'm trying to win the musket of
dialog: infinite velocity.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: But people loved the Oasis ‘cause
dialog: it was free. At least in spirit,
dialog: you could do anything.
text: The camera suddenly TAKES OFF, shooting away from Parzival...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTER SPACE --
text: And into OUTER SPACE.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Halliday built an entire universe,
dialog: something for everyone...
text: We SHOOT ACROSS THE GALAXY, passing countless planets...
text: One of them seems to be a huge SPACECRAFT, IMPOSSIBLY LARGE.
text: But as we pass it we see that it is the LETTER “S"”, floating
dialog: in space. The rest of the word is so big we can’t make it out
dialog: from this perspective.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Which is how you end up with a
dialog: place like Planet Doom.
text: We approach a planet that seems to have beautiful and
text: elaborate weather systems swirling around it. As we get
text: closer, we realize that the “weather” is actually EXPLOSIONS,
text: from a never-ending war.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: The first gamers in the Oasis
dialog: walked around blowing each other
text: away right in front of everyone
dialog: else. Halliday realized he needed
dialog: to draw some boundaries. He divided
dialog: the Oasis into combat zones, or
text: PVP, and non-combat zones.
text: As we descend from the atmosphere, we pass over “The Dark
text: Side” of Planet Doom, which is sealed off from the war zones
text: by a giant wall known as Anorak’s Fence.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: He migrated all the most violent
dialog: first person shooters to one
text: planet. One giant PVP zone.
speaker_heading: EXT. APPOMATTOX (OASIS)
text: We swoop in from the atmosphere to reveal a perfectly
text: rendered vision of the battle of Appomattox, with some small
dialog: changes.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.)
dialog: Who you up against?
text: Mixed in with the soldiers are a bunch of avatars that are
text: way out of context.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: The South. But also Aliens. And the
dialog: Roman Legion, I think.
text: Aech is on the Union side, a musket with one hand, and a
text: futuristic BLASTER in the other.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Think I might’ve figured something
dialog: out. Wanna swing by the journals
dialog: and take another run at the key?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Wish I could.
dialog: 19.
text: As he moves across the field, Aech shoots an Alien with his
text: musket, then a Confederate soldier with his blaster. As they
text: explode, their COINS shower to the ground. A VACUUM TUBE on
text: Aech’s shoulder sucks them right into his inventory.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: This sesh has got another five
dialog: hours, minimum. DAMNIT!
text: Aech just got winged in the ribs by an enchanted ARROW.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Aech was my best friend in the
dialog: Oasis, probably my best friend
dialog: period, even though I'd never met
dialog: him.
text: Aech launches himself into the fray, racking up kills.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: He also had a lot of stuff,
dialog: including a dope spaceship. So I
dialog: was always hitting him up for
dialog: rides.
scene_heading: EXT. INCIPIO STREETS - THE OASIS
text: Aech’s window disappears, so Parzival toggles his HUD to
dialog: navigation.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: (voice command)
dialog: Memoir-opolis.
text: A pathway suddenly lights up in front of him, showing him the
dialog: path to take.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: The Oasis was like the real world
dialog: in that respect; the more money you
dialog: had, the more stuff you got, and
dialog: the more stuff, the easier it was
dialog: to get around, and thus get even
dialog: more stuff.
text: Wade heads towards a train station. The train tracks head UP
text: AND OFF THE PLANET.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: I think that’s why Halliday’s
dialog: challenge was such a big deal. It
dialog: wasn’t just the money.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: For someone like me, it was the
dialog: chance to go from peasant to king
text: in a heartbeat.
text: Wade takes a seat on a bench at the train station, waiting
dialog: for his ride.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Like everyone else, I remember
dialog: exactly where I was the day the
dialog: contest was announced... the day
dialog: James Halliday died.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO --
scene_heading: INT. LUDUS -- OASIS
text: A giant, virtual classroom. PARZIVAL is one of a thousand
text: avatars sitting and listening to a virtual ALBERT EINSTEIN
dialog: teach them rudimentary science.
text: Suddenly, everyone in the room gets an alert...
scene_heading: JAMES HALLIDAY, DEAD AT 62.
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT - DAY -- THE REAL WORLD
text: WADE, 13 years old, rips his early-iteration headset off. His
text: eyes fill with tears.
text: He is in his cozy childhood home. There are boxes everywhere,
text: the family has just moved in. In the background, his FATHER
text: paints the living room wall while his MOTHER cooks dinner.
text: When she sees her boy crying, she runs over to comfort him.
dialog: Despite the tragedy, clearly these were happier times for
dialog: Wade.
scene_heading: EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR (OASIS)
text: At a funeral parlor, people dressed in black mourn before an
text: open casket...
text: The body inside is JAMES HALLIDAY, shiny quarters cover each
text: of his eyelids.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: But it wasn’t his death that
dialog: changed everything. It was his
dialog: will.
dialog: 21.
text: IN THE CASKET -- Halliday’s avatar suddenly SITS UPRIGHT and
text: begins talking to camera.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: Hello. I’m James Halliday. If
dialog: you're watching this, I’m dead.
text: He snaps his fingers and a SCROLL appears in his hand. He
text: unfurls it to the floor and begins reading aloud...
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I, James Donovan Halliday, do
dialog: hereby declare this to be my last
dialog: will and testament...
text: A CAPTION at the bottom of the screen reads:
dialog: “Halliday's Announcement"
dialog: (archival footage property of GGS)
scene_heading: INT. ANORAK’S CASTLE (OASIS)
text: Now Halliday appears inside a castle as ANORAK, his avatar, a
text: tall, robed wizard with a slightly more handsome version of
text: Halliday's face.
speaker_heading: ANORAK
dialog: Before I died, I created my own
dialog: Easter egg, and hid it somewhere
text: inside the OASIS. The first person
dialog: to find the egg will inherit my
dialog: entire fortune and earn complete
dialog: control of the Oasis.
text: A simple RHYME appears as a subtitle in front of Halliday as
text: he speaks.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
text: Three hidden keys open three secret
dialog: gates/ Wherein the errant will be
dialog: tested for worthy traits/ And those
dialog: with the skill to survive these
dialog: straits/ Will reach the end where
dialog: the prize awaits. Now here is the
dialog: clue for the first key...
speaker_heading: EXT. TRAIN (OASIS)
text: Parzival boards a high-speed train. His HUD IMAGE OF CREDITS
text: appears and is lightened by 10 coins. Everything in the Oasis
dialog: costs something.
dialog: 22.
text: He takes a seat next to two ridiculously proportioned WOMEN
text: who chat loudly. Parzival MUTES them.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: The corporate overlords at IOI
dialog: weren't as excited about the
dialog: contest.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBUS, THE REAL WORLD --
text: Push in on three sleek skyscrapers in gleaming downtown
text: Columbus, Ohio in the shape of the letters IOI.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: The thought of new ownership
dialog: terrified them.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS
text: Inside the building, a sea of workers in rows of Haptic
text: Decks. A buzzing hive of activity; like a trading firm, all
text: working to solve Anorak’s challenge.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: They started their own division of
dialog: egg hunters.
text: We see all of the IOI EMPLOYEES AVATARS have the same default
text: outfits and instead of names, NUMBERS. All of them start with
dialog: a “six”.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: We call em “Sixers” ‘cause that’s
dialog: the rule, no name, just numbers.
dialog: They put this Kardash named Nolan
dialog: Sorrento in charge.
text: AN INTERVIEW -- with a slick, ambitious guy in his forties
text: who is clearly trying to burnish his image.
scene_heading: A chyron reads NOLAN SORRENTO, EXECUTIVE VP, IOI.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Sorrento was the lead sixer. The
text: face of IOI's team.
text: The program CUTS TO Sorrento giving a tour of his lavish
text: home, trying to show a more human side.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I love games. I love being inside
dialog: the Oasis.
dialog: 23.
text: Despite the fact that his whole house is luxurious, his rig
text: is particularly ostentatious: a rotating full body 3D
text: Immersive Haptic Interface, like a hamster ball.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: The one luxury I spoil myself with
dialog: is the best haptic immersion rig
dialog: money can buy.
text: We see B-Roll of his enormous house, his attractive FAMILY.
text: His admittedly cute dog.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Despite the charm offensive,
dialog: Sorrento was a scary dude. He made
dialog: his bones in IOI’s security and
dialog: adjustment division.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBUS SUBURBS -- FLASHBACK
text: A younger Nolan Sorrento leads a team of jack-booted IOI
text: thugs as they break down someone’s door. A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL
text: with a DISTINCTIVE BIRTHMARK watches as Sorrento reads off a
text: list of debts to her FATHER, then has him dragged out of the
dialog: house.
text: The girl runs after her father, Sorrento sticks out his foot
text: and TRIPS HER.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Now he was in charge of IOI’s egg
dialog: hunt, but you could tell his heart
dialog: wasn’t in it.
scene_heading: INT. SORRENTO’S HOME
text: Sorrento’s interview continues...
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: At IOI, we love hunting for the
dialog: egg, it’s part of what makes the
dialog: Oasis so fun.
text: It’s the least convincing expression of enthusiasm ever.
speaker_heading: EXT. INCIPIO (OASIS)
text: The TRAIN rockets up and out of the city, impossibly fast.
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: The first clue was easy, some long-
dialog: forgotten gunter cracked it ina
dialog: week. But the challenge -- the race
dialog: through Times Square -- was
dialog: incredibly hard.
text: The train arrives at his stop, one of the many moons of
text: Incipio. A sign at the station reads: MEMOIR-OPOLIS.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Five years went by and no one came
text: close to beating it. Most people
dialog: gave up. The sixers couldn’t, they
dialog: had no choice. The rest of us, the
dialog: Gunters, as in “egg hunters”...
dialog: well, we didn’t have an excuse. We
dialog: just had a dream.
scene_heading: EXT. OASIS -- MEMOIR-OPOLIS
text: Parzival strolls down a street lined with what look like
text: homes, but are actually a row of “memory palaces”, basically
text: auto-biographies represented in tangible form.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: At this point, you're probably
dialog: wondering why a nobody, me, is
dialog: telling you his life story.
text: The “titles” of these “books” float in front of the memory
text: palaces in various fonts. As this is prime real estate, they
dialog: are mostly people anyone from 2044 would know.
scene_heading: MOGUL -- THE MADDOX JOLIE PITT STORY
text: THE UNABRIDGED LETTERS OF SKRILLEX
text: JaRICHARD CHENEY IV, MY LIFE AS A REBEL -- yes, Dick Cheney’s
text: grandson is the dreadlocked, blunt-smoking leader of the
text: Rebs, known as JRC. That was him on the kid’s t-shirt
dialog: earlier.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Point is this; I tell my story
dialog: cause that's what Halliday did. He
dialog: knew our lives would be
text: memorialized in the Oasis, and
dialog: people like me would want to know.
text: Parzival passes “OGDEN MORROW, MY LIFE SO FAR”.
dialog: 25.
text: Finally he comes to the building he’s looking for; HALLIDAY’S
speaker_heading: JOURNALS .
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: And if that seems grandiose on my
dialog: part, if this seems like some rand-
dialog: o day in the life of some rand-o
dialog: nobody, it’s not. This is the day I
dialog: stopped being a nobody.
scene_heading: INT. HALLIDAY’S JOURNALS - OASIS
text: Parzival enters a large lobby with many doors, each of them
text: heading into a different part of Halliday’s life.
text: THE HISTORIAN, a doddering NPC with an attitude, suddenly
text: appears before him. (An NPC is a bot, an AI).
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: Parzival. How shocking to see you
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: What’s up, not-real but sarcastic
dialog: program?
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: So, Halliday’s childhood again?
dialog: Comb through his VHS library? Chew
dialog: up my valuable search time?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Nah, today I need to check out
text: something pretty obscure.
dialog: Halliday’s one mistake.
text: The Historian raises an eyebrow, intrigued.
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: His mistake. Flunkie Sprat Three?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Yeah. This girl said something to
dialog: me, I’ve been thinking about it all
dialog: day.
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: I'm feigning interest.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: (ignoring that)
dialog: I mean, maybe it’s cause she’s hot.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: If she had said “I love pork
dialog: rinds,” would I be thinking about
dialog: pork rinds? Possibly...
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: Please, go on, I’m fascinated.
dialog: He isn’t.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Damn, now I am thinking about pork
text: rinds.
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: Is that the end? Great story,
dialog: Parzival.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: My point is, what if he made a
dialog: mistake?
scene_heading: INT. HALLIDAY’S JOURNALS - HALLWAY
text: The Historian leads Parzival to a door. Parzival opens it and
text: steps inside.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: With the contest, I mean. What if
dialog: he made a mistake on purpose?
scene_heading: INT. GREGARIOUS GAMES -- 1993 (THE REAL WORLD)
dialog: But for the presence of Parzival and the Historian, the
dialog: recreation is absolutely flawless. We ARE in 1993, in the
text: offices of Gregarious Games, where a much younger James
text: Halliday, hung over, can’t stop talking about his night.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: She's incredible, Ogden. I mean...
dialog: I never met anyone like her. I
dialog: drank too much, like an idiot, I’m
dialog: a total lightweight.
text: A frustrated OGDEN MORROW, rotund, with an unruly beard and
text: wire-rimmed spectacles, is Halliday’s partner. He inspects
text: the code Halliday has written for PD3.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: (re: the code)
dialog: What did you do here?
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: She told me to call her. Do I do
dialog: that tomorrow? When? I’m terrible
dialog: at this stuff.
speaker_heading: MORROW
text: Data is leaking all over the place.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: I really do wonder why people
dialog: bother with relationships, it’s
text: incredibly messy and confusing.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: Yeah, partnerships are that way
dialog: too.
text: Morrow pushes back from the desk.
speaker_heading: MORROW (CONT'D)
dialog: You blew it this time, Hal.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: I got the level finished.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: Oh, it’s finished. With one minor
dialog: bug. You did it backwards. Flunkie
text: starts at the end and sprats his
text: way backwards to the beginning.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: Can’t we just reverse the...
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.)
dialog: STOP!
text: The scene suddenly freezes. Parzival turns to the Historian.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
text: Play again from minor bug.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: «+. minor bug. You did it
dialog: backwards.
text: Hold on Parzival, wide eyed.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO VAN - THE REAL WORLD
text: Wade suddenly yanks the haptic visor off, breathing heavily.
dialog: He’s got it.
dialog: 28.
scene_heading: EXT. ANORAK'S RACE - OASIS
text: A new crowd of RACERS wait at the starting line with their
dialog: cars.
text: Aside from the usual, indistinguishable sixers, we see SHOTO
text: and DAITO. Both are Japanese, in their twenties, bearing a
text: striking resemblance to one another. They each wear matching
text: suits of traditional samurai armor, a short wakizashi and
text: longer katana strapped to their belts. They also drive
text: matching Speed Racer cars.
text: Parzival walks towards his DeLorean, in the center lane.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Hey Parzival, what‘’s up?
text: They speak in Japanese, which we hear faintly, because it is
dialog: instantly translated to English.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Shoto, Daito.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Dude, you're in the newb lane.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Just testing out a new engine Aech
dialog: threw in.
text: Daito nods. Shoto seems unconvinced. Parzival gives the
text: gunter salute.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: First to the key.
speaker_heading: SHOTO DAITO
text: First to the egg. First to the egg.
scene_heading: AT THE STARTING LINE --
text: The race begins with a gunshot and instantly Shoto, Daito and
text: the Sixers speed off.
text: Parzival’s DeLorean doesn’t move.
text: As the rest of the racers disappear around a curve, Parzival
text: puts his car in REVERSE and drives backward, and then...
dialog: 29.
scene_heading: EXT. SEWER SYSTEM - OASIS
text: The ground gives way and the DeLorean lands with a thump in
text: the sewer system. Parzival stomps on the accelerator and the
text: car AUTOMATICALLY GOES BACKWARDS.
text: Parzival laughs as he shoots through a winding tunnel.
text: Then the sewer ramps UP and the DeLorean shoots out back into
dialog: the race.
scene_heading: EXT. RACE TRACK - OASIS
text: As he emerges, and because he is driving backwards, Parzival
text: can instantly see that he is way ahead of the pack and EVERY
text: OBSTACLE in the game is FALLING BEHIND HIM.
text: He can see the T-REX licking its claws and waiting on 54th
text: street, the CRANE not yet toppled, the CEMENT TRUCK not yet
text: moving. He can even see the TRAIL OF THE METEOR on a
text: trajectory towards the park.
text: It doesn’t matter, it’s all behind him. He sees Shoto and
text: Daito crash, then glances in his rearview. He’s just entered
dialog: Central Park.
scene_heading: EXT. CENTRAL PARK - OASIS
text: The DeLorean SPINS OUT and ends up facing forward RIGHT AT
scene_heading: BETHESDA FOUNTAIN.
text: Parzival gets out. As he walks towards the fountain, he calls
text: AECH up in a video-chat window.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: What’s up 2?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Aech, my good friend.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Great question. Do you recognize
dialog: this?
text: PARZIVAL flips AECH to HIS POV...
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: WAIT. Bethesda Fountain? No. Oh my
dialog: god. Dude! You made it!
dialog: 30.
text: As Parzival walks around the fountain, interference causes
text: his HUD to disappear, hanging up on Aech. Probably because
dialog: he’s so close to...
scene_heading: THE COPPER KEY
text: Parzival snatches it out of the air. He stares at the key for
text: a long moment, then can't resist: HE HOLDS IT UP LIKE
speaker_heading: EXCALIBUR.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I... am... PARZIVAL!
text: His bellow echoes out over the park. He feels a bit stupid
text: for a second. Then a DOOR APPEARS.
text: Parzival sticks the key in, and the door opens. As he does,
text: we WHIP AROUND THE OASIS in what some might call...
dialog: A MONTAGE!
scene_heading: EXT. OASIS
text: Aech is standing on a distant planet, impatiently waiting for
text: a TRANSPORT SPOT to open up.
text: A BRILLIANT LIGHT IN THE SKY draws his attention.
text: It’s the scoreboard! There’s a name at the top now...
text: Parzival. If Aech had programmed his avatar to cry, it would.
scene_heading: INT. PLANET DOOM
text: Artemis is in a private chat room -- unlike Aech’s, it is
text: austere and functional -- with her GUNTER CLAN. Conversation
text: is hushed, secretive. Then a KNOCK at the door startles them,
text: everyone pulls their weapons (various guns and blasters and
dialog: knives).
text: Artemis checks the peephole. It’s one of her clan members,
text: excitedly knocking on the door.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Arty! Ya gotta come check this out!
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET DOOM
text: Artemis steps outside and appears next to her clan mate.
text: Planet Doom is experiencing a rare, momentary peace.
text: Artemis looks up, to see why. It’s the Scoreboard.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Ho... lee...
text: She smiles, ear to ear. As we zoom to our next location...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS - BOARD ROOM
text: A massive VIRTUAL BOARD MEETING is taking place, NOLAN
text: SORRENTO’s avatar is making a presentation about “The Loyalty
dialog: Initiative”, a program that involves the construction of
text: multiple LOYALTY CENTERS around the world.
text: On an interactive MAP, we see there’s one in Columbus, one in
dialog: Oklahoma City, and many more planned. Then...
text: Something catches Sorrento’s eye. Out the window. His voice
text: drifts off...
scene_heading: EXT. IOI CORPORATE SKY DECK - NIGHT
text: SORRENTO walks out onto an outdoor executive deck. He can see
text: that THOUSANDS OF SIXERS have filed out into the courtyard
text: below, all gazing and pointing at the sky like extras ina
text: Spielberg film. He looks up to see.....
text: FULL REVEAL -- THE SCOREBOARD, shining brightly in the night
text: sky above.
text: There are ten spaces that for five years have been empty.
dialog: But now...
scene_heading: 1ST PLACE: PARZIVAL -- 100,000 POINTS
text: Just to hear it said, Sorrento repeats the single name that
text: has suddenly jeopardized everything he believes in.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Parzival.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. INCIPIO - DAY
text: Parzival suddenly appears on a street on Incipio, the key
text: hanging around his neck.
text: It takes him a moment to notice, then he realizes that
text: everyone is staring up in the sky, pointing. He looks up to
text: see his name up there, as big as the sun.
dialog: 32.
text: Parzival is absorbing the magnitude of this when his HUD
text: suddenly comes up and his COIN COUNTER shoots from 827 to
text: 100,000. Instantly.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Sweet Mama Cass!
text: Then his message queue pops up. He has over fifty thousand
text: messages waiting for him, the number jumps by another
dialog: thousand every second.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, World.
text: Then he hears voices...
speaker_heading: VOICES
dialog: Parzival! Look, Parzival! It’s him!
text: He’s been spotted.
text: Parzival laughs as he is surrounded by AVATARS, all looking
dialog: for a word or a chance to look at the key, or even just a
text: moment next to the most famous man in the Oasis.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
scene_heading: INT. WADE'S HOME - SOMETIME LATER (REAL WORLD)
text: In stark contrast to the Oasis, in real life Wade sits in his
text: Aunt’s apartment in the Stacks, drumming his fingers.
dialog: Waiting.
text: HIS POV -- Aunt Alice, wearing their only haptic deck, is
text: "working", pointing left and right.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STACKS - DAY (REAL WORLD)
text: Wade, burning off nervous energy, walks around the Stacks
text: checking the time and occasionally glancing at the sky.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S APARTMENT -- LATER (REAL WORLD)
text: RICK is now wearing the haptic deck, playing some sort of
text: lame first person shooter. He contorts his body and complains
text: as he keeps getting shot.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: That’s bullshit! You didn’t hit me.
dialog: You're cheating! This game is
text: friggin’ rigged.
text: WADE watches mutely from the kitchen. No way he can get back
text: online. It’s like a nightmare.
scene_heading: EXT. WADE’S STACK (REAL WORLD)
text: Wade is now standing outside the stacks, checking the time
text: and watching the skies. The REB KIDS are spray-painting the
text: side of a stack.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Hey look, it’s the loser!
speaker_heading: REB 2
dialog: Eat a dickbagel, loser!
text: Wade looks over at the kids and double takes.
text: Their t-shirts? A PICTURE OF PARZIVAL holding up the JADE
dialog: KEY! Someone’s screengrab that they printed up and sold. It
text: causes Wade to burst out laughing.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Nice shirts.
speaker_heading: REB 2
dialog: They are nice, butt-chee.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: What’s so funny?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You, mostly.
text: Wade notices a DRONE dropping from the sky, heading towards
text: them. One of the reb kids grabs his air rifle...
text: Wade snatches it out of his hands.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t even think about it.
text: The kids are taken aback by Wade’s sudden confidence.
text: The drone lands beside Wade and a signature screen pops up.
text: Wade signs it and the package releases.
speaker_heading: REB
dialog: Those aren't socks.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You're a pair of socks. Get out of
dialog: here.
text: Wade tosses them the air gun. The kids run away. Amazing what
dialog: a little confidence will do.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HIDEOUT (REAL WORLD)
text: Like a kid on Christmas Day, Wade tears open the package...
text: It’s the SHAPTIC@ BRAND HAPTIC BOOTSUIT, the same one he’s
text: been looking at every day out his window.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh yes, my sweet, sweet love.
text: He hugs the suit to his chest, the happiest kid in the world.
scene_heading: EXT. WHITE SANDS - OASIS
text: Nolan Sorrento’s avatar stands in the middle of an enormous,
text: white sand desert. He waits impatiently, when suddenly...
text: A SPACESHIP DROPS DOWN in front of him, kicking up a cloud of
text: sand. It looks similar to SLAVE 1, Boba Fett’s ship from Star
dialog: Wars, but not so similar that a lawsuit could be filed.
text: A MASSIVE WARRIOR emerges from the ship, A SPACE KNIGHT, all
text: in black, weapons bristling across his body. Imagine the
text: Hound from Game of Thrones crossed with a goth Master Chief
dialog: from Halo.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Six, old friend, how are you?
text: This is NUMBER SIX, an Oasis Bounty Hunter, and he is scary
text: as shit, except for his voice. It’s incongruously nasal and
text: unintimidating.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: I'm okay, I’ve got a neck thing,
dialog: some sort of carpal tunnel deal but
dialog: in your neck? So if you could stay
dialog: on this side of me...
text: He motions for Sorrento to step to his left.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Yeah, sure.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Thanks, just the repetitive stress,
dialog: you know...
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I get it. I have a job for you,
dialog: Six.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Yeah, kinda figured that when you
dialog: sent me the message about having a
dialog: job for me. Who’s the target?
text: Sorrento flings a “DATA PACKET” at Six. It instantly unfolds
text: into a HUD filled with info.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (CONT’D)
dialog: Duh. Should’ve seen that coming.
scene_heading: IN THE HUD -- All known information about PARZIVAL. Not just
dialog: the obvious stuff, like his status as leader of the
dialog: challenge, this has his entire Oasis history, all his
dialog: achievements, every XP hunt, power-up purchase, porn planet
dialog: visit... it’s all there. Everything except his real world
dialog: identity.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (CONT’D)
dialog: Not gonna be easy. Guy’s got a lot
text: of eyes on him.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: That’s why I came to you. You're
dialog: the best.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Riiight.
text: Six pushes the data aside.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (CONT’D)
dialog: Before I bust my ass, how many
dialog: other haxorz have you put on this?
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Six, why would I hire anyone else?
dialog: You're my guy.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Yeah, okay, well I’m gonna need a
dialog: higher daily budget than usual. And
dialog: I’m gonna need help, as in
dialog: manpower.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: The Sixer Army is at your disposal.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: I said “help” not a bunch of
text: deadbeat level-one shart-squirters
dialog: to trip over.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: If you think it’s too difficult...
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Yeah, yeah. You can skip the mind
dialog: games, Nolan. You know I’m in.
text: The giant warrior turns and heads back to his ship...
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Owww.
text: He moans and grabs his neck as he boards.
scene_heading: EXT. DEEP SPACE -- NIGHT
text: Aech’s Spaceship rockets through the Oasis, away from the
text: galaxy’s center towards the less populated rim.
speaker_heading: AECH (0.S.)
dialog: I like your facial expressions.
text: Much more detailed.
scene_heading: INT. AECH’S SPACESHIP
text: Aech and Parzival are hanging in the cockpit of Aech’s sweet
text: ride, talking about Wade’s new Shaptic Brand Bootsuit.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Think so?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Yeah, but was it worth it? Those
text: rigs are pricey.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I can feel the Corinthian leather
dialog: under my ass, that’s how sensitive
dialog: this thing is.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Worth it! Changed my mind.
dialog: 37.
text: Aech gives Parzival a triple-slap high-five, which in the
dialog: 2040's is the cool way to do it.
scene_heading: EXT. VENDOR’S MOON --
text: Aech’s spaceship descends towards a MOON that looks like it
text: is made entirely from WOOD.
scene_heading: INT. VENDOR’S WORKSHOP - DAY
text: In the center of an enormous space that makes the warehouse
text: at the end of Raiders look like a closet, a man known only as
text: the VENDOR (played by DAVID CROSS because literally, this is
text: a David Cross branded avatar, with maximum sarcasm enabled)
text: constructs a personalized PLANET, MADONNA’S 100th BIRTHDAY
text: WORLD.
text: He uses his right hand to shape and mold, his left to add
text: texture and color. Bits of color and pixels of matter fall to
text: the ground like glitter.
text: He finishes off an ERUPTING VOLCANO and places it in the
text: center of an ocean. Without turning around...
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Where’s my robot, Aech?
text: Reveal Aech and Parzival approaching from a distance.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Hey man, someone I want you...
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Where is my Giant Robot, Aech?
dialog: From the movie Iron Giant, a
text: heartwarming tale about a
dialog: friendship between a human boy and
dialog: a Giant Robot?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I'm working...
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Where is it? Why don’t I have it?
dialog: Did we not say I would have it this
dialog: week?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: This is Parzival!
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: You... if... what?
dialog: (to Parzival)
dialog: The Parzival?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: That’s me.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: So what are we after, a used
dialog: planet? Real estate in an
dialog: undeveloped solar system?
text: The Vendor grabs a sheaf of paper from off a table and
text: UNFURLS it. It stretches out into an enormous, stunning, ONE
text: HUNDRED FOOT LONG MAP of every planet in the Oasis.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: How about your own signage floating
dialog: in the rings of Googleworld? I have
text: a signsmith with fonts that will
dialog: literally make you cry.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I just need a ship. Something fast.
text: The Vendor smiles, snaps the map closed.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Spaceships are my jam.
scene_heading: INT. WORKSHOP
text: The contents of a SHOEBOX are dumped on a worktable,
text: matchbox size versions of the Starship Enterprise, the
text: Battlestar Galactica, and other iconic spacecraft.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: I just got a wonderful Guild spice
text: ship that folds space like a boss.
text: Parzival shakes his head.
speaker_heading: VENDOR (CONT'D)
dialog: How about this George Melies-
dialog: inspired stop-motion-esque rocket?
dialog: Very classy.
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Kind of had my heart set on this
dialog: one.
text: He picks up “Serenity”, the spaceship from the show
text: “Firefly”. The Vendor frowns.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Oh, joy, another Whedonite.
dialog: Personally, I never saw the appeal,
text: insular and twee and smug. Still,
dialog: can’t deny it’s a well built
dialog: vessel.
scene_heading: INT. VENDOR'S WORKSHOP - LATER
text: The “Vonnegut”, as Parzival has renamed it, is now complete.
text: He circles it, inspecting it from every angle.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: It’s amazing.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: So you really did it. You got the
dialog: first key.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Course.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Can I see it?
text: Parzival turns to look at the Vendor. He seems desperate.
speaker_heading: VENDOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not gonna go Gollum on you,
dialog: kid.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Okay, sure.
text: Parzival takes the key from around his neck and hands it to
text: him. The Vendor's eyes light up as he turns the key over in
text: his hands.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: The Copper Key. See how perfect
dialog: that is, down to the pixel? Highest
dialog: density resolution, just amazing
dialog: work.
text: In fact, the key is magnificent, like it somehow has more
text: weight, and catches more light, than anything else around it.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: VENDOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I wondered if anyone would find it.
dialog: He would have been happy to see
dialog: someone like you holding this,
text: instead of those IOI beefjugglers.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Wait, did you know Halliday?
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: In some ways, yes.
text: The Vendor looks over his shoulder, to make sure Aech isn’t
dialog: listening.
speaker_heading: VENDOR (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to give you something. You
dialog: have to promise not to tell Aech,
dialog: he would be furiously jealous.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah, sure.
text: The Vendor rummages in his pockets. Parzival’s excitement
dialog: grows, he can only imagine what it could be, this is a guy
dialog: who can make anything.
speaker_heading: VENDOR
dialog: Here you go.
text: The Vendor drops a single quarter in Parzival’s hand.
speaker_heading: VENDOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Remember, don’t tell anyone.
text: As the Vendor walks away, Parzival looks down at the measly
text: quarter and laughs. He flips it, then adds it to his
scene_heading: INVENTORY.
scene_heading: INT. VONNEGUT - DAY (OASIS)
text: Wade straps into the driver’s seat of the Vonnegut. The ship
text: rockets through the open bay door of the planetoid and
text: accelerates into space.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HIDEOUT (REAL WORLD)
text: Wade, in his full body bootsuit, is taking the thrill ride of
text: his life. He steers with a virtual wheel, accelerates with a
text: virtual thrust, flips switches on a virtual switchboard.
dialog: 41.
scene_heading: INT. THE VONNEGUT (OASIS)
text: All of which is rendered in loving detail inside the
text: Vonnegut. Parzival deftly navigates two oncoming ships, a
text: massive GROUPON DEAL-HAULER and some tween girl’s HELLO KITTY
text: shuttle, then loops through the BROKEN RINGS of the FACEBOOK
text: PLANET, which has been dormant for years.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: “The place where lovers couldn’t
dialog: leap/ In the dark, while counting
dialog: sheep/ Take the jump, prove how
dialog: you’re made/ Then you will find the
dialog: key of Jade.” That mean anything
dialog: to you, Kitt?
text: The voice of his onboard computer, KITT, responds.
speaker_heading: KITT (0.S.)
dialog: No, sir.
text: Parzival puts the ship on autopilot, then calls up a map in
text: his HUD.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
text: Clearly some sort of jump. So many
dialog: options. Set a course for Lover's
text: Leap, in the Valentine's Day sector
dialog: on Hallmark 4.
speaker_heading: KITT (0.S.)
dialog: Very good, sir.
text: As the ship hurtles through space, his HUD operates like a
text: FIND FRIENDS app, showing that ARTEMIS is nearby, on PLANET
speaker_heading: DOOM.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Locate.
text: His Hud spins for a moment, but Artemis isn’t available. He
text: leaves a message.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, it’s me. Z. Ha ha, that
dialog: rhymed.
text: He abruptly stops and DELETES the message. He tries again.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Howdy...
dialog: (disgusted with himself)
dialog: What the hell, am I a cowboy now?
dialog: Act like a human being, Wade.
dialog: 42.
dialog: Now he gets his shit together.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Artemis, it’s Z. I’m in your neck
dialog: of the woods, thought maybe I’d
dialog: drop by. Anyway, I wanna thank you
dialog: for helping me figure out the first
dialog: challenge. So here’s me helping you
dialog: out. Go backwards. And let’s meet
dialog: up sometime. You know, just to hang
dialog: or... whatever.
text: He pauses for a moment, wondering if he should do this. Then
text: he SENDS the message.
scene_heading: EXT. THE VONNEGUT --—
text: The Vonnegut suddenly rockets forward. As it does, reveal
text: that another craft SPEEDS UP AS WELL, not quite as fast,
text: clearly trying not to be seen.
scene_heading: INT. SLAVE 6 --
text: The interior of Number Six’s ship reveals a one-man bounty
text: hunting operation. He has a live surveillance feed of the
text: Vonnegut, simultaneous from five different angles.
text: He’s also got what must be an ILLEGAL FEED of PARZIVAL‘'S
text: personal heads up display, though no sound. THE MESSAGE TO
text: ARTEMIS becomes visible as it FIRES FROM THE VONNEGUT.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: (voice command)
dialog: Lock me on to that bitch, Slave.
text: The Slave Six SUDDENLY LEAPS INTO PURSUIT OF THE MESSAGE.
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE -- THE OASIS
text: The race between Parzival’s message and Six in his spaceship
text: is so fast that the ship itself appears as A MASSIVE BLUR.
scene_heading: INT. SLAVE 6
dialog: But the result is that for as long as he can keep up with the
text: message, Six can ACTUALLY HEAR IT. It’s warped and broken
text: into pieces, but still audible.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: +. figure out the first
dialog: challenge... returning the favor...
text: Six smiles despite the G-force distorting his face. He’s onto
dialog: something and he knows it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AECH’S BASEMENT
text: Aech is putting the finishing touches on the IRON GIANT, lost
dialog: in his work.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.)
dialog: Wow, that looks amazing.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: You told her.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: What?
text: Aech turns on him.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: You told her! I can’t believe you
dialog: told her.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I don’t know what...
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Have you seen the board? Artemis is
text: on it.
text: Aech snaps open a window. A live feed of The Scoreboard
text: reveals Artemis’s name in the number two position.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Oh. Yeah. Well, I just felt like...
dialog: she helped me.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: That’s not why you gave her the
dialog: clue. Man, I can’t believe it. What
dialog: happened to “Guy Friend before
dialog: Female you want to Date”? And how
dialog: much have I helped you?
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Dude, I’m sorry, I'll totally give
dialog: you the...
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I don’t want it, okay? I’1l figure
dialog: it out on my own.
text: Parzival’s call alert starts beeping. He’s too embarrassed to
dialog: answer it.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: Well? You just gonna let it ring?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Probably vid-spam.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: It’s her, isn’t it? Don’t be a
dialog: tool, answer it.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Nah, she’s just a girl, man.
speaker_heading: AECH
text: ANSWER IT.
text: ON SCREEN -- A message from Artemis. “Let’s meet up”.
text: Parzival's thrilled. Aech is annoyed.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: She could be using you, in fact SHE
dialog: could actually be a HE. Think about
dialog: that.
text: Parzival frowns, he hadn’t thought of that.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS - REAL WORLD
text: An excited Nolan Sorrento, on his headset, practically runs
text: through the Sixer department at IOI.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Backwards? Are you sure?
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (0.S.)
dialog: I watched her get the key.
text: Sorrento runs into the main SIXER BULLPEN. There are dozens
text: of Sixers sitting in a hundred top-of-the-line immersion
text: rigs. A monitor above each rig shows us (and Sorrento)
text: exactly what the Sixer in the Oasis is experiencing.
dialog: 45.
text: Sorrento whistles, loud enough that everyone turns to look
dialog: his way.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Listen up! Backwards. That’s your
dialog: clue. First one to finish the race,
dialog: raise your hand.
text: The Sixers jump back into action. Sorrento returns to his
text: voice link conversation with Number Six.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: What do we know about this girl?
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Coming your way.
text: Sorrento taps the monitor closest to him. A single touch
text: scans his ID and instantly displays the information Number
text: Six is sending him.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (CONT’D)
dialog: Name’s Artemis. She’s got a geek
dialog: cute thing going. She’s also got a
text: serious rap sheet.
scene_heading: ON THE MONITOR --
dialog: A list of every achievement, and infraction, committed by the
dialog: avatar named Artemis.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (CONT’D)
dialog: Board bans, game suspensions,
text: digital vandalism, politics in a no
dialog: politics zone. Anti-IOI doxxing...
text: Six lets out a laugh.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: What’s so funny?
text: On the monitor, one of Artemis’s Oasis crimes is displayed.
text: She is TEABAGGING an NPC in COMPUTER CHESS, but her gamertag?
scene_heading: NOLAN SORRENTO.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s not funny.
speaker_heading: SIX
dialog: Kinda funny. Anyway, I think I
dialog: found Parzival’s weak spot...
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: You did.
text: Sorrento’s eyes linger on the picture of ARTEMIS.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT’D)
dialog: It’s her.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: What? No. It’s spaceships.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: She’1l get you what you’re after.
speaker_heading: SIXER (0.S.)
dialog: Mr. Sorrento! I’m in Central Park,
dialog: sir!
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Don't let me down, Six.
text: Sorrento hangs up and walks over to the immersion rigs. He
text: tugs on the arm of the Sixer who just yelled.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, get out!
text: Sorrento yanks the surprised Sixer’s visor off and puts it on
text: himself, then climbs into his rig. We notice a special THUMB
text: CAP that clicks in to the gloves, and now the interface
dialog: reads...
scene_heading: LOGGING IN: NOLAN SORRENTO
scene_heading: INT. OASIS - CENTRAL PARK
text: Sorrento now stands in front of Bethesda Fountain in Central
text: Park. The copper key just floats there, waiting for him.
text: Sorrento reaches out and GRABS IT.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Booyah!
text: Then he looks around to make sure no one heard that.
scene_heading: EXT. SCOREBOARD
text: The Scoreboard, huge beyond comprehension, begins to rumble
text: and shake as a new name rolls out into THIRD PLACE.
text: The Vonnegut streaks past, just a speck in the foreground.
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: INT. VONNEGUT
text: Parzival watches in disgust as the THIRD SLOT on the
text: scoreboard changes to the name “NOLAN SORRENTO”.
text: Feeling guilty, Parzival pulls up Aech in his contacts.
text: There’s no response, so Parzival leaves a message.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I’m sorry. I should've said
dialog: something, you’re my best friend.
dialog: Here’s how to beat the first
dialog: challenge...
text: And while he explains...
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF PLANET DOOM
text: Artemis is making her way through the streets of Planet Doom.
text: Her armor meter is high enough that she doesn’t need to worry
text: about crossfire. The occasional bullet or shell pings off her
text: and falls to the ground.
text: Then she notices someone following her. It’s IOI Security.
text: She speeds up a little, then walks right past the entrance to
text: her CLAN CLUBHOUSE, hoping to lose the tail. She turns a
dialog: corner.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET DOOM - NIGHT
text: TWO IOI security guards come around a corner, only to be
text: JUMPED by ARTEMIS. She is completely bad-ass in the Oasis,
text: and makes quick work of them with some insane martial arts
text: moves combined with a BLASTER that she uses with deadly
dialog: accuracy.
text: More Security Guards close in, firing more ordinance.
text: Artemis’s shields are starting to take damage. She has to
dialog: retreat.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY -- PLANET DOOM
text: Artemis is PINNED DOWN in an alley, IOI Security closing in
text: from both directions. She ducks out from behind garbage cans,
text: returning fire, but in a few moments she’1l be overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.)
dialog: Hey Artemis...
dialog: 48.
text: Artemis looks up to see Parzival, standing on a ledge above
text: her, wearing A PAIR OF RED HEADPHONES. He tosses her a
dialog: matching pair.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Put these on.
text: She puts them on and them Parzival pulls out a supremely bad-
dialog: ass RAIL GUN.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Just bought this puppy. Check ‘er
dialog: out.
text: Parzival fires and the gun spits out a super-heated light
text: wave that sprays like a shotgun. The blast incinerates
text: everything in its path, except Artemis, who stands in the
text: center of it, unharmed.
text: An impressed Artemis looks up at Parzival.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
text: Headphones of limitless protection.
dialog: Keep em, those are my spares.
text: Parzival jumps down to the alley to join her, a fine mist of
text: vaporized IOI goons whirls through the air.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: So what was that all about?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Long story. Let’s get off the
dialog: streets.
text: Parzival nods, happy to. As they walk away...
text: Reveal a HOODED FIGURE, watching them from afar. He follows.
scene_heading: EXT. SAFE ZONE -- PLANET DOOM
text: A comically thin strip of sidewalk is the only safe zone on
dialog: Planet Doom.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Don’t know if I told you this, but
dialog: I like your look.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: You do?
dialog: 49.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Yeah, I mean, the Atari Game burial
dialog: t-shirt, very cool. Also, I like
dialog: that you’re not all ‘roided out.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah, I hate that.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Your friend...
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I've tried to talk to him about
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
text: The shoulders.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Too wide, right?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Totally. I mean, nothing personal
dialog: but... even your arms are a little
dialog: big.
text: Parzival checks out his arms.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Are they?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: For your frame. I’m just saying,
dialog: the biceps are kind of... BAM!
text: Parzival’s biceps instantly shrink down a bit.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: There you go, a little less Olympic
dialog: weightlifter.
text: Parzival smiles, motions to Artemis.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I like yours too. I mean, your
dialog: arms, but I mean like... your butt,
dialog: it’s not...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Yeah, tried to keep it real.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: And your... you know, your boobs,
dialog: they’re not those ridiculous porn
dialog: star...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Those things are a huge liability
dialog: in a death match. You try to hide,
dialog: but your cans are sticking out from
text: behind a tree.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah.
text: They walk in comfortable silence; definitely a connection
dialog: forming.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you look like in the real
dialog: world?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Hey. Boundaries, not cool.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah, I’m sorry, I just... it would
dialog: be... you know, to meet you. In
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: You'd be disappointed.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: No I wouldn't.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Are you a guy?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I’m just saying, I don’t care what
dialog: you look like. I'd like to meet
dialog: you. I mean, I have no idea where
dialog: you live, and I’m sure you'd be
dialog: disappointed in me but...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Shhh!
text: Artemis motions to more IOI SECURITY GUARDS up ahead,
text: searching for their missing quarry. They duck behind a
text: billboard advertising MADDEN 74.
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Parzival, listen...
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: My real name is Wade.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: No! Are you crazy? You can’t tell
dialog: anyone who you are.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I’m not telling anyone. I’m telling
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: And you don’t know me, you don’t
dialog: know anything about me. IOI is
dialog: after me, they’re definitely after
dialog: you. This isn’t a game, Z.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Uh, yeah, I think it is.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Well, you’re wrong. It’s not.
text: A hovering graphic up ahead indicates END OF NON PVP ZONE.
text: Artemis stops.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Z, seriously, what would you do if
dialog: you found the egg?
text: Parzival is taken aback, almost like he hasn’t really thought
dialog: this through.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I don’t know, I mean, what wouldn’t
dialog: I do? Buy myself the best rig, the
dialog: biggest space ship... I’d get all
dialog: the shit I could never afford.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: And what about the Oasis?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I'd keep it like it is, I guess,
dialog: like it should be.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: That's the thing, Z, it isn’t how
dialog: it should be. Not anymore. Whoever
dialog: wins this, they’re going to need to
dialog: work to keep things free.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I'm not really that into politics
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: It's more than politics, it's basic
dialog: human decency. IOI has all this
dialog: double speak about “maximizing
dialog: bandwidth potential,” but what it
dialog: really means is the Oasis is
dialog: screwed.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah, I guess.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: That's why it’s so important that
dialog: we win. We need you, Z. My clan
dialog: needs you.
text: Parzival suddenly realizes.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Oh. Oh man.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Aech was right. I’m an idiot.
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: I thought... I thought you wanted
dialog: to hang.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: (not getting it)
dialog: I want to do more than hang, I want
dialog: to clan up.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: That’s not-- nevermind. It’s cool.
dialog: I better go.
text: He pulls the miniature Vonnegut out of his pocket and TOSSES
text: it into the middle of the street. It instantly expands to
text: full size. Artemis is confused by his sudden attitude.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wait, so what’s your answer?

scene_heading: INT. WADE'S BEDROOM - DAY (THE REAL WORLD)
text: Wade is sleeping in his tiny room when he hears pounding on
text: his door.
speaker_heading: RICK (0.S.)
dialog: Wade! Get out here!
text: Wade pulls some pants on, heads out of his room.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Wade walks into the living room to find Alice and Rick
text: waiting for him. They’ve got his backpack open on the table.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Wade? Can you explain this?
text: Rick, wearing a “Parzival” hat that makes Wade doubletake,
text: holds up Wade's fancy Bootsuit.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Can I explain why you guys are
dialog: going through my stuff? No, I
dialog: can’t.
text: Wade tries to grab the bootsuit, but Rick holds him back.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: This thing costs at least ten
dialog: thousand credits. Where’d you get
dialog: the money?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Did you steal it?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I bought it.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You doing those sex chats?
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What? No. Ew. Why do you care
dialog: anyway, Rick? You don’t even live
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: Neither do you.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: Rick!
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Alice? What’s he talking about?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We're selling the trailer, Wade.
text: She slides a LOYALTY CENTER PAMPHLET towards Wade. It's got
text: the IOI logo on it, and reads: ‘Work off your debt in weeks
dialog: at Oklahoma City's new Loyalty Center.'
text: Wade leafs through the pamphlet in shock.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Is this a joke? I don’t want to
dialog: live in this ass-y gulag.
speaker_heading: RICK
dialog: You're not gonna live there. We
dialog: didn’t apply for you.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What?
text: Wade stares at Alice, looking for an answer.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: You're getting a little too old not
dialog: to have your own place. I think
dialog: your Mom would have wanted...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Don’t you dare bring my Mom into
dialog: this, Alice.
text: Wade looks really upset. Alice, feeling bad, takes him aside.
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: I’m sorry, Wade. I know it’s rough.
dialog: I just don’t know what else to do.
dialog: It’s really hard to find someone
dialog: you can bear to be with.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: But Rick?
speaker_heading: ALICE
dialog: We don’t always get our first
dialog: choice, kiddo.
text: Alice hands Wade her IOI gear.
speaker_heading: ALICE (CONT'D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Here, take my stuff. I don’t want
dialog: to leave you with nothing.
text: Reluctantly he takes it.
scene_heading: EXT. STACKS - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)
text: A dejected Wade trudges through the stacks, backpack over one
text: shoulder, headed for his hideout.
text: As he goes, we hold on a shadowy figure, WATCHING HIM. He’s a
text: big guy in a hoodie, with a really LAME TATTOO. He watches
text: Wade disappear into the piled up cars.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - THE OASIS -- DAY
text: A rail runs along the edge of a deck that hangs in the upper
text: atmosphere. Wind whips furiously, and we reveal Parzival
text: standing on the edge. He looks ready to jump.
text: He sees Aech approaching.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Thanks for finally returning my
dialog: calls.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I looked deep in my heart and
dialog: realized, you’re my best friend.
dialog: How can I stay angry?
text: Aech looks over the edge. It’s at least ten thousand feet to
dialog: the ground.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: Plus, you sounded kind of bummed
dialog: when we talked.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah, I guess I am.
text: As if to prove his point, Parzival JUMPS OFF THE EDGE!
scene_heading: EXT. SKY - FALLING -- OASIS
text: Parzival free-falls. A moment later, Aech joins him.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: So you gotta move out?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I mean, they didn’t give me any
dialog: warning.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: That’s rough. How'd it go with the
dialog: girl?
text: Parzival shakes his head.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Don’t ask.
text: Yes, they are still hurtling towards the ground at terminal
text: velocity, but the conversation is as casual as if they were
text: chatting over coffee.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t really know anyone. Where
dialog: do I even go? Where do I log in?
dialog: Can’t believe my Aunt is doing
dialog: this.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: You don't get to choose your
dialog: family. But I'm your friend, even
dialog: in the R.W. So if you need help,
dialog: you call me, okay?
text: Parzival looks over at Aech. Despite the fact that he looks
text: like a linebacker and is falling through space at high speed,
text: he can see the sincerity behind his words.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Thanks, dude.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Now pull your ripcord.
text: They pull their chutes.
scene_heading: EXT. OASIS - LANDING SPOT
text: Parzival and Aech leave the RED BULL GLUTEN-PACKED ENERGY
text: LEAP, the promotional jump they just tested out.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: So this wasn’t it. The second
dialog: challenge.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I've tried like ten different
dialog: famous jumps.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I don’t think that’s the answer.
text: They arrive at Aech’s ship, which is incongruously sitting in
text: a parking lot among many other vehicles.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Meaning?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I just don’t think the clue is that
dialog: literal.
text: Aech climbs on board his ship.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Need a lift?
text: Parzival shakes his head. AECH throws him the gunter salute.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: Cheer up, dude. You’re still on the
dialog: board.
scene_heading: AECH’S SHIP BLASTS OFF
dialog: And once it does...
text: A GROUP OF SIXERS ARE REVEALED, five of them, with one very
text: familiar leader, recognizable even through the smoke.
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (0.S.)
dialog: It’s good to meet you in person,
dialog: Parzival. I’m a fan.
text: Seeing NOLAN SORRENTO, Parzival immediately draws his GUNS,
text: and his SHIELDS power up. Sorrento walks forward.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa, take it easy, Hombre. None of
dialog: us are armed.
text: IN PARZIVAL’S HUD -- a quick scan reveals that he’s telling
text: the truth, no weapons on any of them.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: What do you want?
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: To make you an offer.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Not interested.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: This is the kind of offer where you
dialog: get everything you’ve ever dreamed
dialog: of.
text: Sorrento motions to a gleaming, blue TRANSPORT DISC, the
dialog: fastest, and most expensive way to get around the Oasis.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: Five minutes, just hear me out,
dialog: that’s all I ask.
text: Off Parzival, debating whether to step onto that platform.
scene_heading: EXT. IOI HEADQUARTERS -- THE OASIS - DAY
text: The IOI executive transport sits on a gated platform at one
text: end of the Courtyard in One IOI Plaza. Sorrento, Parzival and
text: the Sixers zap in.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I understand why people don’t like
dialog: IOI. I really do. Everyone wants to
dialog: stick it to the man.
text: Sorrento leads them off the platform and into the courtyard
dialog: below.
dialog: 59.
scene_heading: EXT. IOI HEADQUARTERS COURTYARD (OASIS)
text: The courtyard of IOI’s Oasis Headquarters is unimaginatively
text: similar to their real world campus, though everything is
text: bigger and more ostentatious.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: And I like a good treasure hunt as
dialog: much as the next person. But could
dialog: you imagine if these so-called
dialog: “rebs” won the contest?
text: They walk past a stunning gravity-defying fountain towards
text: the massive towers.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: They'd dismantle the place in
dialog: weeks.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Is that what they say?
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: That’s what they’d do. You take all
dialog: the commerce out of the Oasis, it
dialog: falls apart. Halliday always had a
dialog: business model, he was no
dialog: communist.
text: As they move toward the building’s giant glass doors,
text: Parzival sees hundreds of nameless IOI WORKERS filing out a
text: side door towards their respective shitty jobs.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: This is where all your employees
dialog: spawn, huh?
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Yes, but don’t worry, they
dialog: immediately move off site. The
dialog: executives -- which you would be --
dialog: don’t have to interact with the
dialog: worker bees.
text: Sorrento points Z to the executive elevator.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll barely ever see them.
text: Parzival notices his AUNT ALICE’S AVATAR among the crowd.
text: Despite his mixed feelings about her, it’s hard for him to
dialog: feel good about Sorrento’s comment.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS - SORRENTO’S OFFICE (OASIS)
text: Parzival and Sorrento step out into Sorrento’s opulent
text: office. The windows off the observation deck afford a
text: stunning view of the surrounding virtual city.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: IOI wants you, Parzival. To help
text: find Halliday's Easter egg.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: That's what I figured.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: You'd have everything at your
dialog: disposal, you’d be free to follow
dialog: any strategy...
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: But if I win, IOI would run the
dialog: Oasis.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: You'd rather run it yourself?
text: Parzival looks at Sorrento quizzically.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know how hard it is to
dialog: maintain the Oasis? Do you know how
dialog: many hours a day Halliday worked?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL SORRENTO
dialog: Twenty hours a day... Twenty hours, that’s right.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT’D)
dialog: That's what it takes. Is that the
dialog: kind of person you are?
dialog: Parzival considers this. He is definitely not a “20 hours a
dialog: day” kind of guy.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: Our offer won’t require twenty
dialog: hours a day. But it does come with
dialog: your own penthouse apartment in
dialog: Columbus, with the highest speed
dialog: connection, and the best deck money
dialog: can buy.
text: This gets Parzival’s attention.
dialog: *
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll have all of our company's
dialog: vast resources at your disposal.
dialog: Money, weapons, magic items, ships,
dialog: artifacts. You name it. And I
dialog: haven’t even gotten to how well
dialog: this job pays.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I don’t think I can be a sixer,
dialog: it’s...
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Two million a year. To start.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Oh. Shit.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Regardless of outcome. And if and
dialog: when you help us find the egg?
dialog: You'll get a twenty-five-million-
dialog: dollar bonus.
dialog: 
dialog: Parzival says nothing...
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HIDEOUT (REAL WORLD)
text: While in real life, a hyperventilating Wade has to take his
text: visor off just to catch his breath.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Holy crap.
text: He slips it back on.
scene_heading: INT. SORRENTO’S OFFICE (OASIS)
text: Parzival looks pretty cool as he considers Sorrento’s offer.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Look, Z, I know you’re using
dialog: emotion-suppressing software right
dialog: now, and why wouldn’t you? It’s
dialog: smart not to give away your hand.
text: In the background, the planet's simulated sun begins to set,
text: casting a glow over the room. It’s actually quite beautiful.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: But one thing I can tell you is
dialog: that life is a lot easier when you
dialog: have money in the real world.
dialog: Relationships are easier.
text: Parzival isn’t sure what he’s getting at, but it definitely
text: makes him think.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: When you say we... One question...
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: (knows the question)
dialog: As our employee, you’d be playing
dialog: on behalf of IOI.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: So IOI would own the Oasis?
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: We would own it, Wade. All of us
dialog: who work at IOI. Well, all of us
dialog: who own stock.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: But we keep Halliday’s rules? Equal
dialog: access, equal bandwidth...
text: Sorrento tightens, tries to smile. This is a bit of a sore
dialog: subject.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Ah yes, equal bandwidth, Halliday’s
dialog: dream. Do you know how much that
dialog: slows things down, Wade? It’s a
dialog: lovely idea, but do you know how
dialog: much faster and better the Oasis
dialog: can be? If we maximize the
dialog: bandwidth potential for income?
dialog: ON PARZIVAL -- hearing those buzzwords, maximize bandwidth
text: potential. It strikes a chord.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: Your 25 million will be worth fifty
dialog: million two months after IOI takes
dialog: over. That's a guarantee. Fifty
dialog: million, is that a good deal?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I’m sorry, no.
text: Sorrento’s face falls.
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm probably going to really regret
dialog: this, but I can't do it.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I’m sure you'll regret it, but I
dialog: understand, I really do. In fact,
dialog: I'd like to say something off the
dialog: record.
dialog: 
dialog: Parzival shrugs, “why not?”
text: With a wave of his hand, Sorrento disables all the cameras
text: and microphones in the room.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT’D)
dialog: The truth is, I had to make this
dialog: offer. The Board insisted. But I
dialog: was really hoping you would say no.
dialog: Because if anyone wins, it’s going
dialog: to be me. My avatar will get that
dialog: egg, because the truth is, I am the
dialog: only one with the balls to run this
dialog: place right.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Wow, you kind of switched gears
dialog: there from “fairly reasonable” to
text: “maniacal overlord”.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Ha, funny. There’s the obnoxious
dialog: wit I’ve heard about. Well,
dialog: consider yourself lucky, Wade,
dialog: because you won’t be around to
dialog: experience my “maniacal” reign.
text: Parzival reacts. Did he just say “Wade”? Sorrento gets a
text: wicked grin on his face.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT’D)
dialog: Yes, that’s right. I know who you
dialog: are. Wade Owen Watts. Born August
dialog: twelfth, 2024. Both parents
dialog: deceased. I also know where you
dialog: are.
text: A vidfeed window opens directly behind Sorrento, displaying a
text: live aerial view of Wade’s Stacks.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT’D)
dialog: You live with your aunt in the
text: Stacks. 700 Portland Avenue in
dialog: Oklahoma City.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: Unit 56-K, to be exact. You were
text: last seen entering her trailer
dialog: three days ago and you haven't left
dialog: since. Which means you're still
dialog: there right now, and there’s no
dialog: time to get out.
text: He puts a hand on Parzival’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry Wade, it really wasn’t
dialog: personal.
text: Parzival suddenly blinks out. Sorrento turns back to the
text: vidfeed monitor, watching as IOI DRONES approach the Stacks.
scene_heading: INT. CARGO VAN -- THE REAL WORLD
text: But of course, Wade isn’t IN the Stacks, he’s in his hideout.
text: He tears off his haptic gear and scrambles out of the van.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STACKS PERIMETER - NIGHT
text: Wade SPRINTS towards his stack, trying to reach Alice on his
text: headset.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Alice! Alice! You gotta get the
dialog: hell out of there--
text: OVERHEAD, Wade can see more DRONES closing in on his stack.
text: They look like they are carrying packages, but as each of
dialog: them flies in--
text: They maneuver towards his stack and plant their packages on
text: the support struts of the unit...
text: Red lights on their side blink faster and faster.
text: Wade frantically calls out to his Aunt.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon Alice, pick up...
text: But Rick answers.
speaker_heading: RICK (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, this bootsuit is pretty
dialog: awesome, thanks for that...
dialog: 65.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Rick, get out of there! The place
dialog: is gonna blow!
text: Rick starts laughing.
speaker_heading: RICK (0.S.)
dialog: Hear that, Alice? This douchenozzle
dialog: is--
dialog: And that, sadly, is the last thing Rick ever says...
speaker_heading: KABOOM!
text: The support columns are blown apart, and the entire Stack
text: begins to teeter...
text: The sound of RENDING METAL pierces Wade’s ears as the stack
text: RIPS FREE of its scaffolding and CRASHES against its
text: neighbor, like a massive domino.
text: Wade watches, frozen in shock and horror as THREE STACKS
dialog: start falling...
text: TOWARDS HIM.
text: He runs as the massive towers split apart and fall,
text: containers and RV homes flipping and tumbling and catching
text: fire as PROPANE TANKS EXPLODE.
text: Wade just manages to get clear of the collapse. As sirens
text: wail and people scream...
text: For a moment, Wade just stands there, overcome by the horror
dialog: of it.
text: Then he notices someone, staring at him. It’s that same GUY,
text: the one with the LAME TATTOO.
text: He’s moving towards him. As Wade slowly backs away, the guy
text: follows him.
text: Now Wade starts to run.
scene_heading: EXT. STACKS
text: Wade is running as fast as he can, but this isn’t the Oasis,
text: his real body is out of shape. He sucks air as he rounds one
dialog: of the Stacks and sees...
text: AN IOI TRANSPORT pull up to the burning stacks and a dozen
text: IOI Security Guards hop out.
dialog: 66.
text: Wade turns and runs in the other direction.
text: Until Lame Tattoo rounds a corner just ahead of him. Wade
text: slides, almost falls down, then turns and runs in the other
dialog: direction.
text: AS THE STACKS BURN
text: Wade runs for his life through the wreckage, trying to get
text: back to cover, his Hideout. He almost runs into another group
text: of IOI goons, but they end up giving him the cover to escape
dialog: from Lame Tattoo.
scene_heading: INT. WADE’S HIDEOUT
text: Wade, still clutching his backpack, climbs into his van, out
dialog: of breath.
text: He sits there for a moment, in shock, then starts pounding on
text: the steering wheel. Tears stream down his face.
text: After a moment, he catches his breath and tries to calm
dialog: himself down.
scene_heading: EXT. WADE’S HIDEOUT
text: Wade looks both ways before emerging from the hideout. In
text: one direction, the burning remains of the stacks, in the
text: other, the beckoning lights of Oklahoma City.
text: He starts off in that direction when he is suddenly GRABBED
scene_heading: FROM BEHIND.
dialog: It’s Lame Tattoo.
text: Before he can scream, he has a GAG in his mouth, plastic
text: cuffs around his wrists. Then a HOOD goes over his head.
text: Everything goes black.
scene_heading: EXT. STACKS - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)
text: Police and ambulances surround the disaster at the stacks. An
text: IOI clean up CREW picks through the wreckage right alongside
dialog: the police.
text: We hear chatter among onlookers and police about “an exploded
dialog: meth lab”.
text: IN THE WRECKAGE -- One of the IOI guys pulls out the charred
dialog: remains of...
dialog: 67.
text: A SHAPTIC BOOTSUIT. As he lifts it up, the ashes of an
text: incinerated body drop out of it.
text: IOI GUY checks the serial number with a scanner. On a small
text: display screen, the details come up...
text: “Purchaser: WADE WATTS”
text: Satisfied, IOI GUY nods to the others. Their work here is
dialog: done.
scene_heading: INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY -- REAL WORLD
text: As the hood is pulled off, the world is blurred and too
text: bright. When WADE’S EYES finally adjust, the first thing he
dialog: sees is...
text: A KNIFE. Wade raises his hands defensively, but Lame Tattoo
dialog: just grabs them and...
text: SLICES THE HANDCUFFS. Then he pulls the gag out.
text: Wade coughs, spits. His vision is starting to adjust. He can
text: now see someone sitting just across from him. A woman.
text: She looks familiar, dark hair and hazel eyes. She has a
text: prominent BIRTHMARK on her left cheek which she hides with
text: her new wave hairdo, but otherwise there’s no doubt who it
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Hey, Wade. Welcome to the
dialog: rebellion.
text: It’s the real life Artemis, in the flesh.
scene_heading: INT. REB SAFE HOUSE
text: Wade and Artemis walk through the Reb Safe House. It’s run
text: down but animated, filled with other young people committed
dialog: to the cause.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: When I was a kid, we moved around a
dialog: lot. My Dad was always getting
dialog: hassled, by the government or
dialog: corporations or whoever, he just
dialog: couldn’t catch a break. But he
dialog: fought for his rights, even when it
dialog: got him in trouble.
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Wow. Sounds rough.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Well, he went broke, and then he
dialog: abandoned us. But the point is, he
dialog: taught me never to back down. He
dialog: refused to give in to the system's
dialog: injustice. So damn right I picked
text: up the torch.
text: Everyone they pass nods to Artemis. She’s a leader here.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You’re even more badass in real
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Nah.
text: Artemis leads him past the Reb Oasis War Room, where a bunch
text: of Rebs are logged in to haptic rigs.
scene_heading: EXT. REB SAFE HOUSE
text: Wade and Artemis step outside into a rundown neighborhood, a
text: suburban slum. In the distance he can see the gleaming
text: skyline of COLUMBUS, OHIO.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: That’s Columbus, huh?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: World’s nicest city. If you’re rich
dialog: and powerful. Otherwise you live
dialog: out here in the bandwidth slums.
text: She motions to the rundown neighborhood around them.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Never knew it was so bad.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: It isn’t just Columbus.
text: Artemis points to the horizon, where the Slums are expanding,
text: Favela-like, to cover the Ohio countryside.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
text: It’s everywhere. IOI messes with
dialog: access speeds to force more and
dialog: more people into debt. Case in
dialog: point.
dialog: 69.
text: She points to an IOI SECURITY TEAM, accompanied by the
text: POLICE, dragging someone out of his home, The guy has a
text: MOHAWK and wears an ironic “MATRIX KIDS!” t-shirt. His
text: screaming, half-naked girlfriend holds a screaming, totally-
text: naked baby.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What the hell?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: That was LaJeremy, our neighbor.
text: LaJeremy is pushed into the back of an IOI transport van and
text: whisked away.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You fall into enough debt, IOI
dialog: takes you in for “loyalty service”.
dialog: Have you ever seen a “loyalty
dialog: center”, Wade?
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Only on a pamphlet.
scene_heading: EXT. IOI LOYALTY CENTER - COLUMBUS DIVISION (REAL WORLD)
text: An enormous building, like the projects, but there’s no
text: activity outside; everyone is inside, all the time.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: The key to the whole scam is
dialog: getting around Halliday’s first
dialog: rule; one person, one avatar.
scene_heading: INT. LOYALTY CENTER
text: The bullpen at the loyalty center is quite literally a SEA OF
text: a THOUSAND HAPTIC DECKS, each with a poor soul in it under
dialog: servitude to IOI.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (0.S.)
dialog: Sorrento came up with the
dialog: workaround. A way to spoof
dialog: accounts, so he can take over for a
dialog: Sixer whenever he wants. But it’s
dialog: worse than that.
text: We watch some random guy working and working, piling up coins
dialog: from his loyalty rig...
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: The “loyalists” don’t have an
dialog: identity in there. Earnings just go
text: into a shared account. IOI’s.
text: The coins DRAIN OUT OF HIS ACCOUNT just as quickly.
scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBUS SUBURBS
text: Artemis and Wade are walking back now.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: No matter how hard they work, their
text: debt goes up. IOI charges them for
dialog: their deck, their access, and room
dialog: and board. The Oasis was built to
dialog: be free. These Loyalty Centers will
dialog: turn everyone into slaves.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Halliday never would have let this
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: I know you love the guy, Wade, and
dialog: I had a lot of respect for him too,
dialog: but Halliday knew there were
dialog: issues, but he never did jack one
dialog: about it. He wanted the whole world
dialog: to be a game, and it just isn’t.
text: Wade nods, he’s experienced that first hand. Suddenly the
text: events of the past few days come rushing back.
text: Wade has to stop walking for a moment, he feels dizzy.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
text: Wade sits down on the sidewalk.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Wade?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: They killed my Aunt. She was a jerk
dialog: to me, but she still raised me, she
dialog: didn’t deserve to die. None of them
dialog: did.
dialog: (turning to her)
dialog: And you saved my life.
text: Wade’s eyes are tearing up.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw man, I must look pathetic.
text: Artemis dries his tears, she holds his face in her hands.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Stop it. You’ve been through hell.
dialog: And you're not pathetic, you're the
dialog: number one gunter in the world.
dialog: That is bad ass.
text: Wade and Artemis are incredibly close now, his face just
text: inches from hers. It feels like one of those moments...
text: But they just sit there, awkwardly. Wade can’t make the move.
text: The moment is gone.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: We should get back before the
text: patrols start.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. REB SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM
text: Artemis leads Wade into the Oasis War Room. Wade pulls his
text: Aunt’s IOI gear out of his backpack.
text: Artemis shakes her head.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Oh. Right, IOI can trace it?
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Now you're getting the hang of it.
text: Wade gets into one of the empty rigs. Artemis watches as Wade
text: does some quick customization, cleaning off the haptic
text: receivers with his shirt, balling up the cord on his headset
text: so it doesn’t snag.
text: Artemis is impressed; when it comes to the Oasis, Wade is a
text: pro. She even imitates him, pulling slack on her cords, as
text: she gets in her rig.
scene_heading: INT. AECH’S BASEMENT - NIGHT
text: Aech is in his basement, studying a smaller version of the
text: Vendor's Oasis Map.
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Enhance.
text: Despite looking like a real map, the image ZOOMS IN. Aech
text: refers to a few different MARKED LOCATIONS where “The Leap”
dialog: might be.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: Gotta be the Brooklyn Bridge.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.)
dialog: Nope, not the answer.
text: Aech turns to see Parzival entering, Artemis right behind
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Z! I was worried about you, man.
text: He and Z do their elaborate high-five move. The one that
dialog: really is cool.
text: Aech nods to Artemis, somewhat less enthused. The feeling is
dialog: mutual.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Are they here?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (nods )
dialog: They’re here.
text: SHOTO and DAITO step forward.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Shoto, Daito, this is Artemis.
text: Artemis takes a small bow.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Of all the gunters, Shoto and Daito
dialog: are the two most skilled fighters
dialog: I've ever seen. They're maxed out
dialog: on all PVP categories.
text: Shoto and Daito bow back to Artemis.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys all got my message? Aech,
dialog: are you someplace safe?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I’m on the run.
dialog: 73.
text: Parzival turns to Shoto and Daito.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Same for you two. If you're with
dialog: us, they’1ll come looking for you.
text: Parzival pauses, then addresses the group.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: A good friend told me that we would
dialog: be better off working together. I
dialog: didn’t listen to him.
text: Aech is a bit embarrassed, he knows it’s him.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: I thought Halliday wanted us to do
dialog: it alone, but that’s only how he
dialog: would’ve done it. I think he wanted
dialog: someone to be better than him.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: So we’re clanning up?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (to Artemis)
dialog: But I’m not joining your clan.
text: Artemis is confused. Wade turns to Shoto.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Shoto)
dialog: Not yours either.
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: We are the Clan. Right here in this
dialog: room, this is the Oasis Dream Team.
dialog: We're the “first five” and we are
dialog: going to win this thing together or
dialog: not at all.
text: Murmurs of agreement from everyone, except Artemis.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Z, you know it’s not that easy for
dialog: me, I’m committed.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Does your Clan know how to find the
dialog: second challenge?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: No, of course not.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Do you?
text: Everyone turns to look at Z. He smiles.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (to Artemis)
dialog: 74.
dialog: Don’t want to put you on the spot,
dialog: but if you're with us, you’re with
dialog: us.
text: Artemis nods.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Okay. I’m in.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: So spill, where’s the jump?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
text: There is no jump.
speaker_heading: AECH
text: Skeptical, but intrigued.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: “Where lovers wouldn’t leap.” It
dialog: hit me today. It’s about a girl.
dialog: (meeting Artemis’ eye)
dialog: And the leap he didn’t take.
text: Artemis doesn’t seem to get Parzival’s meaning, but Aech
dialog: does.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: After they blew the Flunkie Sprat
dialog: job, Halliday and Morrow met to
dialog: work on a new idea. It was a
dialog: seminal moment in history.
scene_heading: INT. GREGARIOUS GAMES -- 1998
text: Gregarious games headquarters, circa 1998.
text: laptop, Halliday paces.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: I don’t think that’1l track.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: Just try it, Og.
text: Morrow hits a button, the machine renders,
text: Morrow sits at his
scene_heading: SLOWLY.
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: REVEAL --
text: That our assembled team is watching the scene together in the
dialog: Halliday Journals. The Historian is there as well. Parzival
text: monologues.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I’ve watched the scene a million
dialog: times, the night they sketched the
dialog: plans for the Oasis. It took
dialog: sixteen years to make it work, but
dialog: this is where it began.
text: Bored, Morrow leans back in his chair.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: So, how was it?
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: I missed the voiceover. I don’t
dialog: care what people say, I like the
text: voiceover.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: You know that’s not what I mean.
text: Halliday, frustrated, paces quickly now.
speaker_heading: MORROW (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened with her?
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: She thought it was kind of dull,
dialog: can you believe that?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: This is the same girl Halliday was
text: swooning over months before. He
text: took her to a movie, but he still
dialog: hadn’t taken the leap.
text: Morrow shakes his head, it’s like pulling teeth with him.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: What does that have to do with
dialog: getting your mack on?
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: It just bothers me, it was a bomb
dialog: when it came out, how can people
dialog: not recognize genius?
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: Ahead of its time. Like us. But
dialog: Jim... did she....
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: She invited me back to her place.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: I don’t know. Nothing happened.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: STOP!
text: Parzival turns to Aech.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: See what I’m talking about?
dialog: “Counting sheep.” That’s what gives
dialog: it away.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (catching his drift)
dialog: “Do Androids dream of electric
dialog: sheep...” Right. I mean, you forget
dialog: because he says it was a bomb...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: (figuring it out)
dialog: Wait, it was a bomb?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
text: Way ahead of its time. The Citizen
text: Kane of dystopic future noir films.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: You think this is the clue to the
dialog: key?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Definitely.
text: The Historian clears his throat.
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: I know I’m a computer program and I
dialog: should know this, but what movie
dialog: are you talking about?
text: They all look at him, disappointed. Then, together...
dialog: 77.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Blade Runner!
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE -- THE OASIS
text: The Vonnegut rockets across the Oasis Solar System, once
text: again passing the enormous SCOREBOARD. We hear Parzival’s
text: voice, pre-lapped.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (0.S.)
dialog: Everyone knows Blade Runner has its
text: fingerprints all over the Oasis, in
dialog: the architecture, the vision of the
dialog: future, even the avatars.
text: The Vonnegut shoots towards a large planet with a number of
text: orbiting moons.
scene_heading: EXT. MOVIE THEATER ROW - NIGHT
text: A row of MOVIE THEATERS extends to the horizon, each of them
dialog: playing one of Halliday’s favorite movies: War Games, Star
text: Wars, Raiders, Road Warrior, Terminator, Ferris Bueller, Last
dialog: Action Hero, all of the Monty Python movies...
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: But if you know Halliday, you know
dialog: that one of the first things he
dialog: built in the Oasis was a place for
dialog: his favorite movies.
text: Our fabulous five come to a marquee with BLADE RUNNER:
scene_heading: ORIGINAL EDITION on it.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: So, what, we’re gonna watch Blade
dialog: Runner?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Something tells me there'll be more
dialog: to it than that.
text: They pass through the doors of the movie theater, and are
dialog: suddenly transported to...
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES 2019
text: HARRISON FORD as Deckard sits at his counter seat at the
dialog: noodle parlor. People speak crazy polyglot languages. It is --
dialog: literally -- Blade Runner.
dialog: 78.
text: Parzival, Aech, Artemis, Shoto and Daito suddenly appear in
text: the middle of the crowded street.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Whoa. We’re IN Blade Runner?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: It’s the immersive cut.
dialog: (looking around)
dialog: Think it’s the Oculus Criterion
dialog: Edition.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Yeah, but this isn’t the beginning
dialog: of the movie.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: We're what, eight minutes in?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Nine forty I believe.
text: Parzival notices a counter in the corner of the screen, going
text: down from three hours.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: But that’s not what’s in our HUDs.
dialog: Stay on your toes, people, this is
dialog: the challenge.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: I wonder what we’re supposed to do?
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Let’s just go ask Deckard.
text: Shoto immediately heads over towards the noodle shop. Daito
text: follows him.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Hold on, that might not be...
dialog: But they’ve already gotten close enough.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: «+. the best idea.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Hey, Deckard.
text: Deckard looks up at Shoto for a moment, then he pulls out his
text: gun and SHOOTS HIM. The rest of them scatter.
dialog: 79.
text: Daito takes a bullet to the back and dies too. He and Shoto
text: are both dead in the challenge, though they can still be
text: heard arguing in Japanese over voice chat.
scene_heading: EXT. LOS ANGELES 2019
text: Parzival, Artemis and Aech hide in a side alley.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Well, now we know what the
dialog: challenge is.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Do we?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: We're replicants, the bad guys.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: They weren’t the bad guys, they
dialog: were misunderstood. They’re more
dialog: like the Na’vi in Avatar.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Whatever dude, split hairs.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: We expire in less than three hours.
dialog: Not much time. What should we do?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
text: Something in the clue, “prove how
dialog: you're made”. That’s the key. To
dialog: the key. Come on.
text: He grabs Artemis’s hand and leads her away. Aech reluctantly
text: follows.
scene_heading: INT. INTERVIEW OFFICE - TYRELL CORPORATION
text: Parzival, Artemis, and Aech walk through the office building
text: from the opening scene, the one with the ceiling fans and
text: atmospheric smoke. A wall suddenly appears between them,
text: separating them.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Hey!
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Remember what you...
dialog: 80.
text: Too late, the three of them will each be doing the challenge
dialog: on their own.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Parzival slowly approaches a desk with a Voight-Kampff
text: machine sitting on it. He knows which chair is his.
text: To his surprise, instead of Morgan Paull, the original actor,
text: ANORAK sits across from him. He’s still got the cigarette and
text: the slicked back hair.
speaker_heading: ANORAK
dialog: You're walking through a desert and
dialog: come upon a tortoise...
text: Parzival smiles, he knows this part.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: What’s a tortoise?
speaker_heading: ANORAK
dialog: You ever seen a turtle?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: ANORAK
dialog: Same thing. You reach down and flip
text: it on its back.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Do you make up these questions, Mr.
dialog: Halliday?
speaker_heading: ANORAK
dialog: Just answer the questions. You’re
dialog: on a date...
text: That throws Parzival, definitely not from the movie.
speaker_heading: ANORAK (CONT'D)
dialog: At the movies. Your date invites
dialog: you to her place for a drink. What
dialog: do you do?
text: Parzival takes a long pause.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I go with her.
text: A long pause. Then Anorak stands up and extends his hand.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: ANORAK
dialog: Alright. You're not a replicant.
text: Anorak hands him a clipboard with the results to his test:
speaker_heading: PASSED -- HUMAN
speaker_heading: ANORAK (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: clipboard)
dialog: Take this down to the next room.
text: When Parzival looks down, the clipboard is now...
speaker_heading: The JADE KEY.
text: When he looks back up, Anorak has disappeared. And the office
text: door is a JADE DOOR. He turns the key and walks through...
speaker_heading: EXT. NEONOIR (OASIS)
text: Only to find Artemis waiting on the other side. They are back
text: outside the movie theaters.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: What the...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Guess I answered quicker.
text: They look up to see the SCOREBOARD...
text: ARTEMIS in the lead, PARZIVAL in second.
text: Aech steps through a moment later.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Damn, you guys beat me?
text: AECH appears on the scoreboard too.
scene_heading: INT. SIXER DEPARTMENT (REAL WORLD)
text: Sorrento is looking at images of what little is left of the
text: Portland Avenue Stacks, including Wade’s Bootsuit. He talks
text: to NUMBER SIX on his HUD at the same time.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: I'm telling you, whatever you did
text: to his account, he's back online.
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Not possible, I... deleted his
dialog: account. Permanently.
text: Clearly Six doesn’t know exactly how deep and dirty Sorrento
dialog: goes.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Well, look at the scoreboard.
text: Sorrento checks one of the display screens, sure enough
text: there’s PARZIVAL, second on the Scoreboard, now behind
dialog: Artemis.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: We have to go about this a
dialog: different way. Get me her identity.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Gonna cost you extra.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I don't care, just find out who she
dialog: is.
text: Sorrento signs off.
scene_heading: INT. AECH’S BASEMENT (OASIS)
text: In the Oasis, the First Five clan celebrates their victory,
text: singing along to “We Are the Champions”.
text: In a rousing moment, Aech turns to Artemis. He holds up his
text: hand for an old-fashioned high-five.
speaker_heading: AECH
text: Nice moves back there.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You too.
text: She clears her throat to get everyone’s attention.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, ready for the third clue?
text: They all clap and whistle. She reads...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
text: The first was ringed in red metal/
dialog: The second, in green stone/
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: The third is clearest crystal/
dialog: And cannot be unlocked alone.
text: A beat as everyone mulls that over.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: What do you think, some sort of key
dialog: trick?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Doesn't say anything about where
dialog: the challenge is.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Maybe that’s the trick.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Whatever, we've got time to figure
dialog: it out, right? More music!
text: Aech throws another track on, “My Sharona.” They all start
dialog: dancing again.
scene_heading: INT. REB SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)
text: The Oasis War Room at the Reb Safe House. Wade helps Artemis
text: out of her gear. She’s humming MY SHARONA to herself.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Never heard that song before, it's
dialog: awesome.
text: Wade looks at her, incredulous.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: I got into the 80’s stuff cause of
dialog: the contest, not the other way
dialog: around. So I guess I've got gaps in
dialog: my knowledge. The other day some
dialog: guy said he was gonna pull a “Lloyd
dialog: Dobler” on me, I had no idea
text: whether to thank him or punch him.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Say Anything?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 84.
text: Wade speaks a muffled voice command into his rig, then holds
text: up his headphones. The sound is really good as a SONG COMES
dialog: UP.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: A great song from Halliday’s twenty-
dialog: seventh favorite movie.
text: MUSIC CUE: “IN YOUR EYES,” BY PETER GABRIEL. They sit
text: together for a moment, just listening to the song.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think?
text: Cynical dicks can turn the page now, but the song has its
text: magic and it WORKS. Artemis smiles, clearly into it.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: How do you know all this stuff,
dialog: anyway?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: My Mom and Dad, that’s what they
dialog: grew up on. It was all Atari and
dialog: comic books and Halliday. I didn’t
dialog: get much time with them, they died
dialog: when I was a kid, but I did inherit
dialog: their tastes.
text: Artemis slides closer, so she can hear better. Their legs
text: press against each other. Wade naturally rests his hand on
text: her shoulder.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: You ever wonder why Halliday did
dialog: all this? The contest I mean.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I think he was cut off, y’know? He
dialog: wanted to be understood, but he
dialog: didn’t know how to talk to people.
dialog: So this was a way to get them to
dialog: understand.
text: Artemis nods, makes sense. They just listen to the song for a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: So what’s a “Lloyd Dobler?”
text: Wade turns a bit red, then smiles.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well... it’s when a guy plays a
dialog: great song for a girl he’s really
dialog: into, to get her to go out with
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Oh.
text: She has her hand on his now.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: You know that thing you said, about
dialog: not taking a leap...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (already leaning in)
dialog: Yeah.
text: Before she can finish her thought, Wade completes it by
text: kissing her. He’s surprised that he made the move. She’s
text: surprised how badly she wants to kiss him back.
dialog: And it’s not just a peck, not an accident, not just of the
text: moment. It’s a long, slow kiss, and the song keeps playing...
scene_heading: INT. REB SAFE HOUSE - WADE’S ROOM (REAL WORLD)
text: ++. aS Wade and Artemis connect on a more physical level.
dialog: And by that I mean sex. They have sex with each other. Or
dialog: however much people feel comfortable with these days, which
dialog: is probably more prudish than it should be, but whatever.
text: When it’s over, they fall asleep holding hands.
text: Music takes us through a TIME CUT. When the music ends, a
text: sleeping Wade opens his eyes. Artemis is getting dressed.
text: From the moonlight coming in through the window, it’s clearly
text: the middle of the night.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hey. Where you going?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wade...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Sorry if I pulled a “Dobler” on
dialog: you.
text: Artemis can’t help but smile.
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: This was great. I just...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I get it.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: No, I mean, I can’t do this again.
dialog: I can't be with you.
text: Wade’s smile fades.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: I... we both need to be focused on
dialog: the contest.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: One doesn’t mean the other...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: No, it does.
text: Artemis is hurrying to pull her boots on. Wade sits up.
dialog: She turns
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hey. Artemis. Can you listen to me
dialog: for one second?
text: and looks at him.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: These clues, the ones Halliday is
dialog: leaving? They’re all saying the
dialog: same thing.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wade...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: He met someone, and he...
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: -+. he loved her. And he let it
dialog: slip away.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wade, you’re embarrassing me.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I know, and I’m embarrassing me
dialog: too. But I know what I want. I know
dialog: you feel something. I can feel it.
dialog: 87.
text: Artemis looks at Wade, very confused.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: I'm sorry, I just can’t.
text: She hurries out of the room, leaving a distraught Wade
dialog: behind.
speaker_heading: WADE (0.S.)
dialog: Remember you said if I ever needed
dialog: help... in the real world?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. REB SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Reveal Wade, slipping out one of the windows of the Reb
text: house, backpack over his shoulder, whispering to Aech over a
text: headset.
speaker_heading: AECH (0.S.)
dialog: Course. Just say it.
text: Wade lands on the ground. He heads towards the lights in the
dialog: distance.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Well how far away are you from
dialog: Columbus?
text: A pause from the other end.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Aech? You there?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Yeah, I’m here. Not that far, maybe
dialog: two hours. I’1ll come get you.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Thanks, dude, you are a true
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I know. Just don’t forget that,
dialog: okay? When you meet me.
text: Aech hangs up, leaving Wade wondering what he meant.
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: EXT. REB SAFE HOUSE (REAL WORLD)
text: TWO DRONES have gathered above the Reb Safe House, their red
text: lights pulsing softly. A third and a fourth join them.
text: Something is going down.
scene_heading: EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT (REAL WORLD)
text: Wade lingers outside of a fully automated fast food place
scene_heading: BURGER CHICKEN-CORN PIZZARITO. There are no workers or cooks,
dialog: just machines that inject processed protein glop into pre-
text: rolled, deep fried burrito shells.
text: Then, AN RV PULLS UP. A mocha colored SunRider, at least two
text: decades old. A patchwork of solar cells cover the RV's roof
text: along with a liberal amount of rust. The windows are tinted
dialog: black.
text: The side door opens, revealing a short ASIAN KID who's way
text: too young to drive. He beckons Wade over.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Shoto? You're a... kid.
text: Shoto laughs.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: When did you get here?
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: We flew in yesterday. Aech picked
dialog: us up. Join the party.
scene_heading: INT. AECH'S RV - CONTINUOUS (REAL WORLD)
text: Wade climbs in, sees an older Asian male sitting in the back.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: And you must be Daito.
text: DAITO just nods, he doesn’t speak English. Then, from the
text: driver's seat, a voice Wade doesn’t recognize.
speaker_heading: AECH (0.S.)
dialog: Hi Wade.
text: Wade turns to see a heavyset African American girl, about
text: Wade's age, with short kinky hair.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hi. Where’s Aech?
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I’m Helen. My Dad called me “Aech”
dialog: and it stuck.
text: Wade is shocked.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Wait, Aech? You?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Ugh. I knew you’d be mad. Grab a
dialog: seat.

scene_heading: EXT. COLUMBUS (REAL WORLD)
text: As dawn breaks, the RV rolls into Columbus, the most
text: spectacular city in the world, Paris on the Scioto River.
scene_heading: INT. VAN --
text: Wade now sits in the passenger seat. The tension is palpable.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: So what is it, that I’m a girl? Or
dialog: Black? Maybe I’m heavy, is that it?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Of course not. It’s just... all
dialog: those times we talked about
dialog: girls...
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Oh, yeah. Well, I’m a lesbian.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Really?
text: Aech laughs. Now that she’s smiling, he recognizes her.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn, I had no idea.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: You didn’t know? Dude, your gaydar
text: is broken.
text: Aech looks over at Wade.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I’m sorry I wasn’t honest with you.
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: It doesn’t matter. I didn’t tell
dialog: you I was even better looking in
dialog: the real world.
dialog: (looking around the RV)
dialog: I like your set up here.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: We keep it moving. Stay one step
dialog: ahead. We’re rigged up for five if
dialog: we need it...
text: She taps what looks like a radar detector on her dash.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: Got my 40G wifi hotspot, fully
text: encrypted.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Cool.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: What happened with Artemis?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: She hasn’t realized that she loves
dialog: me yet.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: But you love her?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Doesn't matter. We have a key to
dialog: find.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: That’s the spirit.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. REB SAFE HOUSE - DAWN (REAL WORLD)
text: Artemis walks up to the second floor, looking like she didn’t
text: get a good night’s sleep. She knocks on Wade’s door.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wade?
text: No response. She opens the door. His stuff is gone. And so is
dialog: he.
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: Damn it, Wade, I liked you.
text: Then she sees something strange out the window, shadows
text: moving over the front lawn. Pulling herself together, she
text: goes downstairs to check it out...
scene_heading: EXT. REB SAFE HOUSE - DAWN
text: Artemis steps outside, studying the strange shadow patterns
text: on the ground. She looks up and sees a weird formation
text: overhead. She squints, realizing too late what it is...
text: THE SKY IS FILLED WITH DRONES, HUNDREDS OF THEM, like BATS
text: CIRCLING OVERHEAD.
scene_heading: THEN -- BLINDING LIGHTS
text: A HELICOPTER FLIES IN, BLACK SUITED SECURITY GUYS rush the
text: house. Artemis tries to run but is tackled by IOI SECURITY.
text: THEN TEN MORE SECURITY GUYS rush into the house, gunfire and
text: explosions break the night’s silence.
text: It's an all-out assault.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. AECH’S RV - DAY (THE REAL WORLD)
text: Aech drives while Daito and Shoto are logged in to the Oasis,
text: keeping up the hunt. It’s Wade’s turn to sleep, but he keeps
text: tossing and turning, something on his mind...
text: Finally he bolts upright.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I just figured it out. The crystal
dialog: door.
text: Wade climbs up to the front seat.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: In Anorak's Castle, there's a
text: crystal door.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Dude, there's a thousand Anorak's
dialog: Castles.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: But I think I know which one.
dialog: 92.
text: Aech pulls the RV over.
scene_heading: EXT. ANORAK’S CASTLE -- PLANET DOOM (OASIS)
text: The Vonnegut emerges in orbit on the dark side of PLANET
text: DOOM. Daito yells in Japanese, Shoto points out the window...
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Look!
text: Nolan Sorrento has just jumped ahead on the scoreboard.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Sorrento’s got the second key!
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: And I think they’ve beat us to the
dialog: third challenge...
text: Even miles away from Anorak’s Castle, they can see AN
text: ENORMOUS DOME-LIKE FORCE FIELD surrounding it.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: No, you gotta be kidding me.
text: The group deflates.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Screw them.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Screw them. They can’t stop us that
dialog: easy. I’ve got an idea.
scene_heading: INT. AECH'S RV - MOVING (REAL WORLD)
text: Daito is now in the driver’s seat, Shoto in the passenger
dialog: seat translating into Japanese.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: (zipping up his haptic
dialog: suit)
dialog: Tell him to drive in the middle
text: lane, safely and slowly.
text: Shoto translates, Daito nods. Aech gets in her haptic rig.
text: They log in: READY PLAYER ONE?
dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS -- THE OASIS
text: Sorrento, in his office in the Oasis, receives an update
text: through a vidfeed window in his HUD. Number Six stands in
text: front of ANORAK'S CASTLE, INSIDE the force field.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: The intel you got from the raid was
dialog: good, the challenge is in there.
dialog: It’s not easy. But the perimeter’s
dialog: secure, we've got time to figure it
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I’m on my way. Don’t do anything
dialog: until I get there. I want to be the
text: one to walk through the gate.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Yeah, I figured.
text: Sorrento closes the vidfeed window and exits...
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS -- THE OASIS
text: Sorrento leaves his office, heading for the executive
text: transport platform in the IOI courtyard. As he walks past the
text: gravity-defying fountain, someone steps in his way.
text: It’s a bad-ass looking Samurai. Despite a face mask, we
text: recognize him as SHOTO. Sorrento tries to step around him,
text: but Shoto blocks him.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Get the hell out of my way! Do you
dialog: know who I am?
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: Nolan Sorrento, I send greetings
dialog: from Wade Watts and the First Five.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Are you serious? Security!
text: Before Sorrento can get the word out, SHOTO ZAPS SORRENTO
text: WITH a CATTLE PROD. His avatar crumbles to the ground.
scene_heading: INT. SORRENTO’S HOME -- THE REAL WORLD
text: Nolan Sorrento’s eyes suddenly jolt open. That actually hurt.
text: He looks around.
dialog: 94.
text: He’s in his Haptic Hamster Ball, in the same room we saw
text: during the virtual tour of his home. He breathes a sigh of
dialog: relief, the Oasis is so real sometimes...
text: Relieved, he pulls off his visor, then hits a button, which
text: rotates him until he is standing. The hamster ball separates,
dialog: revealing...
text: WADE WATTS, in the flesh, standing right in front of him.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Hello Nolan.
text: Wade is pointing a gun at him. Sorrento goes pale.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: No, it’s not possible.
text: Sorrento climbs out, catching a glimpse of his own reflection
text: in the polished walls of the rig. It’s real world Sorrento,
dialog: all right.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you get into my home?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Without killing anyone. So far.
text: SHOTO steps out, dressed in civilian clothes, but holding a
text: SWORD and a TASER. Despite his age, the look in his eye is
dialog: deadly.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: If you want to keep it that way,
dialog: you're gonna tell us everything you
dialog: know about the third challenge and
dialog: how to pull down that force field.
text: Off Sorrento, terrified...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SORRENTO’S HOME - LATER
text: The door to Sorrento’s Haptic Rig Room opens up, and Wade
text: emerges.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (back into the room)
dialog: Shoto, if his info is bad, start
dialog: taking fingers.
dialog: 95.
text: We can hear Sorrento’s protests as Wade shuts the door behind
text: him. He walks away from the room, and now we reveal...
text: That this “room” is actually a virtual set inside of AECH’S
text: OASIS WORKSHOP. Wade walks over to AECH, who sits at a
text: control board which has fifteen camera views of the action.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: He totally bought it.
text: Wade hands Aech a DATA PACKET (remember they are in the
text: Oasis) and specs for the IOI force field come up in his HUD.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Course he did. He’s in full haptic
dialog: feedback, he can’t tell where he
dialog: is.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: You hear back from Arty?
text: Aech shakes his head “no”, Wade nods.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Great job on the skins, by the way.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Yeah, missed a spot or two.
text: Aech points on one of the monitors. THE BACK OF SORRENTO’S
text: HEAD is unfinished.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Can’t look at the back of your own
dialog: head, right? I wouldn’t worry about
dialog: it.
text: Suddenly, there’s an earthquake-like JOLT.
scene_heading: INT. AECH'S RV - DRIVING -- THE REAL WORLD
text: DAITO, driving as carefully as he can, has just driven over a
text: huge pothole, but only because he’s trying to lose...
speaker_heading: THREE IOI DRONES
text: It’s not clear if they are simply sweeping over or actually
text: tailing them, but Daito is taking no chances. He swerves
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: WADE (0.S.)
dialog: What the hell?
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. CONTROL ROOM -- OASIS
text: WADE speaks through his HUD to DAITO.
speaker_heading: WADE
text: Slow and steady, D.
text: Daito lets out a stream of Japanese, the only recognizable
text: words are “IOI Drones”.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Semi-bad news.
text: Wade turns back to Aech, who has finished analyzing the IOI
dialog: force field.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: The Force Field is from a spell in
dialog: Gauntlet 2027, Magic and Physics
dialog: proof. We can un-cast it, but only
dialog: if we’re in close proximity.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: So we go to the castle and un-cast.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Yeah, but we better hustle.
text: Aech refers to another monitor, a live feed from a gunter
dialog: clan...
text: OUTSIDE IOI HQ -- the SIXER ARMY is preparing for transport
text: to Planet Doom. THOUSANDS OF THEM.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Okay, let’s wrap this up.
text: They turn back to the feed of Sorrento. To their surprise,
text: Shoto not only has his sword to his throat, he is angrily
text: interrogating him.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: If you’re lying, I cut off your
dialog: hands.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I’m not, don’t! They didn’t kill
dialog: her, she’s still alive!
text: Wade suddenly looks up.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: What did he say?
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: The girl, Artemis. We didn’t kill
dialog: her in the raid. We have her!
text: Wade and Aech exchange a look.
scene_heading: INT. SORRENTO’S FAKE DECK
text: Wade storms into the room and grabs Sorrento by the collar.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: IOI, with the other Sixers! She’s
dialog: fine, a little bruised but...
text: WADE goes for Sorrento and Shoto has to hold him back.
speaker_heading: SHOTO
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Chill, Wade. You'll wake him up.
text: Wade turns away from Sorrento, whispers to Aech.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Tell Daito to head for IOI HQ, in
dialog: the RW. Now.
speaker_heading: AECH (0.S.)
text: On it.
scene_heading: EXT. AECH’S RV - DRIVING
text: But DAITO has his own issues. More DRONES close in overhead.
text: Daito has to drive into a tunnel to evade them. An IOI drone
text: EXPLODES as it hits the tunnel strut. But as the van passes
text: into the tunnel, the SIGNAL weakens...
scene_heading: INT. SORRENTO’S FAKE RIG ROOM
text: The loss of the signal causes the room to PIXELATE, just for
text: a moment. Sorrento catches it.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: What was that?
text: Sorrento looks at his reflection again, and this time notices
text: something strange about the back of his head. He tries to
text: contort himself so he can see it, but it’s not easy.
dialog: 98.
text: Another BUMP, another GLITCH...
text: Sorrento’s eyes narrow. He knows what’s going on.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: You slimy little bastard. Guess
dialog: what, I am gonna hurt your little
dialog: girlfriend.
text: Suddenly Sorrento starts pulling at wires that don’t seem to
dialog: be there and... he DISAPPEARS!
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: The real Sorrento wakes up in his actual home, in his real
text: rig, his high-impact haptic skull piece no longer attached.
text: He carefully opens his hamster ball...
dialog: There’s no one there.
text: Furious, Sorrento scrambles out of his unit for real.
scene_heading: INT. AECH'S RV - DAY
text: Aech drives as fast as she can in the direction of IOI
text: headquarters, which is visible, not that far away.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Go faster!
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Going as fast as I can. This isn’t
dialog: my spinner.
dialog: It’s true, compared to the Oasis, driving in the real world
text: is painfully slow.
speaker_heading: AECH (CONT'D)
dialog: Can I just make a point here?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: AECH
text: The Sixers are at the castle on
dialog: Doom, but they won’t take the key
dialog: without Sorrento. So we have a
dialog: short window to get out there...
text: Wade shakes his head.
dialog: 99.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I’m going after Artemis.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: But Wade... think this through.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I love her, Aech.
text: Aech sighs, she understands.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: I get it, but breaking into IOI in
dialog: the Oasis isn’t the same as doing
dialog: it in real life... oh, crap!
text: Suddenly, Aech swerves...
scene_heading: EXT. STREETS OF COLUMBUS
text: Aech’s RV has been cut off by a TESLA LIMO-BUS, the kind kids
dialog: in the future take to prom.
text: Aech immediately throws the van in reverse...
text: BUT A SECOND TESLA, an electricity-guzzling SEDAN, has them
dialog: blocked off.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Dude. We’re f-ed.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: We gotta run for it.
text: Before they can go for the door, a FIGURE steps out into the
text: street, calls to them.
speaker_heading: FIGURE (0.S.)
dialog: Aech! Don’t be a moron! Get out of
dialog: your car!
text: Wade looks at Aech.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Who is that?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: It’s not Sorrento.
speaker_heading: FIGURE (0.S.)
dialog: All of you, stop juggling your nads
dialog: and get out here, time is ticking
text: ticking into the future.
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: EXT. LIMO VAN
text: They four of them tentatively exit the van and walk towards
text: the figure, slowly.
speaker_heading: FIGURE
dialog: Can you please walk faster? Before
dialog: all the bad things happen?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Ven?
text: The voice is the same, but it doesn’t look like David Cross.
text: And yet that is unmistakably the inflections of the Vendor,
text: who is now revealed to be...
scene_heading: OGDEN MORROW.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO VAN
text: Ogden leads them into the back of the giant Tesla party-
dialog: mobile.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: (to the driver)
dialog: Take us to the back entrance of
dialog: Iol.
text: The driver pulls out as Morrow rummages through a bag of
dialog: stuff.
speaker_heading: MORROW (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m impressed with you guys.
dialog: Particularly you, Wade, you really
text: picked up on Halliday’s message
text: very quickly.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: One thing I still don’t understand,
dialog: who was the girl, and why Bethesda
dialog: fountain?
text: Morrow smiles wistfully.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: Her name was Kira. And she was my
dialog: wife. And Bethesda Fountain, that
dialog: was the last place I ever saw
dialog: Halliday.
text: Off the four, still not understanding...
dialog: 101.
scene_heading: EXT. BETHESDA FOUNTAIN - FLASHBACK
text: Halliday and Morrow argue in the real Central Park, circa
dialog: 2017.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: You have to let it go, Jim. Do you
dialog: understand how insane this is?
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: I don’t have to do anything. You
dialog: stole her from me.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: Stole? Kira and I are getting
dialog: married. You went on one date with
dialog: her, fifteen years ago.
text: Halliday is clearly not thinking straight.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: She was the one. The only one. And
dialog: you betrayed me. You’re OUT!
text: Morrow has tears in his eyes. Halliday walks away, leaving a
text: stunned Morrow alone at the fountain.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO VAN - BACK TO PRESENT
text: Morrow is emotional recalling the moment.
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: After Kira died -- and then he got
dialog: sick too -- he sent me a letter.
dialog: Very unlike him. It only had two
text: words on the page. “I’m sorry.”
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: (tearing up)
dialog: Damn. Now I’m getting emotional.
speaker_heading: MORROW
text: This contest is his confessional.
dialog: He wants someone to fix the
dialog: mistakes he made. Or simply not
dialog: make them again.
text: The Limo Van comes to a halt.
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: MORROW (CONT'D)
dialog: As a major shareholder, I’m not
dialog: supposed to interfere, but that
dialog: luckbox kidnapped your lady, and
dialog: that is not cool. Here...
text: He hands Wade and Aech ID CARDS. For IOI.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: How’d you get these?
speaker_heading: MORROW
dialog: I’m super, super obscenely rich. I
dialog: can get anything I want.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Now go. Save your girl. And the
dialog: Oasis.
text: The four of them jump out of the car.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)
text: Sorrento, in his own car, is moments away from IOI HQ.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Have my rig ready. After I talk to
dialog: the girl, I’m going in.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: Wade and Aech use their ID CARDS to enter IOI HQ. They act
text: casual, careful not to raise suspicion from IOI security.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I'll head up to the Sixer floor.
dialog: You hit the computers?
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: Got it.
text: They split off.
scene_heading: EXT. IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)
text: Sorrento pulls into the executive lot. He literally throws
text: his keys at the valet parking guy.
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET DOOM (OASIS)
text: Artemis is on a VIRTUAL CHAIN GANG, helping to fortify IOI
text: defenses around Castle Anorak. She drags her feet, a
text: Supervisor glares at her, but then suddenly, she sees the LOG
text: OUT SCREEN...
scene_heading: INT. SIXER BULLPEN
text: Artemis emerges from the Oasis to see WADE standing over her
dialog: rig.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wade? Oh my God, Wade, you came for
dialog: me!
text: She embraces him, then he KISSES HER.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Come on, we need to move.
text: He pulls her out of the rig.
scene_heading: EXT. IOI COURTYARD -- REAL WORLD
text: Wade leads Artemis by the hand across the courtyard.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Wait, the exit is over here.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: We're not leaving, we’re logging
dialog: in.
text: Artemis looks at him, surprised.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: No one’s beaten the third challenge
dialog: yet. You were the one who convinced
dialog: me. This needs to be done.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Well then we're doing it together.
dialog: But where...
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: The one place they won’t think to
dialog: look, and where they won’t find us
dialog: if they do.
text: Wade leads her to the adjacent IOI LOYALTY CENTER.
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)
text: Sorrento enters the Sixer department, only to see one of his
text: befuddled functionaries standing next to the rig Artemis was
dialog: just in.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: No. You're kidding me.
speaker_heading: SIXER
dialog: She was in here...
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: I thought you had her tethered?
speaker_heading: SIXER
dialog: We did, sir.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Well find her! DAMN YOU, FIND HER!
text: The Sixer runs off, frightened.
scene_heading: INT. LOYALTY CENTER
text: Wade and Artemis run through the rows of hundreds of haptic
text: decks, looking for one in particular.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: (into comms)
dialog: Talk to me, Aech.
speaker_heading: AECH (0.S.)
dialog: It’s in the seventh row... exactly
dialog: eleven units from the end!
text: With Aech’s directions, Wade quickly locates the rig. They
text: swing it open, revealing...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: LaJeremy!
text: It's LaJeremy, Artemis’s NEIGHBOR WITH THE MOHAWK. Wade
text: undoes his restraints.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Your debt is officially paid off.
speaker_heading: LAJEREMY
dialog: Thank you Artemis! You too... dude.
text: He bolts out of there. Artemis gets in. Wade climbs in to the
dialog: next deck.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: First to the key...
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: First to the egg!
scene_heading: INT. SIXER DEPARTMENT -- THE REAL WORLD
text: Sorrento paces up and down the rows of the Sixer department,
text: urging his troops on.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Come on, people, first one to get
text: to the final screen gets a bonus.
dialog: I’m counting on you.
text: A SIXER approaches.
speaker_heading: SIXER
dialog: Sir, we have reason to believe
text: Artemis is still on the premises.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SIXER
dialog: I don’t know, but she’s in the
dialog: Oasis right now.
scene_heading: INT. THE VONNEGUT -- THE OASIS
text: Indeed she is in the Oasis, flying the Vonnegut to Planet
text: Doom, while Parzival streams out a message.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Fellow Gunters, today the assclowns
dialog: at IOI found the third challenge
text: and they put a FORCE FIELD around
dialog: it. They think we are too busy
text: fighting each other to notice.
dialog: Nolan Sorrento thinks the gamers in
dialog: the Oasis will never pull it
dialog: together.
text: Parzival pauses for dramatic effect.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Well I say, tell that to the gunter
text: clans in the gold mines of Ludus.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Tell it to the anons and the
dialog: channers, the newbs in the Reddit
text: Army and the 98th level ninja magic
dialog: users...
text: As Parzival speaks, we see his message broadcast...
scene_heading: EXT. INCIPIO -- THE OASIS
text: On every billboard, on every blimp, on every screen, in every
text: heads up display... all over Incipio, Avatars stop what
text: they’re doing to watch Parzival’s message on their live
dialog: stream.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Tell it to themed Gunter clans, the
dialog: Dothraki Klingon Alliance, the
dialog: Trekkies, the 8 Bit Warriors from
text: the Atari system, the stat-heads
dialog: from the Fantasy Sports guild.
scene_heading: EXT. THE REAL WORLD (VARIOUS)
dialog: Now we focus on individuals in the real world; a portly kid
text: sweating it out in his cheap haptic rig; a cute cheerleader
text: type in a glossy pink immersion unit; a LAN party of 12-year-
text: old pimple-faced geeks in the stacks of Memphis.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET DOOM - APPOMATTOX (OASIS)
text: On the hills of a civil war reenactment, Union and

scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS
text: Sorrento watches from the Sixer division, growing

text: He gets a message from Number Six.
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (0.S)
dialog: Hey, Sorrento, looks like we’ve got
dialog: company.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE ANORAK
text: Number Six stands outside the Castle. Sorrento appears in a

dialog: distance.
text: PARZIVAL stands atop the highest point of Anorak's Fence,
text: holding a BOOMBOX above his head. We hear the first few

speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: First to the key, first to the egg!
text: And now the fiery earwig of death that is BLACKENED by

text: rushes past Parzival and down towards the castle, all of them
dialog: chanting...
speaker_heading: GUNTERS

scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE ANORAK
text: The Vonnegut, Shoto at the helm, flies over the top of the

dialog: the magic incantation of undoing...
speaker_heading: DAITO

scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE ANORAK -- OASIS
text: Sorrento zaps in on the transport platform and walks over to

speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: What the hell?
text: Sorrento, armoring up, yells an order to his troops.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Sixer Army, do not let them through
dialog: the castle walls! Attack!
text: The Sixer Army races out to meet the enemy.
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY OF DOOM

speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Geeks the world over would sing
dialog: songs of that day. The day the
dialog: citizens of the Oasis rose up with
dialog: a mighty fist and collectively

text: To the metaphorical elbow.
text: Within the GUNTER HORDE we find the DELOREAN, weaving past
dialog: all manner of avatar and vehicle.
scene_heading: EXT. VALLEY OF DOOM
text: The DeLorean bounces across the rocky field, plowing through
text: and around Sixers and their allies. Parzival opens his gull
text: wing door and leans out, steering with one hand.
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Sniper rifle!
text: A SNIPER RIFLE suddenly appears in his hand.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: They say I drove and sniped at the
dialog: same time. I don't know that it's
dialog: ever been done before, maybe I had
dialog: auto-aim on, but I know that bodies
dialog: fell by my hand.
text: The armies grow closer and closer. Parzival pops off a shot
text: that blows up a Sixer jeep.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: The sweat of a hundred thousand
text: nerds poured forth that day.
dialog: It was violent and aggressive and
text: slightly NSFW.
dialog: And now the armies MEET! It’s an insane fight, every kind of
text: Avatar one can imagine, as if Peter Jackson staged a battle
text: with cosplayers from Comicon.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: They sent trolls...
text: Huge TROLLS stomp across the battlefield, one of them about
text: to STOMP on the DeLorean...
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: ... And we countered with Giants.

scene_heading: INT. DELOREAN

dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: More weapons!
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Staff of piercing?
text: Artemis tosses him a DATA PACKET that becomes a long SPEAR in
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Staff of piercing!
text: He throws it, skewering eleven Sixers at once.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Nuchakus of destiny!
text: They appear in Parzival’s hand and he smacks a disgusting ORC
text: with them, literally knocking it into next week.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Bow of ending!
text: Parzival fires a destructive arrow, and now OTHER GUNTERS get
text: into the action, offering their own inventory to Parzival. He
text: repeats the names of each as he uses them.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Anti-personnel ordinance cannon!
dialog: Rail Gun! Axe gun!
text: A gun that fires AXES. Silly, but effective.
speaker_heading: GUNTER
dialog: Velociraptor!
text: Parzival throws a full grown dinosaur at a group of Sixers.
speaker_heading: GUNTER 2
dialog: Grenade disguised as a kitten!
text: Parzival, a bit surprised, looks down at the cute kitten now
text: in his hand. He shrugs and throws it.
text: IN THE FIELD -- A group of sixers look down at the cute
text: widdle kitty... she purrs and then EXPLODES, incinerating
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: (solemnly)
dialog: Musket of Infinite Velocity.
dialog: 111.
text: A MUSKET, courtesy of Aech, appears in Parzival’s hand. He
text: fires it and A MUSKET BALL smashes through a SIXER, then
text: continues and LITERALLY CIRCLES THE PLANET before smashing
dialog: into the next sixer, and the next one...
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Sixer blood ran safe-for-teen green
dialog: in the rivers of Planet Doom, in
text: the shadow of Anorak’s lair.
scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE ANORAK
text: Sorrento, starting to get nervous, sees that the tide is
text: turning. He pages through his HUD, looking for the right
dialog: weapon.
scene_heading: EXT. ANORAK’S CASTLE
text: Shoto and Daito are at the front lines, expertly cutting down
text: trolls and IOI soldiers with their samurai swords, trying to
dialog: clear the one bridge into the castle when...
text: They come face to face with a SAURON/SMAUG/VOLDEMORT mash up.
text: Forty feet tall, one huge EYE staring down at them
text: menacingly.
text: Shoto and Daito brandish their swords and face off with the
text: creature, realizing... it’s SORRENTO.
text: Sorrento makes short work of Daito, though Shoto manages to
text: hack off one of his hands.
text: Then AECH steps in as the IRON GIANT. He SQUASHES SORRENTO.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS (REAL WORLD)
text: Sorrento, infuriated, finds himself logged out of his rig. He
text: rushes to get out of the rig and take another Sixer’s spot,
text: when he is approached by IOI Security.
speaker_heading: IOI SECURITY
dialog: Sir, we've found them. They’re in
dialog: the loyalty center.
text: Sorrento follows the guards.
scene_heading: EXT. ANORAK’S CASTLE
text: Artemis, driving now, steers away from the main gate where
text: the battle is still being pitched.
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: All the other bridges are
dialog: destroyed, we need to go through
text: the main gate.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Too many obstacles.
text: She heads for one of the shattered side bridges. It has
text: collapsed into the water, but part of it sticks up, almost
dialog: like... A RAMP.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Could just be a glitch.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: C'mon Z, what have we learned?
dialog: There are no glitches. Halliday put
dialog: it there for a reason.
text: The DeLorean roars up the collapsed bridge, hits the ramped
text: part, and TAKES OFF...
text: Jumping the moat the same way Artemis once jumped the cement
text: truck... and landing right in front of the castle, crushing
text: some Sixers in the process.
text: Artemis and Parzival prepare to enter the Castle when
dialog: suddenly...
text: THE IRON GIANT reaches down and deposits Aech next to them.
text: A moment later Shoto and Daito drop in.
text: The five of them enter the Castle.
scene_heading: INT. ANORAK’S CASTLE
text: As our team wanders down a cobblestone corridor, they can
text: hear a SIXER struggling with the challenge.
speaker_heading: SIXER (0.S.)
dialog: No. NO!
text: Tentatively the Five step inside the Castle’s cavernous Great
dialog: Hall to find...
text: The final challenge is deceivingly simple. It’s a stand up
text: arcade cabinet of DONKEY KONG.
text: The stressed-out Sixer makes a mistake.
speaker_heading: SIXER (CONT'D)
dialog: Crap! These effing barrels!
dialog: 113.
text: And POOF, he disappears. Clearly you get one shot at the
dialog: challenge, then you have to start over another day.
text: Parzival turns to look at the troops.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Everyone ready for some Donkey
dialog: Kong?
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX (0.S.)
dialog: Not so fast.
text: They turn to see NUMBER SIX waiting for them, holding a
dialog: briefcase.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Name’s Number Six.
speaker_heading: AECH
dialog: What’cha got there, paperwork?
speaker_heading: NUMBER SIX
dialog: Briefcase nuke. Sorry bucko, but a
dialog: job’s a job.
text: Number Six hits a button on the handle...
speaker_heading: BOOM!
text: A sound like the entire universe cracking in half.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: When your avatar gets killed, your
text: point of view shifts into third-
dialog: person, giving you an out-of-body
dialog: replay of your final moment.
text: WADE’S POV -- An INCINERATING WHITE LIGHT fills the world,
text: accompanied by an earsplitting wall of sound.
text: A blast disintegrates everything, all the Gunters and Sixers
text: outside, all the dragons and robots and bunnies. Even the
text: First Five are incinerated, to a fine, atomized dust,
text: suspended in the air for a moment before slowly settling to
dialog: earth.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: I waited for the inevitable, final
dialog: message to appear in my display,
dialog: the words I knew every other avatar
dialog: in the sector must be seeing at
dialog: this very moment.
text: ANORAK'S CASTLE remains standing, and the Donkey Kong arcade
text: cabinet is still there. Otherwise, the place is empty.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
speaker_heading: GAME OVER.
text: But instead, a different message appears:
dialog: Congratulations! You have an extra life!
text: Parzival’s avatar reappears, fading back into existence right
text: where he'd died a few seconds earlier.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
speaker_heading: In the history of the OASIS, there
dialog: was no record of any avatar ever
dialog: acquiring an extra life.
text: He looks down to see that everything he'd been carrying is
text: gone, and his avatar now wears a black T-shirt and blue
text: jeans, the default outfit on every newly created avatar.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Hello? Can anyone hear me?
text: Silence. He reaches in his pocket, pulls out...
text: THE QUARTER. Only now do we realize that it is made of the
text: same high-definition material as the keys, it is a special,
dialog: gleaming quarter.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: Morrow had given me the most
dialog: powerful weapon in all of the
dialog: Oasis.
text: Parzival walks up to the Donkey Kong cabinet. He drops the
dialog: quarter in.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS (THE REAL WORLD)
text: Sorrento and his Security team race into the Loyalty Center
text: bullpen. Sorrento taps a screen, bringing up a GUIDE to who’s
dialog: in which rig.
text: ON THE SCREEN -- Every rig has the same name, NOLAN SORRENTO.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Let's go, rig by rig, start
dialog: checking!
text: The team spreads out through the room, opening one rig after
text: another, searching for Wade and Artemis.
scene_heading: INT. ANORAK’S CASTLE (OASIS)
text: Parzival calmly progresses through a game of Donkey Kong.
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: I could tell you it was the most
dialog: epic game of Donkey Kong I'd ever
dialog: played...
dialog: We time lapse Parzival playing a really long game of Donkey
text: Kong, INTERCUT with Sorrento and his men opening rig after
dialog: rig...
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: But it was actually easier than I
dialog: expected. Halliday’s score wasn't
dialog: that great.
text: Parzival finishes a level, his score overtakes Halliday’s,
text: Donkey Kong FALLS off the scaffold, and in the process lets
dialog: go of what he was holding. No, not the Princess...
scene_heading: THE CRYSTAL KEY
text: It leaps off the screen and appears in front of Parzival. He
text: snatches it out of the air.
scene_heading: INT. LOYALTY CENTER (REAL WORLD)
text: Sorrento is starting to lose hope that he will find them, the
dialog: room is so big, there are so many rigs to check...
scene_heading: INT. ANORAK’S CASTLE (OASIS)
text: Parzival approaches the legendary UNOPENABLE CRYSTAL GATE. It
text: is famed for its lack of a keyhole, but today it has THREE
text: keyholes. Parzival takes out the Copper Key and places it
text: into the first key hole. Then he puts the jade key in the
text: second, and the crystal key in the third. He turns the three
dialog: keys one by one, then...
text: THE CRYSTAL GATE OPENS, leading into a spinning whirlpool of
text: stars. Parzival steps through the gate...
dialog: 116.
scene_heading: INT. ANORAK’S CASTLE - STUDY (OASIS)
text: And into Anorak's study. Towering shelves line the room,
text: filled with ancient scrolls and dusty spellbooks. And
text: floating in the center of the room...
dialog: The egg.
text: Parzival stares at it, a large white oval with pixelated
text: edges. He gently takes it in his hands, in awe.
text: Directly beneath a black dragon painting, on an ornate
text: crystal pedestal, sits a gold chalice, encrusted with tiny
text: jewels. Its diameter matches that of Parzival’s silver egg.
text: Parzival places the egg in the chalice. It fits perfectly.
text: In the distance, a fanfare of TRUMPETS grows, and the egg
text: begins to glow.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: You win.
text: Parzival turns to see ANORAK standing right behind him. His
text: obsidian black robes seem to pull the sunlight out of the
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: ANORAK
dialog: The game is over. It's time for you
dialog: to receive your prize.
text: Anorak holds out a long-fingered hand. Parzival hesitates,
text: then he takes it.
text: Cascading bolts of blue lightning erupt in the space between
text: them, their spiderweb tines enveloping them both.
text: When the lightning subsides, Anorak is no longer dressed in
text: his black wizard's robes. In fact, he no longer looks like
dialog: Anorak at all.
text: He’s James Halliday. Pale, middle-aged, dressed in his Space
text: Invaders T-shirt.
text: When Parzival looks down at his own avatar, he sees HE is now
text: wearing Anorak's robes. The icons and readouts around the
text: edge of his HUD now show his stats all completely maxed out.
dialog: He now has a list of spells, inherent powers, and magic items
text: that seem to scroll on forever.
text: And his credit readout now displays a number twelve digits
dialog: long.
dialog: 117.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: Congratulations, Parzival. Your
dialog: avatar is immortal and all-
dialog: powerful. Whatever you want, all
dialog: you have to do is wish for it.
dialog: Pretty sweet, right?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Super sweet.
text: Halliday leans toward Parzival and lowers his voice.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: So you ready to run this place?
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: Actually, I’m going to split it
dialog: with my friends.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: (nods )
dialog: Good thinking. You need someone you
dialog: can trust, worst mistake I ever
dialog: made was thinking I could do it
dialog: alone.
speaker_heading: PARZIVAL
dialog: I've got someone I trust, Mr.
dialog: Halliday.
speaker_heading: HALLIDAY
dialog: Don’t ever let her go.
text: Halliday disappears. Parzival barely has a moment to register
text: that he’s gone when he’s violently pulled from the OASIS.
scene_heading: INT. IOI HEADQUARTERS - THE REAL WORLD
text: Wade is suddenly pulled out of the Oasis and back into the
text: real world. His rig is surrounded by IOI Security, who also
text: hold Artemis hostage. Nolan Sorrento holds a gun up to Wade.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Out. Get out of the rig.
text: Wade climbs out, though he LEAVES HIS HEADSET with the
text: microphone facing out.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO (CONT'D)
dialog: The notion that a piece of stack-
dialog: trash like you would ever run the
dialog: Oasis is laughable. The entire
dialog: system would fall apart in days.
dialog: 118.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Maybe. But it’s better than the
dialog: future you’ve got planned out, you
text: can of monkey balls.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Well, I guess we’ll just see about
dialog: that. Because you’re not walking
dialog: out of here alive.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: I think you forget, I’ve already
dialog: won. I’m a God in the Oasis.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: You’re not in the Oasis anymore.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: No, but once I tell everyone that
dialog: they are released from any debt
dialog: incurred while in the Oasis and are
dialog: therefore free to log out right
dialog: now, well...
text: Sorrento turns to see hundreds of people, rising up out of
text: their rigs.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess the question is, how many
dialog: bullets do you have in that gun,
dialog: punk?
text: The crowd of downtrodden “Loyalists” close in on Sorrento.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Put the gun down, Sorrento. It’s
dialog: over.
text: The Guards, seeing they have no chance, let Artemis go.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: She's right, Nolan. And before you
dialog: do anything stupider, you might
dialog: want to hear about the offer I’m
dialog: prepared to make you, now that I’m
dialog: in charge.
text: Sorrento is nothing if not pragmatic. He puts the gun down.
text: Wade takes it away from him, and then some of the loyalists
dialog: grab him.
speaker_heading: SORRENTO
dialog: Well, what’s your proposal?
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Dude, you killed a whole bunch of
dialog: people including my aunt. You're
dialog: going to jail, that’s my proposal.
text: Sorrento yells as he is dragged away.
speaker_heading: WADE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t drop the soap!
scene_heading: EXT. IOI HEADQUARTERS - DAY (REAL WORLD)
text: As Sorrento is taken into police custody, Wade and Artemis
text: are joined by Aech, Shoto and Daito. They do a communal three
dialog: slap hi-five, because as goofy as it looks, that is what’s
dialog: cool in 2044.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: First to the key...
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: First to the egg!
scene_heading: BY THE FOUNTAIN
text: Wade and Artemis share a quiet moment away from the crowd. He
text: takes her hand.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: So what happens now?
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Maybe we should buy a really nice
text: apartment and move in together.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: Well, we only just met a few days
dialog: ago.
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yeah. But I'm in love with you.
text: Artemis’ lower lip starts to tremble.
speaker_heading: ARTEMIS
dialog: You're sure about that?
speaker_heading: WADE
dialog: Yes. I am. And I’m not gonna miss
dialog: my chance to tell you.
dialog: 120.
text: Artemis leans over and kisses him. We begin to pull back...
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: As we stood there, kissing, it
dialog: occurred to me that for the first
dialog: time in as long as I could
dialog: remember...
text: The kiss is still going...
speaker_heading: WADE (V.O.)
dialog: «+. I had absolutely no desire to
dialog: log back into the OASIS.
text: And as we pull back, back, we hear another voice...
speaker_heading: KID (0.S.)
dialog: Did all of that really happen?
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN (0.S.)
dialog: Exactly as it was told.
scene_heading: INT. WADE WATTS BIOGRAPHY -- THE OASIS
text: A young boy’s avatar -- ERNIE, age ten -- follows the
text: Historian as he ambles down a long hallway, closing all the
text: doors they've opened. The narration of the movie has indeed
text: been Wade telling his own story, just as Halliday told his.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: But what happened with the first
dialog: five? Did Wade share the Oasis with
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: Of course. Well, until the great
dialog: schism. But that’s next door, in
dialog: volume three.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: The what?
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: After the War of the Oasis, in
dialog: volume two, there was the Great
dialog: Schism. When Shoto raised an army
dialog: of...
dialog: (catching himself)
dialog: I don’t want to spoil it. Off you
dialog: go now, your class is leaving.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: Do you know any cheats for Aech’s
dialog: scavenger hunt?
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: No, and if I did I wouldn’t tell
dialog: you. Off we go.
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: I’1l come back tomorrow.
speaker_heading: HISTORIAN
dialog: No need. Try another book. Or maybe
dialog: video games?
speaker_heading: ERNIE
dialog: I love Parzival and I’m coming back
dialog: every single day! And I’m gonna
dialog: write my own memoir!
text: The Historian looks less than thrilled as Ernie races off to
text: catch up with his class as they exit.
scene_heading: EXT. MEMOIR-OPOLIS (OASIS)
text: A long line of people snake down the street, all waiting to
dialog: enter the most popular biography on Memoiropolis:
scene_heading: READY PLAYER ONE: THE STORY OF Z@
text: Wade’s story is divided into three separate buildings, one
dialog: for each volume.
text: As we pan past the line, we reveal other memoirs, some more
dialog: crowded than others:
text: COOKING WITH SWORDS -- Shoto and Daito’s poorly reviewed
dialog: cookbook.
text: THE HUNT FOR JRC -- A badass account of how Artemis hunted
text: down a rogue JaRichard Cheney in the Oasis Wars.
dialog: And finally...
text: OASIS 2.0, Aech’s account of how she built the mysterious and
dialog: frightening Second Oasis, that some claim exists INSIDE the
dialog: first Oasis.
text: Ernie walks past them all, a smile on his face, a sparkle in
dialog: his eye. Inspired, as we all are, by a great story... no
dialog: matter what form it might take.
speaker_heading: GAME OVER.
dialog:
