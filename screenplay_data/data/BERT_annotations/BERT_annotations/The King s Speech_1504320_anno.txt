text: THE KING'S SPEECH
dialog: Written by
dialog: David Seidler
speaker_heading: OPEN ON:
scene_heading: 1 INT. BATHROOM, YORK HOUSE, LONDON - DAY (MID-1930'S) 1
text: A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free
text: standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs -
text: bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's "Trumpet
dialog: Volunteer".
text: A head emerges.
text: White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing
text: naked wet body in white towels.
scene_heading: 2 INT. DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY 2
text: The ritual continues with crisp military precision.
text: CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and
text: unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp,
text: thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and
text: Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown.
text: This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white
dialog: shirt.
text: Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet
text: and gartered legs to be inserted.
text: Mirror-polished boots are laced tight.
text: Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received.
text: Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling
text: field of ribbons and medallions.
text: Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted.
text: Polished buttons are fastened.
text: Multi-coloured collar clasped shut.
text: White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed
text: and placed upon brilliantined hair.
text: PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known
text: to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second
text: son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a
text: sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which
text: he's been bedecked.
text: Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 3.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You look like a Christmas tree.
text: He smiles wanly.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY 3
text: THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill.
text: Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess.
text: Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH -
dialog: considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land,
text: truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from
text: all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously,
text: creating a happy chaos.
text: Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave.
text: Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and
text: four, wave back from their nursery window.
scene_heading: 4 INT/EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS, HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY 4
text: Bertie nervously lights a cigarette. Elizabeth pats his hand.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't
dialog: rain.
text: BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators,
text: prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs,
text: agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry
text: placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of
dialog: the day.
text: A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose
text: spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants.
text: REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back.
text: The first drops splatter against the glass. Elizabeth sighs.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Never trust the wireless.
text: Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour,
text: which segues into a GARGLING sound.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 4.
scene_heading: 5 INT. BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY 5
text: A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling
text: while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the
text: ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He
text: expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth
text: fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an
text: atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb,
text: and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the
dialog: control room.
text: The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three...
dialog: two...
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen: good afternoon. This
dialog: is the BBC National and World Programmes
dialog: taking you to Wembley Stadium.
text: He speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones. There's no higher
text: creature in the vocal world.
scene_heading: 6 EXT. WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY 6
text: ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas
text: hiding the spectators from view.
text: Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded
text: chairs with the other dignitaries. They are:
text: KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and
text: uniform, accompanied by his wife.
text: QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame.
text: DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed,
text: balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority.
text: WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is
text: lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition.
text: STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed.
text: His hair, as always, parted down the middle.
text: NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin,
text: lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk.
text: A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on
text: springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening,
text: even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a
text: blow. Elizabeth sees his terror.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 5.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Why wasn't he told?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Ten million people listening around the
dialog: world, Mam. Possibly more.
dialog: (as though Bertie didn't
dialog: exist)
dialog: His brother, and father, have been
dialog: broadcasting since last year.
text: The King, growing impatient, hisses:
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: Get on with it. Show what you're made of!
text: Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of
text: confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots,
text: chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.
text: It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter.
text: A man who cannot speak in public.
text: Lang whispers to Churchill. When Lang whispers, everyone can
dialog: hear.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage
dialog: for all the world. And on such an important
dialog: occasion.
dialog: Lang really is a piece of work.
text: For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this
text: point on in the script.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was
dialog: standing before you today.
text: POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas. No response. This is going
dialog: to be a torment for him, and his audience.
scene_heading: 7 INT. BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY 7
text: A glowing dial on the face of a studio radio. Everyone
text: listening intently.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 6.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (ON RADIO)
dialog: (stuttering profoundly)
dialog: Be that as it may...my brother David is
dialog: attending to other duties in the furthest
dialog: parts of this vast Empire...
text: The radio falls silent. Eyes widen in concern.
scene_heading: 8 EXT. WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY 8
text: Bertie stands frozen, his mouth agape, jaw muscles locked. He
dialog: knows he's considered by all, especially himself, unfit for
dialog: public life.
text: Elizabeth is devastated.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: Just needs more practice.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY 9
text: TRACKING SHOT - rain splatters on brass plaques denoting Dr This
dialog: or Dr That, specialists in various maladies. Halt at a plaque
text: that reads: LIONEL LOGUE, SPEECH SPECIALIST.
scene_heading: 10 INT. RECEPTION ROOM, LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY 10
text: Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all.
text: The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat
text: decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her
dialog: features.
text: She waits. Coughs. No response. Calls imperiously:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are you there?
text: From behind a door:
speaker_heading: LIONEL (O.S.)
dialog: In the lav.
dialog: Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's
text: further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed,
text: and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his
text: forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His
text: demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although
text: Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 7.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: "How poor are they that have not patience!
dialog: What wound did ever heal but by degrees?"
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Iago...world's greatest villain. Just wants
dialog: to be bad. Sorry, no receptionist.
text: He offers to shake hands. She doesn't take it, even though
text: she's gloved.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (with sang froid)
dialog: I'd be more comfortable in your office.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That's for clients. Where's Mister J?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He doesn't know I'm here.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That's not a promising start.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: My husband's seen everyone. They were all
text: useless. He's given up hope.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A bit premature.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Because he hasn't seen you?
text: Lionel doesn't disgree.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: You're very sure of yourself.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Of course my husband wants to be cured! His
dialog: position requires public speaking upon
dialog: occasion. A torment. I fear the requirement
dialog: may grow more frequent.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: He should change jobs.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 8.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: He can't.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Indentured servitude?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Something of that nature.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his
dialog: personal history. I'll make a frank
dialog: appraisal.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Doctor...
text: Logue tries to object but she over-rides.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I do not have a "hubby". We never talk
dialog: about our private lives. Nor do we `pop'.
dialog: You must come to us.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf,
dialog: by my rules.
text: The lady lifts her veil.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Perhaps you'll make an exception?
text: He recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet
text: refuses to be intimidated.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I thought the appointment was for
dialog: "Johnson"?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: A name used during the Great War, when the
dialog: Navy didn't wish the enemy to know His
dialog: Royal Highness was aboard.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm considered the enemy?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You will be, should you continue to be un-
dialog: obliging.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 9.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: For my method to succeed there must be
dialog: mutual trust, complete honesty, and total
dialog: equality. That process takes place in my
dialog: consultation room. No exceptions.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: In which case...
dialog: (re-lowering her veil)
dialog: I should have kept my pledge. I promised my
dialog: husband I'd stop seeking "The Great Cure."
dialog: I've wasted your time. And mine.
text: She exits, closing the door firmly behind her.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bloody hell, I buggered that.
text: WACK! The sound of something solid meeting leather.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 11
text: A foot kicks a ball. Lionel is returning home from work. He's a
text: well-known fixture locally. Some lads are playing footie. One
text: of them passes the ball to Lionel who, despite briefcase and
text: rolled brolly, dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and
text: entering a modest brownstone.
scene_heading: 12 INT. LOGUE'S ENTRYWAY AND STAIRWELL - LATE AFTERNOON 12
text: As Lionel mounts the stairs he's set upon by three sturdy boys -
text: VALENTINE, IAN, and PETER - with handkerchiefs tied around the
text: lower portions of their faces and armed with broomstick swords.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: Stand and deliver!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (falling into the game)
dialog: `ow dares molest...Jack The Ripper?!
text: The boys scream with delight and a sword fight ensues - Lionel
text: using his brolly.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Beware, Highwaymen, or I'll run yee
dialog: through.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: We're Swagmen, not Highwaymen, Dad.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 10.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Beware, jolly Swagmen, I'll skewer yer
dialog: gizzards.
text: Lionel wife - MYRTLE - appears at the head of the stairs; a
text: sweet-faced, down-to-earth woman.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: You'll all hang from the gallows if you
dialog: don't come for tea.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Boys, I think we'd best go up.
scene_heading: 13 INT. LOGUE'S DINING ROOM - EVENING 13
text: Logue, Myrtle, and the boys are finishing at the table.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Had a visit from a lady today.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Another spoiled silly?
speaker_heading: VALENTINE
dialog: May we be excused?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You must stay, bored stupid, listening to
dialog: your parents' inane conversation.
speaker_heading: THE BOYS
dialog: (grinning)
dialog: Thanks, dad!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And mum.
speaker_heading: THE BOYS
dialog: And mum!
text: They start to leave.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Take your plates.
text: The boys grabs their plates and exit. After a moment...
speaker_heading: MYRTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: No wonder about the silly. You're so good
dialog: at what you do.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 11.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: At what I do.
dialog: (then, deliberately being
dialog: `theatrical')
dialog: Twas a Lady with a capital L.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Oh, Lionel, that'd get us home in grand
dialog: style wouldn't it?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: She came on behalf of her husband. Which is
dialog: not the proper way. I told her I was fully
dialog: booked.
text: Myrtle is clearly disappointed
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: She was...too high and mighty. Know what I
dialog: mean.
text: She does. There's an unspoken code between them.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: We wouldn't want that.
text: Covers her letdown.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hard to feel sorry for that sort.
dialog: Silence, then:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Had a call. Wish me luck?
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
text: Course, Lionel. Loads and loads.
scene_heading: 14 INT. CHILDREN'S NURSERY, 145 PICCADILLY - NIGHT 14
text: Elizabeth, fashionably attired for an evening-out, is curled on
text: a bearskin rug reading "Peter Pan" to the girls.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: "Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into
dialog: the nursery too late. The birds were
dialog: flown."
text: Bertie enters, handsome in a tuxedo. Elizabeth closes the book.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Tomorrow, Chapter IV, `The Flight'.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 12.
text: The two little girls clap with joy.
speaker_heading: MARGARET ROSE
dialog: Oh, to fly away!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Weren't they lucky.
text: Within his family, Bertie's stutter is virtually absent.
speaker_heading: LILIBET
dialog: One would have to learn to fly properly of
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: MARGARET ROSE
dialog: Now a Daddy story!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Can I be a penguin instead?
text: He drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like a
text: penguin. The girls giggle, but are undeterred.
speaker_heading: LILIBET
dialog: The horsie story, please.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Ah well.
text: Called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. But the
text: two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor
text: impediment, and it fades.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Once upon a time there were two horsies. A
dialog: white horse that went clip clop clip clop
text: through Hyde Park. And a black horse that
text: went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
text: They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The
text: white horse said "neigh". The black horse
text: said, "neigh". The white horse continued
text: on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
text: The black horse continued on, clip clop
dialog: clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the
text: end of the story. Now off to bed.
dialog: As the girls exit:
speaker_heading: LILIBET
dialog: A silly story really. But Father tells it
dialog: rather well.
text: The girls have gone.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 13.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: David called. He said come round to The
dialog: Fort on Friday and stay for dinner.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Will she be there?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I suppose.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Seriously?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Seriously, she'll be there.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I think I meant... is David serious?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: About our coming?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: About her!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: A married American? Twice divorced? He
dialog: can't be.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: She can.
scene_heading: 15 INT. STAGE OF A LONDON THEATRE - NEW DAY 15
text: Movements behind a curtain.
speaker_heading: MUFFLED VOICE (UNSEEN)
dialog: Now?
dialog: From the auditorium:
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Now!
text: Someone pushes through a gap. Its Lionel.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: "Now..."
text: Falters, begins again.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 14.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: "Now is the winter of our discontent
dialog: Made glorious summer by this sun of
dialog: York..."
text: His elocution is crisp and flawless. His acting, however, is
text: unconvincing.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: "And all the clouds that lour'd upon our
dialog: house
text: In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
dialog: Now are our brows bound with victorious
dialog: wreaths..."
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: (interrupts crisply)
dialog: Thank you. Beautiful diction...but I don't
text: hear the cries of a deformed creature
dialog: yearning to be King.
text: Lionel struggles to maintain a semblance of dignity.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What do you suggest?
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR
dialog: Continue to do whatever you do, and hope it
dialog: gives you a great deal of satisfaction.
text: Crushed, Lionel retreats behind the curtain.
scene_heading: 16 EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW EVENING 16
text: Cold and austere mausoleum illuminated by floodlights.
text: On the parade ground, Grenadier Guards in red coats and black
text: bearskin busbies drill stiffly like toy soldiers. Viewing stands
text: are beginning to fill.
text: The King's voice is heard:
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V (O.S.)
text: Stride boldly up to the bloody thing, stare
dialog: it square in the eye, and talk to it as you
dialog: would to any decent Englishman.
scene_heading: 17 INT. THE KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - EVENING 17
text: The King's study resembles a naval captain's cabin. Both men
text: are uniformed for a state occasion. Bertie regards the BBC
text: microphone as though it were an alien.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 15.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I d-d-don't thu-thu-think I c-c-can.
text: In the presence of his father, Bertie's stuttering returns in
text: full form, his breathing short and shallow, the muscles in
text: spasms.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: Show who's in command. If you don't, this
dialog: devilish device will change everything.
dialog: Used to be, all a King had to do was look
dialog: reasonable in uniform and not fall off his
dialog: horse. Now we must creep cap in hand into
dialog: people's homes that smell of boiled
dialog: cabbage, and speak nicely to them. We're
dialog: reduced to that lowest, basest of all
dialog: creatures...we've become...actors! Don't
dialog: give me a look of defeated pathos. This is
dialog: a family crisis!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Father, we're not a family, we're a firm.
text: His father shoots Bertie a surprised look. Does the lad have a
dialog: brain after all?
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: We're the oldest, most successful,
dialog: corporation in the world and sitting on
dialog: thrones is our business! But any moment now
dialog: we may be out of work. Your brother came to
dialog: me the other day, livid a certain lady has
dialog: been refused an invitation to my Silver
dialog: Jubilee. I pointed out she wasn't a lady
dialog: and most definitely wasn't his wife.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What did David say?
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: She made him sublimely happy. I said: that
dialog: was probably because she was sleeping with
dialog: him. "I give you my word we've never had
dialog: immoral relations." "As my son, as Prince
dialog: of Wales, as my heir, do you solemnly swear
dialog: your friendship with this woman is an
dialog: absolutely clean one?" "I do", he said.
dialog: "Look me in the eye," I said. "On my
dialog: honour" he said. Stared straight at his
dialog: father... and lied.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh my brother...
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 16.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: When I'm dead that boy will ruin himself,
dialog: this family, and this nation, within twelve
dialog: months. Who'll pick up the pieces? David's
dialog: friend, Oswald Mosley? His black-shirt
dialog: British Union of Fascists are marching
text: through London. Hitler terrorizing half of
dialog: Europe, Stalin the other half. Who'll stand
dialog: between us, the jackboots, and the
dialog: proletarian abyss? You?
text: A red light attached to the mike begins a series of warning
text: blinks.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What're you going to say?
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
text: The usual guff. The Archbishop writes it.
dialog: My people love to hear me say it. Spoken
dialog: fluently, of course.
text: They're interrupted by the entrance of the BBC News Reader and
dialog: Technicians.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V (CONT'D)
dialog: That's the chap who taught me how to use
dialog: this contraption. You touch your chin with
dialog: your thumb and the `thing' with the end of
dialog: your little finger. Splendid fellow.
text: SQUISH. Assisted by the Technicians, the News Reader sprays his
dialog: throat.
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER
dialog: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is
dialog: the BBC, broadcasting direct from
dialog: Buckingham Palace upon the occasion of the
dialog: Royal Silver Jubilee. His Majesty: King
dialog: George the Fifth.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: (to the mike)
dialog: "I can only say to you, my very very dear
dialog: people, that the Queen and I thank you from
dialog: the depths of our hearts for all the
dialog: loyalty and - may I say so? - the love with
dialog: which this day and always you have
dialog: surrounded us. I dedicate myself anew to
dialog: your service for all the years that may
dialog: still be given to me."
text: The News Reader, terribly moved, whispers to his Technicians:
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 17.
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER
dialog: That's how a King speaks.
dialog: (adds with splendid false
dialog: modesty)
dialog: I showed HM how to do it.
scene_heading: 18 EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT 18
text: The edge of the crowd is visible. One can sense a vast sea of
text: humanity. When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the
text: murmur becomes a ROAR. When the King steps out, it becomes
dialog: tumultuous.
scene_heading: 19 EXT. BALCONY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS 19
text: The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of
text: Canterbury, other Royals, and dignitaries. The noise is
text: deafening. The King beckons impatiently for someone still
text: inside to join them. It's Bertie, with Elizabeth.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They didn't come to see us, Father.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: Pretend.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Where's David?
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: Bedding his American whore. Come, join the
dialog: fun!
dialog: (aside to Elizabeth)
dialog: You'll have to do a lot more of this. I'm
dialog: sending him to the Midlands. With all the
dialog: factory noise they won't hear a word he
dialog: says.
text: The King goes back to waving. Elizabeth is stunned at the
dialog: prospect.
text: The ROAR of the crowd segues into the ROAR of machinery.
scene_heading: 20 INT. MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY 20
text: Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral. WORKERS are lined up
text: dutifully to hear the visiting Royal. Bertie's lips move, but
text: with the noise he cannot be heard. Elizabeth watches in relief.
text: Then a FOREMAN, trying to be helpful, signals. The machinery
text: halts, the factory falls silent.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 18.
text: At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries
dialog: Bertie forward.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What's needed is cooperation...
text: Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory
text: brings Bertie's stutter back in full form.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: ...buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses...
text: One of the workers sullenly pulls a chain, releasing a blast
text: from a steam whistle that drowns Bertie out.
scene_heading: 21 EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS DRIVING THRU HYDE PARK - NEW DAY 21
text: THE ROYAL STANDARD fluttering.
scene_heading: 22 INT. AUSTIN PRINCESS - DAY 22
text: Elizabeth and Bertie in the back.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Is this necessary?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: You know perfectly well.
text: As they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads:
text: PRINCE OF WALES TELLS MINERS "SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!"
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
text: Neglects to tell them what must be done,
dialog: how its to be done, and who's to do it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: David has `the touch'. They adore him.

text: inside. Some point.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll wager they're saying: There's the
dialog: useless one who can't speak.
scene_heading: 23 INT. LOGUE'S WAITING ROOM - DAY 23
text: Bertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper:
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 19.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There's no receptionist.
text: Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: The Johnsons.
text: From the inner office.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (O.S.)
dialog: Not finished yet.
text: Elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: How'd you find this physician?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (poker-faced)
dialog: Classifieds; next to "Saucy model,
dialog: Shepherd's Market".
text: Bertie smiles despite his mood.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Comes highly recommended. Charges
dialog: substantial fees in order to help the poor.
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm not sure I want to see this fellow.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I'm not sure he wants to see you.
text: The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman
text: - ANNA - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are. She
text: retreats rapidly back into the consulting room.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Perhaps this was a mistake.
text: After an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be
text: properly formal, and stutters:
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm not actually Mr ...
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 20.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (whispers, terrified)
dialog: I know.
dialog: (then to Elizabeth)
dialog: Dr Logue says...
speaker_heading: LIONEL (O.S.)
dialog: Lionel!
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it
dialog: being a pleasant day, take a stroll.
dialog: (to the consultation room)
dialog: Was that alright?
speaker_heading: LIONEL (O.S.)
dialog: Bloody marvellous.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: (choking up)
dialog: Thank you...Lionel.
text: Anna flees quickly.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. Johnson, do come in.
text: The Yorks look at each other.
scene_heading: 24 INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY 24
text: A totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A
text: world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two
text: slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish
text: rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging
text: from the ceiling. Recording apparatus. The walls are pearl grey
text: and smoky blue.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: My wife's favorite colours.
text: Here, in a doctor's office, Bertie's stutter returns.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Glad we have something in common.
text: Bertie's head bangs into one of the models.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: My lads build them. Make yourself
dialog: comfortable.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 21.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Please...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You're too close. Five paces is the rule of
dialog: thumb.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That might be difficult in this office.
text: Bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
text: Nice girl, Anna. Worried she wouldn't find
dialog: a husband if she couldn't speak. Tried to
dialog: convince her men will find her even more
text: attractive as a silent partner. The perfect
dialog: woman. Sorry, bad Australian joke. Why'd
dialog: your wife change her mind and ask for an
dialog: appointment?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I can't discuss that.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What can we talk about?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That's better. When speaking with a Royal
text: one waits for the Royal to start the
dialog: conversation and chose the topic.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Your joking. That won't work here.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I admit if one waits for me to start a
dialog: conversation one can wait a rather long
dialog: time.
text: Silence. They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You call this making me comfortable?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You call this being forthcoming?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Aren't you interested in treating me?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 22.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Only if you're interested in being cured.
dialog: More silence.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Cuppa tea?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No thank you.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I need one.
text: Turns on the hot plate.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Any idea what you're letting yourself in
dialog: for?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Apparently a great deal of rudeness, Doctor
dialog: Logue.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Call me Lionel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I prefer Doctor.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I prefer Lionel. My family calls me far
dialog: worse. What shall I call you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The Duke of York is appropriate.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Oh please.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Your Royal Highness then.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Much more informal.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Prince Albert? Or Frederick? Arthur?
dialog: George? I've lots of names to choose from.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: How about Bertie?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 23.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (flushes)
dialog: Only my family uses that.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That's what I'll call you then. We must be
dialog: true equals.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If we were equal I wouldn't be here, I'd be
dialog: at home with my family and no-one would
dialog: give a damn.
text: Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Don't do that.
text: Bertie gives him an astonished look.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Sucking smoke into your lungs will kill
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: My physicians say it's good for stuttering,
text: relaxes the throat.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: They're idiots.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They've all been knighted.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Makes it official then. House rules: no
dialog: smoking.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I thought here we're "equal".
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: As a monarchist I thought you'd appreciate
dialog: these are my digs and here I rule. No
dialog: smoking. What was your earliest memory?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I beg your pardon?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: First recollection of the world?
text: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 24.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (stutter growing in
dialog: intensity)
dialog: I'm not here to discuss personal matters.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why're you here then?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Because I bloody well stutter! And you
dialog: bloody well can't fix it!!!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Temper.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: One of my numerous faults.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Do you stutter when you think?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don't be ridiculous.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: One of my many faults. How about when you
dialog: talk to yourself?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I don't talk to myself!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Come on, everyone natters to themselves
dialog: once in a while, Bertie.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Stop calling me that!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Shan't call you anything else.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Then we shan't speak!
text: Silence. The jug has boiled. Lionel makes himself a cup of tea.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Must I pay for this?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Loads. Now: when you talk to yourself, do
dialog: you stutter?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 25.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Of course not!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Proving your impediment isn't a permanent
dialog: internal fixture.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: When I give a speech...I bloody stutter!!!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly,
dialog: right here, right now.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (bitterly)
dialog: Easy money. You're on.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: See your shilling then.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Royals don't carry money.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: How convenient.
text: Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll stake you. Pay me back next time.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If there is a next time.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on.
text: During this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a
text: recording device with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the
text: turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open
text: book. Bertie glares at it defiantly.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I certainly can't read The Bard.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: `Easy money'.
text: Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "To be or not to be, That is the question.
dialog: Whether it is wiser..." There!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 26.
text: Reaches for the coin.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Not so fast.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I proved I can't read.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You proved you can't listen.
text: Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones. Bertie doesn't
dialog: want to take them.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
text: A princely bob is at stake.
text: Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. Logue turns a dial.
text: LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You're playing music.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm aware.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: How can I hear what I'm saying?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bertie, you're Royal. Surely a prince's
dialog: brain knows what its mouth is doing?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You're not well acquainted with Royal
dialog: princes, are you?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I want to demonstrate that when you can't
dialog: hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus
dialog: proving your impediment is not innate.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Rubbish.
text: Bertie replaces the earphones. Again, the LOUD MUSIC. His lips
text: move as he reads, but all that can be heard is the music.
text: Finished reading the passage he takes off the earphones and the
text: music ceases. He reaches for the coin, but Logue snatches it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was terrible.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 27.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Flawless.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I know how I sound!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win
dialog: twelve-pence?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I've no idea what an Australian might do
dialog: for that sort of money.
text: Logue puts the record in a brown paper dust jacket and hands it
dialog: to Bertie.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Souvenir of our first and presumably last
dialog: encounter.
text: Bertie glances at the record.
dialog: POV - the label: HMV His Master's Voice.
scene_heading: 25 INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY 25
text: Elizabeth, trying to be gracious, has been cooling her heels
text: with a working class MOTHER and her young son WILLIE.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm finished with your husband.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm finished with Doctor Logue!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Lionel.
text: They exit curtly.
speaker_heading: WILLIE'S MUM
dialog: Was that...?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Certainly not. How's it going, mate?
speaker_heading: WILLIE'S MUM
text: William isn't trying hard enough.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Willie?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 28.

text: Oswald Mosley's blackshirt British Union of Fascists are out in
dialog: full force.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: The bloody man did parlour tricks and
dialog: cheated me out of a shilling.
text: In fury he rolls down the window and is about to throw away the
text: record. Elizabeth stops him.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They'll see.
text: He quickly rolls up the window.
text: The sound of an approaching aircraft engine.
scene_heading: 27 EXT. PRIVATE LANDING STRIP, SANDRINGHAM ESTATE - NEW DAY 27
text: A grass strip cut into the moors. Bertie waits beside a shooting
text: break, the stiff breeze whipping his coat, as a small plane
text: lands and taxis. The cockpit canopy slides back and the pilot
text: leaps out, removing his leather helmet and goggles, revealing
text: hair gleaming like gold, perfect teeth flashing a dentist's
dialog: smile. This is - DAVID - the Prince of Wales, Prince Charming,
text: the media's darling, a sun god descended from the skies
dialog: accustomed to being worshipped by all.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (teasing with a false
dialog: stutter)
dialog: Hello, B-b-bertie. B-b-been waiting long?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Three days. Where've you been?
text: Bertie stutters badly in the presence of his brother.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I was busy.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: So was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 29.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She'll recover.
text: Bertie shoots him a look.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Father won't.

text: David drives. Badly.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He's doing this on purpose.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Dying?!
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: Some sod tipped him off Wallis is getting a
dialog: quickie divorce and we're going to make our
dialog: marriage a fait accompli. As an act of pure
dialog: spite, Father's trying to depart
text: prematurely in order to complicate matters.
text: The break almost careens off the lane.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You believe that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Wallis explained it. She's terribly clever.
scene_heading: 29 INT. KING'S BEDROOM, SANDRINGHAM - DAY 29
text: The King is propped up in bed, wrapped in his favorite faded

scene_heading: Secretary - CLIVE WIGRAM - his personal physician - DR DAWSON,
text: and a NURSE.
text: Wigram presents a tray with papers and pen.
speaker_heading: WIGRAM
dialog: The Instruments Of Succession, Your

text: The King is so feeble he can barely make his mark. Glares at
dialog: David.
speaker_heading: KING GEORGE V
dialog: You're next? God help us.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 30.
text: He waves them out of the room, but beckons Wigram to come close,

speaker_heading: WIGRAM
dialog: At the appropriate moment, Your Majesty.
text: The King nods.
scene_heading: 30 INT. DINING HALL, SANDRINGHAM - NIGHT 30
text: Clear soup is being served at the immense table. Places set for

text: of silver and china. Finally:
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: I want my jewelry divided equally.
dialog: Elizabeth gets first choice. She's not
dialog: greedy.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: May I remind you, you're not the one who's
dialog: dying, Mother.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Where are the others?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Lord Wigram and Dr Dawson are making

speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: What sort of arrangements?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They didn't say.
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: And David? Fetch him.
scene_heading: 31 INT. LIBRARY, SANDRINGHAM - CONTINUOUS 31
text: David, hunched over a table, appears to be sobbing. He doesn't
text: hear Bertie's discreet knock.
text: Seeing his brother crying, Bertie is deeply moved, puts a
text: comforting hand on his shoulder. David pulls away as though
text: touched by a leper and covers the receiver in his hand.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm on with Wallis!
dialog: (as though Bertie didn't
dialog: exist)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 31.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: I know, darling, a talk, even a lovely long

dialog: often lately.
dialog: (kisses the phone)

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: BULTER
dialog: The Archbishop of Canterbury.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Who the hell invited him?!
speaker_heading: QUEEN MARY
dialog: Nobody. Don't swear.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: WIGRAM

speaker_heading: DAWSON

scene_heading: 34 INT. KING'S BEDROOM, SANDRINGHAM - NIGHT 34

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like to hear?

text: jacket to create a monstrous hunchback. His acting, performed
dialog: just for his children, is quite magical.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: "Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
dialog: Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight,
dialog: and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twanging
dialog: instruments
dialog: Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes
dialog: voices,
dialog: That, if then I had waked after long sleep,
dialog: Will make me sleep again: and then, in
dialog: dreaming,
text: The clouds methought would open, and show
dialog: riches
dialog: Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked,
dialog: I cried to dream again."

scene_heading: 40 EXT. ENTRANCE TO LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY 40

speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VOICE
dialog: Doctor Logue?
scene_heading: 41 INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41
text: Lionel is stunned, covers:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Must be a tradesman. Off you go, lads. Mum
dialog: should be home from work.
text: The boys gather their things, deposit the model plane on a
text: chair, stow the building materials in a box, and exit the back
text: way. Lionel goes to the door, but doesn't open it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE'S VOICE
dialog: Logue...?
text: Logue, expressionless, doesn't respond.
scene_heading: 42 EXT. ENTRANCE TO LOGUE'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 42
text: Bertie is torn: part of him wants to flee, yet he desperately
dialog: needs to be let in. He knows what must be done. This is a huge
dialog: step for him.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Lionel...it's Bertie.
text: The door opens.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: My condolences. I didn't expect you.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Thank you. I didn't expect to be here. May
dialog: I come in?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: My wife doesn't think it's a good idea.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Your wife?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Myrtle.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 39.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Myrtle? Myrtle's never met me. I've never
dialog: met Myrtle. May we discuss Myrtle in
dialog: private? Its not proper talking about our
text: women on the street.
text: Lonel gives him a look, but lets him him.
scene_heading: 43 INT. WAITING ROOM TO LOGUE'S CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS 43
text: As they enter Bertie notices:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What happened to your shoulder?
text: Lionel hastily removes the pillow, tosses it away.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sore back.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What's your Myrtle got to do with me?
dialog: Elizabeth doesn't much care for you either,
dialog: but here I am.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That woman has style.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Which is why she dislikes you. You're far
dialog: too familiar.

scene_heading: 44 INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS 44
dialog: They enter:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You look dreadful.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Another example of exactly the sort of
dialog: thing you don't say to a Royal. And you're
dialog: too close.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: But you're not Royal in this room.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 40.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Which is precisely why Elizabeth dislikes
dialog: you.
text: He starts to sit.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Not there!
text: CRUNCH. A model airplane was nestling in the armchair.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
text: Curtis bi-plane, now a Curtis mono-wing.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh I say, I'm terribly sorry. Tell your
dialog: lads I'll buy a new one.
text: Lionel takes out the box of model building gear the boys left.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You don't have any money. I'll fix it. So,
dialog: Bertie, what brings you here? Your father's
dialog: death?
text: Bertie is silent.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
text: Mine lay rigid, fists clenched angrily at
dialog: his sides, daring the Reaper: take me, you
dialog: bastard!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What was he angry about?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I was a great disappointment.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Thought he'd be proud of you.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: So did I.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: A man of stature?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: A clerk.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (pause)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 41.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I was informed, after the fact, my father's
dialog: last words were: "Bertie has more guts than
dialog: the rest of his brothers put together."
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Couldn't say that to my face.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Your mother?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Coughed herself to death when I was young.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I remember going to the theatre with her.
dialog: Not real theatre...traveling players.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I've been to Australia.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Not where I lived.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (blurts)
dialog: My brother. That's why I'm here.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What's he done?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Can't say.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm going home now.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You must undersand, I can't puh-puh-puh...
text: His jaw and throat muscles constrict.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Try singing it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Know any songs?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "Swanee River".
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 42.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Very modern.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Happens to be my favorite.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Sing it.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Certainly not.
dialog: (fascinated by the plane
dialog: repairs)
dialog: May I help? Always wanted to build models.
dialog: Father wouldn't allow it. I had to collect
dialog: stamps. He collected stamps.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Only if you sing. Goes like this...
dialog: (sings)
dialog: "Way down upon the..."
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I know the words!
dialog: (sings)
dialog: "Way down upon the Swanee River. ..."
dialog: Etcetera.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You didn't stutter.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Of course I didn't stutter, I was singing!
dialog: One doesn't stutter when one sings!
dialog: (realises) )
dialog: Oh...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Well I can't waltz around on State
dialog: occasions warbling!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You can with me.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That's because you're peculiar.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I take that as a compliment. Cut some
dialog: struts from the balsa. Sorry, hard to show
dialog: you what to do at five paces. Would you
dialog: like a cup of tea?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No. Yes. Thank you.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 43.
text: Lionel fires up the hot plate.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You were about to sing an aria concerning
dialog: your brother.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm not crooning to the tune of "Swanee
dialog: River!"
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Try "Camptown Races" then.
dialog: (sings)
dialog: "The Arch of C, he said to me, doo-dah doo-
dialog: dah..." That sort of thing.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I can't talk, or sing, about your future
dialog: King, doo-dah, doo-dah...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: My future King? He's your future King too.
dialog: Did that cause friction? Knowing he'd grow
dialog: up to be King, but you wouldn't.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Certainly not. I've always looked up to
text: David. Water's boiling.
text: Lionel makes the pot.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Two lumps or one?
text: Bertie, a bit abashed, holds up three fingers.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I've a sweet tooth. To tell the truth...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Always preferable.
dialog: (referring to plane wing)
dialog: Cover it with tissue.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: ...it was a relief. Knowing I wouldn't be
dialog: King.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why's that?
text: Lionel hands him a mug of tea. Bertie realizes it's chipped and
dialog: possibly none too clean.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 44.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I wouldn't have to give speeches!
text: Reaches into his jacket for his cigarette case.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: No smoking. What's the age difference?
text: While Logue isn't looking, Bertie surreptitiously wipes the rim
text: of the mug with his handkerchief.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Eighteen months.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: But for eighteen months you would've been
dialog: King?!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We didn't think about it that way, doctor.
dialog: (sings)
dialog: Doo-dah doo-dah.
dialog: (then)
dialog: David and I were very close.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: As you said: eighteen months.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: As brothers!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: How close?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Young bucks... You know.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I don't, or I wouldn't ask. Did you go
dialog: after the same girls?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Upon occasion.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Princess Elizabeth?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (flares)
dialog: What an extraordinarily rude thing to say!
dialog: (quickly under control)
text: David did try to be her beau at one point.
dialog: Before I met her. She wouldn't have him.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 45.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not like my father...he and his brother,
dialog: when they were young, kept a girl in St
dialog: John's Wood and shared her on alternate
dialog: nights.
text: An uncomfortable silence. Too much has been said.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Now dope the other wing. Did David tease
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They all did. "Buh-buh-buh-Bertie". Father
dialog: encouraged it. "Spit it out, boy!" Thought
dialog: it would make me stop. Is this necessary?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Otherwise the paint will eat through the
dialog: tissue.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I mean the damn questions!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Mandatory. Tell me more about your
dialog: storybook childhood. What was your earliest
dialog: memory?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You asked that before.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: This time I'd like an answer.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Being born.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: How can you remember that?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: December 14th.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I don't understand.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: "Mausoleum Day". Prince Albert departed on
dialog: that date. I was named Bertie to placate
dialog: Great Grandmamma Victoria. In return, she
dialog: hated me because it reminded her of her
dialog: grief.
dialog: (stutter growing in
dialog: intensity)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 46.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let's stick to medical history please. I'm
dialog: naturally left handed, which was considered
dialog: inappropriate.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I was punished. Now I'm right handed.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Bandy legs. Also considered inappropriate.
text: Lionel waits.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
text: Metal splints were made...worn night and
dialog: day...very painful. Now I have straight
dialog: legs. This is so...tawdry! I need your
dialog: services as a Speech Therapist, not Grand
dialog: Inquisitor. Are you available? Or will it
dialog: be: "Myrtle says no?"
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You sound angry.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Yes, I told you, I have a temper.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Angry at me, or at your brother?
text: Bertie remains stubbornly silent. Then blurts:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He's fallen in love!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: How dreadful.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: With the wrong sort of woman!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What's wrong with her?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: She's American.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Some of them must be lovable.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 47.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: This one's divorced. Twice. Mrs Wallis
dialog: Simpson of Baltimore. I want David to be
dialog: happy, but the family, the Church, the
dialog: nation, won't have it.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Can't they fornicate privately like adults?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If only! David used to prefer married women
dialog: because there was no possible attachment.
dialog: But now...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: "Queen Wallis of Baltimore"?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Please.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Does sound a bit iffy.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I made a smudge!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Touch it up.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You want me to beg for help?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I advise you never to beg. Especially if
dialog: you might be King.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don't say that!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I see. For reasons you cannot disclose,
dialog: fearing ramifications you will not explain,
dialog: you feel sufficiently anxious to embark
dialog: upon a course of therapy in which you have
dialog: no faith? You already owe me a shilling.
text: Bertie takes a coin out of his pocket, hesitates, then offers it
dialog: to Logue.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I brought it along. You won, fair and
dialog: square. I'll pay you generously.
text: Lionel pockets the coin.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 48.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'll continue to ask questions.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That's what I was afraid of.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (admires the plane)
dialog: Nice job.
text: Bertie sees Lionel glance at his watch.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You've someone waiting?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I do now.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'd apologize to them in person, but...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You don't wish to be seen? Slip out the
dialog: back way.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: After the funeral...it may be even more
dialog: difficult. To remain unobserved.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You're having second thoughts.
text: Bertie's silence is confirmation.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I ask too many questions?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Perhaps the wrong sort.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (writes an address)
dialog: We live in South Kensington, small
dialog: apartment, but no one would see you.
dialog: (added incentive)
dialog: Lots of planes.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You know, Lionel, you're the first ordinary
dialog: Englishman...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Australian.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 49.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: ...I've ever really talked to. Sometimes,
dialog: when I ride through the streets and see a
dialog: `bloke' I'm struck by how little I know of
dialog: his life, and how little he knows of mine.
dialog: Cuts both ways.
text: As Bertie is about to leave, Lionel requests casually:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And if you decide to come, bring the
dialog: Duchess. She might be helpful.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: She might. If I asked. Very nicely.
dialog: (at back door)
dialog: And how will Myrtle take to our coming into
dialog: your home?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Not sure. She isn't speaking to me.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Wants to go home.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: After the funeral then?
text: Bertie doesn't answer. Exits. Logue is left holding the plane.
text: He goes to the waiting room door.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: How're you doing, Willie?
speaker_heading: WILLIE'S MUM
dialog: (speaking for her son)
dialog: Still can't say a sentence.
speaker_heading: LIONEL

scene_heading: 45 EXT. ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR CASTLE - NEW DAY 45
text: Funereal bagpipes wail, joining the measured drum-rolls.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 50.
text: On the balcony of the Castle, decorated with black bunting, is a
text: huge BBC microphone, and arrayed in front of it a row of

text: replete with ostrich feathers.
text: One of the dignitaries reads a declaration:
speaker_heading: DIGNITARY
dialog: Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to call
dialog: to His mercy our late Sovereign, King
dialog: George the Fifth of blessed and glorious
dialog: memory...
text: During this, INTERCUT to the REVERSE ANGLE, showing a massive
text: military parade, mainly Navy personnel, wending its way through
text: the main street of Windsor towards the Castle, accompanying a
text: gun carriage on which rides the King's coffin, draped with the

text: David is seen - very serious.
speaker_heading: DIGNITARY (CONT'D)
dialog: ...that the High and Mighty Prince Edward
dialog: Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick
dialog: David is now become our only lawful King.
text: Canons are fired.
text: Startled by the salute, a large flock of blackbirds rise up and
text: streak across the wintery sky.
text: A MURMUR, then a shocked GASP, as the gun carriage transverses a
text: tram track and tilts precipitously. Suddenly the Royal Crown
text: tumbles and falls, knocking off the Maltese Cross.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (O.C.)
dialog: Oh bloody Hell!
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.C.)
dialog: A bad omen, Your Grace?
text: The Archbishop and Churchill are watching the events from the
text: shadows at one end of the balcony.
text: Below - a scramble to restore the Cross to the Crown, and
text: replace both atop the coffin.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Don't be disingenuous. For our late King's
dialog: crown to fall from his coffin is not a
dialog: fortuitous portent. What ever is going to
dialog: happen next?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 51.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Is that be the motto of the new reign?
dialog: Indeed, will there actually be "a new
dialog: reign"?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Winston! I'm deeply shocked.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: You don't look it.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: My function requires me to appear serene.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: That may be increasingly difficult to
dialog: maintain. I've been informed by no less an
dialog: authority than the Prime Minister that our
dialog: populace has no objection to Royal
dialog: fornication, but will never tolerate
dialog: adultery.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Well, since we cannot acquire a new

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: My turn to be profoundly shocked.
text: Neither look the slightest traumatized.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Scoff, Churchill! Go on... scoff! But you
dialog: more than others know full well we'll soon

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: The winds of war...a gathering storm?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Oh, you do have a way with words. And who
dialog: would you suggest to rally the troops, the
dialog: nation, the Empire, the world?
text: INTERCUT to Bertie in the funeral cortege, looking frail and
dialog: pale.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: A man who cannot speak? In Nuremberg

scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 52.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Would you prefer the next brother?

speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: The youngest, perhaps?
text: INTERCUT to George, the Duke of Kent.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
text: Now there's dimness.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: I must admit...unburdened with brain.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Thus we're left with David, the rightful
dialog: heir, who speaks beautifully, even if he
dialog: talks nonsense.

text: The chair at the head of the table is empty, everyone waiting

text: He finally arrives. David. He gestures for Bertie to come into

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Pardon?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Diction. Speechifying. That's the word

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Merely trying to overcome my dreadful

speaker_heading: DAVID (OVER-RIDES)
dialog: I'm the brother who speaks. Or do you wish
dialog: to have a go?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Good lord no! I hope to...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Replace me? Well...today's your chance.
text: He thrusts a document into Bertie's hands, then pokes his head
text: into the conference room.
speaker_heading: DAVID (CONT'D)
dialog: My brother will read the Coronation Plans.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (whispers urgently)
dialog: I'm not prepared!
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: LIONEL

dialog: rude words?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What a bloody stupid question! I just said

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Perhaps a touch more vulgar?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Certainly not.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: To prove you know how.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Bugger!
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Hardly robust.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Shit then. Shit, shit, shit!
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Apologies, Mrs. Logue.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: First time I've heard you laugh.
speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: LIONEL

scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 58.

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Your next public appearance should be very
text: well rehearsed.
text: Without thinking, Lionel instinctively reaches out to pat Bertie
text: supportively on the shoulder.
text: Bertie pulls back in offended shock. All the warning signals
text: instilled in him are going off.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don't take liberties! You're a dangerous
dialog: man, Logue. Who sent you?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Anyone in mind?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: The lurking shadows. Courtiers and
dialog: peers...the whole panoply of a class which
dialog: once ruled the nation which once ruled the
dialog: world, afraid of losing their last vestige
dialog: of privilege if the monarchy is further
dialog: debased.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Your wife was the one who sought me out.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Because, dear sweet deluded woman, she
dialog: believes in me!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: But you don't share her belief? Why come
dialog: here?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm beginning to ask myself that very same
dialog: question. Your sailing close to the edge,
dialog: don't push me, Doctor Logue.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Lionel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I came here because I was taught from

scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 59.

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Not to worry. They say the King can do no
dialog: wrong.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He can bugger things up! And I am not the
text: King. Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce.
text: The Coronation is set for the 12th of May.
dialog: Her decree becomes final on the 27th of
dialog: April. That gives them two weeks to marry
dialog: and put this issue to rest.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And if Mr Baldwin stops them?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That would be a tragedy. I pray to The
dialog: Almighty they succeed. I'll do anything
dialog: within my power to keep my brother on the
dialog: throne.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Does that include debasing yourself?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If necessary!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Your brother knew perfectly well by giving
dialog: you a document without warning...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Are you saying he wanted me to fail?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Are you insisting he didn't? In the future
dialog: we can parse any document into manageable
dialog: phrases. You can sing them, swear them,
dialog: rehearse them til you get the rhythm and
dialog: flow; that, combined with your growing
dialog: confidence...
text: Bertie doesn't want to hear.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Growing confidence? Growing dread!!! You're
text: a wicked man, Lionel Logue, trying to get
dialog: me to thrust myself forward as an
dialog: alternative to my brother. Trying to get me
dialog: to commit treason!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 60.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Trying to get you to realize you need not
dialog: be governed by fear. Again, why did you
dialog: seek me out? To take polite elocution
dialog: lessons so you could attend posh tea
dialog: parties?!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: How dare you! I'm the brother of a
dialog: King...the son of a King...back through
dialog: untold centuries. You presume to instruct
dialog: me on my duty? A jumped-up jackeroo from
dialog: the outback? The disappointing son of an
dialog: embittered clerk! You're a monster, Doctor

speaker_heading: DIRECTOR

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Nothing prevents.
speaker_heading: DIRECTOR

dialog: What'll you do when we get home?
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: LIONEL

text: rather small, angular, dark haired woman, with a high brow and
text: square jaw - MRS WALLIS SIMPSON. Her most attractive physical

dialog: Watching from the sidelines:
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Erotic sexual techniques beyond polite

text: To the side, Churchill and Lang watch David and Wallis do a

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: According to the F.B.I.... she is, after
dialog: all, one of their citizens...our Monarch
dialog: does not possess exclusive rights to Mrs.

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (referring to the

dialog: A relative?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Distant.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: (referring again to the
dialog: painting)
dialog: You're well aware, of course, George IV's
dialog: wife, Mrs. Fitzherbert, was very common
dialog: indeed...and previously married. She signed
dialog: an agreement that she could never become
dialog: Queen, and their children could not be
dialog: Royal. A rather sensible morganatic
dialog: arrangement.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: That was a very long time ago. You're
text: stirring with a rather large spoon,
dialog: Winston. Keep in mind, I'm also a distant
dialog: relative of Lady Macbeth.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL

speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That isn't funny.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Ssssssorry, d-d-dear b-b-oy!
speaker_heading: BERTIE

text: A moment of silent confrontation. David backs down. Sort of.
speaker_heading: DAVID

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: This could end in disaster.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: This will end splendidly. With Wallis as my
dialog: wife.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Whatever will she call herself?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Queen of England, I suspect. Kings do
dialog: marry. Empress of India. The whole bag of
dialog: tricks.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: David! The upper classes are terrified
dialog: anything which clouds the monarchy makes
dialog: their situation more dangerous. Hunger
text: marchers are singing the "Red Flag" in

speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Herr Hitler will sort that out.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Who'll sort out Chancellor Hitler?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 68.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: He's much maligned. By the Jews, according
dialog: to Wallis. And she's very clever about
dialog: politics.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The man's a monster! Our position must
dialog: remain clear.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Why's that, old chap?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We are a German family!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Didn't bother anyone during WWI. And Kaiser
dialog: Willie was our uncle.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Because we took an English name! Windsor.
dialog: Because we are England. We are the heart
dialog: and soul of this nation. That must never
dialog: change.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Are you already in charge?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm trying to warn you.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Am I being threatened?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: David, your role is to consult and to be
dialog: advised.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Sounds like you've studied our wretched

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Sounds like you haven't.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I won't be a lackey to an unwashed

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: He's your Prime Minister.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: And I'm his King!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 69.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: If you refuse to listen to our Government,
dialog: they have no choice but to resign.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'll form another. There's Winston. He'd
dialog: love to be P.M. We'll create a King's
dialog: Party.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: To fight a general election in which your
dialog: marriage is the only topic?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'd risk anything and everything for
dialog: Wallis. Don't I have rights?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Privileges.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Not the same thing.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yet an ordinary man may marry for love.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We're not ordinary men, David! We were bred
dialog: to be profiles on a coin. If you were
dialog: ordinary, on what basis could you possibly
dialog: claim to be King?!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's the point then? Just to look posh?
dialog: You know...your speech is much improved
text: tonight. Hardly a hesitation. Yearning for
dialog: a larger audience, are we?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don't say such a thing!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Is my young brother trying to push me off
dialog: the throne? Sounds positively medieval.
speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: BALDWIN

text: Churchill is silent. Balwin waits, then:
speaker_heading: BALDWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: ...I intend to resign. The Royal scandal
dialog: has weakened my position considerably.
text: Churchill, on the edge of his seat, can't suppress an
text: anticipatory grin. Baldwin takes pleasure in deflating it.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: No need to volunteer your services,
dialog: Winston. Neville Chamberlain will take my
dialog: place, once this Royal matter is settled.
dialog: As Chancellor of the Exchequer he already
dialog: lives next door.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: My opportunity to redecorate will come soon
dialog: enough, Stanley.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Will it? Well, enough chit-chat. The
dialog: question of a morganatic marriage, as a
dialog: possible solution, has been put to the

dialog: Australia: no.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: David feels there aren't that many people
dialog: in Australia.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Canada: no. Union of South Africa: an
dialog: inappropriate marriage would create a
dialog: permanent wound. The Irish Free State:
dialog: states it is not really their affair, and,
dialog: bluntly, our English King may marry any
dialog: whore he wants, they'll be well out of it.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Bloody Irish.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: New Zealand...wavers.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Ah, the Kiwis!
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Being rather remote, they've not even heard
text: of Mrs Simpson. Hardly a winning hand.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is not about true love, Winston. This
dialog: is about who's in charge. Does the King do
dialog: what he wants, or what his people want him
dialog: to do? Does the King own his nation, or
dialog: does the nation own their Monarch?
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
text: He won't budge.
speaker_heading: BALDWIN
dialog: Nor will we.
scene_heading: 63 INT. PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - NIGHT 63
text: Winston Churchill is incongruously inspecting a rocking horse.

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Don't dismount.

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Good of you to see me at this late hour.
speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: I was.
dialog: (takes a piece of paper
dialog: from his pocket and
dialog: reads)
dialog: "I am now free to tell you how I was
dialog: jockeyed out of the Throne."
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Good Lord! My brother wrote that?
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Wallis wrote it for him. I'll burn it. I
dialog: fear your brother is like the child in a
dialog: fairy story, given everything in the world,
dialog: but they forgot his soul. Quite happy to
dialog: bring his nation to the brink of civil war
dialog: just as we face global conflict.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We're not coming to that?!
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Oh, there'll be war, alright.
dialog: (takes out another piece
dialog: of paper)
dialog: Your brother held conversations with the
dialog: Duke of Saxe-Coburg, your cousin, a ranking
dialog: member of the Nazi party. I have the
dialog: Scotland Yard intercept: "Who is King here?
dialog: Baldwin or I? I myself wish to talk with
dialog: Hitler, and will do so here or in Germany."
dialog: I doubt England is ready to return to
dialog: absolute monarchy.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Surely his motives are misunderstood?
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: "If I don't get my way, when the war comes,
dialog: Hitler will crush everyone, including the
dialog: Americans. The British may not want me as
dialog: their King, but I'll soon be back as their
text: leader." His intent seems crystal clear.

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Mugs for his cancelled Coronation will soon

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Depends how badly the horse you're on
text: stumbles.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It's not too late, Winston, you could form

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: I must decline. Reluctantly.

speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)

speaker_heading: DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
dialog: Now that I have been succeeded by my

dialog: must be to declare my allegiance to him.
speaker_heading: MARGARET ROSE
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Daddy, who broke our rocking horse?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (whispers)
text: A giant.
text: Elizabeth holds a finger to her lips: shush.
speaker_heading: DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
dialog: This has been made less difficult to me by
dialog: the sure knowledge that my brother has one
dialog: matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of
dialog: you, and not bestowed on me -- a happy home
dialog: with his wife and children.
scene_heading: 66 INT. LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT 66
text: The glow of a radio dial. Lionel and Myrtle sit in armchairs,

speaker_heading: DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
dialog: I have found it impossible to carry the
dialog: heavy burden of responsibility and to
dialog: discharge my duties as King as I would wish
dialog: to do without the help and support of the
dialog: woman I love.
text: Lionel gets up to turn it off as David's voice concludes:
speaker_heading: DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER) (CONT'D)
dialog: We all have a new King. I wish him and you,
dialog: his people, happiness and prosperity with
dialog: all my heart. God bless you all! God save

text: Logue strokes Myrtle's hair.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I too "married the woman I love."
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 75.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: You married a shop girl.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A wonderful lass. Someone I can talk to
dialog: heart to heart.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Using simple words and short sentences. I'm
dialog: very ordinary.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That's why we're suited. I'm just an
dialog: ordinary bloke.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Ordinary? You're a man with wild dreams,
dialog: Lionel. Mine are so very small. A job, a
dialog: husband, a home. Raising our sons. That's
dialog: all I ever wanted.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Me too.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Is that why, every day, you've spent hours
dialog: with a man who's about to be King?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: That relationship is now past tense.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Yet, for as long as you could, you did what
dialog: you wanted.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I wanted to be a great actor. That's what I
dialog: wanted.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: And failing that...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I certainly failed!
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: A great healer. Always...'great'. Where

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Very snugly, into my heart! Always have,
dialog: always will.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 76.

speaker_heading: DRIVER

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: How did this happen to you?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 77.
scene_heading: 70 INT. ACCESSION COUNCIL CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 70
text: Bertie walks to the podium like a man to the gallows faced with
dialog: an array of the Privy Councillors, members of the House of
dialog: Lords, the Lord Mayor of the City of London, the Aldermen of the
dialog: City of London and the High Commissioners of the Commonwealth
dialog: countries.
text: All the old symptoms reappear: the tightening of the neck
text: muscles, the protruding Adam's apple, the jaw locking.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: My Lords, members of the Accession Council,
dialog: I meet you today in circumstances which are
dialog: without parallel in the history of our
dialog: Country...
text: Its going to be a terrible performance. He bows his head in
dialog: humility. And shame.
scene_heading: 71 INT. PLAYROOM, YORK HOUSE - THAT DAY 71
text: Elizabeth is playing quietly with her daughters when the door
text: opens and Bertie appears, still in full regalia, straight from
text: the Accession Council. He holds his arm out, expecting them to
text: run to him for a hug and kiss, his solace after the ordeal.
text: They remain where they are.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Daddy's home.
text: They curtsy formally.
scene_heading: LILIBET &amp; MARGARET ROSE

speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: How could you possibly?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Being what we both dread most.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 78.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Dear, dear, man, I refused your first two
dialog: marriage proposals because, as much as I
dialog: loved you, I couldn't abide the thought of
dialog: living in the Royal gilded cage. Then I
dialog: realized...you stuttered so
dialog: beautifully...they'd leave you alone.
text: She takes his face in her hands tenderly.

dialog: Gets stuck.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: We haven't much more time together. Give it
dialog: a go.
text: The doorbell RINGS. Logue is annoyed.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: There weren't any more appointments today.
text: The bell RINGS again. He yells:
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Piss off!
dialog: (gently)
dialog: Anna?
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: "The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
dialog: Of night and light and the half-light..."
text: The door opens and Bertie enters the waiting area. Hearing Anna
text: he stops outside the consultation room and listens.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 79.
speaker_heading: ANNA (CONT'D)
dialog: "I would spread the cloths under your feet,
dialog: But I, being poor, have only my dreams.
dialog: I have spread my dreams under your feet;
dialog: Tread softly because you tread on my
dialog: dreams."
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Read it to him. If he doesn't profess his
dialog: love, he's not a man.
text: Anna nods earnestly.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Thank you...Lionel.
text: She exits via the Waiting Room and almost runs into Bertie. On
text: recognizing him, she bobs her head.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That was lovely. Don't take any guff.
speaker_heading: ANNA
dialog: Can I tell my Harold that's what you said?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'd be honoured.
text: She dashes off.
text: Logue comes to the door of the Waiting Room, in effect blocking
text: Bertie's way in.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Johnson, isn't it? Have you an appointment?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Want me to beg?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I told you, Kings don't beg.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I believe this time a bit of begging might
dialog: be required. Elizabeth says I must eat
text: humble crow.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Its "crow" or "humble pie". Take your pick.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 80.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (gathering resolve)
dialog: I was frightened and took refuge in being
dialog: `Royal'. What I said was unforgivable.
dialog: And...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (blurts out)
dialog: What's the one essential thing a King must
dialog: do? He must believe he is King. How can I
dialog: possibly do that? For pity sake, Lionel, I
dialog: beg you: get me through! I'll pay you
text: another shilling.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What're friends for?
text: Logue steps aside, letting Bertie in.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I wouldn't know.
scene_heading: 74 INT. LOGUE BEDROOM - NIGHT 74
text: The double bed is piled high with clothing, a suitcase at its

speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: I've got the boys sorting their things.
dialog: Your office will be a chore...
text: Realizing something is amiss, she turns, and knows instantly

text: stifle her emotions.
scene_heading: 75 INT. BERTIE'S STUDY - DAY 75
text: Bertie is with visitors: Churchill and Lang. There's a slight
text: but discernible change in his demeanor.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: We asked to see Your Highness because
dialog: there's the urgent question of what to call
dialog: your brother. Aside from the obvious.
text: Bertie is not pleased with His Grace's joke, but lets it pass.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 81.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What do you suggest?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Mr. Edward Windsor? All he deserves.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What has my brother given up on his
dialog: abdication, other than the throne?
text: They look at each other, unsure.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out
dialog: before coming to me? He cannot be Mister,
dialog: as he was born the son of a Duke. Which
dialog: makes him a Lord at the very least.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Very well, Lord E.W. it is.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And as a Lord of the realm, he's entitled
dialog: to be elected to the House of Commons.
text: Heading a King's Party.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Unacceptable!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: So you prefer he takes a seat in the House
dialog: of Lords? Again, on behalf of a King's
dialog: Party? Is that acceptable?
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Certainly not.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called
dialog: His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for
dialog: Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the
dialog: House of Lords.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh I say...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The Duke of Windsor it is. Gentlemen.
text: He exits abruptly.
text: Churchill and Lang gather their things stunned.

text: Dickensian air, is deep in concerned conversation with a man in
text: trench-coat. The Owner keeps glancing worriedly in Myrtle's
dialog: direction.
text: The two men nod, shake hands. The fellow in the trench-coat
text: leaves. The owner beckons another shop-girl over and whispers

scene_heading: 78 INT. LOGUE'S STUDY AND PARLOUR - DAY 78

scene_heading: IN THE STUDY:
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Splendid. Here's another. "She sifted seven

dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Shall we invite your wife in now?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 83.
text: Logue goes to the door and starts to open it. He shuts it
dialog: quickly.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I wasn't expecting Myrtle for several
dialog: hours!
text: IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle has entered, definitely unhappy. Seeing
text: Elizabeth, she's even less happy, and flabbergasted.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Milady?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: "Your Majesty", the first time. After that,
dialog: "Ma'am". Not Malm as in Palm, Mam as in
dialog: ham. I'm informed your husband calls my
dialog: husband Bertie and my husband calls your
dialog: husband Lionel. I trust, however, you won't
dialog: attempt to call me Liz.
text: IN THE STUDY: Lionel stands listening, ear to the door.
speaker_heading: BERTIE

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: As to be expected.
text: IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle announces:
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: You may call me "Madam Logue".

speaker_heading: MYRTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: May I offer you a cup of tea, Ma'am?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Thank you, Madame Logue, but I'm waiting to
dialog: be summoned.
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: You don't like my husband. That's what I
dialog: was told.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I was told the same.
scene_heading: IN THE STUDY:

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm not going out there!
scene_heading: IN THE PARLOUR:
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: What do you dislike about my Lionel?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: I don't wish my husband to be demeaned.
dialog: What don't you like about mine?
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: I don't want my Lionel getting hurt.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There's only one thing can save him now:
dialog: success.
text: IN THE STUDY: the men are growing increasingly nervous.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: We're being cowards.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Of course. We're sensible men.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You should go in.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Me? You.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Why me?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You're the Royal.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Being a monarchist, I recognize these are
dialog: your digs. Therefore: here you rule.
dialog: Therefore: you go in.
text: Urged by Bertie, Logue opens the door.
text: IN THE PARLOUR: Logue enters, pretending total innocence and
text: surprise, followed by Bertie, also trying to keep the pretense.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 85.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Oh! Hello, Lady Elizabeth! Oh! Hello,
dialog: Myrtle darling! What a pleasant surprise.

speaker_heading: MYRTLE

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: A previous engagement.
speaker_heading: LIONEL

text: little wave. She glares and exits.
scene_heading: IN THE STUDY:
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle.
text: Bertie stifles a snort. Elizabeth glares at him.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Elizabeth)
dialog: Good of you to come.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Harley Street is far too public. What is my
dialog: function here?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: For me to show you how to pitch in.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Piece of cake.
dialog: (to Bertie)
dialog: Please assume a supine position on the

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Firm support is needed.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 86.

speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now

dialog: Splendid. How do you feel?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: Full of hot air.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Well on your way to becoming a qualified

speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: ... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be
dialog: so kind as to sit on your husband's

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Good grief.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Gently of course.
text: Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking
dialog: solicitously:
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are you alright, Bertie?
text: Bertie nods.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess
dialog: Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed,
dialog: expanding your chest fully, extending the
text: column of air til it hits the
dialog: diaphragm...and...up comes Princess
dialog: Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess
dialog: Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess
dialog: Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have
dialog: to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I
dialog: thought you'd prefer your wife to one of
dialog: the staff. Now comes the fun part.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: There's actually more?
text: Bertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 87.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You will now shout the vowel sounds, all
text: five of them, as loudly as possible, each
dialog: to last no less than 15 seconds. There's
dialog: poor coordination between your larynx and
dialog: diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be
dialog: the official timer.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
text: Vowel sounds? Shouted at an open window? On
dialog: a public street?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Anyone who can stand at an open window
text: vibrating loudly in full view of the world
dialog: can learn to give a public speech.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: They can also be considered quite dotty.
dialog: Don't even contemplate it!
speaker_heading: BERTIE

text: She's right, those two chaps are staring at

speaker_heading: MYRTLE

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why'd you come home so early?
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Lionel...
speaker_heading: LIONEL

speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: What role are you auditioning for now?
dialog: Royal saviour?! Who's going to help us?!
dialog: This will bring us down, Lionel. You know
dialog: it will.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: When that poor chap first walked into my
text: office, he was a slim, quiet man with tired
dialog: eyes and all the outward symptoms of the
dialog: person upon whom a habitual speech defect
dialog: has set the sign. You saw him today; once
dialog: more there was hope.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: You're not listening to me!
text: She gets up angrily and starts carrying dishes to the kitchen.
text: He follows her back and forth.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Myrtle, I love you.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: You say that, but you don't listen when I
dialog: say, in so many ways, how desperately I
dialog: want to go home, how I never, ever,
dialog: intended to stay here. This was to be a
dialog: holiday trip to see `Mother England', and
dialog: you turned it into quite something else.
dialog: What happened, Lionel? We went to Wembley
dialog: Stadium, next thing...you'd cashed in our
dialog: tickets.
text: He's silent.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Very well, I shan't talk of this ever

speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Myrtle... I don't deserve a wonderful woman
dialog: like you.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: How right you are.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: But why'd you come home so early?
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Lionel...I was let go.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 90.
text: He's stunned.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Inquiries were made...Mr Falkoff wouldn't

dialog: with us, will you, Mrs Logue?'
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (anguished)
dialog: Why?!

dialog: the world.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: What we need, and what we'll get, may be
dialog: two rather different things. Did you hear
dialog: his pathetic attempt at the Accession
dialog: Council? He'll never be able to speak in
dialog: public.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
text: So, we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and
dialog: lock him in a closet? Who then will
dialog: spiritually lead this great nation into
dialog: war? Who will address the far flung corners
dialog: of the Empire, rallying all to our defense?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: The Head of our Church? Is that what you
dialog: have in mind?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 92.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Would it be such a calamity?
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Best ask our new King.
text: Bertie has entered with Logue. Lang spins around.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Your Majesty.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Excuse me, sir, duty calls.
text: He exits quickly. Cosmo continues nervously as they walk
text: through the Abbey, the Archbishop pointing out the preparations
text: in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Is this the scene of the crime?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: What a peculiar thing to say.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Referring to my assault upon the ears of
dialog: the listeners.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's
dialog: Box. I have, however, categorically said no
dialog: to the BBC's new "radio-with-pictures"
dialog: gadget. Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as
dialog: we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Radio with pictures?!
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
text: It is called..."television". Happily, with
dialog: a transmission range of only fifteen miles
dialog: this "TV" thing has no future. We shall,
dialog: however, be forced to permit cinema; the
dialog: product of which I shall personally edit.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That'll keep you busy, removing all my
text: stops and starts.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet
dialog: ceremony?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 93.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What exactly do you mean?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Something...discreet...private. We could
dialog: pre-record an edited version to be
dialog: broadcast to the world. Or even find an
text: actor with a similar voice.
text: Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A King based upon deception?
text: Cosmo takes Bertie aside.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: If your gentleman from Security would give
dialog: us space, we could discuss this in private.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher?"
text: Giving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to Bertie
text: confidentially.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Fret not. As I assured our nation in my
dialog: recent broadcast: "When his people listen
dialog: to their new Monarch they will note an
dialog: occasional momentary hesitation in his
dialog: speech. But to those who hear it, it need
dialog: cause no sort of embarrassment, for it
dialog: causes none to him who speaks." You see,
dialog: I've paved the way. But should you wish to
dialog: avoid further stress...
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why not paint him pink and cover him with
dialog: sequins?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Pardon?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: If you wish to call attention to his
dialog: anxiety.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Does your bodyguard know to whom he's
dialog: speaking? He certainly doesn't know his
dialog: place!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 94.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Therapist?! I'd no idea! Had I known Your
dialog: Majesty was seeking assistance I would've
dialog: made my own recommendation.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Dr. Logue is to be present at the
dialog: Coronation.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
text: Impossibly to find room. Even for a Doctor.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Just Lionel.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: The Royal Box!? Your Family will be seated
dialog: there.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Which makes it most suitable.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Perhaps I might be able to add a very small
dialog: stool.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
text: Two comfortable chairs. One for Madam
dialog: Logue. She's a close friend of my wife. The
dialog: Queen.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: I'll have someone attend to it.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: And now, if you don't mind, we need the
dialog: premises.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
dialog: The Church must make preparations.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: So must Bertie.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Bertie?! We do not call the King: "Bertie"!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 95.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I do. During waking hours we'll need the
dialog: facilities. It'll be a closed set. No
dialog: observers.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Those are my wishes, Your Grace.
text: Lang nods curtly and exits.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: You've made a dangerous enemy.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Wouldn't want him as a friend.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And don't ever call me Bertie in public.
text: A moment of confrontation. Lionel knows he's overstepped.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Tell me...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I sense one of your dreadful questions on
dialog: the horizon.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Do you really want to be King?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Knew it! I haven't any choice.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You can be a wounded King who stumbles
dialog: through his Coronation. Or, as the Arch of
text: C so archly suggests, no Coronation at all.
dialog: Always a choice.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What's this, you wait til Westminster
dialog: Abbey, then ambush me?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm simply asking questions... which you
text: seem unable to answer.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'm a sacrificial lamb being led to
dialog: slaughter! Damn you!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 96.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Quite possibly. But at least I know what I
dialog: want. You haven't the foggiest.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (explodes)
dialog: I WANT TO BE HEARD!
text: His words reverberate through the empty abbey.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: That's quite different. Let's get down to
dialog: work then, shall we?
text: Bertie glares at him.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West
dialog: door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I
dialog: Was Glad When They Said Unto Me." You won't
dialog: actually be that glad, because they sing it
dialog: for a great long time.
text: Bertie follows Logue deep into the bowels of the `Abbey'.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: You'll then show yourself to the various
dialog: sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop
text: announces four times in a loud voice,
dialog: "Sirs, I here present unto you..." Have you
dialog: decided your name for when you become King?
dialog: For when you become a different person?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: George.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Like your father?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Like my father.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Not Albert?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Given the current situation...too Germanic.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: "Sirs, I here present unto you, GEORGE,
dialog: your undoubted King!"
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 97.
text: "George, your undoubted King!" echoes through the Abby.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 82 INT. AN OFFICE IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT 82
text: Lang is on the phone. The door is open. While talking he
text: watches the work preparations. On the phone he tells someone:
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: I've made inquiries.
scene_heading: 83 INT. LOGUE DINING ROOM - NIGHT 83
text: Logue enters and sits at the table. Myrtle serves him.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: You look done in.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I've news for you. You're coming to the
dialog: Coronation.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: I've news for you. I'm not!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You must.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Royal Box. You and I.
text: Stunned silence, then.
speaker_heading: MYRTLE
dialog: Lionel...I'd need a new dress.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Rather thought you might.
text: Valentine calls from the next room:
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 98.
speaker_heading: VALENTINE (O.S.)
dialog: Dad! Phone! For you!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Won't be a sec.
text: He exits. Myrtle waits. Looks at herself, bemused, reflected in
text: a glass-fronted cabinet. Even does a curtsey.
scene_heading: 84 INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - THAT NIGHT 84
text: The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang.
text: He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a
text: director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes
dialog: Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself:
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: "The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch
dialog: the conscience of a King."
text: He exits.
dialog: THE CAMERA explores various elements:
dialog: The Throne of Edward the Confessor.
text: Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone.
text: Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next
dialog: Coronation rehearsal.
text: Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs.
text: Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use.
text: Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen.
dialog: This Abbey holds the history of a nation.
text: Footsteps resonate.
text: Lionel enters. Trips over one of the gravestones.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron.
dialog: Bertie...?
text: Lights snap on skewering Lionel. Bertie steps into view wearing
text: a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: This is not a rehearsal, "Doctor" Logue.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 99.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I
dialog: wondered when that would happen. And I'd
dialog: promised Myrtle a new frock.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (barely controlled)
dialog: "Just call me Lionel"! Never did you call
dialog: yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No
dialog: diploma, no training, no credentials. Just
dialog: a great deal of nerve.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Want to hear my side of the story?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: There isn't a "your-side-of-the-story".
dialog: This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its
dialog: not just the Coronation, terrifying enough,
dialog: its the radio speech to millions
dialog: afterwards, and the speech after that, and
dialog: for the rest of my failed miserable life!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Wembley Stadium...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You dare remind me?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I was there.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Then you knew from the start I was
dialog: hopeless?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: My son, Valentine, asked, "Could you help
dialog: that poor man?" I replied, "He's too old
dialog: for me to manage a complete cure, but I
dialog: could very nearly do it, I'm sure of that."
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Lying bastard!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I knew I could help you. You refuse to
dialog: believe?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: In you?!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 100.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: In yourself.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Who the hell do you think you are?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: A failed actor.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Actor?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Father wanted me to be a doctor, but I
dialog: couldn't cut flesh. So I worked in the
dialog: mines, recited in pubs...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: An actor?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: When the war came, by the time I was ready
dialog: to be shipped out, the first casualties
text: were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in
dialog: bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with
dialog: your mouth, see if you can help these poor
dialog: sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest.
text: Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than
dialog: you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I
dialog: found I had to go deeper, as you might well
dialog: imagine.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I know nothing of those poor men!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I think you do. They had cried out, and the
dialog: universe had not listened. So they'd lost
dialog: faith in their voice. My job was to make
dialog: them shout in righteous anger: "I have the
dialog: right to be heard!"
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I suppose that helped them, did it?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Make inquiries.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Inquiries have been made! No credentials.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: But a lot of success. No training was
dialog: given.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 101.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Not in Western Australia, not at that time.
dialog: I simply knew what to do. When the war was
dialog: over I kept being a therapist to earn a
dialog: living. When the lads were old enough, I
dialog: thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always
dialog: wanted to be an actor, one last go." I
dialog: pretended it was our trip home to Mother
dialog: England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: To Harley Street?!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Cashed in our return tickets. I had three
dialog: months rent.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: So you set yourself up on Harley Street as
dialog: an actor? Harley Street, don't you know, is
dialog: for doctors!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: The plaque says, `L. Logue. Speech
dialog: Specialist'. No mention of a medical
dialog: degree. No mention of any degree. Some of
dialog: the diggers I'd helped had come to England.
dialog: They made referrals. My practice
dialog: flourished. My acting, however, did not.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Well enough to deceive me.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Lock me in the Tower.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I would if I could!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: What crime?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You've saddled this nation in its moment of
text: peril with a voiceless King. Destroyed the
dialog: happiness of my family...all for the sake
dialog: of ensnaring a star client you knew you
dialog: couldn't possibly assist!
text: Lionel sits down on the chair of Edward the Confessor. Leaning
text: against it is the great two-handed sword of St. George.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: What're you doing? Get up!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 102.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I'm tired.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: You can't sit there!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why not? It's a chair.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: It's the Chair of Edward The Confessor! The
dialog: throne upon which every King for six and a
dialog: half centuries has been crowned.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: It's falling apart. People have carved
dialog: their initials into it. Needs a stone to
dialog: keep from blowing away.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That's the Stone of Scone! The Stone of
dialog: Destiny that was once Jacob's pillow.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You believe such ballocks I don't care how
dialog: many royal backsides have sat on it, it's a
text: building block with handles attached.
dialog: You're just like me, an actor with tawdry
dialog: stage props you choose to believe are real.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Listen to me... !
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Listen to you?! By what right?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Divine right, if you must! I'm your King!!!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Noooo you're not! Told me so yourself. Said
dialog: you didn't want it. So why should I listen
text: to a poor stuttering bloke who can't put
dialog: one word after another? Why waste my time
dialog: listening to you?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Because I have a right to be heard!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Heard as what?!
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: A man! I HAVE A VOICE!!!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 103.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Well then...you're cured.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Stop trying to squirm off the hook.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bertie, you'll make a bloody good king. And
dialog: you know it.
text: Bertie stares at him.
text: A familiar voice is heard from the shadows.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Your Majesty?
dialog: The Archbishop of Canterbury.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: You'll be relieved to learn I've found a
dialog: replacement specialist. Impeccable
dialog: credentials.
text: There's a long silence.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: That won't be necessary.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: The matter's already been settled. For your
dialog: own well-being.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Your Majesty's function is to consult...and
dialog: to be advised. You didn't consult, but
dialog: you've just been advised.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Now I advise you, so listen carefully.
dialog: ...in this personal matter I will make my
dialog: own decision.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: May I remind you, you do not place the
dialog: crown upon your own head.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: And may I remind you, it is my head upon
dialog: which the crown is placed!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 104.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: This will end badly.
text: Lang turns on his heel.
text: Lionel ignores what has just happened.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints
dialog: a picture for the world, as you stand at
dialog: the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets
text: echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain
text: clears miraculously as a shaft of sun
text: streams through the stained-glass window
dialog: catching your golden tunic and bathing you
dialog: in light like a mediaeval knight. And you
dialog: are King!
text: The faint CLICKING WHIR of a film projector is heard.
scene_heading: 85 INT. ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY'S SCREENING ROOM - NEW DAY 85
text: On the screen: archive footage of the Coronation, capturing the
text: pomp and ceremony. Cigar smoke rises up. The voices of
text: Churchill and Lang can be heard.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (O.S.)
dialog: I was much moved
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.)
dialog: There were tears in my eyes too, Your
dialog: Grace, particularly when I saw you and the
text: Dean of Westminster cannoning into each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (O.S.)
dialog: That's been edited.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.S.)
dialog: More tears when our new Monarch started
text: towards his throne, only to be brought to
text: an abrupt halt owing to one of the Bishops
text: treading on his robe.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (O.S.)
dialog: To the world, all went splendidly.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
text: Amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels,
text: bobbing tiaras, and heaving bosoms.
text: The footage freezes momentarily.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 105.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (O.S.)
dialog: Now, Winston, I have something which will
dialog: bring tears to your eyes.
text: The archive footage continues, but it is not of the Coronation.
dialog: David and Wallis visiting the Fuhrer in Germany: Hitler
text: gallantly kissing Mrs Simpson's hand while Goring and the Duke
text: of Windsor beam; David giving the Nazi salute. FREEZE FRAME.
text: The lights come on. For once, Churchill is speechless.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: There's no doubt: David is planning a
dialog: comeback. And will succeed if our King
text: continues to falter. Though Bertie
dialog: miraculously survived the Coronation he
text: continues to stumble very badly indeed.
text: Soon he must broadcast to the world. Hitler
dialog: will be listening. David will be listening.
dialog: Stalin and Roosevelt will be listening.
dialog: Everyone will be listening. God help us.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (V.O.)
dialog: (stuttering very badly)
dialog: "In this grave hour... "
scene_heading: 86 INT. LOGUE'S CONSULTATION ROOM - NEW DAY 86
text: Bertie and Logue are rehearsing.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "In this grave hour... " Sorry.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Try again.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "In this grave hour... "
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Turn the halts into pauses, during which
dialog: you say to yourself, "God save the King".
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I say that all the time, but apparently no
dialog: one's listening.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Use the silence. Long pauses add solemnity
dialog: to great occasions.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Then I'm the solemnest king who ever lived.
dialog: Lionel, I can't do this!
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 106.
text: Logue tries to protest, Bertie over-rides.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: If I am to be King...where is my power? May
dialog: I form a Government on my own, appoint or
dialog: dismiss a Prime Minister, chose an
dialog: Ambassador, levy a tax or declare a war?
dialog: None of these things. Yet I am the seat of
dialog: all authority. Why? Because the Nation
dialog: believes when I speak, I speak for them.
dialog: Yet I cannot speak!
text: Logue totally ignores the outburst.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Take it from the top. "In this grave
dialog: hour..."
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (hesitates, then)
dialog: "In this grave hour, p-p-perhaps..."
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Go on...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: The letter`P' is always difficult.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Get a running start, put the words all
dialog: together. `Perhaps-the-most-fateful...'
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "In this grave hour...perhaps-the-most-
dialog: fateful...in our history..."
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Beaut.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "... I send to every household of my
dialog: peoples...both at home and overseas..."
speaker_heading: LIONEL (SINGS)
dialog: Doo-dah, doo-dah.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "...this message... "
speaker_heading: LIONEL (SINGS)
dialog: Five miles long...
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 107.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "...spoken with the same depth of feeling
dialog: for each one of you... as if I were
dialog: able..."
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: In your head, now: "Bugger, bugger, bugger!
dialog: Damn, damn, damn! All those bloody
dialog: blighters are going to have to listen to
dialog: me!" Can you dance?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
text: Helps relax the body.
dialog: (goes to record player)
dialog: Waltz?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I prefer pipes.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Thought you might.
dialog: (starts a bagpipe record
dialog: of "Scotland The Brave")
dialog: Dance with me. One, two, one-two-three-
dialog: four. One, two, one- two-three-four. "For
dialog: the second time..." one-two-three-four "...
dialog: in the lives of most of us..." one, two,
dialog: one-two-three- four "... we are at war."
dialog: Three, four.
text: Dancing at arm's length with Logue, Bertie repeats:
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: "For the second time... in the lives of
dialog: most of us... we are at war." One-two-
dialog: three. (continues on)
dialog: "Over and over again... we have tried to
dialog: find a peaceful way... out of the
dialog: differences... between ourselves... and
dialog: those who are now our enemies." Bugger,
dialog: bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You'll be ready.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The shilling you won... still have it?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Of course.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 108.
text: Bertie holds out his hand, demandingly. Somewhat hurt, Lionel
text: hands it over.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I'll return it.
text: Bertie leaves with the shilling, exiting the back way.
text: Logue opens the waiting room door.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Willie! Where's your mum?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: (stuttering painfully)
dialog: She had to work.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You've been waiting here, alone, all this
dialog: time?
text: Willie nods again. Then, haltingly:
speaker_heading: WILLIE
dialog: I heard the King.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Did you?
speaker_heading: WILLIE
text: He sang. And shouted rude words.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: He did.
text: Willie beams.
speaker_heading: LIONEL (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like to sing, dance, and shout
dialog: rude words?
speaker_heading: WILLIE (NO STUTTER)
dialog: I would!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Why am I not surprised?

text: Bertie has entered with Elizabeth and Logue. The Reader wishes
text: he could sink into the floor. Bertie says nothing, but
text: approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth
text: watch nervously.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: `Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare
dialog: it square in the eye, man to man.'
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER
dialog: (placating)
dialog: If you'll be so kind, to let me show you...
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: I already know. My father taught me.
text: He spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus with
text: the little finger, thumb to chin.
text: The Reader scurries off and tells the others.
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER
dialog: His father taught him. I taught his father.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: (testing the microphone)
dialog: Bugger bugger bugger...bloody bloody
dialog: bloody...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Bertie, do make sure that's not switched
dialog: on!
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: You're going to be splendid. And
dialog: if you're not?
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: They'll bloody well have to listen to me
dialog: anyway. Right?
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 110.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Bloody right.
text: Lang and Churchill have entered. Elizabeth forces herself to
text: greet them graciously.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Mr. Prime Minister, Your Grace, how kind of
dialog: you to join us.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: Wouldn't miss this for the world.
dialog: (to Churchill)
dialog: Congratulations. Neville didn't last long,
dialog: did he? Talking to Hitler.
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: My tenure will be shorter, if the King
dialog: fails tonight.
text: Bertie and Logue speak privately.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No matter how this turns out, I wish to
dialog: thank you. For asking such dreadful
dialog: questions. What can I do in recompense?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (lighty...yet seriously)
dialog: I've always wanted to be knighted.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Sorry. That would raise too many questions.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: (pause, then)
dialog: Understood.
text: Bertie takes something from his pocket.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Keep it for good luck.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: No, you won this, fair and square.
text: The object is a silver medal. Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 111.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Made from the melted coin. Designed it
dialog: myself, hope you like it, Lionel old
dialog: friend. May I call you that?
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: My greatest honour, Bertie.
dialog: (then)
dialog: One final question.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Oh dear.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: Do you believe you're King?
text: A very long pause.
speaker_heading: BERTIE
dialog: Almost.
text: The red light on the microphone starts to blink. Logue joins
dialog: the others.
text: The Reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc `broadcast
dialog: booth. Five, four, three, two...
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER
dialog: Good evening, this is the BBC National and
dialog: World programme, broadcasting from
dialog: Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King.
text: During this, Bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his
text: speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the
text: Adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms
text: reappear.
text: Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished. It
text: seems an eternity.
text: Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles.
text: Lang's eyes roll heavenward.
text: Churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach.
text: Bertie and Logue stare at each other.
text: Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's
text: worked with. His confidence is contagious.
text: Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. His hands
text: grow steady, his throat muscles relax...all the things he's
dialog: practiced.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 112.
scene_heading: 88 INT. LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT 88
text: The luminous dial of a wireless. Unbearable silence. Then:
speaker_heading: BERTIE (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
dialog: In this grave hour, perhaps the most
dialog: fateful in our history, I send to every
dialog: household of my peoples, both at home and
dialog: overseas...
text: This is being listened to by Myrtle and the boys. The boys look
text: at their mum. Suddenly they explode with cheers as the radio
dialog: address continues:
scene_heading: 89 INT./EXT. MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN ENGLAND AND AROUND 89
speaker_heading: THE
scene_heading: WORLD - NIGHT OR DAY, DEPENDING ON LOCATION
text: In homes, pubs (where we see the man with the rosacea nose),
dialog: clubs, hotels, boarding houses, factories, mines, prisons, a
dialog: shearing shed in New Zealand, cattle station in Australia, sites
dialog: in India, South Africa, loci around the Commonwealth and Empire.
text: China. Japan. The Kremlin. The White House. Hitler's mountain
text: top wolf den. The South of France (where David and Wallis listen
dialog: dolefully.)
text: During this, the address continues, with dramatic pauses to be
dialog: sure, but no real hesitations.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO)
dialog: ...this message spoken with the same depth
dialog: of feeling for each one of you as if I were
dialog: able to cross your threshold and speak to
dialog: you myself. For the second time in the
dialog: lives of most of us we are at war. For we
dialog: are called, with our allies, to meet the
dialog: challenge of a principle which, if it were
dialog: to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized
dialog: order in the world. It is the principle
dialog: which permits a State, in the selfish
dialog: pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties
dialog: and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the
dialog: use of force, or threat of force, against
dialog: the sovereignty and independence of other
dialog: States. Such a principle, stripped of all
dialog: disguise, is surely the mere primitive
dialog: doctrine that might is right, and if this
dialog: principle were established throughout the
dialog: world, the freedom of our own country and
dialog: of the whole British Commonwealth of
dialog: Nations would be in danger.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 113.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
dialog: But far more than this - the peoples of the
dialog: world would be kept in the bondage of fear,
dialog: and all hopes of settled peace and of the
dialog: security of justice and liberty among
dialog: nations would be ended. This is the
dialog: ultimate issue which confronts us.
text: End the montage with a return to the exterior of Buckingham
text: Palace. Outside, stand solemn crowds, listening to the speech
text: on loudspeakers. PAN THEIR FACES, the faces of England,
text: stalwart and resolved.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: For the sake of all that we ourselves hold
dialog: dear, and of the world's order and peace,
dialog: it is unthinkable that we should refuse to
dialog: meet the challenge. It is to this high
dialog: purpose that I now call my people at home
dialog: and my peoples across the seas, who will
dialog: make our cause their own. I ask them to
dialog: stand calm, firm, and united in this time
dialog: of trial. The task will be hard. There may
dialog: be dark days ahead, and war can no longer
dialog: be confined to the battlefield. But we can
dialog: only do the right as we see the right, and
dialog: reverently commit our cause to God.
scene_heading: 90 INT. THE PRINCESSES PLAYROOM - NIGHT 90
text: The two girls listen to their father on the radio.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO)
dialog: If one and all we keep resolutely faithful
dialog: to it, ready for whatever service or
dialog: sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's
dialog: help, we shall prevail.
text: Lilibet's expression tells it all - she can hear it, her father
dialog: is truly King.
scene_heading: 91 INT. KING'S STUDY/BROADCAST ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - 91
speaker_heading: CONTINUOUS
text: Bertie, in his quiet way is totally in command, and utterly
text: magnificent. Everyone in the room is awed as he concludes:
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 114.
speaker_heading: BERTIE (CONT'D)
dialog: We may all find a message of encouragement
dialog: in the lines which, in my closing words, I
dialog: would like to say to you: `I said to the
dialog: man who stood at the Gate of the Year,
dialog: "Give me a light that I may tread safely
dialog: into the unknown." And he replied, "Go out
dialog: into the darkness, and put your hand into
dialog: the Hand of God. That shall be to you
dialog: better than light, and safer than a known
dialog: way.'" May the Almighty Hand guide and
dialog: uphold us all.
text: IN THE AD HOC `CONTROL BOOTH' AREA - the Manager makes a `cut'
text: gesture to Bertie, he's off the air, the red light on the
text: microphone goes out. The Manager points, and the red light on
text: the Reader's microphone goes on.
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER
dialog: This concludes the BBC broadcast of the
dialog: King's Speech.
text: Another `cut' gesture from the Floor Manager, the red light goes
text: out and the transmission is concluded. The Floor Manager looks
dialog: to the Reader.
speaker_heading: BBC NEWS READER (CONT'D)
dialog: (softly)
dialog: He wasn't perfect.
dialog: (barely controlling his
dialog: tears)
dialog: Not perfect... But by God... He moved me.
text: AT THE MAIN BBC MICROPHONE - Bertie waits for the verdict of his
dialog: peers. Churchill first:
speaker_heading: WINSTON CHURCHILL
dialog: Couldn't have said it better myself.
text: The ultimate compliment. Lang next.
speaker_heading: COSMO LANG
dialog: I'm speechless.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Thank God.
text: She goes to Bertie and kisses him tenderly on the cheek, takes
text: his hand, then Logue's.
scene_heading: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08 115.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Well done, Bertie. Well done...
dialog: (for the first time)
dialog: ...Lionel. Well done.
text: She leaves the two men together.
speaker_heading: LIONEL
dialog: I always called you Bertie. Today, I call
dialog: you King.
text: He offers his hand. But instead of taking it, Bertie takes him
text: by the shoulders and gives him a hug. This is a long way from
text: the five pace rule. The last barrier has fallen.
