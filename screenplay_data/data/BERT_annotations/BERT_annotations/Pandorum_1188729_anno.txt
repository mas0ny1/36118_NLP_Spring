text: A darkness like no other, a silence that is unsettling.
text: Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across
dialog: the void of outer space. Our own motion is only realized as
text: an enormous object slowly moves towards us, taking shape.
text: A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size, a tubular freighter easily
text: ten times larger then any aircraft carrier. At first glance
text: it appears lifeless and adrift, but slowly the small glow of
text: cockpit windows come into view as we move closer.
text: Moonlight cuts across the hull, displaying the name; EDEN.
speaker_heading: BOWER (V.0.)
dialog: Where were you... when Eden was lost?
dialog: Like every other kid on my block, I was
text: in the middle of a dream, envious of
dialog: those who were chosen to be part of
dialog: mankind's greatest quest. Dreaming of
text: the unknown and trying to imagine what
dialog: only the lucky few would encounter.
text: We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE THRU:
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT.
text: Inside the flight deck it's ghostly vacant, rows of empty
text: flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
text: blinking. With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
text: the seat backs... it appears the control deck has been
text: suddenly evacuated.
text: Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship.
speaker_heading: BOWER.(V.0.)
dialog: As the entire world watched in wonder,
dialog: there were only a few, skeptical of the
dialog: journey's success.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Only a few... who would be right.
text: The further we move into the ship... signs of violence
text: appear, smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
text: bright white paneling and several broken computer screens.
text: The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer... an argument
text: between men, panicked rage over-lapping.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a
text: violent confrontation. One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
text: chamber, banging on the glass and pleading with panic.
text: Another OFFICER is on the floor, mortally wounded, his body
text: still twitching with his head bashed in. The INSANE OFFICER,
text: a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal, typing
text: in commands with a casual and emotionless nature.
text: Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
text: as he continues to type commands into the flight computer...
text: heightening the trapped OFFICER'S muffled,. screams.

dialog: PLEASE GOD! NO! NO GOD DAMMIT!
text: Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite. Like a row of

text: positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then... they are
text: launched with a ROAR of micro-jets.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SHIP "EDEN" - CONT.
text: We're suddenly back into the unsettling silence as... like a
text: bee hive that's exploded, thousands of coffin-sized sleep

text: slowly continues its unaffected course.

speaker_heading: BOWER (P.O.)
dialog: Where was I... when I heard we'd lost
dialog: Eden? Just like every other kid on my
dialog: block... I was dreaming... of being one
dialog: who would be chosen to follow.
text: As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods, it's
text: obvious that time has passed, a single skeleton inside each
text: of the pods, hands in a clawing position towards the glass.
text: We PUSH IN towards one pod, moving towards the SKULL, still
text: locked in a SCREAMING position, wide mouthed and...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: M. HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER
text: A RUMBLE passes... EYELIDS TWITCH... A GASP.
text: Inside a coffin-size chamber, a dim glow of light seeps
text: through a small glass porthole. A MAN is asleep, a mask
text: attached to his face, tubes of liquid feeding into his arms.
text: CORPORAL BOWER, military physique, chiseled features. His
text: chest lightly expanding, blood pulsating through his veins.
text: Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life, muscles
text: flinching, breath quickening. He squirms with discomfort,
text: ripping away the mask. He gasps, trying to SCREAM.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT.
text: His scream is muffled under three inches of glass. The hatch
text: door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the edges.
text: THUD, THUD... THUD! The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
text: out, struggling to rip away the feeding tubes. He HITS the
text: floor, naked and gasping. His pores ignite, dripping sweat.

speaker_heading: BOWER (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...? HEY!!? Someone?
text: A constant low RUMBLE is present, joined by the occasional
text: MOAN and CREAK of a large ship. A SHUDDER travels through
text: the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal...
text: A massive steel compartment, tangled with technology. It's
text: cold and institutional. High-tech computer terminals slope
text: out of the floor. The FLICKER passes, taking us into black.
text: We hear him: fumbling through the room, switches are thrown
text: with no result and compartments are pulled opened and...
text: SNAP! A glow stick comes to life.
text: He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion. A
text: drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
text: sleep pod. He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
text: his arm and he sucks on the tube, pulling as much liquid into
dialog: his mouth as possible.
text: After a few heavy gulps, he suddenly heaves towards the
text: floor. He painfully forces himself to drink, gasping.
text: He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own. He
text: leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one, the
text: name plate reading; 2nd Lt. Cooper. It's EMPTY.
text: The third pod's name plate reads; LT. PAYTON. Deep inside
text: there is the figure of a man, asleep under a mask.
speaker_heading: BOWER (CONT'D)
dialog: Payton? Lieutenant... Payton?
text: He turns back to his own pod, seeing the name plate that
text: reads; CORPORAL BOWER. Even this name doesn't seem familiar.
speaker_heading: BOWER (CONT'D)
dialog: Bower? Bower...?
text: The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver

scene_heading: Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal #87153-D.

scene_heading: INT. STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: BOWER
dialog: Bower.
text: He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized

text: tattoo on his forearm that reads: FLT&gt;&gt;005Â»015.
text: He pulls on a black flight suit, emblems and military

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: BOWER
dialog: Faa-uck!

text: THUMP, THUMP, THUMP: Muffled and desperate. CRACK! Bower
text: jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside, the
text: hatch bursting open. Out climbs...
text: PAYTON, a man in his forties, but the rugged physique of a
text: man half his age, lean and agile. His military-style hair

speaker_heading: BOWER (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: GALLO (O.S.)
dialog: Help... me!
text: PAYTON pauses, angling the light inside to see... GALLO, a
text: young flight officer, boyish innocence, short-cropped hair,
text: heavily coated in sweat, desperation in his eyes. His hair

speaker_heading: PAYTON
dialog: Who the hell... are you!?

text: out, trembling with fear and exhaustion.
speaker_heading: GALLO

dialog: I'm- Please- HELP ME!
text: PAYTON oddly hesitates... before lowering the weapon. He
