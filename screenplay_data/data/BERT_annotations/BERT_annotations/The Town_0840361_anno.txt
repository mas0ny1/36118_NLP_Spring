scene_heading: INT. KENMORE SQUARE SOVEREIGN BANK —- EARLY MORNING
text: We are inside a bank in the morning hours, just before it
text: opens. We hear the VOICES of people as they approach. A
text: spear of daylight precedes a woman’s hand. Keys turn in
text: reinforced locks, releasing strongbars.
text: A WOMAN, CLAIRE (30) the bank manager and A MAN,
text: DAVID, (37) the assistant manager, enter, talking
dialog: casually.
text: The BANDITS move with JARRING SPEED AND VIOLENCE.
text: They wear BLACK JUMPSUITS, hold ASSAULT RIFLES and wear
dialog: Halloween masks.
text: The FIRST BANDIT, DOUG (35) GRABS CLAIRE by the arm and
text: leads her toward the back.
text: The SECOND, JEM (34) KICKS the coffee tray from David's
text: hand, staining the wall, then knocks him to the floor
text: with the butt of his AK-47 rifle.
text: Doug leads Claire down the short hall, taking her KEYS
text: and handing her off to GLOANSEY (32) another thief, who
text: pushes both employees to the floor behind the teller
text: cages, and YANKS OFF THEIR SHOES.
text: Doug passes the FOURTH, (DEZ, 28) -- with a RADIO WIRE in
dialog: his ear
speaker_heading: GLOANSY
dialog: Close your eyes. Don’t move.
text: Doug aims his rifle at the David and Claire:

text: The digital clock on the vault door reads 8:17.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ...eight eighteen.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: When it hits, no panic code. Open
dialog: it clean. Understand?
text: Everything has gone very fast to this point. Now it moves

dialog: 3
dialog: 2
speaker_heading: 1
text: The timer CLACKS! Doug inserts the vault key.
text: Claire reaches for the big dial with a trembling hand.
text: She rotates it once, then overshoots the next number.
speaker_heading: JEM
dialog: Now you’re stalling.
text: Jem has his gun pointed at Bearns’ head. Claire makes a
text: mistake and the TUMBLERS RESET.
speaker_heading: JEM (CONT'D)
dialog: (re: Bearns)
dialog: Do you like this lefty? ‘Cause I’m
dialog: gonna drop him like a hot rock.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (calmer)
dialog: How many attempts before a duress
dialog: delay?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Th-three.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: You want us here another fifteen
dialog: minutes?
text: Claire reaches fast, but Doug grabs her wrist, holding it

speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Breathe. Once you start, do not
dialog: stop.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

text: spins the wheel and the vault door OPENS.
scene_heading: INT. SOVEREIGN BANK, INSIDE THE VAULT - CONTINUOUS
text: Doug and Jem collecting CASH. They rip the color-coded
text: bands, fanning each thick packet.

speaker_heading: DEZ
speaker_heading: ATM.

text: Doug’s attention is pulled to Claire, lying face-down
text: behind the teller cages.
text: Her heel is slowly moving Claire peeks at Gloansy, who
text: is distracted by the student. Her foot PRESSES A BUTTON
text: UNDER THE COUNTER -- then quickly glides back.
text: Claire looks the other way... and sees Doug’s mask
text: STARING at her.
text: She’s caught. She’s dead.
text: The Student finally gives up, walking away from the ATM.
text: Doug stares at terrified Claire. After a beat:
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: We gotta go.
speaker_heading: JEM
dialog: Bleach it up.
text: Gloansy pulls ZIP CUFFS from his pocket. Jem and Dez

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Doesn’t matter. Let’s go.
speaker_heading: BEARNS
dialog: Look, no one did anything --
text: Jem HITS HIM WITH THE RIFLE. Then rains down a flurry of
text: punches. His knuckles pound Bearns’ temple.
text: Bearns slumps to one side, but Jem does not let up. He
text: HAMMERS at Bearns’ defenseless face. Claire SCREAMING.
text: Jem rises, grabs a bottle of bleach. Moves to empty it
text: over Bearns’ face. But Doug HOOKS his arm, stopping him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Let’s go. Load the bags.
text: After hesitating, Jem rises.
text: Doug takes the bleach, dowsing the teller station. He
text: returns to the teller station and Bearns’ WHEEZING.
text: Claire's chair is empty.
scene_heading: INT. KENMORE SOVEREIGN BANK, REAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Jem has Claire doubled over near the waiting bags, her

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Fuck is this?
speaker_heading: JEM
dialog: They get us walled in, we need
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: DOUG

scene_heading: EXT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

scene_heading: INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Doug pushing her into the bench, sitting next to her.
speaker_heading: DOUG
text: Eyes shut, no noise.
text: Doug pulls out a small knife. He tugs at her jacket hem,
text: CUTTING OFF a strip of fabric -- making her flinch.
text: The rest of the crew REMOVE THEIR MASKS.
text: As THE VAN LURCHES FORWARD, he ties it around her head as
text: a blindfold. He makes a fist and drives it -- STOPPING
text: JUST SHORT OF HER NOSE. Making sure she can’t see.
text: He sits back. STUDYING her with impunity.
text: As he stares at her we have a NON-LINEAR SEQUENCE where
text: we FLASH BACK TO Doug scouting the bank job, observing
dialog: Claire as she came and went from work--but we HEAR a
text: conversation between Claire and an FBI agent that takes
dialog: place AFTER the robbery.
scene_heading: EXT. KENMORE SQUARE SOVEREIGN BANK - FLASHBACK
text: Doug watches intently as Claire comes to work in the
dialog: morning.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY (V.O.)
dialog: I’m assuming they warned you not
dialog: to cooperate with the police.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE (V.O.)
dialog: One of them took my driver’s
dialog: license and read it to me. Said
dialog: he was keeping it.
scene_heading: EXT. KENMORE SQUARE SOVEREIGN BANK - FLASHBACK
text: Claire gets off, sunset. She is quite beautiful but it
dialog: isn’t that, there is something endearing in her dignity,
text: her poise. Doug watches from a Cadillac STS.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY (V.O.)
dialog: Did he say anything else?
scene_heading: INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS - WORK ROOM - PRESENT
text: In two chairs set next to a table, Claire facing FBI
text: AGENT ADAM FRAWLEY, 36, talented and intense.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: ‘If you tell the FBI anything, we
dialog: will come to your house and fuck

text: The Print Tech looks up before resuming.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Then nothing. We just drove.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: This was a passenger van?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I went skiing in Vermont at

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: They didn’t say anything else to
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No.
dialog: (pause)

text: He drapes his jacket over her shoulders.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Why did they take our shoes?
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: To keep you from running. Or

dialog: activate the alarm?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No.
text: Frawley reaches over, turns off his tape recorder.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: When someone feels their life is

dialog: mile generates ninety percent of
dialog: the perpetrators: Charlestown.
dialog: People in the Town have been

dialog: Does that help?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I moved to Charlestown three

dialog: ghs. Let’s his head fall forward, a bit. Brings

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: Okay. Aside from me, you are the
dialog: last person these subjects want to

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Excuse me, hi. Hello?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh, hey -- how are you?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Really embarrassed. I wanted to
dialog: apologize...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No, no. You got nothing to
dialog: apologize for.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I’m having a really bad month, and
dialog: it all kind of hit me at once.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No problem at all.
text: Some of her remaining clothes sit folded on the table.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Anyway -- thanks for the quarters,
dialog: and pulling my clothes out. And --
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No problem.
dialog: (steps after her)
dialog: Maybe, maybe you can let me buy
dialog: you a drink? I don’t even know
dialog: what that means but people say it-
text: She looks up at him, wasn’t expecting this. Says nothing.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT’D)

dialog: Or we can get dinner.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Uh.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: This is why I’ve never done the

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No, I just wasn’t expecting this.
dialog: Dinner?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: That’s what I was going for.

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Demolition. Well, the owner named
dialog: the company ‘Sky Makers’ -- like
dialog: every time we knock down a
dialog: building we’re really ‘making
dialog: sky.’ But the truth is I hit big
dialog: cinder-blocks with little cinder-
dialog: blocks and at he end of the day I
text: punch a card and slide down the

dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Don’t sugarcoat it for me.

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Not anymore?

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: We were robbed, last week. They
dialog: were waiting for us inside. Made

dialog: know why I’m stuck on that, But
dialog: now I’m barefoot in all my dreams.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: But you weren’t hurt.
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. David was. My assistant
text: manager. The silent alarm went off
dialog: and they...assaulted him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: They did that because of a silent
dialog: alarm?
text: She avoids answering. Then, softly yet plain:
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: They took me with them. I thought

dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: They haven’t talked to you about
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: Not beyond telling me that all
dialog: robbery investigations, evidently,
dialog: begin in Charlestown.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: The FBI said that?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: To that effect.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: They don’t see you as a suspect,
dialog: do they?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. Why would they?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Just, you said they hurt this
dialog: other guy and they let you go...
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: No. I wouldn’t say that’s the

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: The FBI.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: The FBI told you that.
dialog: Did she offend him?
speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: I had asked how one small place

dialog: were the cars and pretty girls...

dialog: Billerica, Winthrop... There were
dialog: a lot of kids in that ice cream
text: parlor, faces pressed to the

dialog: and be like the big guys--some

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY

speaker_heading: CLAIRE
dialog: How’d you know?
dialog: He considers how to answer this, then:
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
text: It epitomizes the character of
dialog: this place--- suspicious,
dialog: parochial, clannish and rude. I
dialog: get cursed at every time I walk
dialog: into a 7-11, like I’m the bad guy.
dialog: This isn’t a very civil
dialog: libertarian thing to say but in my
dialog: experience the only people who

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY

scene_heading: INT. FENWAY PARK, OUTSIDE MONEY ROOM - 15 MIN LATER

scene_heading: INT. TRUCK DELIVERY BAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: THE ARMORED TRUCK HAS ARRIVED.
text: There are THREE BAYS where trucks can pull in and off-

text: BAYS TWO AND THREE ARE CLOSED with a metal grate.
text: Doug sees the driver of the armored car is a WO --
text: frizzy-haired, startled.
text: SHE SEES THEM, TOO! She fumbles the keys in the ignition,
text: STARTING UP THE TRUCK.
text: The LOCKS RESET; the rooftop BEACON SPINS. Tailpipe
text: COUGHS diesel smoke. But the bay door is still closed --
text: she’s got nowhere to go. Driver begins talking fast into
text: the handset of a ceiling-mounted radio.
speaker_heading: GUARD #1
dialog: Assholes fucked up. Sandy’s locked

speaker_heading: DOUG

scene_heading: EXT. FENWAY PARK - GATE A - SAME TIME
text: Outside the “1912 Fenway Park” facade, Frawley opens his

scene_heading: REMINGTON 870 TWELVE-GAUGE from its sleeve, Dino’s Taurus
text: pulls up.
speaker_heading: DINO
dialog: I looped the block. No vans
text: around, nothing.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: Maybe we’re too early. Too late.
text: A blue police CAMPER idles: the Entry and Apprehension

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys, we have to close off these

scene_heading: INT. LOADING DOCK - DAY
text: Jem and Doug load the money into the follow car. Doug
text: sees something shiny over Jem’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Look out!
text: It’s a small mirror on a long pole poking through a crack
text: in the wall. Doug opens up, SHATTERING the mirror --
text: DEAFENING. The pole clatters to the floor.
text: The dock suddenly fills with ricocheting fireballs:
scene_heading: STARFLASH ROUNDS.
text: Jem FIRES as they take cover. Jem breaks off his empty
text: mag and reloads, cursing.
text: There is ANOTHER EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE. The HOSTAGES are
text: yelling and screaming. Gloansy peeks out a door.
speaker_heading: GLOANSY
dialog: That’s the fuckin’ swat team!
speaker_heading: JEM
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: We got dimed.
text: He leaps out, SPRAYING gunfire, then leans back in again.
text: THREE GUNSHOTS CRACK from a different direction. Dez’s
text: knee explodes and he SHRIEKS in agony -- twisting and
dialog: falling.
text: Doug rushes to him, dragging Dez to the rear tire of the
text: can. Hostages are YELLING.
text: Doug searches for the source of the gunshots. Dez, white
text: as a ghost -- his knee blown off -- sits in a widening
text: pool of his own blood. Then -- MORE SHOTS, over their
dialog: heads.
text: Jem ADVANCES, FIRING on a SOURCE OF FIRE and BACKS OFF
text: some of the EAT guys. His .762 Rounds BLOW OFF PIECES OF
text: EAT SHIELDS.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Doug HOLLERS, but then sees: The shots are coming from
text: the gun ports INSIDE the truck. The Driver has them
text: pinned down.
text: Ducking low, Doug sees Gloansy’s feet on the other side
text: of the can’s wheelbase. He YELLS his name, but Gloansy
text: can’t hear him. He rips off his walkie-talkie and slides
text: it under the truck, striking him in the shoe.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (to Gloansy)
dialog: The door! Open the door!
text: Gloansy crawls and HITS the plunger -- the bay door
speaker_heading: RISING.
speaker_heading: JEM
dialog: What are you doing?
text: But Doug was right: the driver PANICS, jumping into the
text: front seat and POWERING FORWARD, SCRAPING the can against
text: the brick door frame, lurching out onto Van Ness.
scene_heading: EXT. GATE D - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Frawley watching as the Provident truck comes out, beacon
text: twirling, SURGING toward him. Other cops rush up, FIRING -
text: - wasting rounds against the grill and windshield.
text: The truck SKIDS on the wet road, then over-corrects,
text: veering toward the sidewalk on Yawkey -- and RAMMING THE
scene_heading: MOBILE COMMAND UNIT HEAD-ON.
text: The blow is TREMENDOUS: the camper BUCKLING AND GRINDING
text: on its rims, tearing up asphalt and uprooting ornamental
text: trees. Cops tumble out of the open end, hurt and
text: crawling away.
scene_heading: INT. LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Now that the full tactical team is assembled AND they
text: know there are armed men firing at them from inside, the
text: firing becomes a continuous assault.
text: Jem and Doug are firing back but they recognize that
dialog: ultimately they are going to be overwhelmed. There will
dialog: be improvised dialogue to this effect and a lot of
text: shooting from inside the loading dock back out to the
text: tactical guys, with Jem’s rounds being the only thing
dialog: that keep them at bay.
text: Gloansy darts to the can and lifts Dez over his shoulder -
text: - Jem emptying another magazine as cover.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Gloansy throws Dez into the Suburban, SLAMS THE TRUNK

dialog: (to Jem)
dialog: And you’re done.

dialog: They’1l be all over me, they won't

dialog: You two go back out through the
dialog: park.
dialog: (he smiles)
dialog: Meet me at the switch.
dialog: This self sacrifice is acknowledged by shared looks-
text: broken off quickly as gunfire comes through the door.
text: Gloansy heads for the follow car.
text: Doug turns and runs the length of the cave, hitting
text: buttons on every bay door -- all of them rising.
scene_heading: EXT. GATE D - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The Black Suburban shoots out of the second bay door. It
text: starts in the opposite direction of the ARMORED CAR, but
text: APPROACHING CRUISERS make it cut back in a controlled
text: skid, racing toward Frawley.
text: Frawley works the pump action on his shotgun: BLAM! --
text: MISSES the first shot, sparks kicking up off the asphalt.
text: He jumps the curb, careening into the parked Thunderbird.
text: Several other OFFICERS FIRE. GLOANSY JERKS HARD to the
text: RIGHT and then has to OVER CORRECT.
scene_heading: INT. AMBULANCE BAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: SOUND OF GUNFIRE AND A CRASH FROM OUTSIDE
text: One empty duffel remains on the floor by the cart. Jem

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: JEM (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you do this?
text: Jem staring at Doug -- holding the gun on him.
speaker_heading: JEM (CONT'D)
dialog: Why?
text: More SIRENS.-- His eyes and gun never leaving Doug.
text: Doug OPENS HIS ARMS, awaiting Jem’s bullet.
text: Jem stares at him until...his gun comes down. Jem hefts
text: the bag and turns and exits back into the park.
scene_heading: EXT. YAWKEY WAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: SIRENS AND FLASHING BLUES arrive. In the Suburban,
text: Gloansy is slumped against the blood-streaked window and
text: deployed airbag, unmoving. Dez crumpled to the floor of
text: the passenger seat.
text: The place is SWARMING WITH OFFICERS.
text: Frawley is down on his haunches behind a patrol car, his
text: shotgun on his knees, which are bobbing and jumping with
dialog: adrenaline.
text: Frawley rises, searching for Dino among the crowd of cops
text: and umbrellas -- finding him talking to a POLICE CAPTAIN.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: Where'd the patrol cars come from?
speaker_heading: POLICE CAPTAIN
dialog: We got a 911. Distress call from

scene_heading: INT. GRANDSTANDS CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Doug moves back through the tunnel. He opens a door the

text: He walks up some stairs and out a SIDE DOOR.
scene_heading: EXT. YAWKEY WAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Frawley is trolling slowly and sees ONE OFFICER off in
text: the MIDDLE DISTANCE who doesn’t appear to be engaged.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: Him. Follow him.
scene_heading: EXT. VAN NESS —- CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Doug crosses the street briskly. Painful glances at the
text: smashed Suburban at the far end of the street.
text: Then, ahead of him, he sees Jem with his duffel -- a man
text: in an FBI vest (Frawley) trailing him. Doug looks at
text: freedom--looks back and follows Jem.
scene_heading: EXT. IPSWICH STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: Frawley following Jem along a row of parked cars.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: Officer! Hold up a minute there,
dialog: please.
text: Jem stops, motionless. When he turns, he turns firing his
text: shoulder-harnessed Tec with a sweeping arm motion.
text: Two cops drop a sawhorse and run. Frawley spins away--
text: just in time. Jem FIRES. BYSTANDERS scatter.
text: Jem methodically comes after Frawley, who scrambles back
text: on his haunches. He is shooting to kill Frawley rather
dialog: than escape and if he hadn’t run out of ammunition-he
dialog: would have.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: ON DOUG
text: Two other Cops run past, one YELLING to Doug:
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: Take the left flank! We’re gonna
dialog: sweep up Boylston!
text: He sees Jem break across the street, bag in one hand, Tec-
text: 9 in the other. Frawley stalking Jem with a shotgun.
text: Jem heads for a crowded McDonald's, a panicked, grainy
text: voice SCREAMING at him on the Drive-Thru speaker.
speaker_heading: ON FRAWLEY
text: Shotgun to his shoulder. He FIRES WIDE, hitting a stand
text: of free Apartment Guides in front of Jem, stopping him
text: and keeping him away from the McDonald's.
text: Jem cuts back the other way as people stream out of
text: McDonald's. People are running in all directions.
speaker_heading: ON DOUG
text: Seeing Frawley, panicked, looking almost childlike trying
text: to pick up and load dirty shells from the gutter. Doug
text: lines up A PERFECT SHOT AT FRAWLEY...
text: Doug tenses, waiting -- but does not take the shot.
speaker_heading: ON JEM
text: Holding the money bag as a shield now, he crosses the
text: intersection, where MORE COPS lie in wait. A FLURRY of
text: rounds peck at his vest, his leg, his shooting arm.
text: Jem spits rounds back. He staggers up the ramp to an Osco
text: Drug, arriving just as a Clerk inside locks the door. Jem
text: stutters GUNFIRE, SHATTERING the glass -- until his Tec
text: runs out of ammo. He throws it to the ground.
text: He produces a Beretta and CONTINUES FIRING.
text: Frawley returns fire, hitting JEM in the HAND.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY
dialog: On the ground, FBI. FBI!

speaker_heading: MAILBOX.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Coughlin! Throw me your weapon.
text: Doug looks back at him. A sea of police officers,
text: skulking behind cars, holding weapons. Bouncing brass,
text: glass and distant sirens are the only sounds.
speaker_heading: FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: Coughlin!
speaker_heading: JEM
dialog: All right!
text: Jem sees a DISCARDED MCDONALDS SODA, dropped in the
dialog: panic.
speaker_heading: JEM (CONT'D)
dialog: One second!
text: He strains to reach for it and finally grasping it, he
text: takes a pull from the straw, quenching some deep thirst.
text: Closes his eyes, he puts the GUN UNDER HIS CHIN AND
speaker_heading: FIRES.
text: The Police now enjoy a burst of courage and begin FIRING.
text: DOUG'S POV: Jem lying in the middle of the road, cops
text: firing. Torn cash blowing everywhere.
text: Doug stares out at his friend -- his brother -- dead in
dialog: the streets.
text: Something washes over Doug. He looks at the Beretta in
text: his hand -- then holsters it, as he walks away.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET (CHARLESTOWN) - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

scene_heading: INT. TOWN FLOWERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The bell RINGS over the door as he enters. Doug waits a
text: few airless moments -- Another funeral arrangement lies
text: in the shop--like the one for Claire.
text: -- until Rusty pushes through the black curtain behind
text: the counter. He looks up eyeing the cop like any
text: customer. Then he recognizes Doug’s face. Doug indicates
text: that Rusty should come, in a hushed, secretive manner.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Is Fergie here? Something
dialog: happened.
text: Rusty comes to the counter and the second he turns his

scene_heading: INT. FLORIST’S BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
text: The back room is empty.
text: Doug enters, comes to the center of the room. He sees a

speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Fergie, come on out.
text: The door opens and Fergie comes through in his
text: sweatpants, holding a BOSTON HERALD in one hand and a .45
text: in the other he stands seven or eight feet from Doug.
speaker_heading: FERGIE
dialog: Prick.
text: They start SHOOTING at one another.
dialog: Rather than sexing it up-- the feel should be of watching
text: people shoot one another on surveillance video: wide,
text: detached and oddly pedestrian.
text: Doug has the clear advantage of a VEST and after five or
text: six shots Fergie BUCKLES and DROPS to the floor abruptly.
text: Doug walks over to him, unsteady, now realizing he has
text: been hit once or twice himself. He replaces his empty
text: clip with a new one, chambering a round.
text: He kneels next to Fergie who lies on the floor (now we
text: see blood coming from Doug’s neck) and puts his gun in

scene_heading: INT. CLAIRE’S CONDO - MOMENTS LATER
text: Doug is LOWERED slowly onto the floor, then we see he is

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: CLAIRE

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY

speaker_heading: DOUG

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY

speaker_heading: FRAWLEY (CONT'D)
dialog: You got the Florist, huh?

speaker_heading: DOUG

dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: MUSIC CUE
text: She eases Doug’s head into her lap, and begins stroking
