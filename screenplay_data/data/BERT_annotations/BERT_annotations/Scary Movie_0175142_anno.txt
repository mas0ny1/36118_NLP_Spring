dialog: Now Greg on the other hand, that's
dialog: somebody else's mess.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: I'll admit, the pro's is a long shot

scene_heading: P.O.V. BUFFY
text: Greg slamming his head into the lockers, obviously upset
dialog: about something.
speaker_heading: BUFFY (CONT'D)
dialog: And the only way we'll see him in prime

speaker_heading: CINDY

speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Yeah, that was her.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No, I was talking about Steve.
dialog: Whatever happened to him?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Hey, do you guys think it's strange
dialog: that she got killed exactly one year

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey, it was an accident.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Was it?
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT @ NIGHT - (FLASHBACK @ ONE YEAR AGO)
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Hey dude. Nobody drives my car but
dialog: me! Well, except for that big black

dialog: drove it, but other than that, nobody
dialog: drives my car but me. Okay, there
dialog: was that one time the dope man had

dialog: that®
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: You know cars are only to make guys

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: What's that supposed to mean?
text: Bobby takes the keys from Greg.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: She's kidding, come on.
text: Greg approaches Buffy.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Why did you tell Cindy about it?
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: I didn't say anything.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Then why did she make that comment?
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Greg, you know I would never tell

speaker_heading: GREG

text: Ray pulls a tape out of his pocket.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Here, put this on.
text: Bobby puts in the tape.
text: The song "It's Raining Men" blares out speakers. Everyone

speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, it's a classic.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Let's put on the radio.
text: Greg ejects the tape and finds a station. Loud rock music

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Now that's more like it. Yeah.
text: Greg nods to the music.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: (yelling)
dialog: AYOO!!!
text: Greg stands up, pokes his head through the sunroof, takes

scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD @ NIGHT (GREG'S CAR)
text: Ray and Brandy in the back are really going at it hot and
dialog: heavy.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: (adjusting the rear view mirror)
dialog: Look at what they're doing.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Bobby, keep your eyes on the road.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: When are we gonna do stuff like that?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: One day.
text: Bobby unzips his pants.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I just want you to touch it.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD @ NIGHT @ (GREG'S SUNROOF)
text: Greg yelling. This time in tears as he realizes he is about
text: to be hit by a low hanging
dialog: branch.
text: Thud. His head goes reeling.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD @ NIGHT @ (GREG'S CAR)
text: Cindy gingerly touching Bobby's crotch. He closes his eyes
dialog: momentarily.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh yeah.
text: Suddenly, Greg's liquor bottle comes falling through the
text: sunroof, crashing against
text: Cindy's head, sending her face down into Bobby's lap.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Oh yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
text: Bobby lays his seat back.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD @ NIGHT @ (GREG'S SUNROOF)
text: Greg's head, passing through the tree branches, emerges with
text: a bee hive wrapped around
text: his face. He desperately tries to remove it.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD @ NIGHT @ (GREG'S CAR)
text: It looks like a wild orgy.
text: Bobby steering with his bare feet.
text: Cindy trying to raise her head but is being stepped on by
dialog: Greg.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD @ NIGHT @ (GREG'S SUNROOF)
text: Greg finally removes the hive. He sees something in the
dialog: road.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Look out!
scene_heading: EXT. WINDING ROAD @ NIGHT @ (GREG'S CAR)
text: Bobby hears Greg's scream. He too sees something. Bobby
text: swerves to avoid it.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Oh my God!
text: The car goes spinning out of control before it finally comes
text: to a stop.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What was that?
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I think we hit something.
scene_heading: EXT. WINDING ROAD @ NIGHT
text: Everyone gets out of the car.
text: Buffy finds a boot.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Oh my God! We hit a boot!
text: They see a man lying unconscious in the road.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Ahh! It's a body!
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: Is he alive?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Let me check®
text: Buffy kneels next to the body.
speaker_heading: BUFFY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey mister, you want a blow job?
dialog: No answer.
speaker_heading: BUFFY (CONT'D)
dialog: He's dead. What are we gonna do?
text: She quickly backs up and joins the rest of the group.
text: The man slowly starts to gain consciousness. The kids don't
text: see him, caught up in their own drama.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: We have to call the police.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: No way, I ain't going to jail.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: We have to.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Do you know what happens to a young boy
dialog: in prison? All those sex starved
text: convicts just waiting for a fresh
dialog: piece of meat.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: You're right. Maybe we should call
dialog: the police.
text: Behind them we see the man sit up. He calls out to them.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: That's not necessary. I'm fine.
text: They can't hear him. They're too busy yelling at each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Think about it, Ray. If you do that
dialog: you ruin the rest of this movie. This
dialog: is your chance to crossover, Ray.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: White girls?!
text: Bobby nods yes.
speaker_heading: RAY (CONT'D)
dialog: What do we do first?
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We'll hide the body.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I won't have anything to do with this.
text: In the background, the man is now standing, brushes himself
text: off and calls out to the group again.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I guess I'll be going now.
text: Again he's ignored. He shrugs his shoulders and starts to
dialog: walk away.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: What about the alcohol?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: We'll get rid of it.
text: Greg tosses the bottle over his shoulder. It crashes the
text: man on the head, knocking him out. He flops back
text: on to the road, just as the group turns to look at him.
speaker_heading: GREG (CONT'D)
dialog: Now let's get him in the trunk. Move the car closer.
text: As the three of them talk among themselves, one of them gets
text: in the car and backs it up. The Man sits up
text: again, shaking his head clear.
text: He gets up just as the car backs up into him. Knocked
text: unconscious again, he falls flat on the road. Just
text: then, the kids turn around.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: We'll throw him in the ocean.
text: They throw him in the trunk and look at each other as they
dialog: talk.
speaker_heading: BOBBY (CONT'D)
dialog: We'll go down to Steveson and dump him in
dialog: there. The sharks will take care of
dialog: the evidence.
text: The Man wakes up again in the trunk, but the kids aren't
text: looking at him.
text: Not looking at him, Brandy slams the trunk lid down on the
text: Man's head.
text: Greg tries slamming it down again and again.
scene_heading: EXT. PIER @ NIGHT
text: They get him out of the trunk and carry him over to the edge
dialog: of the road, which is
text: overlooking the ocean.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Wait. Shouldn't we check his wallet?
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: For what?
speaker_heading: BRANDY
dialog: Shit, he might have some money. We
dialog: already committed murder. Might as
dialog: well rob his ass.
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: Good idea. I'll take credit cards.
speaker_heading: BRANDY
dialog: I want the jewelry.
speaker_heading: RAY
dialog: I'll take his underwear.
text: They finish stripping the man then toss his naked body over
dialog: the side.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: We must never mention this again.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Mention what?
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: The guy we just killed.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Well, you just mentioned it.
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Starting now.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOUNTAIN @ DAY (PRESENT)
speaker_heading: BOBBY
dialog: That's all behind us now, Cindy, we

speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Greg's right, Cindy. I mean what do
dialog: you think we're in, a horror movie?
text: Cindy relaxes and smiles.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Yeah, if it were, they'd probably cast

dialog: to play me.
text: They share a laugh as the bell rings and everyone heads to

speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: DOOFY
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: You shouldn't be here.
speaker_heading: GAIL

speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: You look awfully young to be a

speaker_heading: DOOFY
dialog: I'm twenty-five and a half years

speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: You know, I prove to be most popular
dialog: with males eleven to twenty-four. And

speaker_heading: DOOFY

speaker_heading: GAIL
dialog: I say, that's a mighty big night

speaker_heading: DOOFY
dialog: My mom says I can't play with it
