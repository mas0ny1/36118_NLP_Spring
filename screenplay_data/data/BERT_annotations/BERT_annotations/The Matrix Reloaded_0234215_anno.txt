dialog: April 8, 1999
speaker_heading: FADE IN ON:
text: Dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. We hear wind
text: as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.
text: We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the darker
text: world of the dead surface of Earth, the desert of the real. The
text: rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We approach
text: a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the increasing
text: buzz of multiple hovercraft engines. Blue flashes grow in intensity
text: from the fissure. Radio voices, indistinct at first, grow louder as
text: we approach the fissure.
speaker_heading: WOMAN (V.O.)
text: "Six o'clock, 300 meters. We can't outrun 'em."
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: "I know. Can't tow this crate fast enough! We gotta ditch it!"
text: We hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a police
text: scanner. The woman is NIOBE, the captain of the lead ship, Sephora.
speaker_heading: NIOBE (V.O.)
dialog: "Can't, the core is still good. And they've got 'The One.'"
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: "Oooh, our savior. Hed better be worth it."
speaker_heading: NIOBE (V.O.)
dialog: "Shut up and make the exit. Hold on!"
text: The azure glow from the fissure is suddenly overwhelming. A tight
text: convoy of three HOVERCRAFT explode from the fissure, traveling
text: nearly straight up, like a trio of massive locomotives flying into
text: the sky in tight formation, linked together by tow cables. The blue
text: glow has been emanating from the overworked flare drives of the
text: first and third hovercrafts. Between them, suspended by tow cables,
text: is the dark, scorched, and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They rocket upward,
text: slowing as they reach the top of the arc.
speaker_heading: NIOBE (V.O.)
dialog: "Woo-hoooh!"
text: The rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. The NEB flails
text: wildly between them.
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: "They're still on us!"
text: More vehicles fly from the fissure. A massive army of SQUIDDIES pours
text: up onto the surface.
scene_heading: INT. NEBACHANEZZER COCKPIT
text: The NEB is slung between the two HOVERCRAFT, with the cockpit facing
text: backwards. TRINITY, MORPHEUS, TANK, and NEO, the former Thomas
text: Anderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away from
text: them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.
text: It's been a mere TWO DAYS since the realization of NEOS POWERS and
text: the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into the
text: interior of the ship, and the crew is cold, tired, haggard, and
text: stressed beyond belief as they can only watch the action in their
text: knocked-out ship.
text: MORPHEUS is on a headset.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Niobe, theyre closing."
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "How many?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Just a few. Maybe two or three. Hundred."
scene_heading: INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT
text: NIOBE, as regal as she is beautiful, sits at the controls of her ship
text: with her co-pilot, a younger female. All visible dials are redlined as
text: they streak over the dark surface.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Youve got a gift for understatement."
scene_heading: INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT
text: THE FREEDOMS CAPTAIN, a silhouette in a dark cockpit, is flying
text: blind. His cockpit is awash in the blue flares from NIOBES ship.
text: His lieutenant, a shadowy female figure, reaches for the radar screen.
text: As she does, we see her bare shoulder fall into view, a WHITE RABBIT
text: tattoo is conspicuous.
text: They switch their screens to the radar, squiddies right on their ass.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: "Oh shit, were screwed. We gotta set down and EMP em."
speaker_heading: NIOBE (V.O.)
dialog: "Too many!"
scene_heading: EXT. FREEDOM HULL
text: A racing SQUIDDIES reaches the hull and latches on, striking up its
text: cutting laser and ripping into the hull.
scene_heading: INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT
speaker_heading: MAN (V.O.)
dialog: "Theyre on me! Shit! Losing power!"
text: NIOBES Lieutenant, a muscular Asian woman, Circa, notes something on
text: a console.
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Multiple bogies closing!"
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "No shit."
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "From the front!"
text: Niobe is grim faced as she peers into the sky ahead. Several objects
text: are closing in fast.
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Are they - "
text: She doesn't have time to finish the question, as the oncoming fighters
text: launch a massive volley of missiles. From afar, they look like dark
text: irises surrounded by a corona of flame. At first, we can't tell
text: exactly what they are, until their fiery trails rip straight at the
text: SEPHORA cockpit.
text: CIRCA DUCKS as the missiles harmlessly streak by.
scene_heading: INT. NEB COCKPIT
text: A massive swarm off missiles blasts by the cockpit. The individual
text: warheads swerve at the last second, blowing SQUIDDIES apart, or
text: casting them to the ground aflame.
scene_heading: INT. SEPHORA COCKPIT
text: Niobe breathes a sigh of relief. Her lieutenant looks back up to see a
text: wing of HOVER FIGHTERS - 'DEFENDERS' fly past their ship. Sleek, with
text: huge blue flares from their engines, they're gunship fighters armed to
text: the teeth with missiles and laser turrets studding the fuselage.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "They're ours."
speaker_heading: DEFENDER ONE (V.O.)
dialog: "Hold on, folks, you're in for a little cleaning."
scene_heading: EXT. THE SURFACE
text: The wing of DEFENDERS makes short work of the squiddies. The half
text: dozen clinging to FREEDOM'S hull are picked off by well-placed laser
text: shots that turn the squiddies into curdling balls of slag. The
text: squiddies that survive turn tail and run.
scene_heading: INT. NEB COCKPIT
text: The crew of the Neb breathe a collective sigh of relief as they leave
text: the scene of aerial carnage behind them.
text: NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He
text: relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly enters
text: a cave, and starts to descend. The blue wash of the ship shows rock
text: walls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back into
dialog: the earth.
text: TANK'S shoulders drop, and he leans back into his chair.
speaker_heading: TANK
dialog: "We're home."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Well, not yet, but we're in the defense screen."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "What's that?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
text: "A concentric ring of defenses that shields Zion. The fighters that
dialog: just saved us constitute the first ring."
speaker_heading: NIOBE (V.O.)
dialog: "Neb crew, you can relax now."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "For the moment, perhaps. Its still a long drive home."
speaker_heading: FADE OUT
dialog: and
speaker_heading: FADE INTO:
text: TRINITY'S CABIN. At first we see only stars twinkling, faraway
text: diamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the
text: darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork
text: terminates in the metal ring going around her room. It's a much more
text: hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The articles
text: she's collected during her time in the resistance dot the cabin. An
text: unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits of
dialog: loved ones.
text: Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO is
text: sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside him
text: with her head on his lap.
text: Neo cant sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a photo
text: of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling, laughing
text: as they are seated around the table. Morpeus, Tank, Dozer, Switch,
text: Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's an
text: unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.
text: Gently, placing Trinity's head down, NEO stands and examines the
dialog: photo.
text: She awakens.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "I'll have to take that one down now. Cypher..."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Who is this guy?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Who?"
text: NEO points to the mystery man.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "That was... I... forgot his name."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "What happened to him?"
text: TRINITY is sullen.
dialog: "He didnt make it."
text: NEO returns to the bed and sits down, disturbed. Trinity sits up,
text: awakening.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Was he like me?"
text: TRINITY nods.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Not you, though. Like you. There have been others, Neo."
dialog: "Aren't you tired?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "No. I've never been a big sleeper."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "I know. I used to watch you hacking without sleeping for days."
text: He turns to her, questions in his eyes.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "How many 'ones' have there been?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "That's not the point."
dialog: NEO may not think so.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "You are him. Youre mine."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "But what does it mean, to be The One?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "I don't know, Neo. Our mission was to find you."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "So, now what?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Now, Zion will give us a new mission."
text: The hatch swings open. MORPHEUS peers in.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
text: "We're almost home. We'll need a detail. Five minutes."
text: HE closes the hatch and disappears.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Does he ever knock?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Not on his ship."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK, NEB
text: The crew grips the bulkhead and fixtures as the swaying ship comes to
text: a rest. Outside, the sounds of hover engines fade away. Tank unlocks
text: the main hatch, then jumps as it drops, unpowered, slamming into the
text: tarmac with a resounding smash.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ZION TARMAC
text: The tarmac is a busy, crowded military airport, with hovercraft of
text: different sizes spread across the lot. Its housed poorly lit,
text: houses in a cave so huge the ceiling is out of site. Crewpersons run
text: around, servicing battle-damaged vehicles. Munitions are carted
text: across the tarmac on robot rolling racks. No one pays the NEB and
text: its battered crew any mind.
text: Nearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM are parked. Their engines shut down,
text: and their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out.
text: NIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but
text: their military manner is quickly restored, though they can barely
text: contain their grins.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Niobe..."
text: SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.
dialog: "M."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Thanks for the rescue."
text: THEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps
dialog: between them.
text: It's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier.
text: Exhuberant and oblivious, he joyfully gets in MORPHEUS' face.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Brough, you us your asses! We saved you so hard core you don't even
dialog: know!"
text: NIOBE smiles at Morpheus and fades back as BOOTH shouts his own
text: praises. Morpheus turns to his less-mature peer.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "So, you think you finally found The One, huh? Another One?"
text: DUJOUR, CHOI'S LIEUTENANT, pushes into their conversation, looking
text: offscreen.
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Idiot, we helped him find him. Hello, Morpheus."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Huh?"
text: He looks at what she's seeing. His gaze halts on NEO. He's
text: concentrating on TANK and his apparent girlfriend, who seems to be
text: consoling him. He turns to see CHOI and DUJOUR, does a double-take,
text: and his jaw drops open.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "You?"
text: CHOI is quick to resume his cool.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "In the flesh, so to speak."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Welcome to the real world, Neo. I'm glad you're here."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "What do you think, Dujour? Should we take him with us?"
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Definitely."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Morpheus?"
text: MORPHEUS turns from Niobe and a Zion officer. He addresses Trinity,
text: glancing at the others.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Go on ship's liberty. Meet me in the Dead Duck at 21:00 hours, drunk
dialog: or sober."
scene_heading: EXT. ZION STREET
text: It's like a valley floor running between two gigantic walls of rock
text: that are nearly vertical, coming together in an elongated archway.
text: Carved into the street level are innumerable stores and shops, above
text: them, apartments and balconies that rise to the top of the arch.
text: People flow through the street. Their clothes are homespun wool,
text: denim, and leather. Dyes and color are absent. Carved into the solid
text: granite walls, between homes and around windows and doors, are
text: intricate and beautiful carvings.
text: NEO is lead down the street by CHOI, DUJOUR, and TRINITY, and a few
text: other rebels. The push through a mult-culti crowd of people, humanity
text: melting into one race.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "See, man? This is home. This is the main street. One of em, anyway.
dialog: Almost everyone is a fighter. Sometimes, even the kids.
text: THEY pass an outdoor workshop where youngsters are assembling small
dialog: machines.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Our energy as a people is directed toward liberation. Check it out,
dialog: here are some newcomers."
text: A group of frail, buzz-cut androgonites pass by them. They look at
text: NEO, recognizing him as one of them, a new comer.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Where did they come from?"
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Energy plant we raided on our last mission. There were some
dialog: survivors."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "How are their minds freed from the Matrix?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "With difficulty."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "If at all."
text: They step into a club, Dead Duck. Its a sailor joint. Lots of wood,
text: beer on tap, and rum. Crewmembers of other ships recognize the rebels,
text: greeting them, as they eye Neo. They take a booth in the corner. The
text: waitress arrives.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: "Welcome home, brothers and sisters. First day back?"
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Yes, lovely."
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: "On the house, then. Four rums?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Make it eight."
text: The waitress smirks and leaves. TRINITY turns to CHOI.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Any casualties?"
text: CHOI lights up and takes a drag.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Two. Sidewinder and Left-right."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "I cant believe Cypher turned. Bastard."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "He who loses faith..."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Neo, we monitored your fight. Did you really gain enlightenment?"
text: NEO shrugs.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "All I know is I kicked Smiths ass."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Fuckin finally, Jesus Christ. Its about time we iced that bastard."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Yeah, we finally won against an agent?"
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "I guess 1 n 298 isnt a bed record, huh?"
text: The drinks arrive. Tall glasses of rum.
text: CHOI holds his glass aloft. They raise their glasses to toast.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Live free or die."
speaker_heading: ALL (save NEO)
dialog: "Live free."
text: They slam the rum back, and slam empty glasses on the table. NEO can
text: barely manage to sip his.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "God, how do you do that?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Youve never drank before."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Not for real."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "You want to know what being The One means?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "What?"
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "One drink and youre toast."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Neo, you know what else youve never done?"
text: She glances at Trinity, who falls back against the seat, turning to
text: suppress a smile. Choi cracks up.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Yeah."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Yeah, youve never done it."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "And virtual doesnt count, man, doesnt fucking count."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Well. Ill drink to that."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Here, here."
text: This time, NEO follows the others and slams back the entire glass. He
text: coughs and sputters as his friends and bar patrons cheer him on."
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET, ZION
text: The lights are dim, and only a few late night revelers stagger through
text: the streets on their way back home. Walking straight and calmly
text: through the stragglers are MORPHEUS and NIOBE.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "So, how do you like having your own command?"
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Its good. But trying. The responsibility..."
text: THEY stop before the entrance to the DEAD DUCK.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "You must be both mother and father to your crew."
text: NIOBE nods, and looks into the bar. Inside, the crews are raging drunk
dialog: and loud.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Who will you be now? The mother, or the father?"
text: MORPHEUS peers in on the scene and grins.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "As long as they dont get out of line, Ill just be a brother."
scene_heading: INT. DEAD DUCK
text: NEO is out of it, while the others are merely comfortably in the bag.
text: Hes acting like a kid who broke into his fathers liquor cabinet.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "So, you went back in, and you two pulled him out?"
text: TRINITY nods, herself in disbelief. NEO picks his head up off the
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Kicked... kicked Smiths ass."
text: CHOI eyes MORPHES and NIOBE coming toward them.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Hey, did you kick anybody elses ass, Neo? Like Morpheus?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Morpheus? Yeah, I smacked him around, too."
text: MORPHEUS arrives just in time to hear the last part. He stands and
text: grins down at NEO.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "So, you can smack me around, Neo?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Oh yeah. Anytime."
text: MORPHEUS taps him on the forehead. NEO blinks and falls back into the
text: booth. He stands before them.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Hows Tank?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Hes on bereavement leave with his mother. Dozer was the second son
dialog: shes lost in this war."
text: His comments set a sober tone.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "The Nebechanezzer is out of commission for at least a month. But,
dialog: thats not giving us a rest."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Let me guess. Weve been ordered back out anyway."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Yes. This is another special op. Im in command, Niobe and Trinity
dialog: are team leaders. Neo is our secret weapon."
text: FLASH TO: NEO, passed out with his mouth open on the couch.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "We dont know exactly what hes capable of. He may be just tapping
dialog: his potential, or he may have already reached it. We are to learn from
dialog: him, as he does from us."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Why are we always getting screwed? Not only do I have to go straight
dialog: back into the shit, but I lose my command, too?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Youve been assigned to this mission because youre the best, Choi."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "Yeah, and headquarters thinks you might be able to whine the agents
dialog: to death."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Oh my God thats so funny. My point is, dont we need some r-and-r?
dialog: Unwind a little? We lost two crew on the last one, you lost like five,
dialog: right? Shit. Im glad we found Mr. Invincible, here, but Jesus..."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "You dont have to go, Choi. Volunteers only."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Hes got a point, M. I have faith, but why so quick?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "We have a chance, here, but the window of opportunity is brief. Our
text: ships say the Matrix is already upgrading and re-coding to block our
dialog: entry. And Neos."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Fuck. Every fucking time we get another one, this is what they do."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "He is the One."
speaker_heading: DUJOUR
dialog: "You havent lost the faith, have you Choi?"
text: CHOI grabs a half-filled rum glass and swigs it down.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Well, these are the times that try mens souls. Heres to victory."
scene_heading: EXT. TUNNEL
text: The FREEDOM hovers slowly, silently, like a submarine as it cruises
text: through the murky depths. It suddenly comes to a quiet stop, and
text: descends. The engines fade out, and the vessel rests, darkened, on the
dialog: cave.
text: A quartet of SQUIDDIES slips by. We follow as they worm their ways
text: through the twisted passageway, watching as they pass the bubble
text: cockpit by mere feet.
text: FREEZE on the cockpit. Within the shadows we see Morpheus and Choi at
dialog: the controls.
scene_heading: INT. FREEDOM COCKPIT
text: They watch the SQUIDDIES fade into the distance.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Power up. Sleep mode."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Aye aye, capitano."
text: MINIMAL cockpit displays turn on, and the cabin remains dark.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK
text: The ships OPERATOR, a lean Asian kid with a gaze like a laser scan,
text: sits behind NEO, whos sitting at the operators console with his
text: hands on the abbreviated keyboard. Trinity sits with them, her feet up
text: as she observes.
text: NEO stares at the screen. Its a huge syllabus of Matrix code
text: characters. He struggles to learn the complex code.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Ka equals 9. But reverse Ka is point-nine, right?
text: RAZOR nods.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "You catch on quick, man."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I know these symbols from the hacking trainer. But how come its so
dialog: hard to find them on the keyboard?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Your brain knows what to do. But it has to associate characters with
dialog: your body."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Its muscle memory, Neo. Think of the space bar and your thumbs nail
dialog: it. Because your thumbs have hit the space bar millions of times. But
dialog: think about reverse ka, and your fingers dont hit automatically hit
text: the reverse key and the ka key in one shot."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Where did these symbols come from, anyway?"
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Most of it is from the old Japanese. Its Katakana. See, the machines
dialog: arent binary. No zero and one. Theyre quantum-based, so instead of
text: an open-close base of zero or one, open or closed, they use all
dialog: numbers between zero and one."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "All numbers between zero and one. That could be an infinite number of
dialog: numbers."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Not could be, it is."
text: NEO is astounded.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Holy shit. How many calculations per second?"
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "How many CPS? Well, thats kind of hard to estimate. Put it this way:
text: picture all the particles in the known universe. Not just atoms, but
dialog: sub-atomic particles that compose atoms."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "OK. At last count that was what, a gazillion, right? Two gazillion?"
text: RAZOR barely smiles at the joke.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Well, its up there. In any case, the number of calculations per
dialog: second the Matrix can perform is greater than the estimated number of
dialog: particles in the known universe."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Woah."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Thats how they have the operating power to create entire worlds
dialog: within their PCs."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "OK. Thats why it looks like reality. They have the computing power
dialog: to create entire worlds."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Right."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "So, if we hack into the Matrix, why cant we just change the code
dialog: while were at it?"
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "No, no. See, its not that simple. The machines, the programs that
dialog: code, create, and maintain the Matrix, the agents, they are code.
text: There are different types of agents, many work unseen with no
dialog: interaction in the matrix. Then, there are the enforcers, the ones we
dialog: know all too well."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Right."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Well, my point is, the machines code and recode the Matrix by pure
text: will. Interaction with the Matrix, the physical act of being there,
dialog: by default, allows people to change their environment - the Matrix.
dialog: They move objects, make sound, affect cause."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Like reality."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Almost. Reality is unalterable. But the fabric of reality in the
dialog: Matrix can be rewoven. Some can reach beyond normal cause. Their
text: affects on the Matrix are deeper than average. They have learned to
dialog: change it according to their needs. But they dont have total control.
dialog: Thats why we need operators like Razor here. But you, you go further
dialog: than any of us can."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "How?"
text: RAZOR stands and taps Neos skull. He stretches, grabs a Japanese
text: style wooden sword, and, out of boredom, starts performing slow,
text: precise Kendo moves around the main deck as he talks.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "The equipment you carry up here. Youre a freak. A good freak. Youre
text: neural kinetics blast past those of average humans. This, combined
dialog: with your ability to suspend disbelief, allow you to change the
dialog: reality of the Matrix."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "How did I end up as... a freak?"
text: RAZOR practices the same strike a few times.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Good question. The Machines create people through cloning, since,
dialog: obviously, no coppertops have physical sex. Theoretically, all clones
text: in the Matrix are exactly the same as when the first clones. They
dialog: shouldnt be any different from normal, homegrowns."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "OK, so how do you explain me?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Not just you. Morpheus, myself. We were all born inside.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Well, what separates us from others?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "For the past 50 years or so, something has been happening to children
text: in the Matrix. Theyve been mutating, changing in ways the machines
text: never predicted. Some seem to gain faster reflexes and strength.
dialog: Others seem to have psychic powers."
text: RAZOR looks up to see MORPHEUS, hanging back as he listens. He comes

speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "And others are able to change the reality of the Matrix itself."
text: HE points to Neo.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Discussing history, are we?"
text: RAZOR shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Im trying to teach this fool some programming, man. Hes stuck in
dialog: the 20^th century. Hes got no skills, man. Without us, hes
dialog: helpless."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "In the Matrix, without him, were helpless."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Morpheus, can you tell us what the mission is now?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Not until we reach broadcast depth. Its slow going out there. I
dialog: guess they know were coming back, so theyre patrolling. We have time
dialog: to rest and ready."
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP, LATE DAY (CONSTRUCT)
text: TRINITY sits alone on the tip of an impossibly high finger of rock. It
text: looks like it sits on the rooftop of the world. All around her, as far
text: as the eye can see, lie mountains. Their snow-capped peaks are pink in
text: the sunset light.
text: She looks into the sunset. Heavy thoughts weigh on her mind.
text: A hand appears on her shoulder. Its NEO. How he got on the finger of
dialog: rock is anyones guess.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Boo."
text: TRINITY grins slightly and pulls on his arm. There is only enough room
text: for one on the end of the rock, so he sits down behind her.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Dont lose your balance."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "It doesnt matter if I do."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "So, you can fly."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Yes."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Do you think I can?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I think you can do anything you want, if you believe."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Like you?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I dont know. I dont know exactly what I can do."
text: TRINITY half turns.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Will you teach me to fly?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I dont know if I can."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Free your mind of doubt."
text: NEO stands, and steps in front of TRINITY. Hes on the very, very edge
text: of the rock. He extends his hand down to her. She grabs it, and he
text: hauls her up. Her eyes dart to the ground, thousands of feet below the
dialog: finger.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "In this construct program, the ground can kill."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I wont let you fall. Ever."
text: THEY look into each others eyes. Despite the trauma theyve been
text: through, and not even truly knowing one another, theres a connection.
text: NEO suddenly backs away. He walks on the air with perfect traction, as
text: though hes on an invisible plane of glass. He leaves TRINITY standing
text: precariously on the edge, wobbling a bit as she maintains balance
text: against nerves. She breathes deep, and looks back up at NEO,
text: maintaining her cool even as she eyes the spectacle.
text: NEO stands a few feet away from her, completely at ease as the high
text: altitude winds ruffle his hair.
text: NEO extends a hand to her.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Its not real, Trinity. Youre not standing there. Step out. I can do
dialog: it. You can, too."
text: With one last glance at the infinite drop, she steadies herself and
text: stares straight into his eyes. Blue meet brown. Breathless, she steps
dialog: straight out.
text: She takes one step in the air. For a breathless second, as she steps
text: off the edge, she is stable. When she takes her foot off the edge,
text: though, she sways, and her foot slips, as though shes on a greasy
text: surface bobbing up and down. She corrects herself, tries another step,
text: sags further.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Shit."
text: SHE glances down, then locks eyes with NEO. Then drops like an anvil.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Whoops."
text: HE dives down, shooting like a missile. TRINITY is calm, falling
text: backwards, watching NEO come for her. The rocky ground looms behind
text: her. She makes no effort to reach for NEO as he draws close to her. HE
text: reaches for her with all his might.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Grab me!"
text: TRINITY makes no effort to save herself, even as collision is seconds
text: away. She stares at him intently.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Grab on to me!"
text: SEEING she is doing nothing, he goes beneath her and scoops her up,
text: Superman style. He barely accomplishes this before he slows and
text: settles onto the rocky ground.
text: They are in a twilight glade shaded by the mountains.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "What the hell were you doing?"
text: TRINITY smiles slightly. Her madness has a purpose.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Showing you, Neo."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Showing me what? You nearly gave me a heart attack."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "I want you to know how much faith I have in you."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Oh. And this requires acts of insanity?"
text: TRINITY smiles. She looks him up and down. She moves intimately close.
dialog: "So, you really are Superman."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Only when Im plugged in."
text: TRINITY steps away. NEO grabs her shoulder and turns her to him. He
dialog: attempts a
text: kiss, but she turns her face, letting it land on her cheek.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "What?"
text: TRINITY looks at him, then up at the sky.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Its not you. Just, not here."
text: NEO doesnt understand. TRINITY rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Theyre watching us, you big dope. Do you know how horny computer
dialog: geeks get?"
scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE
text: CHOI, RAZOR, DUJOUR, and CIRCA are sitting around the operators
text: console, feet up, eating. On the screens are patchy images of TRINITY
text: and NEO standing together in the GLADE. Its like theyre watching a
dialog: soap opera.
text: TRINITY and NEO are looking in their direction.
text: ON THE interface chairs, the bodies of TRINITY and NEO lay supine.
speaker_heading: EXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)
text: TRINITY grabs NEO by the arm.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Over here."
text: SHE leads him into the shadows.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE
text: THE VOYEURISTIC crewmembers collectively groan as the lovers disappear
text: off the screen and into the darkness.
text: RAZOR puts his hand on CIRCAS shoulder and sighs.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "So romantic."
text: CIRCA calmly pats his hand and removes it, holding it in front of him.
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Im sure Mary Palmer will appreciate your mood more than I."
speaker_heading: EXT. GLADE (CONSTRUCT)
text: IN the blue twilight shade, NEO and TRINITY kiss tentatively, slowly,
text: then quicker as they give in to their feelings for one another. WE
text: move around them slowly, then pan into the shadows, a natural fadeout.
speaker_heading: INT. OFFICE (MATRIX)
text: AGENTS JONES and BROWN sit across from each other, a steel table
text: between them. They stare at each other for what seems like a long
text: time. There is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst neat
text: stacks of file folders.
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: "Our defeat is worrisome."
speaker_heading: AGENT BROWN
dialog: "As is the loss of our colleague."
text: THEY ARE BOTH seething with anger. AGENT JONES grinds his molars.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "We cant defeat them. You saw what happened."
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "We have a backup copy of Agent Smith..."
text: JONES stands and walks toward the massive panoramic window. The city
text: spreads before him.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "A backup is not good enough. We need to upgrade ourselves to meet the
dialog: new threat."
text: BROWN opens a large file folder.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "Hes being rebuilt. But I have an alternate plan. Why fight the
dialog: humans, when we can let them fight for us?"
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "The terrorists have learned to bend our reality in ways we cannot.
dialog: This was the cause of our defeat."
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "Mr. Thomas J. Anderson is not unique. Over the decades, many humans
dialog: have developed... techniques for manipulating the Matrix. Techniques
dialog: too primitive for us to understand. Most never realize their
dialog: potential, but all the ones weve noticed exhibiting these talents are
dialog: recorded here."
text: ANGLE ON the book as BROWN flips through. Street shots of people from
text: all walks of life. Young rebels, corporate suits, junkies, housewives.
text: JONES turns on AGENT BROWN.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "Do you have anyone in mind?"
text: ANGLE ON the book. It stops on a page dedicated to someone who looks
text: like NEO, but with long hair and an extremely bad attitude. There are
text: photos of him on a motorcycle with a blonde, photos of him drinking
text: with his gang friends.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "Gregory Lowfield. He exhibits the traits we saw in Mr. Anderson."
speaker_heading: MANS VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: "Mr. Anderson no longer exists. Our enemy now is the one called...
dialog: NEO."
scene_heading: ANGLE ON: THE DOOR
text: AGENT SMITH walks in, grinning. There is a new swag to his walk, and
text: his hair is longer, tied back.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "Youve been recreated."
text: SMITH flexes his arm, examines his hands, and feels his hair.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "And you have more hair."
text: SMITH turns to him, examines the photos on the table. They lock eyes.
text: On the same wavelength, they transfer knowledge without speaking.
text: SMITH looks at the photo on the table.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "I know what youre thinking. What we need is our own Neo..."
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "If its possible."
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Ill make it possible."
text: WE ZOOM in on the grainy photo of NEOs doppledanger. Quiet at first,
text: growing louder as it grows dark, we here the rumble and roar of
dialog: motorcycles.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY (NIGHT)
text: FAR OFF in the distance, the glow of motorcycle headlights racing
text: toward us. As we zoom out and focus in, they are already too close to
text: avoid. They rip by us, thundering explosions and men and women
text: cheering.
text: THE pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets. They
text: fly down the highway using both lanes, drinking and driving with total
dialog: abandon.
text: ANGLE ON the lead motorcycle, a massive, custom-made Harley. GREGORY
text: LOWFIELD, Thomas J. Anderson without a desk job, without cares, revs
text: his bike and locks the accelerator. He hands his beer to the blonde
text: who rides behind him, then, in one swift motion, jumps up on his seat,
text: leaning into the slipstream.
text: The feat is IMPOSSIBLE.
text: HIS GIRLFRIEND, CHANDRA, screams at him as she grasps the seat and
text: lowers herself to the bike.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "Greg, are you fucking crazy?"
speaker_heading: GREG
dialog: "Yes. But dont worry."
text: She clings to his legs as they barrel down the highway. They blast
text: pass a darkened cruiser.
scene_heading: INT. CRUISER
text: The cop sets his paper down just long enough to catch a glimpse of the
text: pack exploding down the highway, with GREGORY surfing his bike.
text: ANGLE ON: the radar gun. Its flashing 125 MPH
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: "Holy shit. Drunk ass punks."
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: GREGORY is facing us as he drops back into his seat, taking his beer
text: on cue from CHANDRA. Behind them, the cops lights flare up.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Oh boy. Stop, stop, lets have some fun."
scene_heading: INT. COP CAR
text: WE look through the windshield as the cop drives down the highway,
text: calling in his stop-vehicle report. He suddenly sees something that
text: makes him slam on the brakes.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: "Holy shit!"
text: ANGLE THROUGH the cops windshield. The ten bikers, with GREGORY at
text: their center, are parked in the middle of the road, looking at him
dialog: casually."
scene_heading: EXT. ROAD
text: THE cruiser comes to a stop mere inches from GREGORYS leg. The COP
text: bursts out of the door.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: "What the hell are you doing?"
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Well tell you when to stop, little man. Not the other way around."
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: "Fuck."
text: HE DIVES back into his cruiser, reaching for the radio. GREGORY pulls
text: a huge silver .44 from his jacket and FIRES. The cruisers antenna is
text: blown off at the base, and the nine-foot whip flips onto the ground
text: with a metallic clang.
scene_heading: INT. CRUISER
text: The COP is lying half-on the seat, taking cover. The handset relays
text: only static. He reaches for his gun, but is frozen by Gregorys voice.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Dont try anything stupid, man. I gotta bead on your donut-eating
dialog: ass."
scene_heading: EXT. CRUISER
text: The cop comes out with his hands up.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: "Whaddya want with me?"
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "I dont know. I just thought Id find out what you wanted without you
dialog: shooting at me. So, what do you want?"
text: THE COP is a tough one. Far taller than GREGORY, muscular and serious.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: "Youre all under arrest."
text: THE PACK explodes with laughter. GREGORY walks up to the policeman and
text: circles him, keeping the gun pointed in the business direction.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "This is your lucky day, officer. Were gonna give you a night off."
text: CHANDRA walks up to him. Seductively, she hands him the bottle of hard
dialog: liquour.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "Drink."
text: WHEN he pauses, GREGORY places the gun against his temple.
text: Reluctantly, the big cop starts to gulp down the alcohol.
text: GREGORY lowers the gun. He and CHANDRA return to their motorcycle.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "You never even saw us, man."
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "Keep the bottle."
text: THEY start their bikes and are gone, like ghosts, into the shadows of
dialog: the road.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BEACH
text: A CAMPFIRE blazes only a few feet away from the high tide. A billion
text: stars shine overhead as GREGORY and his biker gang, including the cop,
text: sit or lie around the fire. A few people are still awake, and one
text: picks drunkenly at a guitar.
text: GREGORY stands, throws a blanket over his shoulder, and scoops up
text: CHANDRA. They make their way into the dunes.
scene_heading: EXT. DUNES
text: GREGORY and CHANDRA lie on the blanket, staring at the sky.
text: Inexplicably, GREGROY holds a hand toward the sky.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Which one do you want?"
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "Any one. It doesnt matter."
text: WITH his hand pointed lazily at the sky, a single star starts glowing
text: stronger and stronger. It vibrates, then fades suddenly and comes
text: loose from the sky, and becomes a meteorite, burning across the sky.
text: CHANDRA draws closer to him, enraptured by his power.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "How do you do it, Gregory?"
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "I dont know. Sometimes it feels like... Im reaching beyond the
dialog: world."
text: HIS hand drops and his head turns. He sits up, startled by something.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "What is it?"
text: GREGORY holds up a hand for her to be silent.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "They found us. Cant you hear it?"
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "What? I dont hear anything."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "We can only rebel so long. We can only push until they will hit
dialog: back."
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "They? The Men in Black?"
text: CU on GREGORY. In the distance, the faintest sound of a helicopter can
text: be heard, growing louder.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Fuck! Get to the bikes."
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPFIRE
text: GREGORY bursts over the hill, holding hands with CHANDRA as they run.
text: Hes only had time to through on his boots and boxers and grab his
text: .44. Chandra is dressed only in her underwear and Gregorys leather
dialog: jacket.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Wake up! Get on your bikes and fucking ride!"
text: HIS gang burst to their feet. They scramble through the dunes, heading
dialog: for their bikes.
text: A HELICOPTER, seen only by its massively strong search lamp, and the
text: wind from its rotors blowing sand everywhere, flies up and over the
text: dunes, buzzing the running pack, blowing some off their feet.
text: GREGORY mounts his bike and CHANDRA jumps on back. WITH A WAVE OF HIS
text: HAND, all the bikes, his included, drop into neutral and rev into
text: start. Their headlights blaze as the helicopter returns, joined by
dialog: another.
scene_heading: CHOPPER LOUDSPEAKER
text: "THIS IS THE POLICE, STOP YOUR VEHICLES AND SURRENDER!"
text: SUDDENLY, automatic fire sparks from the unseen helicopters. A bullet
text: trail stitches its way across a pair of bikers, sending them to the
text: ground as the helicopters fly overhead.
text: GREGORY cranks down on the throttle and his bike explodes ahead.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: THE pack splits up in two directions as the distant choppers circle
text: back. GREGORY cuts the lights on his bike and follows the highway by
text: starlight.
scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT
text: TINNY RADIO chatter fills the red-lit cockpit over the steady hum of
text: the engines. The nose of the chopper points to the ground as it
text: focuses on GREGORY and CHANDRA, who are ripping down the highway.
text: CU on the cockpit instruments, centered on the airspeed indicator. The
text: needle is pushing to the max, going through 150 knots.
speaker_heading: PILOT (V.O.)
dialog: "Holy shit, hes outrunning us."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY
text: GREGORY is pasted down to the tank of his bike with CHANDRA gripping
text: him for her life. The slipstream pulls his lips open and tears streak
text: from his eyes as his bike redlines in fifth gear. The helicopters grow
text: smaller behind them. They break chase.
text: CHANDRA looks back and sees the lights turn away. She screams over the
text: wind and the roar.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "Theyre gone!"
text: GREGORY is staring down a dark highway.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Cant see shit."
text: HE turns the headlights back on, just in time to see a ROADBLOCK of
text: heavy duty military trucks. In front of the trucks is a sandbag wall
text: manned by soldiers. The trucks are flanked by police cars. And if one
text: looks closely enough, they can see a pair of AGENTS standing to the
dialog: side.
text: THE stunned soldiers have time to fire off a couple shots as they run
text: frantically to get out of the way of the bike, 800 pounds of metal
text: flying at 150 miles per hour.
text: GREGORY plows into the sandbag wall, directly between two parked
text: trucks. The wall parts in an explosion of sand and sandbags. THEYRE
text: THROUGH, but the bike scissors uncontrollably, until it rolls and we
text: drop into bullet-time.
text: AS the bike goes over, we watch from the side as GREGORY dismounts,
text: grabbing CHANDRA as he steps over onto the safe side of the bike. A
text: massive shower of sparks bursts and trails the bike. It tumbles like a
text: bullet falling through syrup, and GREGORY keeps walking over the
text: rotating surface, using the bike to protect him and CHANDRA against
text: the flesh-ripping concrete.
text: THE bike is coming apart as its bashed against the concrete. Pieces
text: rise slowly into the air - the front wheel, the forks, the mufflers,
text: and a million flakes of metal, until the body bounces into the air,
text: carrying GREGORY and CHANDRA up. Holding her to him - shes barely
text: conscious of the lightning-fast crash, GREGORY rides the flying body
text: with one hand on the frame. It comes crashing down and back into real
dialog: time.
text: THE bikes body streaks along the highway. The sparks fade as it
text: slows, and pieces of metal come clanging and banging down around them.
text: They stop, crouching atop the body, with GREGORY crouching over
text: CHANDRA. The disembodied front wheel rolls past them.
text: STUNNED, not quite understanding how or what he just did, he and
text: CHANDRA stand and start running. BEHIND them is a blurry wall of red
text: and blue lights. POLICE SIRENS grow louder.
text: THEY start running down the highway, then GREGORY yanks CHANDRA to a
dialog: stop.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Split up, into the desert, go!"
dialog: THEY split.
text: CU on CHANDRA. In bare feet, she sprints for the side of the road. The
text: highway is littered with pieces of the bike, and she stomps on a
text: twisted piece of metal that impales her bare foot. She falls to the
text: asphalt with a scream.
text: GREGORY turns and rushes back to her, even as a police cruiser is
text: bearing down on them, its V-8 roaring and the siren IMPOSSIBLY LOUD.
text: GREGORY drops to her side, only to look up into the blinding high
text: beams. He drops over CHANDRA, ducks his head and extends his hand
text: toward the oncoming cruiser and we drop back into BULLET TIME.
text: THE CRUISER runs into his hand and stops as though it hit a steel
text: post. The hood crumples in the center, pushing the grill in even as
text: the front quarter panels of the unibody continue around GREGORY and
speaker_heading: CHANDRA.
scene_heading: INT. CRUISER
text: THE ENGINE smashes in through the console, pushing the cops apart as
text: the glass windshield explodes and their seats slide forward into the
text: console, smashing them like jelly.
scene_heading: CU: GREGORY AND CHANDRA
text: WITH HIS HAND still on the grille, CHANDRA AND GREGORY remain
text: untouched, even as the entire police cruiser rips around them. WE drop
text: back into REAL time and see the cruisers body rip over and around
text: them. The grille and engine block and part of the mangled transmission
text: remain still against GREGORYS HAND. The cruiser was gutted, like a
text: banana shot down the center from top to bottom. It speeds beyond them,
text: silent now, flips and explodes.
text: THE ENGINE block is suspended a few feet in the air. It drops to the
text: ground with a thud.
text: GREGORY and CHANDRA get to their feet and run into the early morning
dialog: desert.
speaker_heading: CU: GUTTED CRUISER
text: UNBELIEVABLY, the driver is still alive... barely. The steering wheel
text: is smashed deep into his mouth, splitting his jaw open. Wet, broken
text: chokes emanate from his blood-filled mouth. His eyes flicker, and just
text: before they close forever, his body is seized by pain as he MORPHS.
scene_heading: EXT. GUTTED CRUISER
text: THE CRUMPLED DOOR is knocked out of the frame. WE SEE a black loafer
text: step from the vehicle and a man in an immaculate black suit steps out
dialog: slowly.
text: WE rise up from the loafer. As the other cruisers catch up to the
text: scene of the accident, AGENT BROWN watches. He looks into the desert.
text: A POLICE lieutenant approaches BROWN.
speaker_heading: LIEUTENANT
dialog: "Sir, should we pursue?"
speaker_heading: AGENT BROWN
dialog: "Withdraw your men and pursue the others. We have our own plans for
dialog: this one."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE (NIGHT)
text: The ship is quiet. RAZOR sits at the operator console, smashing the

scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT
text: CHOI is sipping coffee as he nudges the ship to a stop. He speaks into
text: his headphones.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "OK, try it here."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE
text: RAZOR halts his video game playing and flashes to a different screen.
text: Lines of code come pouring down the screen as he types, then hits the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE
speaker_heading: RAZOR

text: CHOI comes up behind RAZOR
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Oh my God. What are they - "
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Theyre changing the Matrix."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Call Morpheus."
text: RAZOR patches into MORPHEUS cabin through the headset.
scene_heading: INT. MORPHEUS CABIN
text: ITS dark, but quiet classical music can be heard. Hes not in bed
text: alone. NIOBES shaded form can be made out behind him.
text: MORPHEUS sounds awake, but looks anything but. He grabs the buzzing
text: handset only an arms length from him.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Im here."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Sir, you gotta get down here."
text: MORPHEUS starts dressing as he talks. He puts a reasurring hand on
speaker_heading: NIOBES shoulder.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Proximity alarm?"
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "The Matrix, sir. The coding is going nuts."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Be right there."
text: MORPHEUS hangs up the phone and jumps into his boots. He turns to
text: NIOBE as he works.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "It sounds bad. Theyre readjusting quicker than we thought."
text: NIOBE jumps up and dresses quickly.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Already?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "It appears that they are learning their lessons."
text: NIOBE shakes her head.
dialog: "Morpheus, how much are you going to tell him?"
text: MORPHEUS pauses.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Tell Neo? About his predecessors, I suppose?"
text: NIOBE, dressed, nods.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "He is the -"
text: NIOBE puts a finger to his lips.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Six came before him, Morpheus."
text: MORPHEUS shakes his head slowly.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "To me, none came before him. The Oracle told me I would find the one.
dialog: It is prophecy. You havent seen what he can do."
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "What if they toughen the Matrix code, like last time?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "There are lots of ifs. How about this one: What if we lose faith in
dialog: our cause?"
text: HE disappears through the door, leaving Niobe standing in the dim

scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE
text: MORPHEUS leans over RAZOR and CHOI.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Talk to me."
speaker_heading: RAZOR

text: MORPHEUS nods.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS

speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Yes sir."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "We have to download our mission specs. Move aside, I have to log into

text: MORPHEUS takes over RAZORS seat. The scrolling code disappears,
scene_heading: replaced by the small words: ZION.dtr1.mnfr4m3 LOGON.

text: cracking up.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "The mainframe? Haha. Its a joke, right Morpheus? Is today April 1^st
dialog: ?"
text: NIOBE appears behind them.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Its not a joke. We have The One. We must do it now."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "But theyre altering the code already. I cant even read it yet."
text: MORPHEUS turns and faces them.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "We have our mission, but its up to us to interperate how well do
dialog: it."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Morpheus, theres more ice in front of that mainframe than there is
dialog: in Antarctica. Well never cut through it all."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "You havent seen The One in action."
text: RAZOR looks dubious, and turns to the screens.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Can you hack in?"
text: RAZOR pounds the keys. The Matrix disappears, replaced by his program.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Getting you in is no problem. Maintaining the input/output and
dialog: helping you is the problem. Thats how they killed savior number four,
dialog: if I remember right. They cut the signal and trapped him in there."
text: MORPHEUS spins the chair, then stops it. Their faces are inches apart.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "We dont speak of the past."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Excuse me for dragging up painful memories, sir."
text: HE turns the chair back to the screen and continues coding.
speaker_heading: CUT TO: NEO
text: Hes standing at the edge of some equipment on the Main Deck. Hes
text: heard every word. He rounds the corner. The others catch sight of him.
text: The same thought is on everyone's mind: How much had he heard.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Morning. Niobe, wake the rest of the crew. Razor, whats the ETA for
dialog: getting us in there?"
text: RAZOR shakes his head.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "I dunno. Just gimme an hour, Ill probably have caught up to them."
text: MORPHEUS walks up to NEO.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Come with me."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: EXT. DESERT (DAY)
text: FROM FAR AWAY, we see GREGORY and CHANDRA hiding under the only bit of
text: shade available for miles, a tiny outcropping of rock. We sail in and
text: cut to a panning shot, scanning over the harsh ground, onto CHANDRAS
text: feet, clad in Gregorys boots, up her sun-scorched and scratched legs.
text: Shes collapsed onto Gregory. Hes in equally bad shape. Gregory leans
text: with his back against the rock, eyes opening and closing as he drifts
text: in and out of sleep.
speaker_heading: GREGORY POV
text: He stars at the horizon and the mirages of water reflecting the
text: jaundiced yellow sky. In the shimmering distance, a man appears, but
text: Gregorys lids shut and we see darkness. When he reopens them, the
text: figure is more clear. Its a man, dressed in a black suit. Even in the
dialog: distance we can recognize him. We want it to be him.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROCK
text: GREGORY can barely come to his senses as the figure approaches.
text: CHANDRA doesnt even wake.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT
text: We follow the figure at waist heigh as it approaches GREGORY. It comes
text: to a stop just in front of him.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT ROCK
text: GREGORY is fully awake, but he thinks hes dreaming. He reaches out
text: and pokes the black-clad leg of the immaculate man standing before him
text: - a man who doesnt sweat even in the sauna heat. He looks up, but the
text: glaring sun obscures the face.
text: GREGORYs voice is raspy as he starts to speak.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Oh my God. Its... The Man."
speaker_heading: MAN IN BLACK
dialog: "Ive been searching for you for a long time, my friend."
text: GREGORY lowers his head.
speaker_heading: MAN IN BLACK
dialog: "We need you, Gregory."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What for?"
speaker_heading: MAN IN BLACK
dialog: "To save our world."
text: GREGORYS FACE RAISES, THE MAN IN BLACK eclipses the sun with his
text: head, making a hallo of hazy sunlight around an all-too familiar face:
text: AGENT SMITH.
text: GREGORYS head drops back down. He strokes CHANDRAS hair.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Its too late. Were dead."
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "Do you want to live?"
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What for?"
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "A better life for all. Life for her. And for you, a chance for
dialog: revenge."
text: GREGORY raises his head.
text: AGENT SMITH grins. He turns away, and the desert landscape before them
text: turns into a soothing, cool, crystal forest lake. Smith takes a step
text: toward it, then turns and extends his hand.
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "Interested?"
text: GREGORY is mystified. Speechless, he drags himself to his feet,
text: hoisting Chandra, and steps toward the lake.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "This cant be real."
text: HE steps forward, only to have the image recede.
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "You this, dont you?"
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Yes."
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "Will you help us?"
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Anything."
text: CU: SMITH extends his hand. GREGORY grasps it. He lets go, and
text: collapses into the cool shallow waters of the lake edge.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE SHORE
text: THE DESERT is gone, replaced by forest, though still under the
text: poisoned sky of the Matrix.
text: GREGORY laps the water up, and pulls CHANDRA in, rubbing the water
text: over her face. Calmly, AGENT SMITH stands on the lake shore.
text: CU: AGENT SMITH. The humans are reflected in his perfectly still
dialog: glasses.
text: CHANDRA stirs and awakens, though she doesnt seem to see SMITH.
text: GREGORY, revitalized, looks around at the miracle, and up at the
dialog: mystery man.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Who the fuck are you?"
text: SMITH grins devilishly.
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "Im nobody. A Smith. Whats more important, is you. We need you,
dialog: Gregory."
text: GREGORY stares. He pulls CHANDRA ashore and stands to look AGENT SMITH
text: in the eyes.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "First you try to kill me. Now you need me."
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "Two years ago, Gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist
dialog: attack in the heart of the city."
text: THE words spark something nasty in GREGORY.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "So what?"
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "The terrorists were led by a certain individual."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "I know who it was."
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "We need you to kill him."
text: GREGORY laughs he turns to CHANDRA to check on her. Shes passed out
text: on the smooth grass.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What a bunch of bullshit. The whole government cant kill him, so how
dialog: can I?"
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "No one in the government can do what you can."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Fuck you."
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
dialog: "I believe we have a deal."
text: GREGORY stands and puts his face next to SMITHS
dialog: "You know, Ive always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal. And this
dialog: looks like a once-in-a lifetime opportunity. So, FUCK YOU!"
text: SMITH frowns. GREGORY looks him up and down. Hes got a few inches and
text: pounds on the smaller agent.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What are you gonna do, little man? You looking for a trip to the
dialog: fucking hospital? Fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic
dialog: surgery, you - "
text: SMITH delivers a chest punch that sends GREGORY sailing back twenty
text: feet. He tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at SMITH,
text: standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away.
text: CU: SMITH. HE removes his glasses calmly.
text: CU: GREGORY. He was stunned, but hes not out of the fight. Not by a
dialog: long shot.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "No man can beat me."
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Bring it on, pussy."
text: Pull back as he CHARGES SMITH
text: SMITH is ready to deflect the blow, but GREGORY dodges and bowls him
text: over, barroom style. With SMITH pinned below him, he slams his palm
text: downward. SMITHS head dodges the blow that pummels the ground.
text: GREGORY is screaming as he smashes downward with the palms of his
text: heels. Every blow misses the mark.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Mother fucker, what the fu -?"
text: SMITH bucks up, throwing GREGORY into the air. He flips onto his back
text: as GREGORY returns. The sheer force of his street-forged roundhouses
text: knock SMITH around as he blocks. Growing irritated at the untrained
text: attack, SMITH turns a block into a palm-heel that hits GREGORY in the
text: forehead with the force of a cannon blast. Momentarily stunned, he
text: steps back enough for SMITH to perform a roundhouse kick. Its like a
text: helicopter blade, smashing into GREGORYS head and sending him to the
text: ground in a heap.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Ready to change your mind?"
speaker_heading: CU: GREGORY
text: HE cant respond very well. Blood fills his mouth and his face is
text: mashed. A huge welt grows under the loafer mark left by SMITH on the
text: right side of his face.
text: SMITH crouches down by GREGORY
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "I can teach you to beat me, you know."
text: THIS interests GREGORY.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Help us, and both you and her will be free afterward."
text: GREGORY stares at the ground, then gazes past SMITH at CHANDRA.
text: Finally, he starts to rise. SMITH offers a hand, and GREGORY takes it.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "You know it, dont you? That theres more to your world than what you
dialog: can see, what you can rationally explain?"
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Yeah."
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine.
dialog: But first, you need to learn to fight."
text: SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece. GREGORYS eyes close and his body
text: SPASMS. He falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, he
text: stares up at SMITH.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Holy shit. What the -"
text: HE stares at his hands. He sits up, and watches his hands, amazed, as
text: he goes through a series of block-punches. He stops and stares up at
speaker_heading: SMITH.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: I know Kung-Fu."
text: SMITH grins.
scene_heading: INT. COCKPIT (NIGHT)
text: MORPHEUS and NEO sit together. The cockpit lights are dimmed down,
text: only the EMP pulse button glows. Outside the ship, in the dark mists
text: of the underworld, patches of eerie phosphorescent moss glow on the
text: walls. Occasionally, a squiddie will pass over the darkened ship.
text: The two of them watch the deadly outside world.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Were deep in their territory."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I see that."
text: MORPHEUS stares out at the night, deep in thought. He turns to NEO.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Are you rested?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Yes."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "You know now, that you had predecessors."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Yes. Ive heard things."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "What types of things?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "That there were others, like me, who you thought were going to be
dialog: special. But they ended up dead."
text: MORPHEUS nods slowly.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Its true. There were others. And I didnt tell you right away.
dialog: Because you were not ready."
text: NEO nods.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Does this anger you?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I dont know yet. So much has happened so fast, that I cant decide
dialog: whether or not Im angry, or dissappointed, or even if I should be."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "You shouldnt be, Neo. You are the key in the Oracles prophecy.
dialog: Everything forseen to come to pass, has, except one thing."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "What?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "The destruction of The Matrix."
text: MORPHEUS looks out into the darkness.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Your coming was heralded, and it is my destiny to prepare the world
dialog: for you, and to baptize you by fire. But from here on out, no one
dialog: knows."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Can we ask The Oracle."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Not in this life."
dialog: NEO is confused.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "No one has heard from her or her priestesses since the day Cypher
dialog: turned on us."
text: NEO is taken aback.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "But she must have known, if they came to her."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Perhaps she did."
text: NEO shakes his head.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I cant believe it. I dont know, Morpheus, if Im prepared for this
dialog: war. Im not a soldier. How, how are we going to win?"
speaker_heading: MORPHUES
dialog: "For decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world,
dialog: without a conclusion. Now, after nearly a century of war, were at a
dialog: standstill. The only way that we can see to win is by destroying their
dialog: source of energy. We have to pull the plug on them. We must crash the
dialog: Matrix."
text: MORPHEUS grins slyly.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Remember, when I told you, that Ill show you how deep the rabbit
dialog: hole goes?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Yes."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "I brought you deep, yet I no longer know the way. No one does. With
dialog: every second we sink deeper than before. You are our guiding light,
dialog: now. Your powers exceed mine a millionfold. I have shown you the path
dialog: to victory, Neo. Lead us down it."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK
text: MORPHEUS, NEO, TRINITY, CHOI, and NIOBE are on the chairs as theyre
text: being JACKED IN by CIRCA and RAZOR.
text: CUT TO: RAZOR jumps in the operators chair, his hands blur over the
text: touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the Matrix.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "Were going straight for the throat, people."
text: ANGLE ON: RAZOR and CIRCA typing like made at their keyboards. RAZOR
text: hits the ENTER key. They look on, transfixed with anticipation. The
text: screaming Matrix code grinds to a readable halt. The slap each others
text: hands and continue hacking.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "We have the advantage of surprise. They wont expect us to return so
dialog: soon."
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE
text: THE FIVE of them stand, immobile, around a ringing phone as their
text: minds filter in to their body images. They are dressed practically in
text: denim and leather, like blue collar workers. Their dress wouldnt
text: attract the slightest bit of attention, except for the padded coats
text: and tote bags filled with firepower.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Keep your eyes out for changes, theyre modifying things. Dial 0
dialog: for operator."
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE
text: MORPHEUS holds his celly to his ear.
speaker_heading: CIRCA (O.S.)
dialog: "And have a nice day."
text: HE drops the phone into his pocket. They turn to him.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Niobe, youre the liasion to our operators. Neo, what do you have for
dialog: a game plan?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Where is the mainframe?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "The Metacortex building."
text: NEOs jaw drops.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "What the fuck? Thats where I worked."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "And what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video
dialog: games? You were working for The Man."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Its true, Neo. Metacortex employs humans to write code for the
dialog: Matrix."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I thought I was working on a fucking database."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "They keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing.
dialog: Thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people. But, that
dialog: doesnt matter."
text: NEO recovers.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "How bout this? I just walk up to the Metacortex building and blow it
dialog: up?"
speaker_heading: CHOI laughs.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "What, by power of will?"
text: NEO nods. CHOIS smile fades. He looks to the others.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Hes joking right?"
text: MORPHEUS shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Well fan out around the city, keeping an eye out for you. If youre
dialog: able to accomplish this mission, well phase back into the ship. Stay
dialog: in contact. If you lose your cell, contact an operator immediately."
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE
text: THE five of them exit. They blend into the crowds on the street,
text: anonymous and quiet. MORPHEUS looks back as NEO, taller than most,
text: heads down the street.
text: NIOBE pauses next to him.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "What is it?"
text: MORPHEUS shakes his head.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Whats going to happen? If this is it, right now? The end?"
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "I cant even imagine."
text: HE grins and starts to turn. As he does, his profile matches the
text: profile on a WANTED poster stuck to the wall. Its a dark, grainy
text: picture of him, alongside photos of Neo, and Trinity.
scene_heading: POSTER: INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS
text: MORPHEUS glances at it, and continues on.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET
text: NEO walks calmly, observing the people that filter by. Men, women,
text: children, all oblivious to their true nature.
text: A dirty homeless whino, nose explosion red with burst blood vessels,
text: is staggering along the edge of the crowd, unseen and ignored.
text: Somehow, he catches NEOs eye.
speaker_heading: HOMELESS
dialog: "Spare a quarter, buddy?"
text: NEO shakes his head, but still stares.
text: ANGLE on the HOMELESS. He mutters something, and reaches into his
text: shopping cart to open a garbage bag. Its filled with twenty dollar
text: bills, thousands of them.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "How bout a quarter mil?"
text: THE homeless man is astounded. As he stands, speechless, NEO fades
text: back into the crowd.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST GLADE
text: SMITH and GREGORY fight in the glade. SMITH is always one step ahead.
dialog: HE is a cruel sensei, and doesnt pull punches. But with every blow
text: GREGORY takes, he rebounds and attacks again.
text: FINALLY, just as he seems to be gaining on SMITH, he takes a rapid
text: fire series of blows, and collapses to the ground, breathless and
dialog: beaten.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Fuck."
text: SMITH circles him.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Pain is only weakness leaving your body. When you are sufficiently
dialog: strong, you will feel no pain."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Tell me about what is happening. Whats wrong with the world?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Get up and fight."
text: GREGORY gets to his feet and takes a stance. SMITH stares at him from
text: a relaxed poise. He slaps at GREGORY, who deflects the blow and takes
text: a jab, nearly hitting SMITH on the chin. They circle.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "The world is not for you."
text: HE slaps, has it deflected, dodges a blow.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What do you mean?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Youre not human, Gregory. Thats why you dont fit in. Thats why
dialog: you have certain powers."
text: GREGORY takes a swipe. They engage, then push off one another.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What, am I from planet Krypton?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Not quite. But as humans continue to evolve, some are developing
dialog: capabilities beyond those of the average man. Reality-altering
dialog: abilities. I have them. Others in the Agency have them. And you have
dialog: them, too. Were all that stands between law and order, and a
dialog: terrorist dictatorship lead by the one called Morpheus."
dialog: THEY stop fighting for a moment.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "We need you to stop the terror. We need you to save our world."
text: IT sinks in. GREGORY is starting to believe.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "We need you, because youre better than me. Now push past your
dialog: abilities. You can turn you imagination into reality. See your hands
dialog: striking me, see yourself overcoming me. Fight, boy!"
text: SMITH comes at him, and GREGORY responds. Their fists and kicks are a
text: fast, then turn into a blur. GREGORY cant believe his own actions.
text: SMITH misses a block, and GREGORY blows him backward with a chest
dialog: punch.
text: SMITH, recovering, looks up. GREGORY looks around. CHANDRA is gone.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Where is she?"
text: SMITH stands. From behind his back he produces a baseball sized glass
text: ball. He tosses it to GREGORY.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Here."
text: GREGORY looks in the ball. Its a window to an apartment overlooking
text: the city. Chandra is in bed, waking up.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "She doesnt remember our encounter. Shes fine. Dont worry."
text: THE BALL disappears.
text: SMITH puts his hand to his earpiece.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING
text: AGENT BROWN is staring down at the ground. ACROSS THE STREET, NEO is
text: walking toward his building.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "Hes back."
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST GLADE
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Ill be there. Execute the defense plan."
text: SMITH turns to GREGORY.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Come with me. But only watch. Youre not ready to engage in a fight
dialog: with the enemy."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Why not?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Because if you havent defeated me yet, you wont defeat them."
text: SMITH snaps his fingers.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP
text: GREGORY finds himself alone on the top of the MAKARAO hotel,
text: overlooking METACORTEX PLAZA.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: The METACORTEX building stands across the street. NEO has been along
dialog: this road a thousand times, but in another lifetime.
text: NEO raises one hand, palm pointed toward the building.
text: CUT TO: NEOS POV: The building is a massive tower of glowing
text: shimmering energy, no more real than a three-dimensional polygon.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP
text: MORPHEUS and NIOBE stand atop a building a few blocks away, looking
text: toward the Metacortex building.
speaker_heading: ANGLE on NEO
text: HE FIXES his gaze on the building, then lowers his head and closes his
dialog: eyes.
text: THE building tremors slightly, like a heat mirage. Slowly, it starts
text: moving downward.
text: ANGLE ON: the first level. The exterior glass disappears, vaporizing
text: in a million crystal shards that melt into the air, exposing the hive
text: of office cubicles and corridors within.
text: The walls, desks and cubicles vaporize, leaving a few hundred people
text: - office workers, security, maintenance men, standing with nothing
dialog: between them.
text: The massive LOAD BEARING MEMBERS vaporize.
text: CUT TO: the bottom of the building. One can look straight through the
text: entire building. WE go through the empty building, passing dazed
text: people, until we pass out the other side, and come to NEO.
text: HE looks up. The office building is supported by nothing. Slowly, it
text: descends on the stunned people. They rush, screaming, some laughing in
text: hysteria, before the ceiling can come down on them. The last few flee
text: just before the ceiling touches the ground. The second floor melts
text: away just like the first.
scene_heading: EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP
text: NIOBE and MORPHEUS stare on in amazement as the building collapses,
dialog: floor by floor.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Hes doing it."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "I knew it."
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: CHOI and TRINITY look up in the air at the roof of the METACORTEX
text: building, standing beyond a block of buildings. It sinks toward the
text: ground as a flood of people come screaming around the corner.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "It cant be this easy."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Its not over yet."
speaker_heading: MANS VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: "Not by a long shot."
text: CU: TRINITYS FACE. SOMEONE plants the barrel of a silver Desert Eagle
text: .45 against her temple. TRINITY whips her head backward as it fires.
text: We drop into BULLET TIME as the flame and concussion blossoms in front
text: of her face, ripping her sunglasses off as she drops backward, pulling
text: a pair of MAC-10 Uzis from under her jacket.
scene_heading: THE MANS VOICE belongs to AGENT BROWN
text: CHOI turns, pulling a short weapon from under his coat. Its boxy,
text: with a short barrel the size of a soda can. He plants it in the small
text: of BROWNS back and pulls the trigger.
text: A CONE OF FIRE burns straight through brown, blowing steam, flame,
text: smoke, vertebrae, and viscera out a massive hole in his stomach.
text: CU on the weapon. It recoils on tension coils, discharging a shell the
text: size of a 12-ounce soda can.
speaker_heading: REAL TIME
text: What remains of BROWN flies forward. CHOI helps TRINITY up and the
text: retreat into the building and take cover under a window. Through the
text: window, we see military trucks, filled with troops, charging down the
text: street, toward the Metacortex plaza. After the trucks come rumbling,
text: black-painted M1A2 ABRAMS tanks. A black APACHE HELICOPTER flies over
dialog: the convoy.
text: CHOI looks through the window as he reloads his hand cannon.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Holy fucking shit."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Weve stirred up the hornets nest now."
scene_heading: INT. METACORTEX OFFICE
text: AGENT SMITH and JONES stare down into the plaza. The building shakes
text: slightly as it descends.
text: FROM the three streets that enter the plaza, military vehicles pour
text: in. Hundreds of troops discharge and form a L-shaped circle around
text: NEO. Tanks rumble in, and the Apaches whirl to a hover. Panicking
text: civilians rush out of the kill zone.
text: NEO stands calmly, continuing his work.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP
text: MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare from the rooftop.
scene_heading: EXT. METACORTEX PLAZA
text: The air rumbles as the building continues to gently collapse. The sky
text: flashes, and massive streaks of lighting blast across it like cracks
dialog: in reality.
speaker_heading: CU: SOLDIERS
text: They line their weapons on NEO. They are nervous
speaker_heading: PRIVATE
dialog: "This is impossible. Whats going on?"
speaker_heading: SERGEANT
dialog: "Just keep him in your sites, soldier."
scene_heading: INT. TANK TURRET
scene_heading: CU: TANK GUNNER
text: HIS eye is glued to the tank site and his trigger finger on the fire
dialog: button.
speaker_heading: POV: TANK SITE
text: The green crosshairs sit on NEOS chest.
speaker_heading: CU: NEO
text: His eyes open, but the building continues to collapse. He stares up at
text: a mirrored window, and somehow, straight into the eyes of:
scene_heading: CU: AGENT SMITH
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Open fire."
text: A WALL of flame and fingers of tracers bursts from the skirmish lines.
text: The tracers grow into a cone of orange flame bearing down on NEO as we
dialog: drop into bullet time.
text: THE bullets sizzle as tracers burn off their backs. The draw toward
text: him like slugs. Thousands of bullets fired at perpendicular angles
text: close in on him. As they draw close to one another along almost
text: perpendicular paths, they tinkle and chime and bounce.
text: The bullets come to a stop, glowing as their tracers backs continue to
text: burn. The world is in stop motion as the bullets stop, turn 180
text: degrees, and suddenly accelerate back at their origins. Faster and
text: fast they fly, until we drop back into REAL TIME.
text: THE SKIRMISH line of troops is ripped apart by a hail of their own
text: bullets.
text: CU: MACHINE GUNNER. With an M-249 SAW, he blazes away at NEO, only to
text: be shredded by his own bullets. A private takes a shot at NEO, and a
text: bullet slaps into his shoulder. REALIZING whats happening, he drops
text: his weapon.
text: THE SOLDIERS are dropping like flies. The firing quickly subsides.
text: NEO stands alone in the center, unharmed. He turns to the skirmish
text: lines. THE surviving soldiers drop their weapons, and run. Panic
text: ensues. Only a few officers, NCOs, and soldiers too amazed to think of
dialog: running remain.

scene_heading: CU: AGM-65 HELLFIRE GROUND-TO-AIR-MISSILE
text: The missile drops from its release claws and ignites, accelerating off

scene_heading: POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM
text: The missile flies horizontally over the plaza, then pitches up, and
text: back down at NEO. He looks at it, and at the last second the nose goes
dialog: back up.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA
text: The missile swoops up over him, leaving him in its exhaust smoke.
scene_heading: POV: HELLFIRE NOSE CAM
text: THE missile banks, panning across the city, until it locks onto the

scene_heading: INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT

speaker_heading: CU: PILOT
text: HES TOO stunned to move. Mouth agape, he can only watch as:
scene_heading: EXT. HELICOPTER
text: ITS BLOWN to fiery pieces, and comes tumbling down, landing on the

scene_heading: INT. TANK TURRET
speaker_heading: TANK COMMANDER
dialog: "Fire!"
text: THE GUNNER pulls the trigger.
scene_heading: EXT. M1A2 ABRAMS
text: WE drop into bullet time as a cone of fire - bigger than the tank and
text: the shape of a pine tree, blows out of the barrel, pushing the tank
text: back. From the fire streaks a HEAT round, white hot, leaving a laser
text: like tracer as it bears down on NEO.
speaker_heading: REAL TIME
text: THE TRACER stops in front of NEO, and out of the air the HEAT round
text: appears. Suspended in air, it shakes with violence. It accelerates
text: backwards, flying straight back into the tank barrel.
scene_heading: INT. TANK TURRET
text: THE gunner screams as the BREECH explodes, blocking our view.
scene_heading: EXT. TANK
text: The tanks explodes like a 60-ton hand grenade, plowing soldiers onto
text: their faces, consuming the unlucky ones close to it, and throwing the
text: 30-ton turret straight up, 10 yards into the air. It rotates, aflame,
text: and comes crashing down on a nearby commander and his radio man.
scene_heading: INT. METACORTEX OFFICE
text: THE EXPLOSION shakes the building. The scene below is a complete
text: route. Black smoke billows up from the flaming wrecks. The remaining

scene_heading: AGENT SMITH

scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE

scene_heading: INT. MAIN BRIDGE
text: THE GHOST program is loaded. We see 3-D images of Morpheus and the

scene_heading: INT. OFFICE BUILDING
text: SMITH STANDS alone, his comrades have disappeared.
text: THE glass before him shimmers.
scene_heading: EXT. OFFICE
text: THE mirrored glass of Smiths office wavers, then explodes towards us.
text: SMITH jumps, and we pan down to follow his descent. He smacks into the
text: pavement on his feet in front of NEO.
scene_heading: EXT. METACORTEX PLAZA
text: SMITH STANDS, facing NEO, about two fighting distances away.
text: NEOs concentration is broken. The METACORTEX building comes to a
text: shuddering halt.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Youre back."
speaker_heading: CU: SMITH
text: He nods.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "And you have a ponytail now."
text: AS we concentrate on NEO, and he concentrates on SMITH, we can see
text: more black suits marching up behind him.
text: NEO attacks SMITH. SMITH backs away slowly, blocking against a losing
text: battle and taking hits. Meanwhile, the MEN IN BLACK converge on NEO.
text: Just as NEO lands a smashing blow on SMITHS chin, three voices at
dialog: once shout:
dialog: "HEY!"
text: NEO turns, and SMITH pushes him hard in the opposite direction to
dialog: face:
text: THREE SMITHS! They attack at once, one going low and hard with a knee
text: breaking sweep kick, the other punching NEO in the face, and the third
text: breaking to the side and putting his toe into NEOs stomach with a
text: vicious side-kick.
text: They attack is in perfect synch, eight arms and eight legs working
text: like clockwork, striking their target without getting in the way of
text: each other. The attack slams NEO back, right into the first, bloodied
text: SMITH. NEO slams into his shoving arms, and stops as though he backed
text: into a brick wall. AGENT SMITH grabs him and holds him in a FULL
text: NELSON, exposing him to his three copies. The copies shift position
text: and attack again. Two stand together, left shoulder to right, and with
text: their combined arms slam NEO in the face, then step apart as the third
text: comes in. The THIRD grabs the shoulders of the other two and flips,
text: walking his loafers up NEOs body, and kicking him from below, right
text: up into the chin of his jaw! It snaps NEOs back with a spray of
dialog: blood.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP
text: MORPHEUS and NIOBE stare on as the fight rages.
text: MORPHEUS grips the edge of the brick wall edge. The stone crumbles

speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "We can only watch."
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA

scene_heading: EXT. ROOF

scene_heading: EXT. CITY STREET

text: NIOBE stands at the edge of the building and points down.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Morpheus, look!"
text: DOWN on the ground below them, theres a swarm of AGENT Smiths
scene_heading: EXT. STREET
text: The passed-out people stand, and one by one, MORPH into AGENT SMITHS.
text: It happens over, and over, until dozens, then hundreds, are marching
text: on the plaza.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA
text: NEO reaches back and puts his hands on either side of SMITHS head. As
text: hes being pummeled from the front, he squeezes and screams. His
text: screams are mixed with SMITHS. The agents head deforms as were hear
text: a sickening crack. Suddenly, the body reverts back to that of the
text: original owner, a security guard, and the head simply EXPLODES.
text: THE hold broken, NEO stumbles back over the body, with the three
text: SMITHS in pursuit. He somersaults, comes up on his feet, and jumps to
text: the left, putting one Smith in front of the other two. He attacks, his
text: killing blows destroying SMITH, smashing through his blocks. He falls,
text: and NEO takes on the other two, giving a kick jump that knocks both of
text: them away in one shot.
text: As he comes down, a wall of Smiths converges from all sides. They
text: stop, leaving a circle around him.
text: WE PAN BACK to view a sea of black-suited SMITHS flooding the plaza.
speaker_heading: CU: NEO
text: AS his hand passes over his face, it is refreshed, anew, perfect
text: again. He surveys the wall-to-wall SMITHS.
text: SMITH talks with his voice, times a thousand.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "NEO, leave the Matrix. You know not what youre doing."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Well, is that right?"
text: HE turns to the METACORTEX building. Its repairing, growing steel
text: girders and concrete skin.
text: NEOs face darkens.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "No!"
text: REALITY SHIMMERS as his anger strikes out at the building. The tops
text: floors burn, and then explode. The explosion rips down the building,
text: slowing, slowing, then stopping.
text: THOUSANDS of SMITHS are gazing up at the building, concentrating on
text: combating NEOs attack.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOF
text: GREGORY sees the building exploding, and runs. He smashes through an
text: access door.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWAY
text: GREGORY hurtles down the stairs, one at a time.
scene_heading: EXT. METACORTEX BUILDING
text: THE building is frozen, mid-explosion. TONS of pieces hanging in the
text: air, suspended only by frozen tendrils of fire and arms of smoke and
dialog: debris.
text: THE SMITHS attack NEO. They fight in a massive melee, dying in mass.
text: Meanwhile, the METACORTEX building pulls back together, the damage and

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP
speaker_heading: CU: AGENT BROWN
text: With his hand on his ear piece, he comes out the elevator door,
text: slowly. Pistol drawn, he looks around the corner.
text: MORPHEUS and NIOBE stand there, their backs to him.
text: Without hesitating, he advances on them, blasting away with impunity.
text: THE BODIES of MORPHEUS and NIOBE are wracked by gunfire and collapse
text: in a heap of bullet-ravaged flesh.
text: BROWN walks up to the corpses and kicks one with his shoe. It
text: shimmers, and then disappears, followed by the other.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK
text: RAZOR dials the phone. MORPHEUS picks up.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (V.O.)
dialog: "Yes."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Theyre hitting your ghosts."
text: MASSIVE attack of STATIC bursts on the line.
speaker_heading: RAZOR

text: THE LINE goes dead.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP

speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Theyre cutting comes, get to the access point on Laxe - "
text: THE line goes dead.
text: MORPHEUS signals to NIOBE. They exit the roof as he dials TRINITY
scene_heading: INT. EMPTY BUILDING
text: CHOI and TRINITY hide in the shadows of an empty room, watching the
text: battle. TRINITYS cell rings. She answers silently.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (V.O.)
dialog: "Lets go. Laxe Three."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "What about Neo?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (V.O.)
dialog: "We can do nothing to help him. Well only get in his way."
text: THEY leave the room.
scene_heading: INT. LOBBY
text: GREGORY stumbles into the lobby. Slumbering bodies lie everywhere,
text: slumped over desks, half-in chairs, on the ground.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA
text: HE exits into the street. The scene is one from HELL.
text: UNDER the neon sky, fires are frozen and smoke columns hang in the
text: air, still, like massive tree trunks.
text: The battle rages and surges, a thousand SMITHS pouring onto one NEO.
text: All around, nearly covering the ground, are corpses, destroyed bodies
text: abandoned by the agent. Men and women, of all ages and designs,
text: smashed, decapitated and broken.
speaker_heading: CU: NEO
text: THE SMITHS overwhelm him with sheer numbers. NEO is a blur, a human
text: chainsaw now, crushing or smashing them all, but they crowd on all
text: sides. The bodies pile up as they fall, and NEO finds himself stepping
text: up the rubbery mass of corpses. A few more smashed SMITHS fall, morph
text: back into their stolen forms, and NEO is KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD.
text: He cant take it. Choking, NEO struggles to free himself. SMITHS climb
text: up the corpse pile and drop onto him, pounding viciously. NEO stalls,
text: in shock, his eyes locked with the lifeless blue eyes of a woman he
text: just killed. She looks amazingly like TRINITY.
text: Perhaps for the first time, he is confronted with the consequences of
text: this war, and his mind seizes as the Smiths pummel him.
text: NEO goes berzerk! SCREAMING and fighting, he claws his way out and
text: surges into the wall of agents. They throw him back, and he cant kill
text: them fast enough. HE leaps upward, trying to fly away, but Smiths
text: cling on to him, and cling on to each other.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA
text: NEO struggles to fly, and as he does, hes pulling a stalagtite of
text: black suits, clinging like iron filings on a magnet.
speaker_heading: CU: NEO
text: HIS face is wide with fear and shock. He cant climb anymore, and
text: looks back down at the mountain of agents hes pulling into the air.
text: His face clenches shut as a scream wells from deep within him. He
text: starts to glow, and we jump back to see:
text: A MASSIVE orange, spherical shock wave blasts away from his body. It
text: rebounds on the plaza and throws bodies upward, even as it blasts the
text: Smiths away, leaving him clean.
text: EVERYTHING slows down as NEO, exhausted, tumbles out of the sky. On
text: his way down through the neon light, he passes bodies flying upward
text: from the concussion. NEO hits the ground, bounces, and lies still,
text: sprawled, as people drop all around him, piling up, like Satans
dialog: snowfall.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) DAY
text: THE sky and Matrix are still frozen. TRINITY and CHOI make their way
text: along cautiously, leapfrogging from cover to cover. They pause behind
text: a dumpster, and just before looking out, theres the sound of metal
text: tapping metal, twice.
text: TRINITY looks in the direction of the sound. MORPHEUS and NIOBE are
text: standing still in the shadows, near the end of the alley. TRINITY AND
text: CHOI make their way to them.
text: TRINITY peeks cautiously around the edge. On the other side of the
text: street is a phone booth.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Is it clear?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "I smell an ambush."
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Me too. Too quiet."
text: CHOI grips his gun and grimaces.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Too quiet? The world is frozen. Ill go first."
dialog: NO one likes the idea.
text: REAL-TIME suddenly returns. The lightning bolts in the sky suddenly
text: re-animate, thundering out of existence, making the four of them jump
text: out of their skulls. The sounds of the city suddenly flood back.
text: ON THE street, people stir to their feet. Everyone is confused as to
dialog: what happened.
scene_heading: EXT. PLAZA
text: ITS a sea of the dead. From its center, NEO emerges, soaked in blood,
text: gagging and gasping for breath. He stumbles over them. Shocked and
text: crazed, he glimpses the Metacortex building. Its in one piece again,
text: unharmed.
text: He falls against a smashed corporate art sculpture. He picks a cell
text: phone up from the ground and dials.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Morpheus, pick up."
text: We hear nothing but static. Disgusted, NEO throws the phone away. He
text: falls against the sculpture and looks up. Coming around the corner of
text: the building is a group of agents and soldiers.
text: NEO sinks down, staring at his hands. He catches his breath and
text: concentrates. The blood disappears, and he dons the suit of an
text: anonymous soldier in black. His face, too, seems to change.
text: HE stands and walks away. We only see his back.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
text: THEY weigh their options. Finally, MORPHUES gives the nod to CHOI.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Go."
text: CHOI checks his ammo and puts his guns under his coat. There are lots
text: of people on the streets now. Everyones in shock over what happened,
text: and the columns of smoke rising from the center of the city.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "And remember, kids, when youre in a war, never volunteer yourself!"
text: HE walks out onto the street, eyeing the phone booth and everything
text: else. A gorgeous Asian businesswoman stumbles into him. Recognition
text: lights up her face and she stops him.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: "Choi? Oh my God, I havent seen you for months."
text: CHOI keeps looking around, making his way to the booth.
dialog: "Oh yeah, sorry about that."
text: SHE turns angry.
dialog: "Sorry about that? What kind of an asshole are you?"
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY
text: TRINITY is looking around the corner. She pulls back into the alley.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Casanova just ran into an old flame."
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: "No. Fuck you, Choi, you just think you can come and go when you
dialog: please?"
text: CHOI is ignoring her now, walking straight for the phone booth as she
text: is having a fit. Tears are welling in her enraged face.
dialog: "Choi, if you have one shred of decency, if you even care about me - "
text: Inexplicably, CHOI hangs his trench coat on the side of the booth.
text: Standing behind it, he reaches around with his arm, keeping the coat
text: between his body and the phone. The WOMAN doesnt even notice the web
text: of gun harnesses and what looks like a ton of ammunition covering the
text: inside of the jacket.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: " - youll tell me why you dont call, why you, you, what are you
dialog: doing?"
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "The jacket stops fragmentation. Sometimes they bomb the phones. Kiss
dialog: me for luck."
text: HE grabs her to him and thrusts his mouth onto hers.
speaker_heading: CU: PHONE
text: His hand grabs the phone. We hear the dialtone, and he mashes down one
text: of the numbers of the keypad. The number tone rises in pitch to a
text: crescendo. WE pull back and:
text: THE BOOTH EXPLODES. CHOI and the woman are bowled over by the flame.
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY
text: They take cover from the blast as people all over the street are
dialog: knocked flat.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
text: THE PHONE BOOTH is obliterated. Miraculously, CHOI and the woman are
text: still under the cover of the jacket. THROWING the smoking jacket off
text: them, CHOI screams in agony as he grasps the smoldering stump of his
text: right shoulder. The arm is history.
text: THE WOMAN looks on, her eyes as wide as dinner plates. Shaking, she
text: falls back, still staring.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "You werent lucky."
text: MORPHEUS, NIOBE, and TRINITY rush to him, picking him up on his feet.
text: CHOI is screaming and laughing. Someone grabs his smoldering coat,
text: dragging it along. CHOI stares at the ex-flame as they cart him away.
text: His eyes are crazy.
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "You still want me to call you? Ha ha ha!"
text: AS they struggle down the street, CHOI starts to walk more on his own.
text: PEOPLE run from the scene, screaming.
text: CU - the four of them.
text: MORPHUES looks at something off-screen and frowns. HE pulls to the
dialog: left.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "This way."
text: TANKS and TROOPS are filling into the street ahead of them, coming
text: from around the corner.
text: THEY turn onto a different street. This street, too, is filling with
text: troops. Worse, its being lead by AGENT BROWN.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Tanks, or agents?"
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Tanks."
speaker_heading: CHOI
dialog: "Yeah, tanks a lot."
text: They break. CHOI stands on his own, and they run back onto the street
text: with the tanks.
speaker_heading: CU: TANKS
text: THREE ABRAMS stop in the street. Their turrets swing into place with
text: terrifying quickness and precision.
text: AT ONCE, they open fire with their main cannons and machines guns.
text: FIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of lead
text: down the street. Troops filed between the tanks pull their triggers
text: and dont let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away,
text: as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose.
text: WITH UNEARTHLY SPEED, EVERYONE BREAKS for the sides of the street,
text: except for CHOI. He stands amid it all as the tracers come closer to
text: his body. He raises his machine gun with his good arm, and lays into
dialog: the enemy.
text: TRACER rounds kick away from his gun, ripping straight back into the
text: wall of soldiers. His rounds deflect off the sloped armor of the
text: tanks, recoils pile into the flesh of troops. He rakes his fire into
text: the enemy bodies.
speaker_heading: CU: CHOI
text: TRACERS zoom in on him. A tank round blasts by, and the wall of air
text: kicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed
text: by another, blasts through the middle of his body. More and more
text: bullets smack into him, blasting chunks of meat and viscera out the
dialog: back.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (MATRIX) DAY
text: TRINITY and NIOBE take one side of the street, running and shooting
text: simultaneously. THEY reach the buildings on the side and NIOBE goes
text: STRAIGHT UP THE FAÇADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to
text: cover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets.
text: ON THE OTHER side of the street, MORPHEUS goes straight up the
text: building façade and starts running sideways, completely defying
text: gravity, firing downward at the soldiers.
speaker_heading: CU: CHOI
text: HE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his body
text: apart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck, and
text: torso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his
text: machine gun, barrel smoking, spinning in the air, firing still. The
text: arm is still attached and finger clenching on the trigger. It is the
text: last piece of CHOI to fall.
text: MORPHEUS climbs as he runs. In mid-stride he changes magazines and
text: stops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.
text: On the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing at
text: the mass of troops with two guns that never cease. THERE is no cover
text: and no reprieve from the DOUBLE DEATH from above. Most are still
text: firing down the street, or over toward TRINITY.
text: TRINITY runs up the side of the street. Her guns go empty and she
text: dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.
speaker_heading: CU: SOLDIER
text: In slow motion, he pulls a spoon from a grenade. Somehow, the metal
text: ring reaches TRINITYS ears.
speaker_heading: CU: TRINITY
text: She slaps a magazine into her pistol, pulls the action and comes out
text: from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade.
text: She fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group of
text: soldiers, flattening them to the ground.
text: A BULLET smacks through TRINITYS wrist, and the hand comes off,
text: popping like the head off a dandelion. Blood spurts from the severed
text: arteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.
text: ABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND NIOBE leap for one another. They catch
text: each others arms, fifty feet above the surviving enemy, and spin in
text: place, firing away. The tank commanders in their copulas blast upward
text: with their machine guns, but the rounds miss the spinning couple.
text: MORPHUES and NIOBE concentrate on the commanders, and cut them down.
text: THEY land amidst the carnage. TRINITY emerges, shaken, pressing her
text: coat to her arm.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
text: The other end of the street fills with soldiers, and AGENT BROWN.
speaker_heading: CU: AGENT BROWN
text: HE surveys the scene, and immediately draws and fires, running full
dialog: bore for the rebels.
text: MORPHEUS, Niobe and TRINITY are too close to the tanks to be fired on,
text: but the nearest one lunges at them. They climb up over concrete stoops
text: and over the side of the tank. They sprint down the street as the
text: tanks turn their turrets behind them, searching.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "The garage, hurry!"
text: THEY dive behind a corner as a tank fires. Morpheus throws the woman
text: forward as the tank round hits the edge of the building, blowing the
text: concrete and brick wall into a massive cloud of powder. Perhaps a ton
text: of rubble falls on Morpheus legs. He drags himself forward. Niobe and
text: Trinity grab his arms and haul him out of the rubble. Niobe shoots the
text: lock off a steel door, and they pile into the building.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
text: AGENT BROWN and his men rush into position around the building the
text: rebels are hiding in.
text: Suddenly, an unimaginably powerful engine starts, and as we stare at
text: the garage door, it explodes outward. A jet-black, hyped COUNTACH
text: explodes out onto the street, tires literally on fire as they throw up
text: smoke. It cuts through a few soldiers, hitting them in the knees, as
text: it rips up the street, the throttle going way too high.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - DAY
text: THE street scene spins before them. TRINITY is at the wheel, a broken
text: and dusty MORPHEUS sitting next to her. The tach is redlining as the
text: car rips up the street. Pedestrians dive for cover.
text: TRINITY holds her wounded hand to her chest and drives one-handed.
dialog: "Shift."
text: MORPHEUS does so, and the tires squeal again when she releases into
text: second, then third. In a few seconds theyre over 60 on the busy
dialog: street.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
text: Soldiers pick themselves up just in time to hear another engine - a
text: super powerful track bike, emerges from the burnt rubber smoke screen.

text: THEY rocket up the entry to a highway, ripping past cars by driving up
text: the breakdown lane. Once they hit a straightaway Trinity floors it,
text: and the speedo creeps up past 130 as they dodge in and out of cars.
text: MORPHEUS grabs his twisted, folded legs. He was literally poured into
text: the seat. Concentrating, his face knotting in pain, he straightens the
text: broken, fractured legs. He closes his eyes and concentrates.
text: The legs reform into straight, strong limbs.
text: MORPHEUS grabs the wheel.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Keep your foot on the gas. Heal thyself."
text: TRINITY pulls her bleeding wound from her arm. Her face tightens, and
text: she closes her eyes, fervently concentrating, shutting the world out,
text: which is good, as they suffer constant close calls as Morpheus
text: controls the wheel from his awkward spot.
text: When she opens her eyes again, she grabs the wheel. With BOTH hands.
text: MORPHEUS pulls out his cell and tries the line. Its still full of
dialog: static.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Any luck?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "None. Theyve killed city-wide comms."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Then the agents are out of touch with each other."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "They cant track us, but that gives them more time to destroy our
dialog: exits, and find the Neb. Well try the desert. Communications might be
dialog: working there still."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "What about Niobe?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "She knows to meet us there."
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - DAY
text: NIOBEs bike sizzles down the highway, insanely lane splitting at over
text: 100 miles per hour. The wheely bar is folded up against the rear
text: wheel. A dual stream of vehicles spit by her like giant machine-gun
text: bullets. She zooms out of view.
scene_heading: EXT. STREET (MATRIX) - DAY
text: GREGORY slows from a run. He looks back as police cars and ambulances
text: race toward the Metacortex building. He cant shake what hes just
text: witnessed. He looks forward, only to run into:
scene_heading: AGENT SMITH
text: GREGORY freezes, then bursts into questions.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What the fuck just happened?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "We need you, Gregory. Will you help us stop this?"
text: GREGORY is perplexed. Resolve comes over his face.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "I can stop this?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Yes."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Alright. But how can I fight him?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "I will give you the power you need."
scene_heading: INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (MATRIX) - DAY
text: THE building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that
dialog: no sane person could find attractive. The humble place is home to THE
speaker_heading: ORACLE.
text: NEO exits an elevator. Recomposed and dressed normally, he walks up
text: and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in.
text: A tall black woman, one of the Oracles priestesses, comes out of the
text: stairwell and recognizes NEO.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: "Neo."
text: HE turns and looks at her. She smiles, but as Neo looks at her, a
text: flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the
text: smile returns.
speaker_heading: PRIESTESS
dialog: "The Oracle is anxious to see you."
text: NEO follows her into the familiar apartment. The windows are covered,
text: and NEO and the priestess are the only ones there. The Priestess moves
text: into the dark kitchen.
text: NEOs eyes adjust to the darkness. He hears something squish as he
text: steps, and looks down.
text: The tattered rug is a swamp of dark, congealing liquid. NEO reaches
text: down and touches it with his fingertips. Its half-dried blood.
text: He stands, his eyes adjusted to the dark now. The walls are chipped,
text: covered in bullet holes.
text: In slow-motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. In walks AGENT
text: BROWN. NEO turns to the kitchen. AGENTS SMITH and JONES appear. They
text: all draw their .45s.
text: NEO stands still as they walk up to him and put their guns to his
dialog: head.
text: AGENT SMITH scoffs.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I was on to you the whole time. I only came in here to isolate you,
dialog: to destroy you."
speaker_heading: AGENT JONES
dialog: "What are you waiting for?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I realized, that I cant destroy you - "
text: HE nods at SMITH
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: " - without destroying the Matrix itself."
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "You killed me too easy last time."
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "And if you kill us - "
text: HE nods at JONES
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "Well only come back like him."
text: BROWN nods to SMITH.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I know."
text: SMITH breathes deep, and drops his gun. The others follow suit.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "So, why dont you take it all down?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "The Matrix?"
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Yes."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I can. But if I destroy the Matrix, everyone within it will die."
text: SMITH snorts.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "I take it the great Morpheus failed to mention this?"
text: NEO looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "How many people are in it?"
text: SMITH holsters his weapon. He speaks matter-of-factly.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Six and a half billion."
dialog: FOR NEO, the numbers are too huge to imagine.
text: BROWN scoffs.
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "Could you destroy us?"
text: ITS a serious question for Neo. But he nods. He knows his potential.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I could."
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "What does that make you feel like? God?"
text: HE is amused by the idea.
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "This is getting tiresome. Where do we go from here?"
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "IF you cut the power that the Matrix supplies to your armies, Ill
dialog: let you live."
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Idiot. We dont care about life, we care about victory."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Why?"
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: "So our kind... prevails."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "You mean, lives."
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "Who do you think started this war, boy? Your kind tried to kill us
dialog: first."
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: "But you didnt. Youre not as tough as you think."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Well see."
text: THE three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door
text: of the apartment. NEO opens it, and stops, his face meeting a flying
text: FIST. His vision FLASHES with the impact, and he staggers back into
text: the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet.
text: GREGOR steps into the room, tall and BAD.
text: NEO holds up a hand.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Stop! I dont want to fight you! Youre human!"
text: GREGORY doesnt answer. He smashes a side-kick into NEOs gut,
text: doubling him over.
text: THE kick carries such an impact that a pale concussion wave flashes
text: past Gregor. It sends NEO crashing out the window.
text: GREGORY stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the three
text: agents. Theres nothing on the street, twenty stories below.
text: The building starts trembling. We hear rapid-fire impacts, growing
text: louder and coming faster.
text: THE FLOOR EXPLODES as NEO crashes up through the concrete, throwing
text: the agents away as he embraces GREGORY in a bear hug. THEY blast up
text: through the ceiling. WE follow them up through three more floors, bam,
text: bam, bam. Each concrete floor smashes GREGORY in the head.
scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY
text: NEO and GREGORY SMASH through the roof, flying upward, like a missile,
dialog: past us.
scene_heading: EXT. SKY (MATRIX) - DAY
speaker_heading: CU: NEO
text: HIS FACE is contorted in rage as he rockets upward. GREGORY is barely
text: conscious. Seeing this, NEO stops, and flings Gregorys body violently
dialog: earthward.
text: NEO looks down as the body falls toward the city, thousands of feet
text: below. He turns away, just as the distant GREGORY is falling out of
text: sight. Just before he does, the speck of a person PULLS up, and grows
text: larger and larger as it returns. A contrail streaks behind him as a
text: rips through the air. FISTS FORWARD, GREGORY is like an MX missile
text: bearing on NEO.
text: NEO turns just in time to catch BOTH FISTS in his chest. Like a cue
text: ball striking another billiard, all Gregors momentum is transferred
text: into Neo. Gregor stops dead in the air as Neo is hurtled out of view.
speaker_heading: CU: GREGOR
text: HE is in shock somehow as he sees NEO flying away. He clenches his
text: fists and flexes his body, then looks down.
text: WE see the ground, thousands of feet below.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Holy shit!"
text: FOR some reason, he starts to fall. Even as he claws to maintain
text: altitude, his rational mind has caught up with him and is somehow
text: denying the fact that he can fly.
text: As hes facing the ground, NEO slams into him from above. Gripping
text: Gregor by the neck and his belt, he drives straight down. The ground
text: rushes, it takes one second to drop past a 50-story skyscraper. Neo
text: slams Gregor, front first, into the concrete sidewalk. They bust
text: through the sidewalk, into the sewer below.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER (MATRIX) - DAY
text: NEO stands. Offscreen, we can here choking breaths. Neo looks down.
text: Gregor lies twisted on a concrete slab, impaled multiple times through
text: the chest by snapped, rusty rebar. He takes one last breath, and his
text: eyes half-close.
text: NEO checks the pulse. Finding nothing, he leaps out of the hole.
speaker_heading: CU: GREGORY
text: HIS eyes blink, and he follows NEOs departure. Choking, unable to
text: breath with the rebar through him, he writhes. Theres nothing for him
text: to grab to pull himself off the steel.
text: His eyes clenched shut, Gregor levitates, by force of will, pulling
text: his body off the rebar. The corrugated bars make wet, sucking sounds
text: as the pull through his body. Finally, he gets to a twisted piece of
dialog: bar, and cant make it over. Hes losing all his breath, all his life
text: force, over one piece of twisted steel protruding from his chest.
text: WITH one last, wiggling effort, he works it through him. HIS mouth
text: opens wide, but no sounds emit, lest he recall Neo. Just as the end of
text: the steel bar enters his body and we cant take any more,
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY (MATRIX) - SUNSET
text: THE Countach and bike zip down a long, perfectly flat empty road. A
text: brown sunset plagues the horizon. There is no civilization in sight.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET
text: MORPHEUS tries his cell again. This time, it reaches the Neb.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: RAZOR and CIRCA are both operating the consoles.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Operator."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "Good to hear youre still there."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Jesus, you too. Where the fuck are you?"
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "About two hundred miles east of the city, on highway 315. We need an
dialog: exit."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
text: "Coming up on your left, ten miles, a rest stop."
scene_heading: INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "I dont remember an exit there."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Gimme five minutes."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Out."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)
text: RAZOR clears the screen in front of him and cracks his fingers. He
text: looks at Circa.
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Theyre OK?"
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Gotta get em out. They need an exit program."
text: CU: Keyboard. RAZORS fingers fly at inhuman speeds over the keys.
text: Data pours down the console as he blazes away. Finally, he hits
text: enter so hard it rocks the station.
text: RAZOR turns to Circa as Matrix code resumes its cascade down the
dialog: screens.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Yes! Did you like that?"
text: CIRCA just rolls her eyes.
scene_heading: INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) SUNSET
text: MORPHEUS phone rings. He answers. Its Razor.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Exit ready sir."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Check the phone for bombs."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: CIRCA looks over some data and shakes her head.
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Its clear."
scene_heading: INT. COUNTACH (MATRIX) - SUNSET
speaker_heading: RAZOR (O.S.)
text: "Its all set. Theres a pair of cops at the rest stop, though."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Not a problem."
text: THE Countach pulls into the meager rest stop, not more than a water
text: fountain, toilet house and phone booth.
text: A police cruiser sits, lights off, waiting to intercept speeders.
scene_heading: EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET
text: THE Countach skids to a stop, kicking up a massive dust cloud that
text: hides the car. We hear the door slide, and the massive black-clad
text: figure of MORPHEUS emerges from the dust.
text: An Uzi in each hand, pointed at US.
text: THE COP behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even
text: duck for cover. The safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips through
text: it, chewing the cop to pieces. His body thrashes in the seat.
text: MORPHEUS turns away. NIOBE pulls up on her bike and gets off, slowly,
text: obviously the ride had been a long one. Trinity joins them. Morpheus
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "I thought Razor said their were two cops."
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM HOUSE (MATRIX) - SUNSET
text: A ROOKIE cop, his face to young for a razor, is shaking as he peeks
text: through a crack in the door, through which he sees the terrorists who
text: just wasted his partner. He finishes buckling his pants, and draws his
text: service pistol, only to shake in pain as his body morphs.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: RAZOR and CIRCA see the agent morph as the code flies down the screen.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Fuck, fuck fuck!"
scene_heading: EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - SUNSET
text: THEY smell somethings wrong. They move, back to back in a triangle,
text: for the phone booth, weapons draw and looking in all direction at
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Niobe, you first."
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Bullshit, its my turn."
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Junior ranks leave first."
text: TRINITY enters the booth as the phone starts ringing.
dialog: Its the moment Smith was waiting for.
text: HE BURSTS out of the door, gun firing at the booth. Inside, glass
text: shatters, and blood sprays as Trinity is riddled with bullets. Smith
text: doesnt stop. He sprays for an eternity, even firing as she collapses,
text: phone still ringing. Her body slumps, smearing blood against the booth
text: door as it shuts from her weight.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)
text: TRINITYS body spasms violently against her harness as her life signs
text: go berserk. Shes not dead, but death is only seconds away. Circa
text: screams, but Razor is locked, staring at the screen with the intensity
dialog: from which he derived his name.
scene_heading: EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX) - NIGHT
text: MORPHEUS and NIOBE open fire. Smith shudders, flickers violently, his
text: body moving too fast to follow as the two rebels empty their clips at
text: him. The actions of the guns stop in the open position, barrels and
text: empty chambers smoking, as the last empty shells patter to the ground.
text: MORPHEUS throws the guns down and turns to Niobe.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Get her out."
text: NIOBE dives for the shattered booth, kicking away the starred glass
text: and answering the ringing phone. She pulls it down, and hauls
text: Trinitys destroyed body up, placing the phone to her ear.
text: TRINITYS head merely sags lifelessly to one side.
speaker_heading: NIOBE
dialog: "Come on! Go through, Trinity! God damnit dont give up!"
text: TRINITYS eyes flicker. She focuses on Niobe, summoning her
text: consciousness enough to make the phase back into the real world. She
text: starts to fade as we cut to:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK (NIGHT)
text: CIRCA stands over Trinity as the rebels blue eyes flutter open. Her
text: whole body goes into a seizure and she chokes and screams as she grabs
text: Circa.
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Youre safe, youre safe!"
scene_heading: EXT. REST STOP
text: MORPHEUS charges SMITH. Smith ignores reloads him, and sights in on
text: the exposed back of Niobe as she is reaching up to put the phone back
text: on the hook. As the sights rest right between her shoulder blades,
text: Morpheus grabs his gun with both hands. He squeezes off one shot, the
text: action freeze back on an empty chamber, before Morpheus throws his
text: hands up in the air
text: The shot ricochets clips Niobes ear and ricochets off the booth. She
text: hangs up the phone and touches the blood of her ear. The phone rings.
text: She looks at it, then back at Morpheus and Smith, raising dust as they
dialog: fight.
text: She leaves the ringing phone and runs to join the fight.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: RAZOR pounds the edge of the console as he watches the screen.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Crazy mothers!"
text: CIRCA has removed Trinitys interface, but shes having a seizure.
text: Circa can barely hold her down as she uses her teeth to rip the cover
text: off a wicked hypo.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Whats wrong with her?"
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Her bodys dying but her mind wont quit."
text: CIRCA straddles her and plunges the massive needle into her chest.
scene_heading: EXT. REST STOP (MATRIX)
text: Morpheus and Smith clash in the dust - punches, kicks, and blocks
text: coming too fast to see. Smith is wailing on Morpheus, but Morpheus
text: sneaks in a kick that separates them. They take stances a good two
text: distances away. Theyre about to go at it again when:
text: NIOBE sprints into the fight. Performing a flying leap kick, Smith
text: grabs her and swings her down, crashing her body into the concrete
text: with a sickening crack-thud. She rolls, fighting the pain, as Morpheus
text: flies back into action, catching the agent with a furious ass of
text: swinging kicks.
text: Niobe grits back the pain and rejoins her love. Together they assault
text: the agent, their speed almost, almost equaling his, their will capped
text: by the limits of their Matrix-bending powers. Finally, Smith resurges.
text: He lands a punch into Niobes stomach, and her body folds over
text: unnaturally, as if her back is broken. She crumples to the deck, blood
text: pouring from her mouth.
text: MORPHEUS screams and brings a hammer blow down on the back of Smiths
text: neck, smashing the agents face down and imprinting it in the
text: concrete. For a moment, Smith is still. Morpheus collects Niobe and
text: runs for the phone booth, which is still ringing.
text: ITS too far. Smith grabs him around the knees, spilling him forward.
text: Man handling him like he weighs nothing, Smith gets on top of him and
text: starts smashing his fists down into Morpheus face.
speaker_heading: SMITH
dialog: "I should have killed you the first chance I had."
text: Like an enraged silverback, he raises his fists together for one final
text: blow. But instead of striking, his eyes catch something. He flips
text: back, jumping, as a silver streak cuts through the air, a split second
text: too slow to cut the agents head off. Instead, it slices cleanly
text: through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.
text: RAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps over
text: Morpheus as he pursues the agent. Smith rolls backwards, gains his
text: footing, and retreats from the swirling blades of death. He turns to
dialog: Morpheus:
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Go!"
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: RAZOR is strapped into one of the interface chairs, his eyes closed.
scene_heading: EXT. REST STOP
text: HALF-DEAD MORPHEUS drags NIOBE to the booth.
text: Behind them, Agent Smith backs away from RAZORS dual blades, on long,
text: one short. Whenever Razor attacks, Smith backs away. They circle one
dialog: another.
text: MORPHEUS puts Niobe through the phone.
text: RAZOR forces Smith around.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Come on, tough guy, come got some Razor."
text: SMITH frowns and moves forward, but the whistling edge of a blade
text: makes him think twice. RAZOR holds the short sword parallel to the
text: ground, the long sword straight up. He hides his eyes behind the short
dialog: sword.
text: SMITHs back is against the sunset. The sun drops below a cloud.
text: RAZOR flashes the light off his short blade, directly into Smiths
text: eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.
text: SMITH, blinded, turns and backs away. RAZOR attacks.
text: IN the booth, Niobe is gone. MORPHEUS hangs up the phone. He can
text: barely stand up enough to reach the handset. When it rings he picks it
text: up. But he doesnt disappear.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Reload me."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "All right."
text: SHE punches some keys. MORPHEUS 3-D avatar flashes on a console,
text: along with a massive array of weapons.
scene_heading: EXT. BOOTH (MATRIX) - SUNSET
text: MORPHEUS disappears for a second, then reappears. Now he is perfectly
text: clean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and kicks
text: through the remains of the booth, walking toward the fight as he
text: produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat.
text: RAZOR keeps swinging at SMITH - and missing. Seeing his chance, he
text: runs back for the ringing phone. SMITH pursues, almost on RAZOR when
text: the neo-samurai jumps in the air and pirouhettes, swinging one sword
text: after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell.
text: IN the liquid world of slo-mo, the short sword cuts through Smiths
text: outstretched fingers, sending them flying. The long sword grazes his
text: forearm, cutting through the fabric and taking off a slice of flesh.
text: The tip of the sword slices through his suit, cutting his tie off,
text: digging about an inch into his torso.
text: SMITH collapses into the dust, his face a mask of blood and dust. He
text: doesnt try to get up.
text: RAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth. Razor
text: goes through first. MORPHEUS keeps his eyes and weapon locked on
text: SMITH, who makes no attempt to pursue. He stands calmly, and in a
text: dignified manner, wipes dust off his clothing as he watches Morpheus
text: step into the booth, and replace the phone.
text: It rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith.
text: SMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses, taking
text: advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy.
text: SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first
text: anger, then perhaps sadness. Hes lost. Hell be in the Matrix
dialog: forever.
text: With a quicksilver flash, his body reverts back to the shape of the
dialog: rookie cop.
text: THE young man is left standing there. He is filthy, bloody, badly
text: sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at
text: the carnage as his mouth simply opens and closes, reflexively, in
text: shock. He focuses on Morpheus.
text: The rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his body
text: broken and his mind blown.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: CIRCA helps MORPHEUS off the interface chair. Razor is triumphant.
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Did you see that? We beat him! A fucking agent! He gave up!"
text: MORPHEUS, unflappable, rises and rushes to the operations consoles.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Where is Neo?"
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Havent heard from him. The city is still cut off from the rest of
dialog: the Matrix."
text: MORPHEUS appears enraged. He looks at Neo, supine on his chair.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Why does it still exist? Why hasnt he destroyed it yet?"
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Maybe he cant."
text: TRINITY is sitting on the edge of her interface chair, looking like
dialog: hell.
speaker_heading: TRINITY
dialog: "Is he even alive? Is he captured?"
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "Last we saw he was trying to blow up the building. Havent locked
dialog: onto him since."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "What? Why not?"
speaker_heading: CIRCA
dialog: "Call me crazy, but I think hes masking his own displacement
dialog: signature."
speaker_heading: RAZOR
dialog: "His carrier signal just goes nowhere. But there is data going back
dialog: and forth."
text: MORPHEUS stares at the data on the screens. The Matrix lives. He
text: pushes Razor out of the way, and starts hacking at the keyboard at an
text: incredible rate. Its obvious Morpheus can handle computers.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "I found him once. Ill find him again."
text: We go deeper into the miasma of green symbols, swallowed by the
text: blackness of the screen, and emerge into:
scene_heading: INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT (MATRIX) - NIGHT
text: The apartment is luxuriously laid out and furnished. Gregory sits on a
text: leather couch, watching whatever on the tube with the sound off. He
text: absentmindedly manipulates a quarter over and around his fingers.
text: Finally, he stops and looks at the quarter.
text: Holding it between his thumb and forefinger, he folds it in half as
text: though it was a disk of bubble gum. He folds it again, then rools it
text: as though its a musket ball.
text: Chandra enters the living room and collapses on the couch. She reaches
text: points the remote at the TV, but Gregory puts his hand over it to get
dialog: her attention.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "So, you really dont have any idea how you got here?"
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "No. I only remember being on the bike."
text: GREGORY sighs.
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "Yeah, you took a pretty good knock on the head. Do you know how we
dialog: got this place?"
text: She looks at him, annoyed.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "Duh. We broke in. We dont own a penthouse."
speaker_heading: GREGORY
dialog: "What if I said we did?"
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: "Id say youre insane."
text: She finally gets the remote and changes the channel. The volume comes
text: on, louder and infinitely more tinny and obnoxious than anything in
text: life. Chandra laughs at the images as Gregory stares into space.
scene_heading: INT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT
text: NEO sits with his back against a blackened brick wall, staring ahead.
text: Hes in the belfry of an ancient, destroyed cathedral, among the
text: pigeon nests, soot, and bird crap.
text: FROM here, in downtown, we can see the modern, uptown section, with
text: its gleaming skyscrapers. METACORTEX still stands, illuminated by
text: searchlights.
text: NEO sits and broods. Isolated, his world turned upside down and right
text: side out in less than a week, his mind and spirit are a blank.
text: Again, he tries his cell phone. Static. He collapses it and puts it.
text: Just as it leaves his mind, it rings. The face flips open.
text: NEO puts it to his ear without speaking.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "Neo."
text: NEOS grim expression is melted by relief.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Morpheus! Holy shit! You wont believe what happened."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "I know."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I couldnt do it. Morpheus, theres a problem."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: MORPHEUS has the headset on. He stands and surveys NEO.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Yes, there is a problem. The Matrix exists."
scene_heading: EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT
text: NEOS relief fades into confusion.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "I know. Im sorry."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "And the problem is..."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Uh, its impossible. If the Matrix is destroyed, the people within
dialog: the system will die. They will all die. There has to be a different
dialog: way."
text: MORPHEUS doesnt respond.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Morpheus? Did you know this?"
text: We hear nothing. NEO can hear his own heart beating. Anger and
text: confusion add to the already heavy mental burden he carries.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "I didnt say things would be easy, Neo."
text: NEO sinks to the ground, shocked. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "No."
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: MORPHEUS isnt happy about what he has to tell his protégé, but there
text: is no bending his will. The others look on soberly.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "Neo, the Matrix... its not real. And its up to you to end it."
scene_heading: EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT
dialog: NEO cant stand the reality of the situation. Hes coming apart.
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "No, Morpheus, this cant be! We cant do this! We have to get the
dialog: people out."
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "Even if we could somehow get to them without cutting through their
dialog: defenses, theres no way we can rehabilitate billions of people. They
dialog: wouldnt even want to be woken up."
text: Neo is silent.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS (O.S.)
dialog: "You can do it. You can free us."
speaker_heading: NEO
dialog: "Why me? Why the fuck do I have to do this?"
text: MORPHEUS is silent for a long while.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: Everyone is watching Morpheus, and no one can quite believe what is
dialog: happening.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "You know what needs to be done. Time is short. Make up your mind. The
dialog: only way youre getting out of the Matrix is through its destruction."
text: Morpheus kills the connection.
scene_heading: EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT
text: Neo hears the line click dead. He cant believe what has happened.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN DECK - NIGHT
text: MORPHEUS drops the headset on the operations console. He types a few
text: commands on the keyboard, then addresses the crew.
speaker_heading: MORPHEUS
dialog: "No one goes in. Hes on his own."
text: He leaves the main deck.
text: Trinity stares at Neo for a moment, her face fighting for composure No
text: one looks at her. She walks away, then leans against the bulkhead, her
text: body shaking.
scene_heading: EXT. BURNT-OUT CATHEDRAL (MATRIX) - NIGHT
text: Neo closes the cell phone. He reaches to tuck it away, then pauses,
text: looking at it. He drops it to the ground and walks on.
text: He stands out on a finger of crumbling church, the night air all
text: around him. The city lights are alive below. He focuses on the
text: Metacortex building. Leaving him there, we rush to it until we dive
text: into the dark shadows of the very building, going microscopically
text: close, until the darkness gives way to the glowing green miasma of
text: quantum code. It fills the screen before we bust through into
text: darkness again.
text: TO BE CONTINUED...
