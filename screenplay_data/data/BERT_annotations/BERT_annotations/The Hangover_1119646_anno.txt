scene_heading: EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNING
text: It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop
text: the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the
text: exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn,
text: setting up a high-end wedding.
text: A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange
text: centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables...
scene_heading: INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY
text: A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in
text: this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table,
text: surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY
text: TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup.
text: Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in.
speaker_heading: MR. TURNER
dialog: Any word from Doug?
text: The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
text: about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, but I'm sure he's--
text: Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it.
speaker_heading: TRACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNING
text: Heat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust-
text: covered payphone in the middle of the desert is
speaker_heading: VICK LENNON
text: He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.
text: His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent,
text: his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Tracy, it's Vick.
text: Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967
text: Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy -
text: - and missing its passenger side door.
text: Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.
dialog: 
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey Vick!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Listen, honey...The bachelor party
dialog: got a little out of control and,
dialog: well...we lost Doug.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (her jaw dropping)
dialog: What?! But we're getting married in
dialog: like four hours!
text: Vick squints at the rising sun.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TITLE OVER BLACK: 40 HOURS EARLIER
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY
text: The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the
text: stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down
text: Highway 10 towards Nevada.
text: At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-
text: open shirt and mint condition aviators.
text: Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's,
text: handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.
text: Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax
text: attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his
text: khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.
text: Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school
text: linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the
text: back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this
text: is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude this is already the best
dialog: weekend ever!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh, did I show you pictures of my
dialog: kids?!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: No, dude, show `em.
text: Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them
text: to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this
text: group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.
speaker_heading: STU
text: Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is
dialog: already four! Can you believe it?!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (smiling at photos)
dialog: How cute... Good for you, man.
text: Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: The one on the left is gonna be a
text: hottie. The other one, not so much.
text: Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Jesus, dude, those are my children--
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (re: sunscreen)
dialog: Hey, am I rubbed in?
text: Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over
text: Alan's face.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, you're good.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Hey so Alan, are you and Becky
dialog: still together?
dialog: But before Alan can answer--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Of course they are, Doug. Jesus,
dialog: Alan's been dating Becky for 14
dialog: years. When they first met, Alan
dialog: had braces and soccer hair, and
text: Becky had a functioning hymen.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Asking Alan if he's still with
dialog: Becky is like asking the sun if it
text: still rises in the east.
text: The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: She still pressuring you to get
dialog: married?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Enh, we've moved past the pressure
dialog: stage...it's more like aggravated
dialog: assault stage now? Like at the last
dialog: wedding we went to, she threw a
dialog: camera at my head, called me a
text: closet fag, then ran out crying.
text: The guys wince, oooo.
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: But we talked, and everything's
dialog: cool now.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Maybe you could wear a helmet to
dialog: Doug's wedding.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Great idea, Stu. Thanks.
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: So Vick, how's business going?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on
dialog: bringing the next big dessert craze
dialog: to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Bavarian custard. We ran the
dialog: numbers, and it's gonna be bigger
dialog: than fro yo.
text: Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Isn't custard like a trillion
dialog: calories--?
dialog: 
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Our plan is to open three stores in
dialog: the Valley and then franchise it.
dialog: Shares are selling fast, but I can
dialog: probably squeeze you guys in...
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, man, count me in.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Me too, man! I love pudding!
text: Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Is this gonna do better than the
dialog: hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or
dialog: the topless sushi bar? Or the
dialog: mobile tattoo parlor--?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of
dialog: it's time, Alan! And don't come
dialog: crying to me when there's a Custard
text: Cabana on every street corner in
dialog: America and you didn't buy in--!
speaker_heading: DOUG
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: All right, all right, save it for
dialog: the party...
text: Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude! I can't believe I get to
dialog: party all night, and then, tomorrow
dialog: ...I get to sleep in! It's almost
dialog: too much! And FYI, if anyone gets
dialog: really drunk and craps themself,
dialog: just let me know, I can have you
text: cleaned up and partying again in
dialog: under three minutes. No joke. I am
dialog: a master of stool removal...
text: They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...

scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS -- MAGIC HOUR
text: As the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final
text: hill to reveal LAS VEGAS in all its illuminated splendor...
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. -- SUNSET
text: The Caddy rolls down the famed Strip. We are again reminded
text: of the absurd scale of Las Vegas. The 5,000 room hotels, the
text: eight lane roads, the 60 foot billboards...
scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT
text: The Caddy rolls up to the Mandalay Bay. The guys hop out,
text: exhilarated. Vick throws the key to the VALET...
scene_heading: INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT
text: The guys enter the glittering casino four men-wide, all
text: smiling, all exuding vibe. Passing WOMEN sneak glances. Vick
text: slides a drink off a nearby waitress's tray as they make for
speaker_heading: THE FRONT DESK
text: A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN waits behind the front desk.
text: Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on.
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK MAN
dialog: Welcome to the Mandalay Bay.
speaker_heading: VICK
text: Checking in. Lennon comma Victor.
text: The man types into his computer.
speaker_heading: FRONT DESK MAN
dialog: Yes, we have you down for a one
dialog: night stay in an economy suite--
text: Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "ATASHIR."
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Hold it right there, Atashir. This
dialog: is my best friend from childhood,
dialog: Douglas Billings. In two days, he
dialog: is to marry a woman of great beauty
dialog: and strong teeth, do you
dialog: understand? A woman of gigantic
dialog: bosoms who will give him many, many
dialog: sons...
text: Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed.
dialog: 
dialog: 7.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: My two other childhood friends have
dialog: travelled great distances, across
dialog: many deserts, to be here. This
dialog: isn't a night in a hotel for us,
dialog: Atashir: this is a family reunion.
dialog: Perhaps you too have family
text: situated great distances away, in a
dialog: foreign country with much sand?
text: Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter
text: and touches his arm, simpatico.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I have but one question for
dialog: you, friend: if they came to town,
dialog: would you put them in an economy
dialog: suite?
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
dialog: No, sir.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Well, then. I think one of us needs
dialog: to get back on his little computer
dialog: and find us a suitable room.
text: Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
text: All the deluxe rooms are taken. The
dialog: Dean Martin suite is available, but
dialog: I'd have to ask my--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case
dialog: of Cristal, two bottles of Patron,
text: four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of
dialog: skinless mangos...
text: Vick turns to the guys:
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: You guys want anything?
text: The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen
dialog: of those duck skewers I like so
dialog: well. He knows the ones.
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
dialog: And how would you like to pay?
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: American Express.
text: Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns
dialog: to Alan:
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude, give him your AmEx.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Don't worry, we'll hit you later.
text: Alan stammers.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop
dialog: being such a Jew.
text: Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT
text: The guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a
text: headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive,
text: complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and
text: multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: This is bigger than my house.
text: Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels
dialog: up in ten.
text: Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan
text: standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I am so not getting paid back.
scene_heading: INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT
text: Vick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing
text: his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: This is Vick.
dialog: 
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked:
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!
speaker_heading: (WINCING)
dialog: All right, I'll get it. All right.
dialog: All right--!
text: When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone,
dialog: trying to keep the call confidential:
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I said all right, dude! How many
dialog: more times you want me to say all
dialog: right?!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: All right. All right.
text: Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed...
scene_heading: INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- BATHROOM -- SAME
text: Doug brushes his teeth while, at the next sink over, Alan
text: selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries
text: kit and begins washing his face.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: So, you ready for Sunday?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but
dialog: I'm actually just really psyched.
text: Alan nods, impressed.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Tracy's dad still hate you?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Oh yeah.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Any closer to figuring out why?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Enh, I think he wanted more for his
dialog: girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who
dialog: makes 45 grand a year, and he's a
dialog: titan of industry who makes 45
dialog: grand a day, you know? I sort of
dialog: get it...
dialog: (beat, brushing teeth)
dialog: Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm
dialog: not sure you ever get past that.
dialog: 
dialog: 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: You got floss?
text: Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up,
text: starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something --
text: but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's
text: kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy Christ!
text: Alan quickly reaches for the ring--
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell
dialog: anyone about that--
text: Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE
text: BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Anyone got any nipple lube--?
dialog: (seeing ring)
dialog: Jesus would you look at the size of
dialog: that thing?!
text: Stu grabs the ring from Doug.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: It's Alan's. For Becky.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (clutching for ring)
dialog: Actually, I-I was trying to keep it
dialog: a secret, so--
text: Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Boy Party in the bathrooooom--!
dialog: (sees ring, snags it)
dialog: Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight
dialog: pink tint, street value: 26, 27K.
text: Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's
dialog: finally going to propose!
dialog: 
dialog: 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good
dialog: for you! Where'd you get the ring?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh, it's a family heirloom. My
dialog: grandmother smuggled it through the
dialog: Holocaust, actually. I was going to
dialog: propose to Beck this weekend.
text: Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well: now we have two things to
dialog: celebrate!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: "FRIDAY, 6:10 PM"
scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
text: The guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door
text: and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick
text: is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses.
text: Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the
text: door and the frame so they aren't locked up here.
text: The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the
text: stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless
dialog: stars... It's breathtaking.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Thish is so great! I love you guys!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Check it out, Stu's already wasted.
text: Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: We've only had two shots, man!
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You
dialog: used to be able to drink us all
dialog: under the table!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time
dialog: to get plastered anymore! It blows!
speaker_heading: (QUICKLY)
dialog: Am I a bad dad for saying that?
dialog: 
dialog: 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: What? No!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Because my dad was a bad dad.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: (patting his shoulder)
dialog: That's true, Stuey, but you're
dialog: different. We've talked about this.
text: Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Have I showed you guys pictures of
dialog: my kids yet--?
scene_heading: ALAN &amp; DOUG &amp; VICK
dialog: YES!
text: Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Little toast: to Tracy, the
dialog: coolest, kindest, most beautiful
dialog: woman I've ever met. I can't
dialog: believe she let me come this
dialog: weekend -- much less agreed to
dialog: spend the rest of her life with me.
dialog: I think both will prove to be
dialog: massive errors of judgement on her
dialog: part.
text: The guys chuckle, hear-hear.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: And to being here, with my best
dialog: friends in the world. There's
dialog: nowhere else I'd rather be.
text: The guys raise their glasses, touched.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: That said, let's not get too stupid
dialog: tonight, okay? I'm getting married
dialog: in 36 hours.
scene_heading: ALAN &amp; STU &amp; VICK
dialog: No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
dialog: dude.
text: Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above
dialog: the neck -- no piercings, no weird
dialog: haircuts, no facial tattoos. I
dialog: gotta look decent on Sunday.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Jesus, what do you take us for?
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows
dialog: off the night before graduation!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And
dialog: remember when I blacked out at
dialog: Homecoming and you wrote on my face
dialog: with permanent marker?! That was
dialog: awesome! What'd you write again?
scene_heading: ALAN &amp; DOUG &amp; VICK
dialog: "Respect me!"
text: They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Ahh, good times, man. Good times...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We'll be good tonight, Doug.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Seriously, man, we're your friends.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, we've totally grown up since
dialog: then.
text: Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Well then...to a night we'll never
dialog: forget.
text: They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: THE NEXT MORNING
text: Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into
dialog: 
dialog: 14.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE
text: THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the
text: totalled suite.
text: Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is
text: covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans,
text: platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon
text: Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc.
text: SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe,
text: the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM"
text: The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it
text: reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path.
text: Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.
text: The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all
text: over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the
text: couch, onto a pile of newspapers.
scene_heading: PILE OF NEWSPAPERS
dialog: OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!
text: Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find
text: Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick
text: pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Damn, dude, why are you retarded?
text: Both men are ragingly hungover.
text: A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Um, Stuey?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yo.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Why do you have a mullet?
text: Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too
text: hungover to understand.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What?
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You know, business on top, party
dialog: down the back?
text: Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.
text: Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom.
text: After a beat, we hear his voice:
speaker_heading: STU (O.S.)
dialog: Dude...I have a mullet.
text: Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:
speaker_heading: ALAN (O.S.)
dialog: Just give me ten more minutes,
dialog: Beck...
speaker_heading: STU (O.S.)
dialog: Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?
text: Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: Check it out: Alan slept in the
dialog: tub.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Get him up. I'm hungry.
text: Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER
text: turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:
speaker_heading: ALAN (O.S.)
dialog: Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!
text: There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.
text: Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan
text: stumble out of the bathroom.
text: Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night
text: before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut
text: off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Jesus, dude, put away your sack.
text: Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.
dialog: 
dialog: 16.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, and it might be time for some
dialog: manscaping, bro. Your bush looks
dialog: like Yanni.
text: Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What did we do last night?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments
text: later. Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude, why is my ass killing me...?
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Looking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator.
text: BING! The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE
text: waiting to get on. They see the guys and immediately step
text: away from the elevator.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: We'll...we'll get the next one.
text: The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We might not smell very good.
dialog: The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MANDALAY BAY -- BREAKFAST BUFFET -- DAY
text: The guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food
text: into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: This might be the worst hangover
dialog: anyone has ever had, ever.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I can't taste anything.
dialog: 
dialog: 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Please stop talking. If I don't
dialog: focus on eating I'm going to throw
dialog: up all over myself.
text: The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Hey... Are we missing something?
text: The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yes: I left my hat in the room --
dialog: thank you, Alan.
text: They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No. That's not it... There's
dialog: something else...
text: Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You gonna finish that cruller?
text: Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his
text: already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Doug. Guys, where's Doug?
text: The guys look around. Hunh.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah. He's not here.
speaker_heading: VICK
text: Probably left him in the room.
text: Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll call his cell.
text: Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Good morning, this is Stu?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: It's me, meatdick.
dialog: 
dialog: 18.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (to Alan, concerned)
dialog: It's Vick--
text: Then Stu realizes. Oh.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Doug's phone.
text: Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You calling the room?
text: Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then
text: he hangs up.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No answer.
text: Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Ummm...shouldn't we look for him?
dialog: Check-out is in like ten minutes.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have
text: Doug back to LA by five.
text: Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I'm eabing.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What an asshole. Stu, check the
dialog: pool and the casino, I'll check the
text: room and the gym. Maybe he's
dialog: working out or something...
text: Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And Vick, if you could keep a close
dialog: eye on the buffet, that'd be really
dialog: helpful. Thanks, man.
text: Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!
dialog: 
dialog: 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man.
text: Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes
text: him a second to realize what's wrong:
text: THE BED IS MISSING
text: There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.
text: Alan scratches his head.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: That's weird...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY
text: Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright
text: sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool.
text: Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's
dialog: totally cool...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GYM -- DAY
text: Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is
text: packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself:
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I hate you all...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS
text: Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: DOUG! DOUG!
text: Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.
dialog: 
dialog: 20.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GAY MAN
dialog: Hey Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--!
text: Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns
text: around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone.
text: Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan
text: talking to Atashir at
scene_heading: THE RECEPTION DESK
text: He slowly bow-legs himself over.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You find Doug?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No, I assume you didn't either?
text: Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
dialog: There is no Doug Billings at any of
dialog: the area hospitals, morgues, or
dialog: police stations.
text: The guys frown, starting to grow worried.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Maybe he went for a jog?
speaker_heading: ALAN
text: Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Or shopping?
dialog: The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Great. So we've officially lost
dialog: Doug. His wedding is in what, 22
dialog: hours?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Relax, it's Doug, he's probably
text: crashed out on someone's couch
dialog: right now. All we have to do is
dialog: retrace our steps from last night,
dialog: and we'll find him.
dialog: 
dialog: 21.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Okay, so last night...
text: The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Well, we started on the roof...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Right, that was like, 6ish...?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Then...I think...we had steaks at
dialog: the Palm?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah. Then...we played craps at the
dialog: Hard Rock...maybe?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: That sounds right...
text: Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Okay, honestly? I don't even
dialog: remember going to dinner.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I vaguely recall...doing body shots
dialog: ....at some point? Is that...maybe?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I'm pretty much blank after The
dialog: Hard Rock.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I think we went to the Flamingo
dialog: after that...? And then, I just
dialog: remember a lot of blue light...and
text: the overpowering smell of baby oil.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: So that was what, 10ish?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Give or take.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Was Doug still with us?
text: Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.
dialog: 
dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I
dialog: tackled him...for some reason.
dialog: The guys nod, okay, okay.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Okay. So we only have a 13 hour
dialog: window where we could've lost him.
text: They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets,
text: thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook.
text: He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.
text: A long beat of silence...
text: Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start
text: emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before.
text: They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...
speaker_heading: ALAN
text: ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37--
dialog: (reading it)
dialog: For 600 dollars?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: The valet ticket says we returned
text: here at 4:57AM.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: We drove last night?
text: The guys wince, jesus...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The
dialog: meal was comped for some reason--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Why do we have a matchbook from The
dialog: Golden Pony All Male Revue?
text: The guys exchange a look, alarmed.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Someone could've given that to us.
dialog: 
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (laughing, nervous)
dialog: Yeah, totally! There's no way we
dialog: went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!
text: They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the
text: blackjack table.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I think we should call Tracy.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Absolutely not.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What if Doug called her? She might
dialog: know where he is.
text: Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Of course you're with Alan, you're
dialog: both gutless cowards. But we're not
dialog: calling Tracy. You never call the
text: bride from the bachelor party.
dialog: Ever. If my balls were on fire and
text: Tracy was sitting next door with a
dialog: tall glass of water, I still
dialog: wouldn't call her. It's a rule.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: But shouldn't we at least tell her
dialog: we're gonna be getting home late?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: She has a watch, she'll figure it
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I think I'm beginning to see why
dialog: you're always single.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: And I think I'm beginning to see
dialog: why you're always a douche--
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (clutching his ass)
dialog: Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh
dialog: my God -- like right now. Come on.
dialog: 
dialog: 24.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Jesus, what is it?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed
text: men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I can't believe we're doing this.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You don't have to look up my butt,
dialog: just at it. Something is terribly,
dialog: terribly wrong...
text: Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.
dialog: 
text: He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I
text: ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Sweet mother of mercy...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Who's Roger?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I-I-I don't know?! What do you
dialog: think it means?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What do I think it means? Well,
dialog: Stuart, your ass is all torn up and
dialog: you're wearing thong underwear
dialog: declaring your love for another
dialog: dude -- I don't think we need the
dialog: CSI team for this one! You got
dialog: reamed last night, man!
text: Stu covers his mouth, horrified!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I'm sure there's a perfectly
dialog: logical explanation for this...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Really?! What?!
text: Alan tries to think of one.
dialog: 
dialog: 25.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, maybe there isn't.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Look, I'm sure Roger is a very
dialog: nice, considerate young man--
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near
dialog: cool enough.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (gasping, realizing)
dialog: I do watch Dancing With The Stars
dialog: with the kids!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh god, that doesn't mean you're
dialog: gay.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: But sort of...it does?
text: Stu grows increasingly frantic.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And once, I caught myself gazing at
text: a topless photo of David Beckham!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: So what, he's a great-looking dude--
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: And then I had those weird feelings
dialog: for Vick that time in middle
dialog: school, remember?!
text: Everyone stops. Vick most of all.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Um, what?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, that weekend we were all
dialog: camping -- I told you this.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, no you didn't.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I didn't?
dialog: 
dialog: 26.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I think I'd remember, dude.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, I think we'd all remember.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah. I had weird feelings for you
dialog: that weekend. Like really hot,
dialog: really gay feelings. But then they
dialog: went away.
text: Vick is just looking at him, stunned.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Wait -- I was there that weekend.
dialog: Did you have gay feelings for me?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Unbelievable.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What?! I was a good-looking kid!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Please, you're so not his type!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Wait, what?
text: Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room
text: and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Look, Stu, one homosexual
dialog: experience doesn't mean you're
dialog: permanently gay, okay? A lot of
dialog: guys test the waters.
text: ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: All right, we're scaring the
dialog: children. Let's go.
text: The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Wait -- so have either of you
dialog: tested the waters?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No! We're not gay!
dialog: 
dialog: 27.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto
speaker_heading: THE CASINO FLOOR
text: The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit.
text: Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How am I going to tell my wife?
speaker_heading: VICK
text: Quickly, and from a great distance.
text: Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Jesus, what kind of father am I?
text: Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time
text: it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (really scared)
dialog: You think Erin will try to take the
dialog: kids--?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh...my...God.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (turning, annoyed)
dialog: What now?
text: Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger
text: is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (not getting it)
dialog: Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna
dialog: have a field day with this.
text: Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and
text: starts back towards Alan.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Oh my God... Oh my God...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: What's the big--?
dialog: (finally realizing)
dialog: Oh! OH! OH!
dialog: 
dialog: 28.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily
text: takes off the massive unicorn ring.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe it's not a wedding ring?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (reading inscription)
dialog: "To My Noble Husband, Alan."
text: The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: This is worse than my underwear!
text: Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: "Now &amp; Forever Wedding Chapel."
text: They guys exchange a look.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, at least it's a lead.
text: Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot
text: machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over,
text: disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAY
text: The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands
text: his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: So, we go to the wedding chapel, we
dialog: find out what we did with Doug, we
dialog: recover him, and we're back in LA
dialog: before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
text: No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Check it out, some idiot threw his
text: bed out the window last night.
text: Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel
text: with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: That was us, dude.
dialog: 
dialog: 29.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's
dialog: room.
speaker_heading: STU
speaker_heading: (FROWNING)
dialog: Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good
dialog: reason for doing it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: You think they'll charge us for--?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, Stu, I really do.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be
dialog: cool...
text: Just then the Valet drives up in
scene_heading: VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC
text: The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-
text: roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side
text: door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood.
text: The guys just stand there, agape.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You okay, Vick?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I'm not emotionally prepared to
dialog: talk about it just yet, Stuart, but
dialog: thank you.
text: Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: THE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP
text: in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS,
text: even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each
text: quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Seriously: what am I gonna tell
dialog: Becky? For 14 years she's been
dialog: begging me to get married...
dialog: 
dialog: 30.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Well, now you did. Just not to her.
text: Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Wait, is that homeless guy wearing
dialog: Doug's shirt?
text: The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk
text: in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before.
text: Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Naaah.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, that was a different shirt.
text: Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
text: Left turn.
text: Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so
text: as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...
scene_heading: EXT. NOW &amp; FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY
text: Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a
text: laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now &amp; Forever Wedding
text: Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front.
scene_heading: INT. NOW &amp; FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY
text: Everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white
text: plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white
text: plastic chairs. The guys enter.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What if they don't remember us--?
scene_heading: VOICE BEHIND THEM
speaker_heading: AAAAYYYYY!
text: The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE
text: GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread
text: wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: How are you, you dumb bastards?!
dialog: 
dialog: 31.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it
text: shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: CARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE!
text: ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!
dialog: (to the guys)
dialog: You here to pick up your wedding
dialog: photos?!
dialog: Alan starts to decline, when--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Does the pope wear a funny hat?!
dialog: Let's do this thing!
text: Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: And where is Chastity today?
text: They all sit on white plastic chairs.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: W-Who's...Chastity?
speaker_heading: STEVE
speaker_heading: (LAUGHING)
dialog: Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just
dialog: breaking my balls!
text: Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts
text: laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick
text: eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony,
dialog: wasn't it?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Hand to God, I've never seen two
dialog: people more in love!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Sadly, I believe you...
text: The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night
text: before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all
text: wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor.
text: They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk.
text: The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's
text: having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.
dialog: 
dialog: 32.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello, Chastity...
text: Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I am never...ever...drinking again.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Jesus, she is stacked.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu, please, show some class.
dialog: That's Alan's wife you're talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (to Alan, guilty)
dialog: Sorry. She looks really nice.
text: But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and
text: Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a
text: rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: We got a unicorn?!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double
dialog: Camelot Package.
text: Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: A-And how much did that cost?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: 7 thousand dollars.
text: Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!
speaker_heading: STEVE (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, you didn't want to get it,
dialog: either, but Vick insisted.
text: Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I'm gonna kill you!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (fending him off)
dialog: You can't put a pricetag on love,
dialog: Alan! OW! You just can't!
dialog: 
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.
scene_heading: VOICE BEHIND THEM
scene_heading: STOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY!
text: The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA,
text: 40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and
text: dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins:
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts!
text: She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.
speaker_heading: CARLA (CONT'D)
dialog: Good to see you, you stupid mooks!
text: Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick,
text: on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: It's good to be seen, Carla. It's
dialog: good to be seen.
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: I brought the rest of your package.
text: Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.
speaker_heading: CARLA (CONT'D)
dialog: First: Two dozen commuter mugs...
text: She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo
text: emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No way! Awesome!
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: A hundred DVDs of the ceremony...
text: She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: For you and Chastity to watch on
dialog: your anniversary...
dialog: Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.
speaker_heading: CARLA
text: The velvet wall hanging...
text: She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of
text: Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space.
dialog: 
dialog: 34.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: And it looks like real velvet,
dialog: Alan, so no machine wash, okay?
speaker_heading: CARLA
dialog: And the big finish:
text: Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...
text: Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas-
text: relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just
text: closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: STU
speaker_heading: HOLY CRAP!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I want a shield!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a
dialog: shield?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I don't suppose you have any sort
dialog: of return policy, do you?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Um...if you know another couple who
dialog: looks exactly like you guys, and
dialog: who want two dozen commuter mugs, a
text: wall hanging, and a shield...sure.
text: Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it
text: without looking at the Caller ID.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What.
text: We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, hey Becky! Hi!
text: He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: That's his girlfriend of 14 years.
dialog: I'm sure this'll only take a
dialog: minute...
dialog: 
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan
text: tries to talk to his furious girlfriend.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
speaker_heading: BECKY
text: in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase.
text: She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Can you tell me why all the goddamn
dialog: credit cards are maxed out?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No! I-I have no idea--!
text: Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR
scene_heading: BEST MAN, DUDE!
speaker_heading: STU
text: YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER!
dialog: WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!
text: Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: "Your best man?!" What's going on
dialog: there, Alan?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS
dialog: ARE JUST BEING DICKS!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET-
scene_heading: SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I
dialog: BOGART A FEW?!
text: Alan furiously flips them off, shut up!
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: I really don't appreciate being
dialog: mocked right now, Alan, especially
dialog: about wedding-related issues. You
dialog: know how hard this weekend is going
dialog: to be for me.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I know, baby! I know--
dialog: 
dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: So you'll call the credit card
dialog: company and straighten this out?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yes. I will. I promise.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Okay. Okay...
dialog: (beat, calming)
dialog: Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll
dialog: see you soon, okay? Love you.
text: But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making
text: out with his blonde bombshell wife...
speaker_heading: BECKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yes, no, I love you too!
text: Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable.
text: STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, did she ask about us?!
text: Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP
text: through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan
text: sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick
dialog: found a great clue.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Turns out Doug was in all the
dialog: wedding photos, which means -- if
dialog: the time stamp was right -- we had
dialog: him in our possession until 11 pm.
dialog: 
dialog: 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That's another hour of last night
dialog: that we can account for. Isn't that
dialog: great?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (bitterly sarcastic)
dialog: Amazing.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Hey, Steve, you don't happen to
dialog: know where we were heading when we
dialog: left here last night, do you?
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Well, the Double Camelot Package
dialog: comes with a five course wedding
dialog: feast, so I assume you went there.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Great -- where was the feast?
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ALAN (V.O.)
dialog: I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!
scene_heading: INT. VICK'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap. Vick is busy
text: trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot.
text: Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan
text: seethes up front.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Your negativity is like a little
text: black cloud over our car, Alan.
dialog: You've got to let go of this.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The
dialog: fact that I married a complete
dialog: stranger last night? Or that my
dialog: girlfriend's about to leave me? Or
dialog: that I'm broke? Which one?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You're broke? I thought you were
speaker_heading: LOADED--
dialog: 
dialog: 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I know you think it's like
dialog: terminally uncool to be in a
dialog: committed relationship, Vick, but I
dialog: actually love Becky, okay?
speaker_heading: (SINCERE)
dialog: I-I honestly don't know what I'd do
dialog: without her...I really don't...
text: Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Alan. Honey. Have you considered,
dialog: even for a second, that maybe the
dialog: things we do when we're drunk are
dialog: what we secretly want to do?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (dripping with sarcasm)
dialog: Yeah, no, you're absolutely right,
dialog: Vick, I've always secretly wanted
text: to marry a bottle blonde with big
dialog: fake melon tits named Chastity!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I ain't mad atcha, dude...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't
dialog: have the balls to leave Becky, and
dialog: this is your way of getting her to
dialog: leave you.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I was going to propose to her this
dialog: weekend, you jackass!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: All the more reason to freak out.
text: Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick
text: nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but
dialog: you've always had a major pole up
dialog: your ass. Maybe last night was your
dialog: inner cool person trying to get out-
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I swear to God, Vick, if you say
dialog: one more word to me, I will destroy
dialog: you.
dialog: 
dialog: 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Guys, come on, let's not use our
dialog: angry words--
speaker_heading: SMASH!
text: A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump!
text: Vick slams on the brakes!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What the--?!
text: They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian
text: shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on
text: either side of the car. And they look pissed.
speaker_heading: KALOLO FANALUA
text: Get out of the car, Vick.
text: Stu and Alan recoil in terror.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Who are these guys?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu, please.
dialog: (to Kalolo Fanalua)
dialog: I think there's been some sort of
dialog: mistake, Mister...?
speaker_heading: KALOLO FANALUA
dialog: I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get
dialog: The Hell Outta The Car, and this is
dialog: my associate, Mr. Smash You In The
dialog: Teeth If You Say Another Word.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (beat, to Alan)
dialog: Those so aren't their real names.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Vick, don't be a dick--!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Alan? Relax. These men aren't going
dialog: to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.
dialog: SMASH! SMASH! SMASH!
text: Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car!
speaker_heading: KALOLO FANALUA
dialog: We're from Guam, bitch! Now get
dialog: outta the car!
dialog: 
dialog: 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat!
dialog: Jesus, why is everyone trying to
dialog: kill my car...?
text: Vick undoes his seatbelt and reaches for his door handle.
text: Kikiolani lowers his bat -- and Vick throws the door open,
text: right into his nuts! The huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and
text: Vick slams his door shut and
text: FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE!
text: The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the
text: street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out
text: of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement...
scene_heading: EXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS
text: Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge
text: SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Why'd you do that?!
speaker_heading: VICK
speaker_heading: (INCREDULOUS)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Maybe they just wanted to talk!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I honestly don't know how you two
dialog: are still alive.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Do you think we stole something
dialog: from them last night?!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh my god I am such a bad dad!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (producing cellphone)
dialog: I'm calling the police. This is
dialog: getting way out of control--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No! No cops!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: "No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty
dialog: Cent?!
dialog: 
dialog: 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, Vick, what's going on?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Nothing! I just think we should
dialog: focus on finding Doug and not get
dialog: distracted by every little thing!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Every little thing?! We were just
dialog: assaulted by the Yakuza!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Oh please, those guys are from
dialog: Guam. Get a grip.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: They knew your name, Vick! Which
dialog: means they probably know who Stu
dialog: and I are, too!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: If anything ever happened to my
dialog: family, Vick...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Fine. Let's just go back to the
dialog: hotel -- Doug is probably back from
dialog: wherever he spent the night, we'll
dialog: get him, we'll straighten out
dialog: whatever we did to those angry
dialog: Samoans, then we'll get the hell
dialog: back to LA, okay? Left turn.
text: Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan
text: hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM"
scene_heading: INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY
text: The boys hurry into their room, stressed.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Doug? Doug?
text: Alan quickly checks the room phone.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No messages.
dialog: 
dialog: 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Come on, let's toss the place.
text: Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while
text: Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms...
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM
text: Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes,
text: looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on
text: the ground. Picks it up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested
dialog: 30 grand in your custard store last
dialog: night!
text: Vick calls from the other bedroom.
speaker_heading: VICK (O.S.)
dialog: Smart move, man.
text: Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!
text: Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the
text: closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring
text: away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Whoa.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You think she's what those Guamian
dialog: dudes wanted?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No. I think she's Alan's wife.
text: Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet-
text: sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy?
text: A second later Alan enters, what's up?
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
text: Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan.
text: Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor,
text: her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God.
dialog: 
dialog: 43.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What...what am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Wake her up, man!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Why me?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Because she's your spouse, dude!
text: Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared,
text: he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Pinch her tit. It always works.
text: Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets
text: out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up,
text: terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Dang, did I sleep in the closet
dialog: again...?
text: Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles,
dialog: recognizing them:
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh hey, guys! What's up?
text: She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a
text: snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face.
text: The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the
dialog: cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: Morning, honey...
text: She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie.
text: Beat. Alan is speechless.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: She seems really cool.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, I really like her, man.
dialog: 
dialog: 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- LIVING ROOM
text: Chastity gathers her belongings -- jacket, purse, G string --
text: from around the totalled living room. The guys file in.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: So, um, did you take Alan's name?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish
dialog: now--?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Listen to me. Just...did we, or did
dialog: we not, have sex last night?
dialog: Alan braces, please say no, please say no...
dialog: Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Well...ya?
text: Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: But we waited til we were married.
text: Alan GROANS.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What a responsible, upstanding
dialog: young Jew. They don't make `em like
dialog: that anymore, am I right?
text: Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: I know -- he even wanted to use a
dialog: rubber.
text: Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: It's cool, I sponge.
text: Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Can someone...please open a window?
dialog: 
dialog: 45.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Stu turns and tries to open a window. No luck.
speaker_heading: STU
text: They don't open.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: So you guys don't remember any of
dialog: last night?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, not so much.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Hey, been there before, right?
dialog: (grabbing her sizable bra)
dialog: Sucks, though. The wedding was
dialog: really fun. I'm bummed you don't
dialog: remember it, Alan.
text: She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude, I think your wife's mad at
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You don't happen to remember what
dialog: time we met you last night, do you?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Sure, we met at the bar at like
dialog: 10:00? Then we got married on my
dialog: smoke break, which was like 11:00?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: It's the All-American love story,
dialog: isn't it? What happened next?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Well, I had to go back to work. But
dialog: when I got off at 5:30, I met up
dialog: with you guys back here.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: And was Doug with us then?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Interesting... Do you have any idea
dialog: where we went after the wedding?
dialog: 
dialog: 46.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: No, but I bet some of my work
dialog: friends do. You were partying with
dialog: them pretty hard.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Work friends?
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
speaker_heading: STRIPPERS
text: Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles.
scene_heading: INT. CRAZY HORSE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB -- DAY
text: Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip
text: Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete
text: with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages
text: of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS.
text: Alan follows after Chastity, horrified.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You work here?
text: Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Yeah -- and this is the pole where
dialog: we first met!
text: She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER
text: currently spins. Alan looks ill.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: It's always been my lucky pole...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Look, I don't know how to tell you
dialog: this, but--
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
text: HEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT!
text: She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING
text: to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole.
scene_heading: PLATINUM THE STRIPPER
dialog: Get it, girl!
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Come on, let's go meet my
dialog: bridesmaids!
dialog: 
dialog: 47.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: She hurries off, but Alan can't move.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: The Holocaust, man.
text: Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Look, we can get your grandmother's
dialog: ring back. We just gotta go about
dialog: it in the right way.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I have besmirched my people.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Don't be so hard on yourself, dude--
text: Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: These were my bridesmaids,
dialog: Anastasia and Starr!
speaker_heading: STARR
dialog: Hey, boys! Good to see you again!
speaker_heading: ANASTASIA
dialog: Mazel Tov--!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Please...don't.
text: Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY
text: PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:
speaker_heading: STRIP CLUB D.J.
text: OKAY, GUYS! LET'S GIVE A CRAZY
text: HORSE SHOUT-OUT TO OUR HAPPY NEW
scene_heading: COUPLE, CHASTITY AND ALANNNN!
text: The entire club CHEERS! Chastity holds up her wedding ring
text: and dances around, WOO HOO! Alan waves meekly. Thanks.
speaker_heading: STRIPPER D.J.
text: IN HONOR OF THEIR MARRIAGE, WE'RE
scene_heading: DOING TWO-FOR-ONE LAPDANCES! TWO
text: SONGS FOR TWENTY BUCKS!
dialog: 
dialog: 48.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The DJ puts on Nine Inch Nails' "I Want to Fuck You Like An
text: Animal" and the club gets hopping again.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Oh my God, he's playing our song!
dialog: (giddy, to Alan)
dialog: This song was playing when we met,
dialog: remember?! You kept sliding
dialog: twenties into my thong and saying
dialog: "I will always love you. I will
dialog: always love you."
text: Alan closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Twenties?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Yeah, it was so sweet...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Look, I don't know how to say this,
dialog: but my friends and I were very
dialog: drunk last night. We would never
dialog: come to a place like this--
text: He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone.
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Guys?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: VICK AND STU TOASTING SHOTS OF JAGERMEISTER
text: and downing them. PULL BACK to see that they are sitting in
scene_heading: THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM
text: getting lapdances from STARR and ANASTASIA. The Champagne
text: Room is a dark, plush private suite in the back of the Crazy
text: Horse where strippers ply their craft; the room is half full.
text: Vick watches Starr lean over and make out with Anastasia.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You are the best bridesmaids ever.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (huge boobs in his face)
dialog: Dude: I might not be gay.
text: Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed.
dialog: 
dialog: 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What the hell are you doing?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Two-for-ones, man.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: We don't have time for this! We
dialog: gotta find Doug!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What do you think we're doing?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We're getting into the mindset of
dialog: last night, to see if it sparks any
dialog: memories.
dialog: (to his stripper)
dialog: Now: is this exactly how you were
dialog: dancing for me last night, Starr?
text: She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, still no memories. Keep going
dialog: -- and put your back into it.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You are so goddamn selfish, Vick.
dialog: You really are. Stu, let's go.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance.
text: Stu looks between them, torn.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Dude: Doug is missing! We have less
dialog: than 18 hours til his wedding! We
dialog: do not have time for this!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I'm trying to save your life here,
dialog: Alan Mervish.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Vick--!
dialog: 
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I'm not kidding, man! Life is one
dialog: long series of emergencies, and if
dialog: you don't learn to stop and have a
dialog: little fun along the way, you're
dialog: gonna grow into a joyless old prick
dialog: like your dad. I'm sorry to bring
dialog: Moshe Mervish into it, but it had
dialog: to be said. Now yes, we have 18
dialog: hours to find Doug -- which means
dialog: we can afford to spend ten minutes
dialog: celebrating the special talents of
dialog: these gifted young body-artists. So
dialog: sit down, have a jager shot, and
dialog: smell the goddamn roses for once in
dialog: your miserable life. Chastity,
dialog: honey? When you're ready?
text: Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and
text: starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No, look-- I am like totally
dialog: against this, morally and
dialog: politically. Plus Becky
dialog: specifically asked me not to--
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: ALAN SITTING ON THE BANQUETTE, LOOKING AWESTRUCK
text: as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. She crawls
text: onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her
text: tongue in his ear. Next to him, no longer getting lapdances,
text: Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I think I know why he married her.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Because if he hadn't, I would've.
text: They continue watching on in silence.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Is it weird that we're sitting this
dialog: close watching?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Not for me.
text: More watching in silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I really shouldn't be here. I have
dialog: daughters.
text: Then both of their heads angle the same way.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Not that can do that.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How can she do that without
dialog: dislocating her hip?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Because she's been touched by God.
text: They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked
text: open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the
text: Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our
text: guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
text: They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized
text: by Chastity. Vick grabs him.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses--
text: Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Come on, man! We got company!
text: Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Chastity, honey, is there a back
dialog: way out of here?!
text: Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to
text: a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Come on!
text: The guys race after her...
dialog: 
dialog: 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CRAZY HORSE -- BACK HALLWAY
text: Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back
text: hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers,
text: cocktail waitresses, and barbacks.
text: Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are
text: slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're
text: bowled over by the obese Islanders.
scene_heading: INT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGE
text: A spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main
text: stage. Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing.
speaker_heading: STRIPPER D.J. (O.S.)
text: ANNND ON STAGE ONE, PUT YOUR HANDS
scene_heading: TOGETHER FOR...DOUBLE STAXXX!
text: All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu
text: blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons
text: look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so.
text: The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan
text: blow through the curtain after Stu.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Come on!
text: Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main
text: runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits
dialog: the floor running!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Did she just do that in heels?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I'm really starting to like this
dialog: girl.
text: The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and
dialog: leaping over the patrons!
text: Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very
text: upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the
text: end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.
text: CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB
text: Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again,
text: leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and,
text: finally, sprinting out the front door!
dialog: 
dialog: 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of
text: destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through
text: a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however,
text: THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS
text: being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble
text: backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS
text: pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground.
scene_heading: CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD

text: Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Did you see them trample those tiny
dialog: Japanese businessmen?! I think they
dialog: killed like four of them!
text: Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't
dialog: just a little fun...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: That was...a little fun.
text: Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb,
text: lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get
text: out and hurry for them, pointing, intense.
speaker_heading: LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
dialog: Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?!
dialog: Stuart Pryce?!
speaker_heading: STU
speaker_heading: (SCARED)

scene_heading: INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY
text: The two LVPD cops, OFFICER MERRIWEATHER and OFFICER BLADEN,
text: 40's, pace about this bare interrogation room, while Vick,
text: Alan and Stu sit behind the cold metal table.
text: Vick looks tense, but in control. Stu and Alan are sweating,
text: terrified. They've clearly been here a while.
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: Where were you last night at 3am?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No idea.
speaker_heading: OFFICER BLADEN
dialog: Okay, how about at 2am?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Ditto.
text: Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: You think this is cute, son?! You
dialog: think this is a game?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Whatever we did, we're so sorry!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Honestly, man, I will confess to
dialog: anything you want!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up
dialog: straight. Officer Merriweather,
dialog: I've told you twelve times now: we
dialog: have no memory of last night. Now
dialog: either charge us with a crime, or
dialog: let us go.
text: Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a
text: TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls
text: out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides
text: it onto the table.
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: What do you know about Jimmy Lang?
text: Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something.
text: Stu and Alan just look at the photograph, confused.
dialog: 
dialog: 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Nothing?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Who is he?
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang-
dialog: Xi crime organization, and is
dialog: wanted in seven states for money
dialog: laundering, drug smuggling,
dialog: racketeering and murder.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh my god--
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Did we kill someone last night--?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We have no idea who this man is.
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, that's right.
text: ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a
text: birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits
text: in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a
text: table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with "Happy
dialog: Birthday To You."
text: When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him
text: blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's
text: Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!
scene_heading: VICK &amp; ALAN &amp; STU &amp; DOUG (ON TAPE)
scene_heading: HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR JIMMMMY, HAPPY
text: BIRTHDAY TOOO YOOOOU!
text: Everyone applauds. Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.
speaker_heading: VICK (ON TAPE)
dialog: I love you, Jimmy Lang!
text: Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy
text: Lang's shaved head.
text: In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen.
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: We're in a lot of trouble, aren't
dialog: we.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Officers, I swear, we have no
dialog: memory of that ever occurring--
speaker_heading: OFFICER BLADEN
dialog: Okay. Maybe a night in jail will
text: jostle something loose.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh no, sir, please don't!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: We have a very important wedding--!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I know Jimmy Lang.
text: Everyone stops, looks at Vick.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You do?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Jimmy and I tried to raise capital
dialog: for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness
dialog: center and day spa for tween-age
dialog: girls, but it never got off the
dialog: ground. It was an entirely
dialog: legitimate enterprise -- I had no
dialog: idea he was a criminal. We must've
dialog: bumped into him last night, and he
dialog: must've invited us to join his
dialog: birthday celebration. No crime in
dialog: that, is there, Officers?
text: Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense.
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: You actually expect me to believe
dialog: that dung?
speaker_heading: VICK
speaker_heading: (UNBLINKING)
dialog: Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: If I find out you're lying to me,
dialog: son, I will take all of you down,
dialog: is that clear?
dialog: 
dialog: 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: OFFICER BLADEN
dialog: You boys wouldn't last three hours
dialog: in prison.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu might.
text: Stu shakes his head, unbelievable.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Now: are you gonna charge us with
dialog: something, or are we free to go?
text: The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat.
speaker_heading: OFFICER BLADEN
dialog: Get outta here.
text: Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh, thank you, Officers!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It was really nice meeting you--!
scene_heading: OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
dialog: If you know what's good for you,
dialog: you'll get the hell out of Vegas.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- NIGHT
text: Day has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the
text: steps of the police station. The mood is grim.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Did you have to be such a dick?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We got out, didn't we?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, four hours later! If we'd
dialog: just cooperated with them--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: If we'd cooperated with them, we'd
dialog: be in jail right now, Alan.
text: They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab.
text: Desperation is setting in.
dialog: 
dialog: 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What are we gonna do now? We've got
dialog: zero leads on where Doug is!
speaker_heading: STU
text: Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30.
text: The guys shake their heads, I don't know.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: Do you think he's okay--?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu, don't. Doug is fine.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I mean, we were hanging out with
dialog: mobsters last night, man! They kill
dialog: people for looking at `em weird--!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu: Doug is fine.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Or what if we like drove Doug out
text: to the desert and left him, just as
dialog: like a funny prank--?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stu! Enough!
speaker_heading: ALAN
speaker_heading: (MUTTERING)
dialog: I knew I shouldn't have come...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What did you just say?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I said I knew I shouldn't have come
dialog: this weekend, Vick!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (getting heated)
dialog: Is that right?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, that's right. I only came
dialog: because Doug insisted.
text: Vick steps towards Alan, heated.
dialog: 
dialog: 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Why do think you're so much better
dialog: than us, dude?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I don't -- I just think I'm better
dialog: than you, Vick! And trust me, it's
dialog: not that hard! You haven't changed
dialog: one bit since high school! Jesus,
dialog: you're 28 years old and you still
dialog: talk back to cops?! Really?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You're out of your depth, Alan--
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: And you're still the one getting us
dialog: in trouble! Only then it was hiding
dialog: your weed in our locker, and now
dialog: you've got us partying with wanted
dialog: felons! It's not cute anymore, man!
dialog: We're too old for this!
text: Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And all your stupid get-rich-quick
dialog: schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?!
dialog: In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Okay, let's all take a breath--
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: When's the last time you had a real
dialog: job, man?! When's the last time you
dialog: had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the
dialog: last time you picked up the check?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What's so great about any of those
dialog: things?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Those "things," Vick, are what
dialog: grown men do!
text: Vick swallows, furious.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Look, we're all tired and hungry--
dialog: 
dialog: 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: None of us ever liked you, Alan! We
dialog: only hung out with you because Doug
dialog: made us!
text: Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Stu...? Is that true?
text: Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I
text: see, his face reddening.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Why would anyone like you, dude?
dialog: Have you ever thought about that?
dialog: You're uptight, you're judgemental,
dialog: you're cheap, and yet somehow you
dialog: think you're sweeter than everyone
dialog: else! Well look around, man: no one
dialog: wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu
dialog: than you!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Wait, what--?
text: Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn!
text: They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it
text: ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in
dialog: each other's faces...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I've...always...hated you...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You punch like...your sister...
text: Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey, no! Time out! We all need a
dialog: time out--!
text: THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down.
text: Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat
dialog: the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then,
dialog: just when it starts getting way too intense,
scene_heading: A CAR HORN SOUNDS
text: And all three of them look up to see Vick'S BEAT-UP CADILLAC
text: parked on the curb, Chastity at the wheel.
dialog: 
dialog: 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: That might not be like, the
dialog: smartest place to fight?
text: Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE
text: DEPARTMENT sign right next to them. They frown...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT
text: Vick's car sits parked in front of a country bar.
scene_heading: INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT
text: The guys sit at a booth, their hair a mess, their faces
text: bruised, their clothing ripped, ravenously chowing down on
text: TACOS. Stu's mouth is full of food:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Good call on happy hour, Chastity.
dialog: These tacos kick ass.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Yeah, I always come here when I get
text: out of jail.
text: The guys exchange a quick look.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Oh, my daddy taught me how to
dialog: hotwire almost anything.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: That's funny, because Alan's daddy
dialog: taught him tax law.
text: Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: And Vick's daddy taught him how to
dialog: get really drunk at his kid's
text: soccer games and then piss himself.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: It's a disease, dude--!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Guys, come on! For Doug?
dialog: 
dialog: 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alan and Vick angrily continue eating their tacos. Then Stu's
text: PHONE rings. He pulls it out, reads the caller ID.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: "Number blocked."
speaker_heading: VINCE ALAN
dialog: Don't answer it. Answer it.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What if it's Doug?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What if it's Tracy?!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (torn, answers phone)
dialog: Good evening, this is Stu!
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT
text: It's Tracy. She's sitting in her living room, on the phone.
text: Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Stu, it's Tracy!
text: His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: It's Tracy!
text: Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: Why is she calling me?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Because she knows you're the most
text: easily tricked.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: We have tell her we lost Doug.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu!
text: Stu turns back to the phone, rattled.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?
dialog: 
dialog: 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh, nothing, just here with my
dialog: family...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Wow, that sounds amazing!
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen
dialog: to know where Doug is, would you?
dialog: He said he'd be home by 5 for this
dialog: dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I
dialog: tried his cell, but he didn't
dialog: answer...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Ummmm........Hang on.
dialog: (covering the mouthpiece)
dialog: She wants to know where Doug is!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I'm working on it! Buy us some
dialog: time!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No, just tell her the truth!
dialog: Honesty is always the best policy!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What are you, retarded?! Honesty is
dialog: never the best policy! Especially
dialog: not with brides!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (lamely, to phone)
dialog: Um, what'd you say?
speaker_heading: TRACY
speaker_heading: (FROWNING)
dialog: I asked if you knew where Doug was.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, um, hang on.
dialog: (to guys)
dialog: She still wants to know!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Okay: tell her Alan got really
dialog: drunk last night and fell down, and
dialog: the doctor said not to move him for
dialog: a few hours, but that we'll be back
dialog: in time for the wedding.
dialog: 
dialog: 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Why do I have to be the one that
dialog: fell over drunk?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get
dialog: over yourself! Stu: tell her!
speaker_heading: STU (TO PHONE)
dialog: Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a
speaker_heading: DOCTOR--
speaker_heading: VICK
text: Fell over drunk.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a
dialog: different doctor, not the one he
dialog: fell on -- he said we couldn't move
dialog: him until the wedding--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: For a few hours! We'll be home
dialog: before the wedding!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: But we're going to have the wedding
dialog: at your home--
text: Tracy just looks really confused.
text: Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (now very concerned)
dialog: Vick, what is going on?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen,
dialog: Alan hurt his back last night, so
dialog: we're gonna be laid up here for a
dialog: bit, but I promise we'll have Doug
dialog: home in time for the wedding, okay?
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Oh God, is Alan all right?
dialog: 
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yes, luckily he had a steel rod
text: surgically implanted up his ass at
dialog: birth, so the doctors anticipate a
text: complete and swift recovery.
text: Alan flips him the bird.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Can I talk to Doug?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What? No! No, you can't actually,
text: Doug...Doug is out.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Where is he? He's aaaat...the
dialog: pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's
dialog: medications. Listen, Trace, I'm
dialog: losing you, but we'll see you
dialog: tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--!
text: Vick hangs up and nods confidently.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: She bought it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT
text: Back in her bungalow, Tracy hangs up the phone, frowning.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: They've done something stupid.
text: Her stern father is standing there, frowning.
speaker_heading: MR. TURNER
dialog: No surprise there.
speaker_heading: TRACY
speaker_heading: DAD--
speaker_heading: MR. TURNER
dialog: I'm just saying, what kind of man
text: stands up his fiancée the night
dialog: before their wedding?
dialog: 
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Dad, I don't want to hear it. I
dialog: trust Doug absolutely.
text: Mr. Turner backs off. Tracy, however, looks a bit rattled...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT
text: The guys get up from the booth and head for the door, grim.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd
dialog: have Doug home in 13 hours, and we
dialog: still have no idea where he is...
text: They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a
text: stamp and a UV light reader.
speaker_heading: DOORMAN
dialog: Handstamp for re-entry?
dialog: Handstamp for re-entry?
text: Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why
text: not, and stops, holding out his hand.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Maybe we should go back to the
dialog: hotel and--
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh my God, guys! Look!
text: Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in
dialog: STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before!
text: Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS,
dialog: completely covered with stamps!
text: The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV
text: light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: It's like a map of last night!
text: The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!

scene_heading: EXT. LAS VEGAS/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT
text: The guys rocket down the Strip, weaving in and out of

text: regular ink. MUSIC blares, and the mood is high.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Where do you want to start?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: At the top! We hit every club we
dialog: went to til someone remembers what
dialog: we did with Doug!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe
dialog: we're actually gonna pull this off!
text: Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's
dialog: hat?!
text: The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car
text: over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT
text: Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Naaah, couldn't be.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Lots of people have hats like that.
dialog: Stu nods, yeah, I guess...
scene_heading: TIGHT ON: STU'S HAND

scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GHOSTBAR -- NIGHT
text: Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in
text: medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the

text: and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them!
text: They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look --
text: waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists,
text: bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake
dialog: their heads, we have no idea where Doug is...

scene_heading: INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT
text: Stu crosses off "GhostBar" from his arm...
scene_heading: INT. BODY ENGLISH NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

dialog: again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug...
scene_heading: INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT
text: Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm...
scene_heading: EXT. PURE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

scene_heading: INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT
text: The guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of

speaker_heading: STU
dialog: All right, this is the last place
dialog: we went, "Chaps."
text: Vick rolls to a stop in front of...
speaker_heading: CHAPS NIGHTCLUB
text: It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in
text: line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You sure we came here...?
text: Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF
scene_heading: THE GOLDEN PONY ALL MALE REVUE."
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: The Golden Pony. That's us.
dialog: 
dialog: 69.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Maybe I'll just wait in the car--
text: But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPS NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
text: The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a
text: kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy
text: hats and short-shorts grinding on each other.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You think we would've remembered
dialog: this...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, I don't think we came here...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Then why is your underwear nailed
dialog: to the wall?
text: The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed
text: to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads "CHAPS WALL OF
text: FAME." We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Those could be anybody's. Thousands
dialog: of people go to Colorado State--
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (looking more closely)
dialog: Oh my God, are they autographed?
speaker_heading: VICK
speaker_heading: (READING)
dialog: "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I Chaps!"

speaker_heading: WAITER

scene_heading: INT. CHAPS -- DANCE FLOOR
text: The guys move through the throng of undulating, sweaty men,

speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Stay very close to me.
text: She smiles and dances through the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. CHAPS -- BACKSTAGE AREA
text: They reach a HUGE MALE BOUNCER guarding the backstage area.
text: He sees the guys and unclips the VELVET ROPE, kissing each of

speaker_heading: BOUNCER
dialog: How are Haylee and Kaitlin?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (totally disturbed)
dialog: Oh. G-Good, thanks...?
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE AREA -- DRESSING ROOM DOOR
text: The guys reach the dressing room door and stop. They inhale.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We're going to love you either way,

text: Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Some of my best friends are gay.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Is that true?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Not...not really? I live in
dialog: Connecticut, man, we don't even
dialog: have black people yet.
text: Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters...
scene_heading: INT. CHAPS -- DRESSING ROOM
text: The dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck-naked

text: Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake,
text: staying ridiculously close together. Vick stops at one
text: dancer, trying not to look down at his junk:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Excuse me, friend, can you tell me
dialog: where Roger is?
scene_heading: BEEFCAKE COWBOY
dialog: Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there.
text: He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky
text: mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror. The guys
text: shuffle over to him. Vick tries to be supportive with Stu:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: He's cute...I guess...?
text: Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees
text: them, and smiles.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Oh! Hey guys!
text: He hugs all of them. The guys make sure to keep their asses
text: arched back to avoid genital contact.
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm surprised you're even walking
dialog: yet, Stu.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: (inhaling sharply)
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Listen, man, we don't really
dialog: remember what happened last night,
dialog: can you fill us in?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Really? No memory?
text: Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared...
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little
dialog: hurt.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Did we...you know...do anything?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Well, duh? Yeah?
dialog: 
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The guys all freeze. A beat. Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder,
dialog: supportive.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Was I...the boy or the girl?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Oh, honey, you were everything.
text: Stu WHIMPERS. Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit!
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: But you were nothing like Vick.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Wait-- what?!
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: I know, I'm sort of over group
dialog: stuff too, but Alan insisted.
text: Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I don't know! I don't know why I
dialog: insisted!
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Actually, after the anger went
dialog: away, it was really quite tender.
text: The guys look at each other, nauseous.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm really not sure we can be
dialog: friends anymore...
text: Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Guys: he's kidding.
text: Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The
text: guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Not cool, Roger. Not cool.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: So what did happen last night?
dialog: 
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Oh, well, you guys came in near the
dialog: end of our last set, like 2ish.
dialog: Doug pretty much dragged you in.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Really? Doug did?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug.
dialog: Black guy, shaved head?
text: The guys look at each other, confused.
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: He's a cake designer, he said he
dialog: met you guys at some sort of
dialog: birthday party at the Rio?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (snapping his finger)
dialog: The guy from the Jimmy Lang
text: surveillance video.
dialog: The guys nod, right.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Anyway, for the big finale of our
dialog: show, we always bring someone on
dialog: stage, and, well, Stu, you
dialog: volunteered pretty aggressively.
dialog: (to nearby dancer)
dialog: Hey Dallas, do we have the video of
dialog: last night's show?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: No! That's cool, I don't need to
dialog: see it--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We must see that video.
speaker_heading: DALLAS
text: It's in the machine.
text: Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting
text: in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback,
text: Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS.
text: Roger fast forwards.
dialog: 
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You were pretty mellow at first,
dialog: Stu, but once we got you into the
dialog: chaps, you really came alive-- oh,
dialog: here it is.
dialog: 
text: ON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his "I ROGER" g-string
text: and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony
text: dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the
text: greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym
dialog: as much as I'd like...
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: You even taught us The Pony, which
dialog: we'd never even heard of before...
text: ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly
text: gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him.
text: Stu's face drops.
speaker_heading: ROGER (CONT'D)
dialog: And then, of course, the pièce de
dialog: resistance: the Ride of the
dialog: Valkyries.
text: ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride
text: a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Annnnd that would explain the
text: searing ass pain.
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: After the show, we split a couple
dialog: pitchers of flirtinis, you had our
dialog: stylist cut your hair like mine,
dialog: and then you split.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: And what time was all this?
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: 4:30 in the morning? 4:45?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: And our Doug was with us?
dialog: 
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ROGER
dialog: Yeah, he had passed out by then,
dialog: but you carried him out. It was all
dialog: very Officer And A Gentleman.
text: The guys look at each other, confused.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45,
dialog: we got back to the hotel at 5:00,
dialog: and Doug was gone by 5:30 when
dialog: Chastity met back up with us?
speaker_heading: STU
text: That doesn't make any sense.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Did we lose him along the way?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: He was passed out, how far could he
dialog: have gone--?
text: Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads
text: "MANDALAY BAY." He answers:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT
text: Atashir is on the phone at the reception desk.
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
dialog: Mr. Lennon?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Atashir, many greetings to you.
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
dialog: I thought you might like to know
dialog: that one of our maids just found
dialog: your friend, Douglas, passed out in
dialog: your room.
text: Vick's jaw drops.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What?! Are you sure it's him?!
dialog: 
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
dialog: I saw him with my own eyes. He is
text: unconscious but breathing nicely.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a
dialog: man of great honor! A thousand
dialog: blessings upon your ancestors!
text: Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
text: Doug is in the room! A maid just
text: found him! He's passed out, but
dialog: he's okay!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: They're sure it's him?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Atashir swears it is!
text: The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh thank God he's okay...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: After all this?! He's in the room?!
text: They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even
text: hugs Roger.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I don't even care! Hug me, you big
dialog: shiny homosexual!
scene_heading: EXT. CHAPS -- NIGHT
text: Chastity and the guys bound out of Chaps, jubilant. Stu is
text: carrying a box of TWO DOZEN VIDEOTAPES.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: That was cool of Roger to give you
dialog: all the tapes of your performance.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I know, if I actually was gay, I'd
dialog: totally date Roger first. What a
dialog: gentle soul.
text: They get into Vick's clunker.
dialog: 
dialog: 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: How we doing on time?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: (looking at watch)
dialog: 2:22.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We'll be in LA by dawn.
dialog: (firing up engine)
dialog: I told you bitches this would all
dialog: work out...
text: They drive off into the night, grins all around.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STRIP/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT
text: Vick drives, Stu sits shotgun. Alan sits in the back with
text: Chastity. The cool night air washes over them. They look
text: happily exhausted.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: This has officially been the
dialog: craziest weekend of my life.
dialog: (to Chastity)
dialog: Thanks for all your help. You were
dialog: awesome.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Anything for my hubby.
text: Alan's smile flickers slightly.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm kidding, Alan. I know last
dialog: night wasn't, you know, real...
text: She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Jennifer.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Beg pardon?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.
text: Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.
dialog: 
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the
dialog: first flaky decision I've ever made
dialog: in my life. I mean, I am a
dialog: stripper.
text: Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Where you from?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: LA. Tarzana.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Yeah. I work here on the weekends.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You fly out every week?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a
dialog: great school.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Kid?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (aside, to Stu)
dialog: They always have kids.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: I have a little girl, Sarah.
dialog: She's... Well, she's everything.
text: Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute
text: little toddler. Alan smiles.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: What about you?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No kids. Same girlfriend for 14
dialog: years. Becky.
text: Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Wow, she's stunning.
text: Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: We like you way better.
speaker_heading: ALAN
speaker_heading: STU!
text: Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Becky is great.
speaker_heading: STU
text: Becky collects teapots.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, she's a total canwego.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You know, she's the girl at the
dialog: party who's always like "Can we go?
dialog: Can we go?"
text: Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: She has low blood sugar.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: She has low fun sugar.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm
dialog: going to marry!
dialog: (beat, considers)
dialog: If, you know...she forgives me for
dialog: cheating on her...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Wait: you're going to tell her?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Of course I'm going to tell her! I
dialog: could never keep something like
dialog: that from her.
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me
dialog: for scratching her Queensryche CD
dialog: in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever
dialog: gonna forgive you for marrying a
text: stripper in Vegas.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Well, then that's just the price
dialog: I'm going to have to pay.
text: Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Good for you.
text: She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her
text: face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: She's gonna cut your dick off,
dialog: dude.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT
text: Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet
text: stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (to the valet)
dialog: Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be
dialog: right back.
scene_heading: INT. MANDALAY BAY -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: Chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite.
text: Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Doug! Wake up, man!
scene_heading: INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT
text: Instead of finding Doug, however, they find KALOLO FANALUA,
text: sitting on their couch, pissed. He's got a huge WHITE CAST on
text: his right arm, courtesy of the strip club bouncers.
speaker_heading: KALOLO FANALUA
dialog: Aloha, assholes.
text: The guys freeze.
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Uh-oh.
text: The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see
text: KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit.
text: He has an identical CAST on his right arm.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: Not good.
text: Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a
text: red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize
text: him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Oh, hello. Good to see you again.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Where is Doug?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did
dialog: last night, we are incredibly sorry-
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: These your rich friends you were
dialog: telling me about, Vick?
text: Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, you haven't told them yet?
dialog: Really, that's low. Even for you.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What's going on, Vick?
text: Vick stammers, trying to find the words...
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Six months ago, your friend Vick
dialog: borrowed some money from me at what
dialog: can only be described as a very
dialog: unfavorable interest rate. When the
dialog: loan came due, he failed to pay me
dialog: back, but he promised me that he
dialog: could get the money from you guys
dialog: this weekend.
text: Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Jesus, Vick...
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: How could you do this to us, man?
dialog: We're your best friends...
text: Vick looks away, ashamed.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: They were gonna hurt me, man...
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Well, Vick, it looks like you and
dialog: your friends have some issues to
dialog: discuss. In the meantime...
text: He draws a huge, red-plated .357 MAGNUM.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: I need my goddamn money.
text: The guys jump back, whoa! Vick holds up his hands:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I can get it! I can! I just--
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: I've heard that before, Vick,
dialog: including last night, when you so
dialog: rudely skipped out on my birthday
dialog: party. That's why I've taken some
dialog: collateral to ensure your payment.
dialog: His name is Doug.
text: The guys all look sick.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: You have Doug?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh my God...
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: If you want your friend to live,
dialog: meet me at mile marker 26 off
dialog: Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the
dialog: money. Are we clear?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yes! Yes.
text: Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: M-M-Mr. Lang?
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Yes, Mr. Mervish?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: H-How much does Vick owe?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: 200 thousand dollars?!
scene_heading: INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Alan and Stu pace about the suite, beyond stressed. Vick
text: stands, looking out the window. Chastity gets them all water.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: How the hell could you blow that
dialog: kind of money?!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Was it for the custard store?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no
dialog: custard store! Vick was just trying
dialog: to rip us off to pay back Jimmy
dialog: Lang!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Is that true, Vick?
text: Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: Were any of your deals...real?
speaker_heading: VICK
speaker_heading: (GUILTY)
dialog: Some.
text: Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that
dialog: money meant something to me...
text: Vick spins around, furious:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Do you really think I wanted my
dialog: life to turn out like this, Stu?!
dialog: Do you really think I don't know
dialog: that I'm a massive loser?!
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, you guys got out of high
dialog: school and you just knew what to
dialog: do, you went to college and got
dialog: good jobs and found cool wives and
dialog: made beautiful children -- what do
dialog: I have to show for the last decade
dialog: of my life?! Nothing!
text: Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES
dialog: against the wall!
text: The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only
dialog: thing I really have...the only
dialog: thing I really have is you guys.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Come on, Vick--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No, man, it's true! I put on a good
dialog: show, but my life is so goddamn
text: hollow and vapid and lonely, it
dialog: scares me, man. I-I don't know how
dialog: much longer I can keep this scam
dialog: going. And now I've gone and ruined
dialog: the one good thing I had...
text: Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry.
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Just...please don't give up on me,
dialog: okay? I-I don't know what I'd do
dialog: without you guys. I really don't...
text: Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky
text: Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Come on, man, we've been bro's
dialog: since third grade, it's gonna take
dialog: a lot more than money to ruin our
dialog: friendship.
text: Vick looks down, deeply touched...
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: What I don't understand is why you
dialog: didn't just ask me for the money. I
dialog: would've given you every last cent
dialog: I had, man...
dialog: 
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Tears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a
text: hug. Stu hugs back, emotional.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: I love you, man.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Love you too, bro. Love you too.
text: They hug tight. For a while.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Also, I banged your sister
dialog: sophomore year.
text: Vick pulls away.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Sorry. Just seemed like a good time
dialog: to tell you.
text: Vick stammers at Stu, speechless.
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: She had just broken up with that
dialog: guy from Central, we were playing
text: "I Never" at Tim Donahee's pool,
dialog: one thing lead to another--
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: No! No. That's...that's plenty.
text: Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan
text: just frowns at his watch, stressed.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Look, I'm glad we're all sharing,
dialog: but we've got three hours to come
dialog: up with 200 grand, or else...
text: The guys nod, frowning, back on point.
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd offer to take a loan out, but
dialog: it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm
dialog: pretty sure my bank is closed.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I think I can get a 20 grand cash
dialog: advance on my credit card...
dialog: 
dialog: 86.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: So that just leaves 180 grand...
text: The guys frown at each other.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Well, it is Vegas...
dialog: The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...?
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: ALAN THROWING DOWN BLACKJACK AT A BLACKJACK TABLE
text: The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides
text: over a large pile of CHIPS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CHASTITY THROWING CRAPS AT A CRAPS TABLE
text: Again the guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS
dialog: grows...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: STU YELLING "BINGO" AT A BINGO TABLE
text: The guys jump up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a
text: table full of OLD LADIES nearby: in your face!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ALAN, STU, VICK AND CHASTITY SITTING AT A PAI GOW TABLE
text: looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips and
text: quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: VICK JUMPING UP FROM A WAR TABLE
text: having just won! Chastity and the guys aggressively hug him.
text: Stu drinks from his glass, hands shaking, wired.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Time check!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (looking at watch)
dialog: 12 minutes.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Chip check!
dialog: 
dialog: 87.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alan quickly counts the chips...
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: Faster! Come on chip check!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Dude, how many Red Bulls have you
dialog: had?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I stopped counting at six! I can
dialog: hear my heart beating in my head!
text: Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Just over 100 grand.
dialog: The guys wince, damn.
speaker_heading: VICK
text: There's only one thing left to do.
text: They all exchange a knowing look...
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
text: $100,000 WORTH OF CHIPS BEING PLACED ON BLACK
text: at a roulette table. The guys sweat, tense. Stu is insane.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You sure we don't want red?! What
dialog: if the ball lands on red--!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Shut up, Stu.
speaker_heading: ROULETTE CROUPIER
text: Betting is closed.
text: The Croupier drops the ball into the wheel. It bounces, hops,
text: spins... Vick crosses himself. Stu looks away.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't watch! My heart's gonna
dialog: explode! Can your heart even
dialog: explode?! Because I think my heart
dialog: is gonna explode! I can't watch!
text: The ball lands. Dead silence.
dialog: 
dialog: 88.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)
dialog: It's red, isn't it?! I knew it!
dialog: Tell me it's not red!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: It's not red...
text: Stu turns, ecstatic--
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
text: It's green.
text: The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his
text: chest, like he's having a seizure. Vick inhales, grim. Alan
text: slowly drops to his knees. Chastity closes her eyes.
text: Their HUGE PILE OF CHIPS is raked off the table...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- PARKING CIRCLE -- PRE-DAWN
text: The guys pack their bags into Vick's beat-up Caddy. The mood
text: is as dark as the pre-dawn sky. When the car is loaded,
text: Chastity takes Alan's hands, gentle.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Would you like me to come with?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No...It might get a little
dialog: dangerous. I wouldn't want...
text: He trails off. Chastity nods.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: I'm so sorry...about everything.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Thanks for all your help.
text: Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: There's no sense...in exchanging
dialog: numbers or anything...right?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, probably not...
text: Alan looks genuinely sad.
dialog: 
dialog: 89.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: Well...I'll always remember you as
dialog: a great first husband, then.
text: They both smile weakly.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: You can just send the divorce

dialog: whatever...
text: Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks for reminding me that there
dialog: are still some really good guys out
dialog: there, Alan. I don't...I don't get
dialog: to meet too many of them.
text: She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks
text: off. TIGHT ON Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger.
text: Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy
text: watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense
dialog: of loss...
text: Then Vick fires up the car next to him.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We gotta go, man.
text: Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...
scene_heading: INT. VICK'S CAR -- PRE-DAWN
text: Vick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway. The
text: guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yep, just driving out to the middle
dialog: of desert to meet some mobsters,
dialog: what could possibly go wrong...?
text: The guys all frown.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: So what's our plan?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I think we should tell Mr. Lang
dialog: that we couldn't get the money, but
dialog: that, if he's amenable, we could
dialog: create a payment calendar--
dialog: 
dialog: 90.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag
text: of money, grab Doug, and make a run
dialog: for it.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment
dialog: calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is
dialog: our only shot of getting Doug back!
dialog: Left turn!
text: Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road.
text: Things are quickly going from bad to worse...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 6:04AM"
scene_heading: INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- MORNING

speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Any word from Doug?
speaker_heading: MR. TURNER
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I know you don't want to hear it,
dialog: Trace, but you deserve better.
text: Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: I'm sure everything's fine. They're
dialog: all smart, capable adults...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: VICK DELICATELY LAYING CASH INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG
text: on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create
text: the appearance of a bag full of money. He's using some $20
dialog: bills, but also some $5's and $1's.
dialog: 
dialog: 91.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: This all the cash we got?
text: The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are
scene_heading: INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAWN
text: The Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of
text: the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely
text: visible in the distance.
text: Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to
text: disturb the bills, and places it on his lap.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: This is the dumbest plan ever.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Alan I need you positive please.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Here they come.
text: They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far
text: horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Stuart?
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: VICK
text: There's an emergency bottle of
dialog: tequila in my glove box. Get it out
dialog: please.
text: Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He
text: opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a
text: pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks.
text: They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I can't believe this is how we're
dialog: going to die...
text: The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves.
text: The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open...
text: TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...
dialog: 
dialog: 92.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: TIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER,
text: then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road...
text: The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off.
text: Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Let's see the money!
text: Vick gently holds up his duffel bag.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Let's see Doug!
text: Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the
text: Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back
text: and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit.
text: The guys look a bit alarmed.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Jesus, what'd they do to him?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Pull off the Ralph's bag!
text: Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal
dialog: IT'S NOT DOUG
text: It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Who the hell is that?!
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
speaker_heading: (ANNOYED)
dialog: This is Doug!
text: He pushes the guy forward.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh my God: it's the other Doug!
dialog: Roger's friend, the cake designer!
speaker_heading: BLACK DOUG
dialog: (to Jimmy Lang)
dialog: I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland!
dialog: I barely even know these guys!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!
dialog: 
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: You sure?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, man, our Doug is white!
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: But you were partying with this guy
dialog: at my birthday thing!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I don't know what to tell you, bro,
dialog: this isn't the Doug we requested!
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Well. I apologize for the mix-up...
dialog: (drawing his HUGE GUN)
dialog: But I'm still gonna need my money.
text: Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Don't move, Vick.
text: Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from
text: view. Jimmy reaches Vick, gun calmly trained at his head.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Now please. Give me my money.
text: All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand...
text: Sweat beads on his brow...
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't be stupid, son. You--
text: Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in
dialog: his massive stomach! And
scene_heading: NOTHING HAPPENS
text: Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy
text: PISTOL-WHIPS Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls
text: to the ground.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Christ that hurts!
dialog: 
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag. Hefts it. Feels wrong. He
text: goes to open the zipper when he hears:
speaker_heading: STU
speaker_heading: AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
text: Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the
text: linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but
text: STU TACKLES JIMMY TO THE GROUND FIRST!
text: The gun flies free and they wrestle for it! Dust flies!
dialog: BACK BY THE YUKON
text: The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult
text: with huge CASTS on their shooting hands!
speaker_heading: ON BLACK DOUG
text: He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his
text: back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas!
scene_heading: BY THE CADDILAC
dialog: Alan looks around, what should I do?! What should I do?! Then
text: he spots the keys in the ignition of the car. He hops in and
dialog: fires up the engine! Just then
scene_heading: THE TWO GUAMIANS OPEN FIRE
text: Bullets pound into the Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified,
dialog: and floors the gas!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I'm being shot at! I'm being shot
dialog: at!
speaker_heading: UP AHEAD
text: Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun,
text: panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: I really didn't want to kill anyone
speaker_heading: TODAY--
text: Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph!
text: The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good
text: ten yards away, in a heap of dust!
text: The guys freeze, shocked.
dialog: 
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The Guamians freeze, shocked.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh my god, is he okay?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Who cares! Go go!
text: Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in!
text: The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and
dialog: dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!
scene_heading: BULLETS IMPACT ALL ALL OVER CAR
text: taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests.
text: The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away. Then
text: they sit up, amazed, out of breath.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I can't believe you just saved my
dialog: life!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I can't believe you just drove my
dialog: car into Jimmy Lang!
text: Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: He's gonna be really upset!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Yeah, I was just thinking that!
scene_heading: BACK ON JIMMY LANG
text: The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two
text: henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.
speaker_heading: KIKIOLANI
dialog: Boss, Boss, you okay?!
text: Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Find Vick... And kill him.
scene_heading: INT. VICK'S CAR -- DAWN
text: The guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Now can we call Tracy?
dialog: 
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Vick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah. It's probably time.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- LONE PAYPHONE -- DAWN
text: The guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of
text: the desert. They all look at the phone.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Who wants to make the call?
text: Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and
text: Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: That was you!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: What?! No! I beat you by a mile!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Vick, who won?!
speaker_heading: VICK
speaker_heading: (FROWNING)
dialog: Actually...I should do it. This
dialog: weekend was mostly my fault. I need
dialog: to Man Up.
text: Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound
dialog: sense of responsibility.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Well, I'll be damned...
text: Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I still can't believe Stu banged my
dialog: sister.
text: Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the
dialog: pay phone...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY
text: Tracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite. Her stern
text: dad blows in.
dialog: 
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR. TURNER
dialog: Any word from Doug?
text: The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
text: about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: No, but I'm sure he's--
text: Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it.
speaker_heading: TRACY (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
speaker_heading: VICK
text: In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted
text: aviators into the rising sun.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Tracy, it's Vick.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: Hey Vick!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Listen, honey...The bachelor party
dialog: got a little out of control and,
dialog: well...we lost Doug.
speaker_heading: TRACY
dialog: (her jaw dropping)
dialog: What?! But we're getting married in
dialog: like four hours!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Yeah, that's not gonna happen...
text: BACK IN THE CAR
text: Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes,
dialog: realizing something!
speaker_heading: BACK TO VICK
text: on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This
dialog: is all my fault--
dialog: 
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver
dialog: out of Vick's hand!
speaker_heading: VICK (CONT'D)
dialog: What the--?!
text: Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just
dialog: joking around! We've got Doug right
dialog: here!
dialog: Vick looks like: what?!
speaker_heading: TRACY
speaker_heading: (HORRIFIED)
dialog: What kind of joke is that?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll
dialog: see you at the wedding! Bye!
text: Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I know where Doug is!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY
text: Tracy stands in her bridal suite. Then she just BREAKS DOWN
text: SOBBING. Her father hurries over, concerned...
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAY
text: Alan floors the car back onto the 15 towards Vegas, amped!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Remember when we saw Doug's bed
dialog: impaled on the griffin thing?!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Yeah, we threw it out the window.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: No: the windows don't open,
dialog: remember?!
dialog: 
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: So how did--?
speaker_heading: (REALIZING)
dialog: Oh my God.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: And that's why we've been seeing
dialog: Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He
dialog: was trying to signal someone!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I don't believe it...
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: I-I still don't get it--
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: And it totally jives with the
dialog: timeline, right?! We brought Doug
text: back to the hotel at 5:00, he was
dialog: passed out...
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: It's so obvious!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Not...to me...so much?
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: How'd you figure it out?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: The Patron, man! It reminded me of
dialog: our first drink of the night!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Honestly, dude, you're a genius.
speaker_heading: STU
scene_heading: CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE
dialog: DOUG IS?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: He's on the roof!
text: Stu looks confused, the roof?
dialog: 
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: After Doug passed out, we must've
text: taken him up there in his bed as a
dialog: prank, so he'd wake up on the roof
dialog: or whatever? Then we forgot him.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: And all day he's been throwing his
text: crap off the roof, trying to signal
dialog: someone to get him down!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You think he's still up there?!
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Only one way to find out...

scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- ROOFTOP -- DAY

speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: DOUG?! DOUG?!
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!
text: But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair...
text: Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent,
text: naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink
dialog: from sunburn...
dialog: IS DOUG!
text: And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!
speaker_heading: ALAN
speaker_heading: DOUG!
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay!
dialog: 
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and
text: whispers, nasty, parched:
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: Don't...even...talk to me.
text: The guys stop short.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Okay, no, that's cool!
speaker_heading: STU

text: As they pass ATASHIR at his desk, Vick yells over:
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?!
dialog: Why did you betray us?!
speaker_heading: ATASHIR
dialog: Because they paid me. And also
dialog: because you're kind of racist.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Fair enough! See you next time, you
dialog: beautiful Judas!
text: They blow out of the hotel...
scene_heading: EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET -- CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: STU

speaker_heading: STU (CONT'D)

scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:

speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Look, Doug, I think I speak for
dialog: everyone in the car when I say I'm

speaker_heading: STU
dialog: You gotta admit, it's a pretty

speaker_heading: VICK

dialog: and calling! What, you don't answer
dialog: your phone anymore?!
dialog: 
dialog: 107.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I-I'm so sorry, I can explain--
text: Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Alan?
text: They all turn to see
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
text: standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her
text: hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: This just got complicated...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Jennifer?
text: Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: I-I know I wasn't invited, but I
dialog: just had to return this...
text: She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky
text: watches on, stunned.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Okay: who the hell is this chick,
dialog: and why the hell does she have your
dialog: Grandmother's wedding ring?!
text: Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity...
text: It's the moment of truth. The fork in life's road...
speaker_heading: BECKY (CONT'D)
dialog: Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just
dialog: like your mother! Talk! Who's the
dialog: ho wearing my ring?!
text: And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns:
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: She's my wife.
text: Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick
dialog: grin, oh shit!
dialog: 
dialog: 108.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We don't make each other happy
dialog: anymore, Beck. And we can keep not
dialog: making each other happy for another
dialog: 14 years -- hell, maybe even
dialog: another 50 years -- but let's not.
dialog: Let's find people who make our
dialog: hearts race. Let's be excited and
dialog: fun and alive again...
text: Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Are you fucking kidding me?
text: Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: I'm sorry, Beck. I really am.
dialog: (to Chastity)
dialog: Can I buy you a free drink?
text: Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together
text: towards the bar.
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: We're not...actually...still
dialog: married, are we?
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Let's start with dinner, and see
dialog: where it goes...?
speaker_heading: CHASTITY
dialog: (smiling warmly)
dialog: I'd like that.
scene_heading: BACK ON BECKY
text: She finally recovers enough to speak:
speaker_heading: BECKY
dialog: Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back
dialog: here this second!
dialog: (but Alan keeps walking)
dialog: Don't you walk away from me, you
dialog: stupid little clown! I own you! GET
scene_heading: BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY!
text: But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu
dialog: wave him on, go dude! Go!
text: Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.
dialog: 
dialog: 109.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: STAY WITH STU
text: as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he
speaker_heading: HEARS:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Daddy?!
text: Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses
text: racing through the crowd towards him! They leap into his
text: arms, so excited to see him! He scoops them both up.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: Oh, I missed you guys so much!
speaker_heading: HAYLEE
dialog: We missed you too, daddy!
speaker_heading: KAITLIN
dialog: You're the best dad ever!
dialog: Beat.
text: And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere.
text: His lovely wife ERIN appears, harried, a diaper bag over her
text: shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes.
speaker_heading: ERIN
dialog: Jesus, are you still drunk?
text: Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her
text: into a big family hug...
scene_heading: INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- LATER
text: Vick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the
text: men's room and approaches a urinal. Then KIKIOLANI and KALOLO
text: FANALUA walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts,
text: still very pissed. Vick inhales, scared.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Okay, okay, I'll go with you.
dialog: Just...don't ruin the wedding.
text: Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: I really didn't want it to end like
dialog: this, Vick.
text: Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy
text: extends his hand for Vick to shake.
dialog: 
dialog: 110.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Good luck.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: (totally thrown)
dialog: Um, what...?
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG
dialog: Your friend Alan just paid your
dialog: marker. Took out a second mortgage
dialog: on his house. The full 200 grand,
dialog: plus medical expenses, which I
dialog: thought was a classy touch.
text: Vick looks blown away.
speaker_heading: JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
dialog: Without our friends, we are
dialog: nothing, Vick. Remember that.
text: The three injured mobsters exit. Vick remains standing there,
dialog: overwhelmed, his life literally saved...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: VICK, STU, AND ALAN
text: standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in
text: hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: I will pay you back, you know.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Damn straight you will!
text: They all LAUGH.
scene_heading: VOICE BEHIND THEM
dialog: Okay, so what the hell happened
dialog: this weekend?
text: The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling. They grin as
text: he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu
dialog: went gay, and I learned a very
dialog: important life lesson from an obese
dialog: hoodlum.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: We'll tell you the whole story when
dialog: you get back from your honeymoon.
dialog: 
dialog: 111.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: We really are sorry, man.
text: Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail.
speaker_heading: VICK
dialog: To Doug and Tracy.
speaker_heading: STU
dialog: To Doug and Tracy.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: To Doug and Tracy.
speaker_heading: DOUG
dialog: To me and Tracy -- and to being
dialog: here, with my three former best
dialog: friends in the world...
dialog: The guys LAUGH.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: There's nowhere else I'd rather be
dialog: right now.
text: They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.
speaker_heading: DOUG (CONT'D)
dialog: That said, let's not get too stupid
dialog: tonight, okay? I'm going on my
dialog: honeymoon in 24 hours...
text: The guys all nod reassuringly.
speaker_heading: THE GUYS
dialog: No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
dialog: dude.
text: The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then
text: CUT TO BLACK.
speaker_heading: THE END
