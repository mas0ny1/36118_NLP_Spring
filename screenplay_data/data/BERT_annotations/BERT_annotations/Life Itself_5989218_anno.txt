speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Cue Love Sick. Bob Dylan. Track
dialog: one, Time Out of Mind.
dialog: CUE SONG: Love Sick by Bob Dylan.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah, that’s good, real good.
text: The Narrator clears his throat, begins:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
text: We open tight on a man.
text: A MAN, 20s, handsome, fills the frame.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Hold up, let me rephrase: we open
dialog: on “our hero.”
text: Oh, just FYI: Sam Jackson is voicing the narrator. Not sure
dialog: why but he is.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
text: We push in on his face.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Muthafucka I said push in on that
dialog: shit!
text: The camera quickly jolts to life, pushes in clumsily. Sam
text: calms down and describes our hero:
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
text: Mid twenties, handsome, gay but gay
dialog: in that cool cat kind of a way, gay
dialog: like “Billy on the Street” gay, gay
dialog: like “yeah, I'll suck a dick we
dialog: don’t have to make no thang about
dialog: it.”
text: Our hero nods slightly, as if agreeing.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah that’s one cool dicksuckin’
dialog: cat we got over here. But right
dialog: now, this cat is anything but cool.
dialog: This cat’s in crisis.
text: Our hero speaks direct to camera, sheepish and emotional:
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: I feel... ashamed, I guess. I know
dialog: this doesn’t make me look very
dialog: good. But it’s breaking me and...
text: His voice cracks.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Let it go, brother. Let it go like
dialog: a Pixar ho - let it go, let it go.
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: It’s just... he and I have been
dialog: together for so long. And I know
dialog: it sounds cliché but... I guess, I
dialog: like knowing he’s always on my
dialog: team, you know?
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: I know, my brother. I hear you, my
dialog: brother. Let. It. Go.
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: But this new guy has come along...
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Proceed.
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: He’s new. He’s exciting. And he’s
dialog: so much younger.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Ain’t no shame, brother.
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: And I know I can’t just “stick”
dialog: with someone out of loyalty.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: You know this.
speaker_heading: HERO
dialog: Okay, I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna
dialog: put Todd Gurley in at my flex
dialog: running back spot and drop Jamal
dialog: Charles. Maybe I'll pick up Miami
text: D off waivers.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: WHAT IN THE FUCK!?
dialog: 3.
text: Sitting opposite the young man is a FEMALE THERAPIST (40s,
text: red hair, we see her from behind).
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Henry: we've talked about how
text: obsessing over fantasy football
dialog: can’t simply replace obsessing over
dialog: food.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: SAY WHAT NOW! ?
speaker_heading: HERO/HENRY
dialog: No, I know.
speaker_heading: THERAPIST
dialog: Have you made yourself throw up
dialog: this week, Henry?
speaker_heading: HERO/HENRY
dialog: (ashamed)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: THE FUCK!?
text: As the therapist and hero continue talking...
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Okay, my bad, that motherfucker is
dialog: definitely not our hero.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But look at that pretty therapist
text: over there. Soothing him. Calming
dialog: his anorexic fantasy football-
dialog: loving ass down. Push in on her
dialog: for a sec.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: (again)
dialog: I said push in motherfucka!
text: The camera jolts to life again, pushes in on her.
dialog: It is!
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Oh yeah, now I’m seeing it. That’s
dialog: a hero right there. The amazing
dialog: smile, the long red hair, the
dialog: freckl... wait a second: hold up...
dialog: is that Julianne Moore!?
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Motherfucker it is! That’s “Still
dialog: Alice”! That shit made me cry!
dialog: She forgot EVERYTHING!!! Okay!
dialog: Now we're talking. Ladies and
dialog: gentlemen: we got ourselves a hero.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Julianne Moore walks out into the street. Sam Jackson
text: resumes narrating to the best of his ability.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Now, like any great hero, our hero
dialog: wasn’t perfect. Far from it.
text: Julianne lights a cigarette, tries to hail a CAB.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: She smoked, first of all, which
dialog: they normally don’t let you show in
dialog: movies any more even though we all
dialog: still smoke sometimes... oh don’t
dialog: even start, you know you smoke
dialog: sometimes. You and the wife have a
dialog: date night, you each have two
dialog: martinis, you guys are feeling wild
dialog: so you buy a pack of smokes on the
dialog: way home and you each smoke one in
text: the 7-Eleven parking lot. Then she
dialog: makes you throw out the pack, but
dialog: instead of throwing it out you hide
text: it in a plant outside the house and
dialog: some nights, after she goes to
dialog: sleep, you sneak out and have one.
dialog: But then one night she catches you
dialog: when you come to bed, ‘cause she
dialog: smells that shit on you like she’s
dialog: a detective - she smells that shit
dialog: on you like she’s Jimmy Smits in
text: “NYPD Blue” and she’s cracked the
dialog: fucking case - and you get in a big
dialog: fight and-- WHAT IN THE FUCK!?
dialog: As Sam has been telling this story, we’ve been watching
text: Julianne Moore trying to catch a cab.
text: Having no luck, she has ventured further and further into the
text: street and, at exactly the time of Sam’s “WHAT THE FUCK”, has
text: gotten run over by a bus.
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Oh shit! Oh shit! Julianne Moore
dialog: just got straight up run over by
dialog: the bus!
text: People run to the scene of the accident...
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe she’s okay, maybe she’s just
text: lying under the bus dazed.
text: A GOOD SAMARITAN (30s) takes charge, starts motioning for the
dialog: bus to back up.
speaker_heading: GOOD SAMARITAN
dialog: Back up the bus! Back it up!
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (V.O.)
dialog: She's gonna be fine. She’s our
dialog: hero and she’s gonna be fine-- OH
speaker_heading: FUCK!
speaker_heading: ON JULIANNE
text: Completely smushed. It’s like something out of “Walking
dialog: Dead” but worse.
text: The Good Samaritan starts VOMITING and spectators start
text: SCREAMING and CRYING.
text: A LITTLE HISPANIC BOY inside the bus presses his face to the
text: window. His eyes well with tears.
text: As more people gather, a man pushes through, out of the
dialog: crowd...
text: It’s SAM JACKSON. Right before passing through frame he
dialog: says...
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON
dialog: Fuck this, I’m out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A COMPUTER SCREEN
text: We see exactly that, the words typed in screenplay format...
speaker_heading: SAM JACKSON (CONT’D)
dialog: Fuck this, I’m out.
dialog: We are in...
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS —- MORNING
dialog: Our REAL HERO is writing the bizarre screenplay we’ve been
dialog: watching.
dialog: Note: it’s the Good Samaritan from the accident.
text: A real NARRATOR (female) takes over:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (0.S.)
dialog: Will Dempsey was thirty-one years
text: old when he finally gave up on his
dialog: Sam Jackson unreliable narrator
dialog: screenplay.
dialog: (beat)
text: He’d been working on it since 7:30
dialog: AM.
text: Will looks up at the clock. It’s 7:47 AM.
text: Will closes the computer, stands, heads to the counter.
text: A way-too-chipper FEMALE BARISTA greets him.
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: Top of the morning to you, good
dialog: Sir! What can I get for you!?
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Double espresso, large cup.
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: And would you care for anything to
dialog: eat?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: A fuck you?
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: I said “no thank you.”
speaker_heading: BARISTA
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Oh, okay, right.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: ("thank you so much”)
dialog: Fuck you so much.
text: She looks up, confused. Did she just hear that again?
text: But Will is just smiling big at her.
text: She gives up, takes his cash.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (0.S.)
dialog: Will was not well. But you don’t
dialog: need me to tell you that.
text: Will stands in the waiting area. Out of nowhere, he starts
text: SINGING. Loudly. People stare.
text: He’s singing Bob Dylan's Standing in the Doorway.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (doing Dylan)
dialog: I’m walking through, the summer
text: nights/The jukebox, playing low.
dialog: Yesterday everything, was going too
dialog: fast/Today it’s moving too slow...
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Will!?
text: Will jolts to a stop. A SECOND BARISTA is holding out his
text: now-ready coffee. Will approaches.
speaker_heading: SECOND BARISTA
dialog: Double espresso, large cup?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yeppers.
text: Will takes the large cup. Opens the lid.
text: From his back pocket he takes out a small glass BOTTLE OF
text: WHISKEY and pours the whole thing into the cup.
text: He does a long pour. Announces it:
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (loudly)
dialog: I’m doing a long pour.
text: Everyone in the Starbucks is now watching him.
text: Will reaches into his pocket, takes out a PILL BOTTLE. He
text: removes a pill, downs it, turns back to the barista.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Want one?
speaker_heading: SECOND BARISTA
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: It’s Xanax.
speaker_heading: SECOND BARISTA
dialog: Still no.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Boo humbug.
speaker_heading: SECOND BARISTA
dialog: (correcting)
dialog: Bah humbug.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: That’s what she said.
speaker_heading: SECOND BARISTA
dialog: Huh?
text: Will SHRUGS, starts singing another verse:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I got no way left to turn/I got
dialog: nothing left to burn...
dialog: (then)
dialog: It’s Dylan, people! Standing in
dialog: the Doorway! Third track on Time
text: out of Mind. His comeback album.
dialog: The whole thing’s like a giant
dialog: fucking Keats poem.
dialog: (a beat, then)
dialog: Give it a chance, it’1l grow on
dialog: you.
text: A STARBUCKS MANAGER approaches.
speaker_heading: MANAGER
dialog: Sir?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh man. Are you gonna make me
dialog: leave? Bah humbug.
text: Will gives a proud thumbs up to the second barista ("nailed
dialog: it.”)
text: CUE SONG: Bob Dylan’s Standing in the Doorway.
text: SLOW MOTION ACTION as the manager and other Starbucks
text: employees push/carry Will out of the store...
text: Just before he’s out the door, Will yells:
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m telling you: give it a chance,
dialog: it will grow on you!
text: From somewhere unknown, a WOMAN’S VOICE echoes Will's:
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Just give it a chance, it will grow
dialog: on you.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MORNING (SIX MONTHS EARLIER)
text: We follow an adorable MINI GOLDENDOODLE into a sun-kissed
dialog: bedroom.
text: The same BOB DYLAN SONG is playing.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: It will grow on me? He sounds like
text: he’s suffering.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0O.S.)
dialog: Bob Dylan does not sound like he’s
dialog: suffering.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Well he doesn’t sound like he’s
dialog: singing.
scene_heading: The OFF-SCREEN WOMAN LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: You're a heathen.
text: The dog tries hopping up on the bed.
speaker_heading: MAN'S VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: (loving)
dialog: C'mere, Fuckface.
text: The mini Goldendoodle does in fact wear a nametag reading:
dialog: “Fuckface.”
text: Hands reach down, pull the dog up. The hands belong to...
speaker_heading: WILL (in bed)
text: The Will of six months ago is a different Will - fresh faced,
text: sober, and handsome. Happy.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Will hadn’t always been “not well.”
dialog: It had really only been since his
dialog: wife had left him that...
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know what, we’ll get to that.
dialog: Right now let’s enjoy them as they
dialog: were.
text: Will turns over with the dog and faces his wife... ABBY
speaker_heading: DEMPSEY (30, knockout).
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Will loved his wife Abby with an
dialog: intensity usually reserved for
dialog: stalkers. She was everything a man
dialog: could ask for in a wife. She was
dialog: nurturing, and she was beautiful,
dialog: and she ate any kind of sushi the
text: chef served to her, even the uni.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Yes, Will was sure of it: Abby
dialog: Dempsey was absolutely perfect. At
dialog: least back then she was.
text: Abby takes the dog from Will.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay, okay, just listen to this
text: next song for thirty seconds and
dialog: tell me Bob Dylan is not a poet.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You have been listening to this man
text: gargling for a month straight.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'm in a phase, Baby. C’mon, lean
dialog: into this with me. It’s Dylan’s
dialog: comeback album!
text: Abby sits up, animated.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: They were counting him out, Man!
dialog: They said you don’t come back from
dialog: the crazy he had and then... BOOM!
dialog: 1997. Time Out of Mind! Three
dialog: Grammys, Album of the Year, he told
dialog: everyone “I’m Bob Dylan and you’re
dialog: not so eat a dick.”
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Bob Dylan told everyone to “eat a
dialog: dick?”
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Metaphorically, yes, he did.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Listen to this track. Really
dialog: listen, then tell me he’s not a
dialog: poet. I read this literary
dialog: analysis online, they say he drew
dialog: on the poetry of Keats--
text: Will fakes SNORING.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon, Babe, this is important to
dialog: me.
text: Will opens his eyes, looks at her. He loves her so
text: completely that it practically seeps from his pores.
text: He nods.
text: She smiles, hits a button on her iPod.
text: CUE SONG: Not Dark Yet by Bob Dylan.
text: A new Dylan song fills the room. They sit there for thirty
text: seconds, listening. At a certain point, Abby simply closes
text: her eyes and sings along, swaying.
text: Will just watches her. Smitten. Always smitten.
speaker_heading: BOB DYLAN (0.S.)
dialog: There’s not even room enough, to be
dialog: anywhere/It’s not dark yet, but
dialog: it’s getting there.
text: Abby stops the song. Opens her eyes. Will smiles at her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: Don't.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: He sounds like he has a giant cock
text: lodged in his throat.
text: She playfully smacks him with a pillow.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Asshole!
dialog: 12.
text: Will rolls on top of her. They wrestle playfully, until...
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, okay, wait, watch Fuckface,
dialog: are we rolling on Fuckface? Will,
dialog: careful.
text: Will sits up. Abby rolls out from under the covers.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm starving. I need to shower or
dialog: we’re gonna be late for your
dialog: parents.
text: As she stands we realize Abby is very pregnant. Explosively
dialog: pregnant.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey?
text: Abby turns. Pregnant, hair in her face, luminous.
speaker_heading: WILL (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey!
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. FRATERNITY PARTY - NIGHT (10 YEARS EARLIER)
text: A MUCH YOUNGER ABBY (20) dances with a HOT GUY on a sweaty,
text: beer soaked dance floor.
text: A MUCH YOUNGER WILL (21) stands holding two beers behind
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey!
text: They don’t hear Will over the music.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I GOT YOU A BEER!
text: Abby and Hot Guy stop dancing, turn.
speaker_heading: HOT GUY
dialog: Thanks, man!
text: Hot Guy takes both beers and hands one to Abby.
text: She smiles apologetically at Will and resumes dancing with
dialog: the other guy.
dialog: 13.
text: Will watches, either devastated or nonplussed.
dialog: You can never quite tell with Will.
scene_heading: INT. FRATERNITY PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Will sits on the stairs, watching the party absentmindedly,
text: nursing a beer.
text: A beautiful pair of legs steps into his sightline. He smiles
text: without even looking up.
text: Abby sits down next to him into frame. They face forward,
text: watching the party.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: What happened to Fuckface?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Tim.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: If you say so.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I wasn’t into him.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh. Too bad for Fuckface.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Tim.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Sure.
text: A beat. They watch Tim/Fuckface dance with a new girl.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: He looks like one of those
dialog: Valentine’s Day stuffed animals,
dialog: doesn’t he? Like one of those
dialog: perfect fluffy teddy bear dogs
dialog: things with the button eyes?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You jealous?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Just observant.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (small smile)
dialog: If you say so.
text: A beat. They sip their beers in contented silence.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you ever going to ask me out,
dialog: Will?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Just waiting for the right moment.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Oh, okay. Good to know.
text: Another long beat. They sip their beers.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: You might want to get on it, is
dialog: all. Because I’m contemplating
dialog: going home with Tim--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Fuckface.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Both of them, out of sheer
dialog: loneliness.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay. Good to know.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But I’m still waiting for the right
dialog: moment.
text: She SIGHS, frustrated, stands.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'll see you later, Will.
text: She turns to go. Will calls after her.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I'm waiting for the right moment,
dialog: Abby, because once I ask you out,
dialog: there won’t be any turning back for
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 14.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I won’t date anyone else for the
dialog: rest of my life, I won’t love
dialog: anyone else for the rest of my
dialog: life, I won’t really care about
dialog: anything else for the rest of my
dialog: life. I am going to fall in love
dialog: with you with such intensity that I
dialog: may not be able to think straight
dialog: for the next few decades. I’m
dialog: waiting for the right moment, Abby,
dialog: because when I ask you out it will
dialog: be the most important moment of my
dialog: life and I want to make sure I get
dialog: it right.
text: ON ABBY: blown away and a little stunned.
text: Will just shrugs, casual, and sips his beer.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: So that’s why.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay. Good to know.
text: A charged silent beat. Abby stands to go.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Abby.
text: She turns.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to go to the movies with
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Wait... are you asking me out?
text: Will shrugs.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: The moment felt right.
text: Abby smiles. They fall in love, instantly.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
text: We’re back to PRESENT-DAY-STARBUCKS-DRUNK WILL DEMPSEY.
dialog: 16.
text: He walks down the street, wobbling and swigging from his
text: Starbucks cup of coffee/whiskey.
text: He pulls an iPod from his pocket.
text: He puts on HEADPHONES.
text: He scrolls forward to track number 5 on Dylan’s Time Out of
dialog: Mind album: Trying to Get to Heaven.
text: Instantly, all the sounds of the city vanish. We hear only
dialog: the song...
speaker_heading: BOB DYLAN (0.S.)
dialog: The air is getting hotter/ there’s
text: a rumbling in the skies/ having
text: waded through the high muddy water/
text: with the heat rising in my eyes.
text: The sights and sounds of summertime New York flood past Will.
text: He takes them all in, hyper-focused on each detail:
text: - A MAN walks his TINY DOG.
text: - A WOMAN tries to hail a CAB.
text: - A COUPLE holds hands while pushing a stroller.
speaker_heading: BOB DYLAN (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Every day your memory grows
dialog: dimmer/it doesn’t haunt me like it
dialog: did before/I’ve been walking
text: through the middle of
dialog: nowhere/trying to get to Heaven
text: before they close the door.
text: Will ENTERS the front REVOLVING DOOR of an office building.
text: He just goes around and around, never getting out. Listening
dialog: to Dylan.
text: A man at sea.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Will sits in a chair, staring forward, almost catatonic.
speaker_heading: WOMAN’S VOICE (0O.S.)

speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE (0.S.) (CONT’D)
dialog: Will?
text: Will looks up, a bit startled.
scene_heading: REVEAL: a pretty therapist - DOCTOR KATE MORRIS (35) -
text: sitting opposite him in a therapist’s office.
dialog: Dr. Morris is attractive and has red hair. Note: this looks
text: lot like the opening therapy scene.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I’m sorry, what did you say?
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I asked how you were doing today.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh. You know. Same.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Has anyone ever told you that you
dialog: look like Julianne Moore?
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: You did. Yesterday.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well I’ve got a good eye because
dialog: you're a dead ringer.
text: Will sips from his alcohol filled Starbucks cup.
text: FLASH: Young Will and Young Abby on their first date, in a
text: packed movie theatre, enjoying a re-release of “Pulp Fiction”
text: with other Tarantino fanatics. Sam Jackson is screaming:
dialog: “I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker” and
text: Abby is loving it. Will watches her, watching it, and takes
text: her hand for the first time.
text: BACK TO WILL, in therapy.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I tried to masturbate the other
dialog: day. I tried thinking of her, but
dialog: I couldn't get it done so...
text: This hangs there.
text: A beat.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Then I tried thinking of you, but
dialog: that’s when I realized how much you
dialog: look like Julianne Moore and I
dialog: started thinking about what I’d
dialog: seen her in last and it was “Still
dialog: Alice” and then well, you know...
dialog: (then)
dialog: I mean, you jerk off to “Still
dialog: Alice” you need to be
dialog: institutionalized.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: You were institutionalized.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Touché.
text: FLASH: Young Will and Young Abby lying in bed, post-coital.
text: He’s tracing her back with his fingers, memorizing her.
text: BACK TO WILL, in therapy.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: She left six months ago today.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I know. But you’ve been in a
dialog: facility almost that entire time,
dialog: Will. And I'm trying to get a
dialog: sense - Will, are you listening to
dialog: me? - I’m trying to get a sense of
dialog: how you’re doing being back out in
dialog: the world again.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Oh. You know. Same.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: You keep saying that.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I keep meaning it.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Have you spoken to her? Since

speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Have you gone to see your parents
dialog: yet, like we discussed?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I don’t want to.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Will, part of the reason you were
dialog: discharged and put into my care was
dialog: so you could start--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I DON'T WANT TO, OKAY!
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: That was weird. Sorry.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Yesterday you said that since you'd
dialog: been discharged you’d been feeling

speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: What, Will? What’s wrong?
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CARNIVAL - EVENING (9 YEARS EARLIER)
text: COLLEGE-AGE WILL is participating in a SHOOTING GAME at a
text: carnival/fair. He hits his mark.
text: COLLEGE-AGE ABBY cheers.
text: Will receives a TEDDY BEAR, hands it to Abby.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We’ll name him Fuckface.
text: Abby LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Every teddy bear in our lives
dialog: cannot be named Fuckface.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I like reminding you of the life
dialog: you could have had if I hadn’t
dialog: rescued you.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Do you now!?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (a la John Wayne)
dialog: Yes, Ma‘am.
text: Will tips an imaginary cap and blows on the gun like a
text: gunslinger. She LAUGHS.
text: Will grabs her and she GIGGLES/SQUIRMS. But quickly they
text: settle into the embrace.
text: Will looks her in the eye:
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s get married.
text: Abby freezes ever so slightly.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We've only been dating a few
dialog: months, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And I think I’ve shown great
dialog: restraint waiting this long.
text: She can’t help but smile.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: You want to say yes so bad it
dialog: hurts.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I don’t.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You do.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: You’re cocky.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I’m right.
text: She smiles. Will reaches for the toy gun. He puts it to his
dialog: head, does his best John Wayne again:
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Little Lady, say yes or let me put
dialog: myself out of my misery.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Stop that, c’mon.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Come on, Little Mama.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Will, enough.
text: Will relents, lowers the fake gun. But then... he shoves it
text: in his mouth.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (mumbled )
dialog: “Yes, I will marry yo--
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Will!
text: Will clocks her discomfort, removes the gun.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: That was weird. Sorry.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I love you, Will. You’re the love
dialog: of my life, I’m sure of it. But it
dialog: scares me how much...
dialog: (then)
dialog: It scares me how much you feel,
dialog: Will.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I never would have thought that
dialog: could be a thing that scared me
dialog: but... I may not be equipped to be
dialog: loved this much.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I only know one way to love you,
dialog: Abby.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I know, but--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (matter-of-fact)
dialog: I‘ll find another way.
text: This stops her. Will thinks, then:
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah, I’1l find another way. I
dialog: will love you however you're
dialog: equipped to handle it, Abby. I
dialog: will love you with restraint, I
dialog: will love you on odd days of the
dialog: week, I will figure out how you
dialog: like your love and I will make it
dialog: to order for you--
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: We'd have to get a dog.
text: Will stops short, momentarily thrown.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I mean, I want kids too, but not
dialog: for a while.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ABBY
text: But a dog first. A small dog.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: My parents died young and that
dialog: makes me sad sometimes.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It will probably make me a bad
dialog: mother.
dialog: 22.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I disagree but okay.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Mainly I want the dog, that’s the
text: big thing. A small dog.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I’m completely on board with the
dialog: dog.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay, I’1l marry you.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Okay.
text: Will hands Abby her Teddy Bear.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Wanna meet my parents?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: The door opens revealing:
text: IRWIN (65) and LINDA (61) DEMPSEY, Will's delightfully over-
text: the-top New Yorker-for-life parents. They SQUEAL with
dialog: delight at the appearance of...
text: WILL AND ABBY, 9 years aged forward since the previous scene.
dialog: Note: these are the pregnant, Bob Dylan loving/hating
text: versions of Will and Abby from that morning roughly six
dialog: months ago.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Abby! My God, look at you. You’re
dialog: positively...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Revolting?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No, you’re--
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Gassy?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She is pretty gassy, Ma.
text: Will’s father nods.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: That means it’s gonna be a boy. I
dialog: practically needed a hazmat suit
dialog: when your mother was pregnant with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: (nodding)
dialog: It’s true.
text: Will turns to Abby:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: My dad says that the farts mean
dialog: it’s a boy.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Well, that makes them all worth it.
text: Abby turns to Linda.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m almost afraid to ask, but did
dialog: you...
speaker_heading: LINDA
text: Meatloaf just came out of the oven.
text: Abby practically collapses in relief.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Oh, God bless you, I’ve never
dialog: craved anything like this. Linda,
dialog: get me to that meatloaf and you can
text: nag, pester, and back-handedly
dialog: insult me to your heart’s content.
text: Abby ENTERS, eager. Linda follows her, equally eager.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh good!
dialog: (getting right to it)
dialog: Abby, honey?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: LINDA (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you forget to put on socks or
dialog: was that a choice? Because it’s
dialog: very chilly out and...
text: Will and his dad share a look, SHRUG, and follow.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - LATER
text: The four of them sit at a dining room table, eating.
text: Abby is positively chowing on that meatloaf. Will watches
dialog: her go at it.
text: He smiles and looks off to an ADJACENT LIVING ROOM.
text: It's already a SHRINE/PLAYGROUND for his unborn child. A
text: crib, play toys, play area, the works.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ma, you are aware that the kid
dialog: isn’t going to actually live with
dialog: you, right?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: I got carried away, sue me. Here,
dialog: eat, before she gets it all.
text: Linda serves Will meatloaf. His father motions toward the
dialog: baby mess.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Baby clothes, baby swings, baby
dialog: stem cells, who knows - I don’t
dialog: know what half this shit is. All I
dialog: know is that I spend all day
dialog: breaking down the goddamn Amazon
dialog: boxes.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Sshh you. Here, Honey, a little
dialog: more.
text: Linda goes to give Will more meatloaf. But Abby - without
text: breaking stride - slaps the spoon away and takes the rest for
text: herself like an animal feeding on a kill.
speaker_heading: LINDA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to be a grandmother, I
dialog: just can’t believe it. Abby, don’t
dialog: take this the wrong way--
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Here we go.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: But selfishly I’m just so glad your
text: parents are dead.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Boom.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh stop it, Abby knows what I mean.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: She does?
dialog: (to Abby)
dialog: You do?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (mouth full)
dialog: She'll explain.
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: What I mean is...
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (chewing)
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: ++. all I ever wanted was for Will
dialog: to marry a woman with dead parents
dialog: so I didn’t have to share the
dialog: grandchildren. And he did. My
dialog: prayers came true.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Jesus, Ma!
speaker_heading: LINDA
dialog: Oh, Abby knows what I mean.
dialog: (then, immediate)
dialog: Ooh, Abby, did you look at that
dialog: book I sent you yet...
text: As CONVERSATION CONTINUES in the background, Will looks over
text: into that adjacent living room filled with baby products...
speaker_heading: WILL (PRE-LAP)
text: Both Abby’s parents died in a car
dialog: accident when she was a little
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY
text: Back to present-day/messed-up Will in therapy with Dr.
dialog: Morris.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Abby was in the car. She was
dialog: seven.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: “Okay” feels like a strange
dialog: response to that new information.
text: Dr. Morris smiles.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I was caught off guard.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You don’t talk about Abby a lot.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don’t ask about her a lot.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I ask about her constantly.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Tomato, potato.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: (correcting)
dialog: Tomato, tom-ah-to.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Let’s call the whole thing off.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Your sessions with me are mandated,
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No, I meant... “tomato, tom-ah-to,
dialog: let's call the whole thing off.”
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I’m not following.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: My God, this is some kind of rhythm
dialog: we have, huh, Doc? Maybe this is
dialog: why I can’t jerk off to you.
text: A really awkward beat.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: That was way inappropriate.
dialog: (explaining)
dialog: I was institutionalized.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Why don’t you tell me about Abby,
dialog: Will? I’d like to know more about
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Well, then you’ve come to the right
dialog: place, Doc. I am the world’s
dialog: foremost expert on all things Abby.
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: Or I was, I guess.
dialog: (then)
dialog: No, I still am, I mean it’s not
dialog: like someone else learned more
dialog: about her in the past six months.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I mean someone could have, I’ve
dialog: been locked up and God only knows
dialog: what she’s been up to wherever she
dialog: is--
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Right. Let me tell you about Abby.
scene_heading: INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY (THIRTY YEARS AGO)
text: ABBY’S MOM gives birth. Her FATHER cheers her on. Will
dialog: becomes our third narrator (so far)...
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: Abby Lesher was born on June 30th,
dialog: 1985. The legend goes that when
dialog: she was born, she didn’t make a
dialog: peep.
text: The baby comes out. The doctor prods it. Nothing.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O)
text: For five minutes, little Abby just
text: sat there, taking in the world.
text: Not so much as a single cry.
text: The baby just sits there, contented.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: In the years to come, her parents
dialog: would always say that there was
dialog: nothing wrong with baby Abby. She
dialog: just didn’t have anything to say
dialog: yet.
text: PRESENT DAY WILL steps into frame with Dr. Morris (the scene
dialog: participants don’t “see” them).
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now keep in mind, I’m getting all
dialog: this second hand. I never met any
dialog: of the people here except Abby.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Understood.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: Her parents die. Pretty soon.
dialog: Long before I come into the
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: No, I know.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And it’s not like I know any of
dialog: these doctors or nurses, why would
dialog: I?
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Let's move along, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay.
scene_heading: INT. ABBY’S HOME - YEARS LATER
text: An adorable FIVE-YEAR-OLD ABBY dances in the living room.
text: Her parents sit on a couch, watching and laughing.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O)
dialog: By all accounts, Abby’s early
dialog: childhood was a happy one.
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: ON HER PARENTS (40s)
text: Adoring their child.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: Her parents - Jack and Elizabeth -
dialog: were kind-hearted and good-hearted
dialog: and all the other kinds of
dialog: “hearted.” They were literally
dialog: both elementary school teachers.
dialog: It’s actually how they met...
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY (1988).
text: Elizabeth (Abby’s mom) sits by herself eating in the
text: teacher’s lounge. She takes a big bite of her sandwich.
text: Just then: Jack (Abby’s dad) approaches, sits next to her.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You mind if I sit?
text: She goes to answer, but catches herself (her mouth is full).
text: She motions for Jack to sit, he does.
text: She covers her mouth and continues chewing quickly.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: If Abby’s mother had known she’d
dialog: meet her future husband at
dialog: precisely that moment, she probably
dialog: wouldn’t have taken a huge bite of
text: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
text: just seconds before.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Hi, I’m Jack.
text: She goes to respond, but is still chewing. She motions at
text: her mouth, apologetically. Chews.
text: He waits. And waits. She can’t get it down. They start
text: laughing.
text: REVEAL opposite them:
text: Will and Dr. Morris sit at the table watching the game of
dialog: peanut butter induced charades/hysterics.
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now is this a meet-cute, or is this
dialog: a meet-cute.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Screenwriting term. I’ve been
dialog: writing.
text: He watches them.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s strange to think about isn’t
dialog: it? How a completely random moment
dialog: involving peanut butter, a moment
dialog: that happened before I was even
dialog: born, shaped my entire life.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Are you glad it happened?
text: Will watches them.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Ah, well that, Dr. Morris, is the
dialog: big question, isn’t it? Because if
dialog: it hadn't happened...
text: We see all of the following in FLASHING SNAPSHOTS from the
text: past - like a high-speed MONTAGE.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: Abby’s parents would never have
dialog: met, they’d never have married,
dialog: they'd never have honeymooned in
dialog: Aruba where they conceived Abby.
dialog: They’d never have seen Abby come
dialog: into the world without a peep,
dialog: they’d never have watched her
text: blonde hair turn brown as she got
dialog: older. They’d never have watched
text: her become obsessed with dancing,
dialog: then soccer, then horses. And, of
dialog: course, Christmas. Always
dialog: Christmas - the lights, the gifts,
dialog: and above all: the Rockettes. So
dialog: obsessed with the Rockettes was
dialog: Abby that every year they’d have to
dialog: drive into the city to see them
dialog: perfo--
text: SMASH! Their car (Abby in backseat) is BLINDSIDED.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
dialog: 32.
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT)
text: Will stares ahead, thinking.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Her parents died instantly. Abby
text: was trapped in the backseat of the
text: car with them for over an hour
dialog: until they got her out. Her
dialog: father...
dialog: (beat, then)
text: Her father was decapitated by the
dialog: steering column.
text: A loaded beat.
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I know, right!? That’s always the
dialog: detail that gets people. I mean
dialog: the story in and of itself is
dialog: tragic, of course, but when you
dialog: give someone that image - that
text: singular image of a seven year old
text: girl trapped in a car with her
dialog: decapitated father - then it all
dialog: really just lands, doesn’t it?
dialog: (then, chipper)
dialog: Anyhoo... you asked about Abby so
dialog: I’1l continue, but be forewarned,
dialog: her next decade isn’t so great.
text: More SNAPSHOTS from the past. We start with little Abby
text: (fresh off car accident) in a police station.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: Abby’s parents didn’t plan on dying
dialog: together. So there was no will,
dialog: and no plan for Abby. Seeing as
dialog: all her grandparents were deceased,
dialog: Abby’s Uncle Joe was given custody.
dialog: Uncle Joe wasn’t a nice man. And
dialog: when I say that, I don’t mean he
dialog: didn’t hug her. I mean he bought
text: her a puppy and then killed it when
dialog: it chewed up his couch. I mean he
dialog: sporadically molested her for the
dialog: better part of six years until at
dialog: fifteen years old she borrowed a
text: gun from a wannabe gangbanger at
dialog: her school, put it to her Uncle
text: Joe's head, and told him in no
dialog: uncertain terms that...
text: Fifteen-year-old Abby tells her uncle...
dialog: 33.
scene_heading: FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD ABBY
dialog: I will fucking kill you if you ever
dialog: touch me again.
text: She lowers the gun...
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
text: Then she shot him in the knee so he
dialog: knew she wasn’t playing.
text: She does. Uncle Joe howls in pain.
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Will smiles.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Like a movie, right? I always
text: pictured a young Natalie Portman
text: playing her.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I don’t know who that is.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don’t know who Natalie Portman
dialog: is!? Doc, you gotta get out more.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I’m sure you're right, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Tell you what, you come over one
dialog: night, we'll marathon young Natalie
dialog: Portman: “The Professional,”
dialog: “Beautiful Girls,” you'll
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Please continue, Will.
speaker_heading: Will SHRUGS.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Things got better from there.
text: More SNAPSHOTS from Abby’s past.
speaker_heading: WILL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Obviously damage had been done.
text: Decapitated father, molesting
dialog: uncle, you don’t just bounce back
dialog: from that. But Abby was smart.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: WILL (0.S.) (CONT'D)
text: Determined. A dreamer. A reader.
text: She hunkered down, got herself into
dialog: college, started seeing a therapist
dialog: on campus who truly changed her
dialog: life, and even made a really close
dialog: friend...
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - EVENING
text: YOUNG ABBY (20) sits in a library studying.
text: Across a few tables, YOUNG WILL throws candy at her. They
text: starts silently food fighting.
text: Once again, PRESENT DAY WILL steps into frame with Dr.
dialog: Morris.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Look, Doc, it’s me! This is what I
text: looked like at twenty-one.
dialog: (then, realizing)
dialog: Holy shit, my hairline has really
dialog: receded, hasn't it?
text: He examines his twenty-one-year old self (who, unaware,
text: continues food fighting with Abby).
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: Look how much lower my hairline was
dialog: back then. Fuck me.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I think you look very much the
dialog: same.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: And I think I look like a different
dialog: person.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Tomato-tomahto.
text: Will smiles.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Look at us, Doc, look at us. Maybe
dialog: we have a chance after all.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Anyhow...
text: Will leads Dr. Morris out of the library and through...
dialog: 35.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS
text: Where we see college-Abby everywhere... playing intermural
text: soccer, reading on the lawn, making out with Will, etc.
text: Will and Dr. Morris walk through these scenes, one after
dialog: another.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Abby came into her own in college.
dialog: She engaged with the world, became
dialog: extremely popular, even fell in
dialog: love (not to toot my own horn but
dialog: toot toot). She graduated top of
dialog: her class with an English Lit
dialog: degree, wrote her thesis on...
speaker_heading: ABBY (PRE-LAP)
dialog: Will! will!
dialog: Suddenly we are in...
scene_heading: INT. FRAT PARTY - NIGHT
text: THREE FRAT BOY IDIOTS hold Will upside down, readying him to
text: chug from a keg.
text: Young Abby rushes over toward Will, nonplussed by the fact
text: that he’s upside down over a keg.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: The unreliable narrator!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (mile-a-minute)
dialog: My thesis! Unreliable narrators
dialog: are considered a “device,” right?
dialog: Don’t answer, they are. They don’t
dialog: get a lot of literary analysis
dialog: because it’s a gimmick, a trick. I
dialog: mean yeah, Canterbury Tales gets a
dialog: shout out for having one, but
dialog: usually it’s the stuff of popcorn
dialog: crime novels and thriller movies.
dialog: Agatha Christie, Usual Suspects, so
dialog: on and so forth. But I’m going to
dialog: argue that by definition, any
text: narrator is unreliable.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Because when someone is telling a
dialog: story, there is always a distance
dialog: from the actual story to their
dialog: telling of the story. Therefore,
dialog: any story that has EVER been told
text: has an unreliable narrator. The
dialog: only truly reliable narrator would
dialog: be someone hypothetically telling a
dialog: story as it happens before our
text: eyes, which is obviously
dialog: impossible. And what does that
dialog: mean?
dialog: (deep breath)
dialog: It means that the only truly
text: reliable narrator is life itself.
dialog: But life itself, by it’s very
dialog: nature, is an unreliable narrator,
dialog: too - because it is constantly
dialog: misdirecting us, misleading us,
dialog: taking us on a journey where it’s
dialog: literally impossible to predict
dialog: what is going to happen next.
dialog: That’s my thesis: life as the
text: ultimate unreliable narrator.
dialog: (then)
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I think--
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: It’ll make more sense when I write
dialog: it. Love you! Bye!
text: She races off.
text: Will’s friends stuff the spout back in his mouth as he
text: watches her race off.
text: He’s literally upside-down, in love.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Will sits, lost in thought. He looks up at Dr. Morris.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Hey, before, when I invited you
text: over to watch Natalie Portman
dialog: movies, you know I was just being
dialog: funny, right?
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Because I’m still married. At
dialog: least I think I am. I haven’t
dialog: signed any papers or anything yet.
dialog: Don’t know how this works.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: It’s fine, Will.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Okay.
text: A long beat.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Tell me about your marriage?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You want me to tell you about my
dialog: marriage?
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Then you haven’t been listening.
dialog: It doesn’t matter what I tell you,
dialog: Doc.
text: His eyes suddenly well with tears.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - 6 MONTHS EARLIER
text: We're back where we first saw Will and Abby together, in bed
dialog: six months earlier, talking about Bob Dylan.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: I could tell you all about our
dialog: marriage. I could tell you every
dialog: detail of that morning she left me.
text: We pick up mid-scene (we've seen this already).
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I'm in a phase, Baby. C’mon, lean
dialog: into this with me. It’s Dylan’s
dialog: comeback album!
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.0O.)
dialog: But is my memory even remotely
dialog: accurate?
text: We REWIND, play the moment again.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I’m in a phase, Will. Why can’t
dialog: you just lean into this with me?
dialog: One fucking time, just lean into it
dialog: with me.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: I could tell you how much fun we
dialog: had together that morning.
dialog: We've seen this next part, too:
speaker_heading: WILL
text: He sounds like he has a giant cock
text: lodged in his throat.
text: She playfully smacks him with a pillow.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Asshole!
text: Will rolls on top of her. They wrestle playfully, until...
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, okay, wait, watch Fuckface,
dialog: are we rolling on Fuckface? Will,
dialog: careful.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.0O.)
dialog: Or...
dialog: We REWIND, play this part again:
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Will, get off me. Watch Fuckface,
dialog: are we rolling on Fuckface?
dialog: (then, urgent)
text: WILL, GET THE HELL OFF OF ME!
text: Will gets off her, surprised.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe I'd been smothering her for
dialog: years. Smothering her with my
dialog: love, with my dreams, with a baby
dialog: she wasn’t ready for.
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: FLASHES /SNAPSHOTS:
text: - Will putting that toy gun to his head.
text: - Will’s parents house filled to the brim with toys.
text: - Abby’s enormous belly.
text: - Fifteen-year-old Abby holding that gun to Uncle Joe’s head.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: Maybe I was just another man who
dialog: looked like he was there to save
dialog: her life, when he was really just
dialog: there to ruin it.
text: We SPLIT SCREEN two versions of Abby on that bed, swaying to
dialog: Dylan:
text: In one version, she looks ethereal, happy, contented.
text: In the other, she’s wet eyed, lost in thought, extremely
dialog: damaged.
speaker_heading: WILL (V.O.)
dialog: Was she unhappy all along? Was my
dialog: dream girl just something I'd
dialog: created in my mind’s eye. A
dialog: narrative trick, to get us through,
dialog: you know... a life.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Will sits with Dr. Morris. He takes a sip of his
dialog: coffee/whiskey.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: This is some heavy philosophical
dialog: shit we're delving into.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: It is, yes.
text: He drinks more. Dr. Morris leans forward.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: Will, can you talk a little about
dialog: that day?
text: Will shakes his head “no.” Dr. Morris continues anyways.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: You had a nice morning with Abby
dialog: talking about Bob Dylan--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (fierce)
dialog: You're not listening, Doc!
dialog: (then, calming)
dialog: It may not have been a nice
dialog: morning. It may have been a
dialog: smothering morning, that’s what I’m
dialog: trying to fucking tell you!
text: His outburst is uneven and unnerving. Dr. Morris takes a
dialog: beat, presses on:
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: And you went to your parents for
dialog: lunch, and then what happened?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (starting to cry)
dialog: She just left me.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: She didn't just leave you, Will--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You don’t want me to do this, Doc.
dialog: Charmingly fucked up Will is a lot
dialog: more fun than deeply fucked up
dialog: Will.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Will--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I‘1ll remind you that deeply fucked
text: up Will has tried to kill himself
dialog: two times in the past six months.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: I’m aware of that--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I‘1l remind you that the first
dialog: thing deeply fucked up Will did
dialog: after he got out from the hospital
dialog: was buy a gun so he could get it
dialog: right the third time.
text: Dr. Morris goes silent. This is new information.
text: She nods, leans forward, says gently:
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Have you seen Abby since you've
dialog: been released, Will?
text: Will closes his eyes, remember:
scene_heading: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - DAY
dialog: We've seen this image before: Will begging Abby to come back
text: to him.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (crying)
dialog: You know I can’t.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Please Abby. Just come back--
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS (0.S.)
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Will?
text: Will looks up (towards her voice):
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I’m talking to my wife!
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS (0.S.)
dialog: But your wife wasn’t there, was
dialog: she?
text: We WIDEN... we see Will is sitting at a table by himself.
text: And Will sees it, too. He knows it. He admits:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: No, she wasn’t.
text: Will just stares at the empty seat across from him. He
dialog: announces to no one in particular:
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m not well. I’m very sick.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Dr. Morris leans forward.
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: You're not sick, Will. You're sad.
dialog: You're mixing meds. You're not
dialog: yourself.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Tell me about that morning.
text: We see the previously seen images that Will describes:
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: We talked about Bob Dylan. We
dialog: laughed. We almost crushed the
dialog: dog. We went to my parents. We
dialog: ate meatloaf.
text: He stops. Tears are streaming down his face.
scene_heading: EXT. BROWNSTONE - DAY
text: Pregnant Abby and happy Will exit his parents.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Oh my God, I ate too much.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: You ate the gross national meatloaf
dialog: product of a small nation.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: (nodding, sad)
dialog: We may have a meatloaf instead of a
dialog: baby.
text: Will LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Walk it off?
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Please yes.
text: He takes her hand. They head down the bustling New York City
text: street, slowly, contentedly.
text: After a long beat...
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
text: The baby is a girl, Will.
text: Will turns, surprised.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know we weren't going to find out
dialog: but a nurse slipped up and... I
dialog: feel shitty knowing without you
dialog: knowing:
dialog: (then, nervous excitement)
dialog: Will, in about three weeks you’re
dialog: going to have a daughter.
text: Will stands there in stunned silence.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Say something.
text: Slowly, Will smiles.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now I get it.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What!?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know what you want to name her.
dialog: 43.
text: Abby smiles mischievously, starts crossing the street. She
text: turns back to Will.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: I know you don’t like his music but--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I love it.
text: Abby smiles. It’s a smile that could light up a city block.
text: And suddenly we hear SCREECHING TIRES. She turns in the
text: direction of the sound.
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
text: Tears stream down Will’s face.
speaker_heading: WILL
text: It’s all I see. Twenty-four hours
dialog: a day. If I think about something
text: else for one second, it comes back
text: like a wave the next. The bus.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: WILL (CONT'D)
text: Her face. That singular image of
dialog: my girl...
dialog: (gutted)
text: Lying there... just gone.
text: SNAPSHOTS: Like Will’s early screenplay (but this time
text: mercifully avoiding the gore - though we can imagine):
text: - A screeching bus, pandemonium.
text: - Will screaming to back the bus up.
text: - The little Hispanic boy crying inside the bus. Will
text: briefly locks eyes with the boy.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Will, you suffered a horrific,
dialog: horrific trauma--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: I can’t live without her.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: You can. For your baby you can.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Your baby survived, Will.
dialog: Miraculously, she lived. Wouldn't
dialog: Abby want you to be there for your
dialog: daughter?
text: Will nods, broken.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS (CONT’D)
dialog: So why haven’t you been to your
dialog: parents yet? Why haven’t you seen
dialog: your baby?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Because she was right: I loved her
dialog: too much. I loved her too hard.
text: All I see is her face.
dialog: (then, nodding)
dialog: I'm just done.
text: Will stands, a newfound determination on his face.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Will, please sit down.
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: If I don’t leave now, I never will.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: DR. MORRIS
dialog: Will--
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I’m sorry, Doc, you're very nice,
dialog: but I don’t want to be here
dialog: anymore. I have to do this now or
dialog: I never will, please close your
text: eyes.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I wasn’t the hero of this story.
text: And before we even know what’s happening, Will reaches into
text: his sock, pulls out his gun, puts it in his mouth, and fires.
text: It is instantaneous, jarring, and - obviously - shocking.
text: Everything SLOWS and GOES SILENT as Dr. Morris SCREAMS and
text: runs to Will... then out the door (screaming).
text: CUE SONG: The most populist track from Bob Dylan’s Time Out
dialog: of Mind album: To Make Me Feel Your Love.
text: A long beat, as we process this... then:
text: A new “narrator” takes over, this time A LITTLE GIRL:
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Dear Rod. I got your letter and it
dialog: was very nice. You spell really
dialog: good my Nana says, and you seem
dialog: like a very nice boy she says too.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: A little girl’s hand writes this letter, carefully.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: I think you are lucky that you have
dialog: a bird. I have a dog. He is my
dialog: best friend. Do you like pizza? I
dialog: Mainly like pizza and dogs. But
dialog: dogs more.
text: Reveal: A LITTLE GIRL (6). Adorable. Wise beyond her
dialog: handful of years.
speaker_heading: LITTLE GIRL (CONT’D)
dialog: (as she writes)
dialog: From, Dylan Dempsey.
text: This is Will and Abby’s daughter, aged six years.
dialog: 46.
text: Our earlier FEMALE ADULT NARRATOR takes back over.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: To say Dylan Dempsey’s childhood
dialog: was marked by death and tragedy
dialog: would be the grossest of
dialog: understatements... and also a
dialog: little bit douchey.
text: TIGHT ON SIX-YEAR-OLD DYLAN’S face. She looks directly into
dialog: lens.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: She was literally born of death and
dialog: tragedy.
text: SCREECH! The sound of a bus. Little Dylan flinches.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Six months into her little life,
text: her father started locking in the
dialog: pattern.
text: GUNSHOT! Dylan flinches again.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: And this was all before the poor
dialog: kid even understood what the hell
dialog: was going on.
scene_heading: INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (5.5 YEARS EARLIER)
text: SIX-MONTH-OLD DYLAN plays on the floor.
speaker_heading: BEHIND HER:
text: Slightly out of focus, her grandparents are hysterically
text: crying and holding each other.
text: Baby Dylan watches them, as if understanding.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
text: The fallout from Will Dempsey’s
dialog: suicide was instant, long lasting,
text: and far reaching.
scene_heading: INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT -— EVENING
text: Dr. Morris sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, dazed and
text: teary.
text: Her HUSBAND rubs her back, but she just stares forward at...
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: A TV SCREEN
text: She's watching young Natalie Portman in “The Professional.”
scene_heading: INT. DYLAN’S NEW HOME - CONTINUOUS
text: Baby Dylan watches her grandparents cry.
text: Little Fuckface (the dog) comes over and licks her face.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Dylan would now be raised by her
dialog: mid-sixties grandparents, Irwin and
dialog: Linda. And the odds weren’t great
dialog: that they’d last very long.
speaker_heading: ON IRWIN:
text: He sits on the couch, stares into lens, crying.
text: As our narrator describes his condition - arrows, stats, and
dialog: graphics demonstrate what she describes:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Irwin Dempsey was sixty-six years
dialog: old. He was 5'10” and he weighed
dialog: 265 pounds. When people would
dialog: caution that you don’t see a lot of
dialog: nearly 300 pound, 70 year olds
dialog: walking around, Irwin would always
dialog: say:
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: (proud but sad)
dialog: You will soon, Mother Fucker.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Irwin had high cholesterol, severe
dialog: arthritis, and the beginnings of
dialog: gout. And he was the healthiest of
text: Dylan’s new caretakers.
text: The camera swings over to Linda Dempsey, who now stares
text: directly into lens, crying.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: For two decades, Linda Dempsey had
dialog: managed her clinical anxiety and
dialog: depression with a ever-evolving
text: cocktail of Prozac, Zoloft, and
dialog: white wine.
text: Linda nods into lens, teary.
dialog: 48.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: And that anxiety and depression did
dialog: not even account for her only
dialog: child's suicide, nor the grapefruit
dialog: sized tumor which she had no idea
text: was growing inside of her.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: Irwin stands at Linda’s grave with now EIGHT-YEAR-OLD DYLAN.
text: She looks up at her grandfather, sees that he’s crying.
text: She takes his hand.
scene_heading: INT. DYLAN’S BEDROOM - EVENING
text: Dylan sits in bed with an aging Fuckface. Around her room,
dialog: we get a sense of the girl...
text: - A writing DESK.
text: - Little girl pinks and purples, mixed - strangely - with BOB
scene_heading: DYLAN POSTERS.
text: - A PHOTOGRAPH of Abby, Will, and a much younger Fuckface in
dialog: happier/earlier times.
text: It is almost viscerally painful.
scene_heading: KNOCK KNOCK.
text: Irwin stands at the half open door. He’s holding a glass of
dialog: whiskey.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: How you feeling, Kiddo?
speaker_heading: She SHRUGS.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I feel like my whole life is going
text: to be marked by death and tragedy.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: She did not say this, of course,
dialog: but if she could verbalize what she
dialog: was feeling at eight years old, she
dialog: would have.
text: Irwin sits next to her. Eight-year-old “Dylan” continues
dialog: expressing her innermost thoughts:
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I crave a happy life, Grandpa. I
text: have an almost desperate craving
dialog: for stability and happiness, the
dialog: way fat people crave chocolate or
dialog: lost hikers crave rescue. I want
dialog: to live a big great fantastical
dialog: life. But I’m concerned that the
dialog: tragedy that seems to follow me -
dialog: the tragedy that birthed me - will
dialog: prevent that from ever happening.
dialog: And I don’t know if I can withstand
text: another body blow like this.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: But what she really said was:
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Are you gonna die, Grandpa?
text: Irwin takes a sip of his whiskey, thinks. Then:
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Yes. I am. And probably sooner
dialog: than you'd like, Kiddo, if I’m
dialog: being honest. But I’m gonna fight
dialog: like hell to stick around for you
dialog: as long as possible, to prevent one
dialog: more death from coming anywhere
dialog: near your doorstep. I’m gonna get
dialog: on the fucking treadmill, I’m gonna
dialog: cut back on the red meat, I’m gonna
dialog: do my best to get you through your
dialog: teenage years without losing one
dialog: more goddamn thing.
text: He nods, determined.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m going to do that for your
dialog: mother and father. I’m going to do
dialog: it for your grandmother. But
dialog: mostly I’m going to do it for you,
dialog: Granddaughter.
text: He looks at her, eyes welling with tears and love.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Yeah, I’m going to squeeze out ten
dialog: more years from this decrepit old
dialog: body for you, my girl. My angel.
dialog: My world.
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Again: Irwin expressed this all
dialog: with:
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Nah, no more dying around here,
dialog: Kiddo. Okay?
text: Irwin holds out his whiskey to toast his granddaughter.
text: She pretends to hold a glass of her own, and “clinks” with
dialog: him.
text: They take a real/fake sip together, and at the same time:
speaker_heading: DYLAN/ IRWIN
dialog: (re: real/fake whiskey)
dialog: Ahhhhhh.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: But Irwin had no more power to
dialog: prevent loss than any of us do.
scene_heading: INT. VETERINARIAN HOLDING AREA - DAY
text: NINE-YEAR-OLD Dylan sits on the floor.
text: Next to her, Fuckface lies on his side - dying.
text: She pets him, gently.
text: BEHIND HER, Irwin stands with a VET.
text: He slams his hand into the wall in frustration.
scene_heading: INT. VETERINARIAN PROCEDURE ROOM - LATER
text: The Vet injects Fuckface, putting him down.
text: Dylan keeps petting the dog, locking eyes with him.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Tell them I’m nice.
text: She places that long-ago PHOTOGRAPH of her parents and
text: Fuckface next to dog.
dialog: It will be buried with him.
dialog: 51.
scene_heading: INT. DYLAN’S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Dylan comes home, begins tearing the Bob Dylan posters off of
dialog: her wall.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
text: Her mother gets hit by a bus. Her
text: father commits suicide. Her
text: grandmother dies of cancer.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But it was the death of a mini
dialog: goldendoodle that ended Dylan
dialog: Dempsey’s childhood.
text: Dylan turns, looks into lens again.
text: As she does, and as our narrator continues, Dylan slowly -
text: ever so slowly - MORPHS in front of our eyes from an INNOCENT
scene_heading: NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL to a TEENAGER.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: 2025 to 2033: the Dylan Dempsey
dialog: Transformation Years. The years
dialog: brought puberty. Puberty brought
dialog: sexuality. Sexuality brought
text: anger. And fear. And confusion.
dialog: And when the smoke cleared - where
dialog: that sweet little girl once stood -
dialog: there remained only a teenager who
dialog: scared the absolute shit out of
dialog: everyone.
text: Dylan turns back to lens, revealing a fully evolved 18-YEAR-
scene_heading: OLD DYLAN DEMPSEY.
text: She is a knockout, in a dangerous, way-too-sexy way.
text: She begins throwing stuff in a BACKPACK.
scene_heading: KNOCK KNOCK.
text: Irwin stands at the door again, aged ten years himself. He’s
text: thinner. Older.
dialog: He may have cut out that red meat, but not the whiskey.
text: He’s holding his ubiquitous glass of it.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Hey.
text: She doesn’t even turn around.
dialog: She grabs
dialog: He shrugs
text: A beat.
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I’m heading out.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: With who?
text: a pack of cigarettes from a drawer.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (CONT’D)
dialog: You're not even going to try and
dialog: hide those from me?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Aren’t we both better than that?
dialog: in agreement.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: (re: cigarettes)
dialog: You hear Vermont’s made them
dialog: illegal?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Remind me never to go to Vermont.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: ("little boy”)
dialog: Can I have one?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Just one?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: No, these things will kill you.
text: She pops a cigarette in her mouth. Irwin cringes at the
dialog: sight.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: I was hoping we could talk about
dialog: college.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: We talked about it last night.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: We didn’t get very far.
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Yes we did. We just didn’t get
dialog: where you wanted.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Promise to be home by eleven?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I'd rather not lie to you.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Lie to me.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: I’1l be home by eleven.
text: She walks past him. He grabs her arm, turns her.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Dylan.
text: He looks at her. He looks old, tired.
text: She softens, ever so slightly.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Happy eighteenth, Kiddo.
text: He holds out his whiskey glass, as he once did to that
text: adorable little girl.
text: She rolls her eyes, but - after a moment - gives in and
text: CLINKS an imaginary glass against his.
text: At the same time, they both sip and...
speaker_heading: IRWIN/DYLAN
dialog: Ahhhhhh.
text: Irwin touches her cheek.
text: And suddenly we see it: sweet innocent Dylan is still in
dialog: there, somewhere...
text: Then she takes Irwin’s real whiskey glass and downs it in one
text: gulp.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Peace.
text: She winks, EXITS.
dialog: 54.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - LATER
text: Dylan sits in the backseat of a small SUV.
text: THREE YOUNG MEN (two up front, one in back) sit in the car
text: with them. Everyone is smoking.
text: In the back of the SUV we see music equipment (instruments,
dialog: amps, etc.).
dialog: It is important to remember: it is 2033 now. All around us
text: we notice the changes in costume, in vehicles, in technology.
text: Not a paradigm shift by any means - no flying cars - but it’s
text: all part of the landscape.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: So I say to her - your friend looks
dialog: lonely. Why don’t the three of us
dialog: get to know one another--
text: As the other bandmates “male bond,” Dylan looks out the
text: window of the car.
speaker_heading: ON STREET
text: They are passing the very intersection where Dylan’s mother
dialog: Abby - exactly eighteen years earlier - was struck by that
dialog: bus.
speaker_heading: ON DYLAN
text: As the car comes to a stop at a traffic light. Right at the
dialog: spot.
text: Dylan lowers the window and sticks her head (and her entire
text: top half of her body, really) out of the car.
text: She hovers over the very spot where her mother died.
text: As the light turns green, Dylan flicks her cigarette out the
dialog: window...
dialog: Onto that exact spot.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BAR - LATER
text: Dylan is mid-performance, the lead singer for the band.
text: SIGNAGE announces her band’s name: PB&J.
dialog: 55.
dialog: Note: their music is the popular underground music of 2032: a
text: violent, electronica-based form of rock ‘n’ roll.
text: Watching Dylan screaming and flailing on stage is jarring, to
dialog: say the least.
text: But she’s also a star performer. Captivating. Raw.
dialog: The most damaged people always make for our greatest artists.
text: The song finishes. The sparse audience CHEERS.
text: Dylan grabs a MUG OF BEER from a nearby ledge and quietly
text: speaks to the crowd, commanding their attention:
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Our last song is kinda personal.
dialog: My mom died eighteen years ago
dialog: today, and--
speaker_heading: DRUNK
dialog: Take it off!
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (explosive)
dialog: FUCK YOU!
text: Dylan calms herself, takes a sip of her beer, continues:
speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: They tell me she used to listen to--
speaker_heading: DRUNK #2
dialog: Show us your tits!!!
text: Dylan THROWS her mug out at the kid. It shatters in the
dialog: distance.
text: Dylan gives up on “context,” simply announces:
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: This is our last song.
text: Dylan steps over toward a nearby keyboard, begins playing.
text: Softly she starts singing, beautifully.
text: It’s To Make You Feel My Love by Bob Dylan... unplugged.
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (singing)
dialog: When the rain is blowing in your
dialog: face/and the whole world is on your
dialog: case/I could offer you a warm
dialog: embrace/to make you feel my love...
dialog: And with that:
text: The band explodes.
text: Suddenly this becomes a violent/thrashing version of the one
text: commercial love song on Bob Dylan’s otherwise perfectly bleak
dialog: album.
text: Dylan is simply on fire: screaming, stalking the stage,
text: letting out as many of the ghosts that haunt her as possible.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BACKSTAGE ROOM - LATER
text: Dylan gives a blowjob to the drummer of the band.
dialog: If it was hard to watch Will and Abby’s only daughter smoke
dialog: cigarettes, this is worse.
dialog: Way worse.
text: Adding to the horror, is the fact that HANGERS-ON and other
text: band members are watching this.
text: Laughing. Pointing.
text: A NEARBY GIRL is even video-ing the oral sex on her phone.
text: Finally Dylan stands, the act completed.
text: Without missing a beat she grabs the phone from the video-
text: taping girl and SMASHES it.
dialog: And like that...
text: Dylan calmly heads to a nearby card table and grabs herself a
text: SANDWICH from a pile of PB&J sandwiches (the band’s fuel, and
dialog: namesake).
text: She’s about to leave, when:
speaker_heading: GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: You owe me a new phone, Bitch.
text: Dylan looks up. It’s the girl whose phone she just smashed.
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (apologetic)
dialog: You're right. I’m sorry, I
dialog: shouldn’t have done that. It’s
dialog: just been a weird day for me and I
dialog: got heated.
text: She reaches toward her pocket.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, let me see what I have on me--
text: Without warning, Dylan attacks the girl.
text: It’s brutal - and admittedly strange - to watch a pretty
text: eighteen-year-old girl get so violent and so feral, so
dialog: quickly.
text: Dylan takes the other girl down and pins her. She starts
text: pummeling her.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You think that’s funny, taping me?

text: Dylan shakes off her “referees,” grabs a fresh sandwich, and
speaker_heading: EXITS.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Dylan walks back to that street corner where her mother died.
text: It’s late, very few cars.
text: Dylan looks out at the quiet street.
text: She lights a joint. Smokes it.
text: She takes a bite of her fresh sandwich. Chews.
text: She takes another hit from the joint.
dialog: And then...
speaker_heading: DYLAN’S POV
dialog: 58.
text: As she sees her mother and father, at that same street
dialog: corner, eighteen years earlier to the day:
dialog: It’s the scene we’ve seen before, but now their daughter
text: (back then unborn, but now eighteen) is there, too.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: .-. Will, in about three weeks
dialog: you’re going to have a daughter.
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: (top of her lungs)
text: NO HE’S NOT!!!! FUCKER’S GONNA
text: BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT WITHOUT EVER
dialog: MEETING ME!!!
text: But, of course, Will and Abby can’t hear her.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: Say something.
text: Slowly, Will smiles.
speaker_heading: ABBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: Now I get it.
speaker_heading: ABBY
dialog: What !?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: YOU DON’T GET IT, ASSHOLE! YOU
dialog: DON'T GET IT AT ALL!
speaker_heading: WILL
dialog: I know what you want to name her.

speaker_heading: DYLAN

speaker_heading: LADY!
speaker_heading: ABBY

speaker_heading: WILL

speaker_heading: DYLAN

text: HERE COMES THE BUSSSSS!
text: But suddenly a desperation takes over for Dylan.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom, look out.
dialog: (then)
text: Mom? MOM!!! LOOK OUT!
text: And suddenly we hear SCREECHING TIRES.
text: Dylan closes her eyes (she can’t watch).
text: When she opens them, the street is empty once more.
text: She recovers, takes a bite of her sandwich.
text: She breathes deeply, looks back up.
text: BUT NOW, IN FRONT OF HER...
text: The bus is back (or at least the memory of it).
text: Pressed up against the glass, inside the bus, is that little
text: four-year-old Hispanic boy.
text: His eyes are welling with tears.
text: Dylan’s eyes are, too.
text: They stare at each other.
speaker_heading: LITTLE BOY
dialog: Are you okay?
speaker_heading: DYLAN
dialog: Does it matter?
text: She takes a bite of her sandwich.
text: On the bus, the little boy cocks his head, taking her in.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: If four-year-old Rodrigo Gonzales

dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - 18 YEARS EARLIER
text: Little Rodrigo sits with his mother and father in the back of
text: a New York City bus.
text: Rodrigo is adorable, carefree, and curious.
text: He’s holding a plastic Statue of Liberty toy souvenir and
text: wearing an “I LOVE NEW YORK” T-shirt.
text: His blue-collar parents JAVIER (big smile, barrel-chested)
text: and ISABEL (beautifully tired, stoic) wear similar T-shirts.
text: They are fighting a losing battle to control their
text: rambunctious son. But they don’t seem to mind losing the
dialog: battle.
text: This family enjoys one another. They love, openly.
dialog: Important note to reader: all conversation within this story

speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: I want to go up front.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Sit, Hijo.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Oh, c’mon, Mamasita, let the boy
dialog: explore.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (amused smile)
dialog: And are you going to walk him up
dialog: and down the aisle?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: (playful teasing)
dialog: As a matter of fact I am.
text: Isabel rolls her eyes as Javier takes Rodrigo’s hand.
text: We follow little Rodrigo down the aisle as he somehow manages
text: to draw smiles from even this jaded New York commuter crowd.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: Hola... Hola... Hola...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Before their trip to New York City,
dialog: the Gonzales family had never
dialog: ventured outside of Spain.

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: The Andulucia region, to be more
dialog: specific.
text: Rodrigo stops toward the middle of the bus as a man
text: entertains him with a magic trick (coin in the ear).
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: They were simple, happy people,
text: from a simple, happy place.
dialog: Vacations did not come naturally to
dialog: them - frankly, it never occurred
dialog: to them that they might need a
dialog: break from anything.
text: A coin gets pulled from a euphoric Rodrigo’s ear. Javier
speaker_heading: LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: But little Rodrigo had become
dialog: obsessed with New York City. So
dialog: his loving father bought cheap
dialog: plane fares and booked the most rat-
dialog: infested Manhattan hotel
dialog: imaginable.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Until this moment, it had been the
dialog: trip of a lifetime.
text: Javier gets drawn into conversation (in Spanish) with a
text: nearby older woman as little Rodrigo keeps moving down the
dialog: aisle.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Again: simple people, with their
dialog: own simple, unique, brand of
dialog: happiness.
text: Javier looks back at his wife, winks at her.
text: Isabel smiles back, motions for him to keep an eye on Rodrigo
text: (who has run up toward the bus driver).
speaker_heading: ON RODRIGO:
text: Approaching the driver.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: Hola.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: (few steps behind)
text: Hijo, leave him.
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: BUS DRIVER
dialog: (looking down momentarily)
dialog: No, it’s oka--
text: Someone SCREAMS. The bus driver looks back up and SLAMS ON
text: THE BREAKS.
text: Rodrigo and Javier (the only ones standing) go flying.
dialog: Pandemonium. We’ve seen this all but from the outside
text: perspective. Now we’re inside the bus seeing:
text: Spectators SCREAMING.
text: Will Dempsey, outside, FRANTICALLY YELLING for the bus to
dialog: back up.
text: The BUS DRIVER doing so.
text: Little Rodrigo rising to his feet, unhurt, and seeing what's
dialog: beneath the bus (we don’t).
speaker_heading: RODRIGO’S POV:
text: His little body blocks our view of the horrifying carnage.
text: All we see is Abby Dempsey’s unharmed, enormously pregnant,
dialog: belly.
dialog: And, of course, we see Will Dempsey.
text: Rodrigo locks eyes with Will. His little eyes fill with
dialog: tears just as...
text: Javier (forehead bleeding) scoops Rodrigo up and carries him
text: away from the window.
text: As Javier carries Rodrigo back to his frantic mother,
text: checking for injuries, everything SLOWS.
text: CUE SONG: A Spanish version of Not Dark Yet by Bob Dylan.
dialog: Through the following, we stay with traumatized Rodrigo
text: (staring back at the scene of the crime).
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: The lives of two families were
dialog: forever changed that day. The
dialog: Dempseys were, as we know,
text: shattered - instantly and in full.
dialog: But for the Gonzales family, it
dialog: would take some time for the
dialog: effects of the accident to fully
dialog: take root.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: (then)

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OLIVE TREE GROVE (SEVILLE, SPAIN) - DAY
text: A LABORER’S ROUGH HANDS feel the earth around an OLIVE TREE’S
text: ROOTS, checking on dampness of the soil.
text: The hands pick up fallen OLIVES from the ground, check for
dialog: bruises.
speaker_heading: LATER:
scene_heading: THE SAME HANDS:
text: As they ever so gently slide olives off a small branch and
text: into a bucket (brucatura).
speaker_heading: WE WIDEN:
text: Revealing that the hands belong to a younger Javier
text: (Rodrigo’s father). He’s about ten years younger here.
text: There’s something beautiful about this big, barrel-chested
text: young man so gently caring for these olives.
scene_heading: WE WIDEN FURTHER:
text: Revealing a 200-ACRE OLIVE GROVE.
text: It’s harvest time, and all around Javier, OTHER LABORERS pick
text: olives from other trees.
text: The other laborers use an easier, and more common “by hand”
dialog: technique. What they are doing is called “a mano con telo” -
dialog: or, simply, “by hand with net.”
text: In a nutshell: they have placed LARGE NETS around the trunks
text: of the trees, and use a combination of RAKES and LADDERS to
text: loosen the olives en masse (which then fall into the nets).
text: But Javier just sits up high, WHISTLING, sliding those olives
text: into his bucket by hand - olive after olive.
text: A FANCY PICKUP approaches and a laborer calls out:
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: LABORER
dialog: He’s here.
text: MURMURS and CHEERS as everyone races toward the truck.
text: AN ELEGANT MAN (40s) steps out and greets his workers.
text: This is MR. SACCIONE. He’s Italian, dapper, and otherworldly
dialog: handsome.
dialog: And these guys fucking love him.
text: As he greets each man by name, and shakes their hands, he
text: looks off in the distance...
speaker_heading: TO JAVIER:
text: The only man still working. Sitting atop his ladder, sliding
text: olives into his bucket, contentedly.
text: The boss may have arrived, but for Javier nothing has
dialog: changed.
text: Though he has stopped whistling.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING
text: A stunning Spanish farmhouse. Views as far as the eye can
dialog: see.
text: Mr. Saccione sits at a desk, writing.
text: Behind him, young Javier steps into the room. He’s dirty
text: from work and clearly uncomfortable standing before his boss.
dialog: He debates how to announce his presence when...
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Javier, thank you for coming down.
text: Mr. Saccione turns.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: Come, sit. Sit.
text: Mr. Saccione motions at an armchair.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: Drink?
dialog: 65.
text: Javier shakes his head no. Mr. Saccione sits on the couch
text: opposite him.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: It occurs to me that we’ve never
dialog: really spoken. Five years I’ve
dialog: owned this land, Javier, and I
dialog: don’t think we’ve said more than a
text: few words to one another.
text: Javier shifts uncomfortably.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: I was raised in Italy, you know
dialog: this, yes? That I’m Italian? Aha,
dialog: yes, you know. But do you know
dialog: that I’m only half-Italian? This
dialog: is true, Javier! My Italian father
dialog: traveled to Andulucia as a young
dialog: man and this is where he met my
dialog: mother - did you know any of this?
dialog: Did you know my mother was from the
dialog: area?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: No, Senor.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: A royal fuck of a man, my father.
dialog: Few men have ever been worse, of
dialog: this I am certain, Javier. He met
dialog: my young mother, swept her off her
text: feet, then moved her away from
dialog: everything she knew and everyone
dialog: she loved. He was possessive and
dialog: controlling and abusive. And he
dialog: was rich, which makes a royal fuck
dialog: of a man like that particularly
dialog: dangerous-- are you sure I can’t
dialog: offer you a drink? Wine, tequila,
dialog: anything you want?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: (tentative)
dialog: Cervesa?
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Yes, of course! Cervesa!
text: Mr. Saccione hops to his feet, continues his story from the
dialog: next room:
dialog: 66.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: (yelling back)
dialog: So there’s my young mother - a full
text: blooded Spanish Andulucian cut off
dialog: from her family, living in the
dialog: Italian countryside - doesn’t speak
dialog: a word of Italian by the way-- it’s
dialog: a little warm, I’m sorry.
text: He’s returned, hands Javier the beer. He sits back down.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: My father decides he wants an
text: “Italian” wife. An “Italian”
dialog: family. So he disallows Spanish in
text: his home. He cuts off contact with
dialog: her family. Mama has nothing to
dialog: care about. No one to love. And
dialog: so... she gets pregnant. With me.
dialog: As I get older, we make a pact: she
dialog: will teach me Spanish, she will
dialog: teach me about that half of my
dialog: heritage - but my father must never
dialog: know. And over those years -—
dialog: whenever my father travels for work
dialog: - she secretly arranges for
dialog: packages to be shipped from her
dialog: homeland. Spanish foods and wines
dialog: and treats - we would eat them so
dialog: fast our stomach would swell,
dialog: Javier! Always making sure we
dialog: never left a trace that my father
dialog: might discover. Our favorite treat
dialog: was always the Spanish olive oil.
dialog: Can you imagine, Javier!? There we
dialog: are in the Italian countryside -
dialog: home to the richest olive oil in
text: the world - pouring Spanish olive
dialog: oil down our throats like you and I
dialog: now drink this cervesa. What a
dialog: pair Mama and I were. What a pair
dialog: indeed.
text: Mr. Saccione sips his beer.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: She died, my mother. When I was
dialog: just sixteen. As soon as she died,
dialog: that royal fuck of a man cut me
dialog: off. I lived in squalor through my
dialog: teens and twenties. He saw my
dialog: mother in me, Javier. And in my
dialog: mother he saw only a dirty Spaniard
dialog: who had ruined his life.
dialog: 67.
text: A beat. Slowly, Mr. Saccione smiles.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: Luckily for me: my father wasn’t
dialog: just a bigot, he was also a
dialog: narcissist. He never thought he
dialog: would die, even as he got older,
dialog: even as he got sicker. And so...
dialog: he never made a will.
dialog: (then)
dialog: The moment that royal fuck of a man
dialog: left this earth, I became a wildly
dialog: wealthy man, Javier. And the first
dialog: thing I did was buy this land back
dialog: in Andulucia, where I now grow
dialog: hundreds of acres of the olive oil
dialog: that Mama and I once hoarded. And
dialog: while business keeps me away most
dialog: of the time, this land is the only
dialog: thing that matters to me, Javier.
dialog: This land is my story, and it is my
dialog: mama’s story. It is everything to
dialog: me.
text: This hangs there. Mr. Saccione finishes off his beer.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: And so, Javier: that is why the
dialog: olives mean so much to me. And now
dialog: I must ask you: why do they mean so
dialog: much to you?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I do not follow.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
text: The other men use nets and rakes,
dialog: you pick by hand. You can only
dialog: pick half as many--
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: I work twice as long.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: No, I am aware. This is not
dialog: criticism, Javier. It is simply a
dialog: question. Why do you work harder
dialog: then the other men?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Because it’s the right way--
dialog: 68.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: (exploding)
dialog: Jesus, Javier, come on!
text: He quickly calms himself a little.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT'D)
dialog: I tell you my story. I tell you the
dialog: story of my fuck of a father and my
dialog: poor abused mother... and when I
dialog: ask you for the same all I get is
dialog: “because it’s the right way?”
dialog: (then, jovial again)
dialog: Come now, Javier! Drink your
dialog: cervesa! Tell me your story!
text: Javier thinks, puts down his beer.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I am a simple man. I do not have a
dialog: story. I did not have a fuck of a
dialog: father. My father was funny and
dialog: whistled why he worked, and I like
dialog: having a job where I can whistle
dialog: while I work, too. The rakes
dialog: bruise the olives so I pick them by
dialog: hand. It’s the right way. That is
dialog: all.
text: Mr. Saccione goes quiet.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Do you have a family?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I have a woman. I hope to make her
dialog: my wife.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Will you have children?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I believe so, yes. One day.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: The men love you. I hear you
dialog: telling them stories, making them
dialog: laugh.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I have a big mouth.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: But with me, you are reserved.
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: You are my boss.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: I wish to be your friend.
text: Javier shakes his head.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: No. I would disappoint you as your
dialog: friend.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: I disagre--
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I have given my answer.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: The other men admire me, and they
dialog: barely know me. But you - you hear
dialog: my story and it does not affect
dialog: you. It does not make you like me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s okay, you can be honest.
dialog: A beat, then:
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: No. It does not.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: May I ask why--
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I would not have taken his money.
text: A simple answer, from a simple man.
dialog: But it says everything.
text: Loaded silence.
text: Mr. Saccione nods, stands. He pours himself a tequila.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Would you like to live here and
dialog: oversee the men, Javier? As
dialog: Senorito? You and your future wife
dialog: and future children could live on
dialog: the property.
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: For free?
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Yes, of course there would be a
dialog: raise--
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: No. My salary is fair. The free
dialog: rent would be helpful enough.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I have one condition.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: You have a condition for getting a
dialog: raise?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I will take care of your land. I
dialog: will help it thrive and I will
dialog: treat it as my own. But my
dialog: whistling is for me, and my big
dialog: mouth is for the men. You will not
dialog: ask of that from me ever again.
dialog: (then)
dialog: In turn, I will be the one man here
dialog: to never ask anything of you.
dialog: As Mr. Saccione considers this...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Abby’s thesis was a total disaster.

dialog: might - that she had strayed from
dialog: literary criticism and had veered
dialog: into an unwieldy cross of creative
dialog: writing and seventeenth century
dialog: French philosophy. He said Abby
dialog: had essentially regurgitated the
dialog: philosopher Descartes who in his
dialog: Third and Fifth Meditations
dialog: discarded perception as unreliable -
dialog: which, Abby’s favorite and most
dialog: trusted professor argued, was all
dialog: Abby was really saying herself.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Then Abby's favorite and most

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Javier had worked hard to undo
text: Isabel's programming. Slowly, he
dialog: believed, she was starting to see
dialog: that she was special enough to
dialog: deserve a special life, even if it
dialog: was to be a simple one.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I want to show you something.
scene_heading: EXT. OLIVE GROVE - LATER
text: We push (high speed) through olive trees until we land on...
text: A group of shelters and sheds known, collectively, as a
speaker_heading: CORTIJO.
text: These are the structures on a farm (finca) which house
dialog: laborers, livestock, mills, etc.
text: The largest building is a two-story structure, the residence
text: for a SENORITO (Javier's new position).
text: He now stands in front of this charming two-story home,
dialog: showing it off to Isabel:
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: You will live here? All of this is
dialog: yours?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: No, Bonita. Ours. I would like it
dialog: to be ours.
text: She looks at him, surprised.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: I can make a life for us now. I
dialog: will not be a rich man, but I will
dialog: be a good one. TI have devoted
dialog: myself to you since the moment I
dialog: first saw you, but now I would like
dialog: to make it official. Isabel--
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Yes.
text: Javier stops.
speaker_heading: ISABEL (CONT'D)
dialog: I answer yes. Yes to everything.
text: Javier smiles, grabs her.
scene_heading: CUE: a CANTE JONDO SONG. Cante Jondo translates as “deep
text: song” - a weighty style of Andulucian Flamenco. It’s
dialog: basically the Flamenco blues.
text: There is a staccato vocal driving the song that feels like
text: euphoric celebration one moment, desperate sadness the next.
dialog: It feels like life.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MAIN ROOM - LATER
text: Javier and Isabel dance.
text: As they do, the camera circles them - leaving one of them,
text: picking up the other, over and over again.
text: As the camera circles... years pass.
text: Facial hair changes for Javier each time we return to him.
text: Hairstyles for Isabel each time we return to her.
text: Eventually, Isabel becomes pregnant.
dialog: 77.
text: They keep dancing, her belly growing larger and larger.
text: Eventually, there’s a baby held between them (little
dialog: Rodrigo).
text: As we continue to circle, and they continue to dance, Rodrigo
text: grows to four years old (the age we first met him at).
text: Throughout this (from outside the large bay window behind
text: them), we sometimes catch MR. SACCIONE, watching them dance.
text: Usually he looks on with a smile, happy for the sweet young
dialog: lovers.
text: But occasionally, there’s a glint of something different in
text: his eye. Is it jealousy? Is he coveting Isabel? Their
dialog: love? Their new son?
dialog: It’s probably nothing.
dialog: But if it’s nothing, why does the Flamenco music always sound
text: a little more ominous when the camera finds him?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. JAVIER & ISABEL’S HOME - MORNING
text: Isabel makes coffee on a small wood-burning stove.
text: She looks towards the small kitchen table where:
dialog: Mr. Saccione plays with little Rodrigo (4). He’s brought
text: Rodrigo a beautiful GLOBE.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: .-. and over there, Javier, that is
dialog: America.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: New York?
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Yes, New York, you remember this!?
dialog: (to Isabel)
dialog: What a child this is! He remembers
dialog: my story of traveling to New York
dialog: from weeks ago, and now connects it
dialog: to the proper country!
text: Isabel smiles, delivers the coffee.
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: He remembers everything you teach
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Isabel could no longer remember
dialog: when Mr. Saccione first started
text: coming over to visit Rodrigo.
text: ON MR. SACCIONE and RODRIGO, bonding. Isabel watches.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: She only knew that the visits had
dialog: become more consistent. Usually in
dialog: the middle of the day, always when
text: Javier was in the fields.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: In English, Rodrigo, Nueva York is
dialog: “New York,” can you say this? New
dialog: York?
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: New York.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: What a child! In perfect imitation
dialog: of the accent no less! I just love
dialog: this child!
text: Isabel flinches, slightly uncomfortable with that sentiment
text: coming from him.
text: Mr. Saccione notices, goes quiet.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Isabel liked Mr. Saccione. She
dialog: liked the things he exposed Rodrigo
dialog: to - a breadth of knowledge and
dialog: experience that she and Javier
dialog: could never access. So while she
dialog: had never hidden Mr. Saccione’s
dialog: visits from her husband, it was
dialog: fair to say she'd undersold their
dialog: frequency and intensity.
text: Mr. Saccione stands, approaches Isabel.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: I apologize. I overstay my welcome--
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: No--
dialog: 79.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Yes, I do. I have many great
dialog: things in my life, Mrs. Gonzales,
dialog: but I fear my strange upbringing
dialog: has left me with such scars... I
dialog: have been unable to find the
dialog: greatest of things. It is not fair
dialog: for me to try and fill that void
dialog: here.
text: He’s close to Isabel. It’s a bit intimate, quiet.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Don’t be silly. We enjoy having
dialog: you. Rodrigo loves you.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: This is kind of you to say. He is
dialog: truly such a special boy. Oh the
dialog: things I might teach him one day!
dialog: English and literature and--
speaker_heading: JAVIER (0.S.)
dialog: Hello, Mr. Saccione.
text: Isabel and Mr. Saccione whirl. Javier stands in the doorway.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Ah, Javier, good, I came to talk to
dialog: you about the extension to the mill
dialog: and brought a gift for your son--
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Thank you, but my son has enough
dialog: toys.
text: Javier takes the globe away from Rodrigo.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (crying)
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Javier.
text: Javier shoots her a look, silencing her, and hands Mr.
dialog: Saccione back the globe.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: It is too generous, Jefe. Now
dialog: come, let me fill you in on the
dialog: status of the mill.
dialog: (pointedly)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: And from here forth, when you need
dialog: me, you can just send word. I will
dialog: come to you and save you the trip.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: (getting it)
dialog: Of course.
text: Mr. Saccione tips his cap toward Isabel and Rodrigo.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (through tears)
dialog: I want to go to New York with him!
text: As Javier escorts Mr. Saccione out of his home, he looks back
text: at his wife.
text: She looks equal parts furious (at Javier) and ashamed (of
dialog: herself).
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Javier Gonzales was a simple man,
dialog: but not a stupid one. And that
dialog: day, he began doing something he'd
dialog: never done before: planning a
dialog: family vacation. To a place that -
dialog: he’d just learned - his son
dialog: desperately wanted to visit with
text: someone else.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY
text: In FLASHES, we watch the Gonzales family enjoy their New York
dialog: City vacation:
text: - They walk the streets of Manhattan. Rambunctious Rodrigo
text: points out everything, enamored with the scope of the city.
text: - The family sleeps (all in one bed) in a cramped youth
text: hostile. They are surrounded by backpackers and vagrants.
text: But they sleep contentedly, happy as can be. A true family.
text: - They take in the Statue of Liberty.
dialog: - They buy crappy “I love NYC” T-shirts.
text: - They sit in the back of a bus, wearing their new T-shirts
dialog: (we’ve seen this already).
text: - Javier chases rambunctious Rodrigo down the aisle of the
dialog: bus (we’ve seen this, too).
dialog: 81.
text: - Javier (bloody) carries Rodrigo away from the front of the
dialog: bus, post accident.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
text: A pregnant woman eviscerated by a
text: bus. A grown man weeping,

dialog: brain for years to come.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. RODRIGO’S BEDROOM (SPAIN) - NIGHT
text: Little Rodrigo tosses and turns in bed.

scene_heading: INT. RODRIGO’S BEDROOM - LATER
text: Isabel tries to calm her sweaty child, a cold compress on his
dialog: head.
text: Javier watches from the doorway. He shifts, unsure what to
dialog: do.
dialog: Everything that makes Javier Gonzales great elsewhere, makes
dialog: him ill equipped here.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: It was textbook early childhood
dialog: trauma... and it was happening to a
dialog: family without any textbooks.
scene_heading: INT. JAVIER & ISABEL’S HOME - DAY
text: Rodrigo (now 5) throws a tantrum as Isabel tries to get him
dialog: to eat.
text: Javier ENTERS, closing the door behind him. The door

text: Javier and Isabel share a look.
dialog: 82.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Javier and Isabel fight. Angrily.

scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL - DAY
text: Rodrigo (now 6) gets in a fight on the playground with
text: another LITTLE BOY.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - DAY
text: Javier and Isabel fight again. In a heated moment, Javier
text: punches the wall next to Isabel’s head.
text: He recoils at himself.
text: She runs off. He grabs a BOTTLE and starts drinking.
scene_heading: INT. RODRIGO’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Rodrigo, in bed, SCREAMS again... startling himself awake.
text: He has wet the bed, per usual.
scene_heading: INT. JAVIER & ISABEL 'S BEDROOM — CONTINUOUS
text: Isabel and Javier lie in bed. They hear Rodrigo’s SCREAM
text: from the next room and Isabel STANDS to go to him.
text: Clearly this has become routine.
text: She stops at the bedroom door.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: He is not getting better, Javier.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: I know.
text: This hangs there.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: He doesn’t talk about it. I try
dialog: but... he can’t. Or he won’t.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: It was just one moment. How can
dialog: one moment just...
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: (then, convincing himself)
dialog: He was so little. Soon he’1l

text: But Javier's eyes betray him.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: We need to get him help.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: We took him to all the doctors--
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: He needs specialists. In Madrid.
dialog: The doctors the rich people would
dialog: go to.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: We are not rich people.
text: Isabel looks at Javier. He suddenly gets what she’s asking.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: He is our son, Javier. He is our
text: little boy and he is in pain.
text: Javier looks at his beautiful wife. She’s pleading with her
text: eyes. He nods.
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: If you want, I will ask hi--
speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: (sharply)
dialog: No.
dialog: (then, loving)

speaker_heading: JAVIER (0.S.)
dialog: Excuse me, Sir?

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: The things we do for our children
dialog: are often the worst things we do to

scene_heading: INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - DAY
text: Rodrigo works in a room with a THERAPIST. He draws pictures,
dialog: plays with toys, etc.
text: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VIEWING WINDOW: Mr. Saccione,
text: Isabel, and Javier watch.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Money cannot buy happiness. Good

dialog: spared no expense when it came to
dialog: helping little Rodrigo Gonzales.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - LATER
text: The Therapist talks to Mr. Saccione and Isabel.
text: Javier is there, of course, but his body language indicates
text: that he’s become a mere support figure.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: The diagnosis was, as expected,
dialog: textbook: clinical early childhood
dialog: trauma at an age when Rodrigo’s
dialog: still developing brain had been
dialog: particularly at risk.
text: The Therapist continues talking. Mr. Saccione asks the bulk
text: of the questions. Javier blinks, trying to understand.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: It would take time, but it was
dialog: treatable. In therapist speak,
dialog: Rodrigo would need to learn to
dialog: create a coherent narrative about
dialog: what happened that day. Being able
dialog: to tell the story of the event
dialog: would help him master his feelings.
dialog: And one day there might be a
text: breakthrough, a moment when Rodrigo
dialog: could fully accept what had
text: happened to him and begin to move
dialog: forward.
dialog: 85.
text: Mr. Saccione takes notes. Javier watches, completely out of
dialog: his depth.
text: A spectator in his own son’s life.
scene_heading: INT. JAVIER & ISABEL’S HOME - MORNING
text: Mr. Saccione gives Rodrigo a BIRD as a gift (red ribbon on

text: Isabel and Javier watch.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Months passed. Mr. Saccione’s
dialog: visits were no longer restricted,

speaker_heading: RODRIGO (0.S.)
dialog: Dear Dylan. My name is Rodrigo

dialog: Rod. I am from Spain. My uncle
dialog: presented me--
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE

speaker_heading: RODRIGO (V.O.)
dialog: I was there the day you were born.
dialog: I was on the bus.
scene_heading: INT. IRWIN’S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Irwin and Linda (Dylan’s grandmother) read the letter at the

dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO (V.O.)

dialog: Actually, I wonder about you every

scene_heading: INT. DYLAN DEMPSEY’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Linda reads the letter to Dylan (age six).
speaker_heading: RODRIGO (V.O.)
dialog: I was sad for a long time but my

speaker_heading: DYLAN (V.O.)
dialog: You spell really good my Nana says,
dialog: and you seem like a very nice boy

scene_heading: INT. JAVIER & ISABEL’S HOME —- CONTINUOUS
text: Mr. Saccione bursts into the house. Isabel and Rodrigo turn.
text: He holds up the letter, excitedly.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (V.O.)
dialog: I think you are lucky that you have
dialog: a bird. I have a dog. He is my
dialog: best friend.
text: Mr. Saccione hands Rodrigo the letter. Rodrigo slowly opens
text: it, reads.
speaker_heading: DYLAN (V.O.)
dialog: Do you like pizza? I mainly like
dialog: pizza and dogs. But dogs more.
dialog: From, Dylan Dempsey.
dialog: (then)
dialog: P.S. - I’m okay. Thank you for
dialog: asking.
text: Rodrigo looks up from the letter, dazed. Tears well in his
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: She’s okay.
dialog: And in that moment, we can see that Rodrigo is going to be
dialog: okay, too.
text: He walks over to his mother, repeats:
speaker_heading: RODRIGO (CONT’D)
dialog: She’s okay.
text: Isabel nods. Rodrigo hugs his mother and he starts crying.

speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Yes.

speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (CONT’D)
dialog: I had pure intentions. You may not

speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: But your father certainly would be.
dialog: You’ve turned out to be your

dialog: For Mr. Saccione, this cuts deeply.
text: He stands, approaches Javier. Mr. Saccione looks him dead in
text: the eye, determined.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: I give you my word: I will stay
dialog: away from them. Your son is
dialog: healing, he doesn’t need me

speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: You did nothing, Javier!

speaker_heading: ISABEL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JAVIER

speaker_heading: SLAP!

speaker_heading: ISABEL

speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: You deserve mor--
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Do not tell me what I deserve,

dialog: Even as a little girl I knew! Even
dialog: when my Abuela - my favorite Abuela

scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - DAY
dialog: Abuela counsels little Isabel (7) - we’ve seen this before:
speaker_heading: ABUELA

speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: So look me in those eyes you love

speaker_heading: ISABEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (strong)
dialog: That boy is all I have. And his

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: If we’ve learned anything by now,

dialog: But damn if little Rodrigo Gonzales

scene_heading: EXT. OLIVE GROVE (SEVILLE, SPAIN)
text: Rodrigo runs through the olive groves, a child at play.
text: As he runs through the trees, we continually pan down to his
text: shoes, and back up to his face.
dialog: Back and forth.
text: As we do... the shoes change, and Rodrigo ages.
text: And as Rodrigo evolves during this one single shot/run, his

speaker_heading: RODRIGO (V.O.)
dialog: Where’s Papa?
speaker_heading: ISABEL (V.O.)
dialog: Papa went away for a bit, Hijo.

speaker_heading: RODRIGO (V.O.)

speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (V.O.)
dialog: Now read it again, in English.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO (V.O.)
dialog: (reading)
dialog: YOU don’t know about me without you
dialog: have read a book by the name of The
dialog: Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that
dialog: ain’t no matter.
text: Rodrigo starts filling out, running harder. He becomes a pre-

speaker_heading: TEACHER (V.O.)
dialog: Rodrigo is my finest student, Ms.

dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: TEACHER #2 (V.O.)
dialog: The most popular boy in my class.
speaker_heading: COACH (V.O.)
dialog: A tremendous athlete your son. A

dialog: Are you a virgin?
speaker_heading: RODRIGO (0.S.)
dialog: I am.
speaker_heading: GIRL (0.S.)
dialog: Would you like not to be?
text: Now he’s a fully-grown eighteen year old. Movie star
dialog: handsome.
text: He’s no longer running through the olive groves for “play.”
text: Now he’s running for sport. Driven.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (0.S.)
dialog: We think he can get an academic

speaker_heading: COACH (0.S.)

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE (0.S.)

text: Rodrigo throws down his bag. He bolts through the house.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: I got in! NYU! Early Admission!
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: New York had once captivated
text: Rodrigo’s imagination, then haunted
dialog: it, and eventually captivated it
dialog: again.
text: Rodrigo takes the stairs, two at a time...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: So it came as no surprise that he
dialog: would be subconsciously drawn back
dialog: to the city one day.
dialog: (then)
dialog: But life tends not to forecast its
dialog: biggest surprises.
text: Rodrigo enters a bedroom to find...
text: ISABEL and MR. SACCIONE (both aged nine years) sitting on a

speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Absolutely not.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (gentle)
dialog: It is not your decision, Mama.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Isabel, with all that is happening--
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: I said no.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (again, firmly)
dialog: And I said that it is not your

speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: Hij--
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (firm)
dialog: I can give you this.
text: He leans in. Takes their hands.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO (CONT’D)
dialog: We will fix this, Mama. We will
dialog: fix this the way you fixed me.
dialog: Look at me. Both of you, look at
dialog: me.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We will fix you.
text: Mr. Saccione nods. He squeezes Rodrigo’s hand.
text: As they sit there like this, our Narrator repeats an earlier
dialog: sentiment:
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Money cannot buy happiness. But
dialog: good health, is sometimes very much
dialog: for sale.
dialog: 99.
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL - LATER
text: Isabel receives chemo.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - LATER

dialog: Waiting for something to change.
scene_heading: EXT. OLIVE GROVE - LATER
text: Rodrigo (now with a young man’s sparse beard) picks olives
text: the same way his father once did... by hand, into a bucket.
text: All around him, men use the more typical (and faster)
text: techniques involving rakes and nets.
scene_heading: IN THE DISTANCE
text: Mr. Saccione watches Rodrigo. He smiles sadly. For many
dialog: reasons.
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE - LATER
text: Rodrigo reads by the fire. Mr. Saccione steps into the room.
speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: Your mother asks for you.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER
text: Rodrigo stops at the door, looks in at his mother.
dialog: What we see is shocking:
dialog: 100.
text: Isabel has been ravaged by cancer. Bald. Almost
text: unrecognizable.
text: She motions for Rodrigo to come closer. He does. She speaks
text: quietly.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: It has been two years, Hijo. I do
dialog: not get better. Vincent spends
dialog: enough so I do not get worse. I
dialog: just... survive. And you just
dialog: wait. It is enough.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: Mama-—
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (lovingly)
dialog: It is enough, Hijo.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Listen to me, come here.
text: She pulls him toward her. She starts talking, very softly.
dialog: We do not translate this. We do not need to. She is telling
text: him to leave her.
text: And as the mother releases the son from his duty... the son
text: cries.
text: He cries because what she says is powerful and because he
dialog: knows she is right.
text: It is time for Rodrigo Gonzales to start his life.
scene_heading: INT. NYU CLASSROOM - DAY
text: Rodrigo sits in a class, taking notes.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Rodrigo entered NYU a twenty-one-

dialog: been doing for most of the previous
dialog: decade, he thrived.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAY
text: A cross-country track meet.
text: Rodrigo bursts from the woods, running in a full sprint. He

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: He lettered in two sports.

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: He even embarked on a relationship
text: with a nineteen-year-old Jewish
dialog: American Princess from Long Island
dialog: named Shari Dickstein. She made
dialog: him laugh. Usually not
dialog: intentionally.
text: Shari breaks from their kiss.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Oh my gawd, I totally forgot to
dialog: tell you, I was at Whole Foods, and
dialog: Rina Rothman was there - such a pig
dialog: - anyway--
text: As Shari continues (and Rodrigo suppresses a laugh):
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: She wasn’t his great love, but she
dialog: was company, and great love wasn’t
text: his priority at the moment.
scene_heading: INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
text: Rodrigo sits in economy class, sleeping.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: He saved every dollar, coveted

dialog: had an internal compass, and it
dialog: always pointed in the same
dialog: direction.
dialog: 102.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM —- MORNING
text: Rodrigo sits by the bedside of his mother, entertaining her.

dialog: Dickstein...
text: He shows a picture from his phone.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: But what is she like, Hijo? Tell
dialog: me.
text: Rodrigo thinks for a beat, then:
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
text: She’s loud.
text: Isabel and Mr. Saccione explode LAUGHING.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Like so many of the biggest years
dialog: of our lives, it flew by. But in
dialog: truth, that year was just a setup -
dialog: a preamble to the biggest day of
dialog: Rodrigo Gonzales’ life: March 31st,
dialog: 2032.
scene_heading: CHYRON: MARCH 31st, 2032.
scene_heading: INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING

speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Where you going?
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
text: Just going for a quick run.
text: A beat.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Bonita.
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: When we started dating you called
dialog: me “Bonita.” You would have said:
dialog: “Just going for a quick run,
dialog: Bonita.”
dialog: (then)
dialog: It always made me feel like Kelly
dialog: Ripa.
text: A loaded beat, then:
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: Shari--
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: I’m pregnant.
text: Fuck. Rodrigo’s world spins like a top.
text: Shari sits up, starts dressing.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: I know. Lots to talk about, obvi.
dialog: Hey - will you take me for brunch?
dialog: There’s this place I want to try,
dialog: it’s Vietnamese, I’m assuming
dialog: that’s like Dim Sum or something
dialog: but I’m dying to try it.
text: Rodrigo just stands there, speechless.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: We can talk at brunch. At the
dialog: Vietnamese place. I really want to
dialog: try it.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER
text: Rodrigo and Shari walk down the city street.
text: Shari talks a mile a minute. Rodrigo just stares, lost.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: So I just started feeling shitty a
dialog: few weeks ago. I thought I was
dialog: just getting a really bad period,
dialog: ever since I got off the pill I’ve
dialog: been getting bananas periods, you
dialog: know?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: But it wasn’t stopping so I went to
dialog: my gyno and he was like “are you
dialog: sexually active” and I told him
dialog: about you and then he did the test
dialog: thing and blammo. I hadn’t even
dialog: thought to try an at-home test, for
dialog: whatever reason my brain didn’t go
dialog: there what-so-fucking-ever.
text: Beat. Rodrigo just stares. She continues, nonplussed.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyways, I know we haven’t been
dialog: together very long and clearly this
dialog: is as what-the-fuck as you get. I
dialog: don’t really know what your deal is
dialog: with religious stuff, but I think I
dialog: should probably just get an
dialog: abortion.
text: She turns back to him.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you like super against that?
dialog: Abortion?
text: Shari has stopped out in the street, looking back at Rodrigo.
text: Rodrigo, still speechless, looks to her right.
text: A TAXI is speeding down the side street right at her.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT’D)
dialog: I know abortion’s a big thing for
dialog: Christians - you’re Christian I
dialog: assu-—
text: At the last second, Rodrigo grabs her arm and pulls her back
dialog: to safety.
text: The CABBIE blares on his horn. Shari barely notices.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyhow, we don’t have to decide all
dialog: this now, but I would like to make
dialog: the call early before the thing has
text: a head and stuff.
text: Rodrigo stares.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 105.
scene_heading: INT. VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT - LATER
text: Shari eats noodles sloppily.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: So the way I see it, we have like
dialog: three options...
text: She SLURPS. Rodrigo’s brain explodes with each slurp.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: Option One: we have it. I mean, a
dialog: mixed race baby with our skin
text: complexions would be amazeballs.
dialog: My family has batshit money, we
dialog: could get nannies and stuff, I
dialog: don’t know, probably a bad idea.
text: SLURP. Brain explosion.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: Option Two: abort. But again, I'd
dialog: like to make that call sooner than
text: later before the thing has a head
dialog: and stuff.
text: SLURP. Brain explosion.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT'D)
dialog: Or Option Three: we can just agree
text: this is all an insane APRIL FOOL'S
dialog: JOKE!!!!
text: A long beat of silence.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: (confused)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: April Fool's, Bitch!
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: What is that?
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Seriously? You don’t know April
dialog: Fool's?
text: Rodrigo stares blankly at her.
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: SHARI (CONT’D)
dialog: On the first day of April you play
dialog: practical jokes on people and yell
dialog: April Fool’s!
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: But it’s March 31st.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: I thought you'd see it coming if I
dialog: did it on April Fool's Day.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: I didn’t even know what April
dialog: Fool’s Day was.
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Well I didn’t know that.
dialog: Rodrigo processes.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: So there’s no baby?
speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Dude, no! Oh c’mon, that was

text: Rodrigo puts down his napkin. Breathes deeply.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO

speaker_heading: SHARI
dialog: Oh fuck, you’re going to break up
dialog: with me aren't you?
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: He was.
dialog: As we watch Rodrigo do the deed...
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (V.O.)
dialog: Obviously nothing thus far had
dialog: indicated that March 31st would be
dialog: the most important day of Rodrigo’s
dialog: life. The entire day - as so many
dialog: of life’s days are - had been a
text: misdirect. A fake out.

speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)

speaker_heading: NARRATOR

dialog: He always had been. He believed in
dialog: the power of the written word, the
dialog: force of actually sitting down and
text: writing to someone by hand.
dialog: (then)
dialog: The bulk of Mr. Saccione’s letters
dialog: were to one man:
dialog: We see the letter heading: Dear Papa.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT’D)
dialog: Almost every day - his own private

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: MR. SACCIONE
dialog: (to Javier)
dialog: I give you my word: I will stay

speaker_heading: JAVIER
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: JAVIER (CONT'D)
dialog: They are better off with you. I

speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: When critics reviewed Abby
dialog: Dempsey’s favorite album - Bob
dialog: Dylan’s 1997 release, Time out of
dialog: Mind - the song “To Make You Feel
dialog: My Love” was the source of much
dialog: criticism. Every track on the
text: album brimmed with unrelenting
text: melancholy and sadness. But there,
text: smack in the middle of it all, sat
text: an unabashedly populist hit song.
dialog: A love song. A song that in years
dialog: to come would be covered by Garth
dialog: Brooks, of all people. Critics
dialog: argued that putting an on-the-nose
text: love song in the middle of an album
dialog: about despair and tragedy, was
text: Dylan's only misstep.

speaker_heading: ELENA (CONT'D)
dialog: My parents found the populist love
dialog: song in the middle of our family’s
dialog: often very melancholy album.
text: Out in the crowd: Rodrigo smiles, takes Dylan’s hand.
text: Elena smiles back at them, continues reading:
speaker_heading: ELENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I wonder sometimes what my
dialog: grandmother Abby would have made of
dialog: that, philosophically. That her
dialog: own child - the girl she named
dialog: after her favorite gravel voiced
dialog: musician - found a love story with
dialog: no twists, no plot turns, and no
dialog: surprises. Just consistency. Oh,
dialog: what I’d have given to have met
dialog: her. To have told her that. To
dialog: have told her that we were all
dialog: okay.
dialog: (then)
dialog: And what I’d have given to have met
dialog: my grandmother Isabel as well.
dialog: Unlike Abby, she was neither a
dialog: writer nor a philosopher. But
dialog: sometimes I wonder if she didn’t
dialog: understand exactly what Bob Dylan
dialog: was going for.
scene_heading: FLASHBACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. FARMHOUSE BEDROOM - DECADES AGO
text: We're back with Isabel, sick in bed, saying goodbye to twenty-
text: one-year-old Rodrigo before sending him off to NYU.
dialog: This is the scene we didn’t translate before.
speaker_heading: RODRIGO
dialog: Mama-—
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: (lovingly)
dialog: It is enough, Hijo.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Listen to me, come here.
text: She pulls him toward her. She starts talking, very softly.
speaker_heading: ELENA (V.O.)
dialog: Spanish does not often translate
dialog: perfectly, but what Isabel said
dialog: that day to her son - my father -
dialog: it required no translation.
dialog: Note: this is the same speech we saw earlier in Spanish
text: without translation, but now it is actually delivered by
dialog: Isabel in English.
speaker_heading: ISABEL
dialog: You have had many ups and downs in
dialog: your life, Hijo. Too many. And
dialog: you will have more. This is life.
dialog: This is what it does. Life brings
dialog: you to your knees. It brings you
dialog: lower than you think you can go.
dialog: But if you stand back up and move
dialog: forward - if you go just a little
dialog: further - you will always find
dialog: love.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I found love in you, Hijo. And my
dialog: life - my story - it will continue
dialog: after I am gone. You, Hijo, are my
dialog: story. You are your father’s
dialog: story. You are your uncle’s.
text: Rodrigo is crying now.
speaker_heading: ISABEL (CONT'D)
dialog: My body fails me, Hijo. But you
dialog: ARE me. So you go now. Give me a
dialog: beautiful life. And when life
dialog: takes us to our knees, you stand us
dialog: back up. You get up, and go
dialog: further, and find us the love.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
scene_heading: INT. BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: As Elena continues:
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: ELENA
dialog: I am not sure whose story I have
dialog: been telling. I am not sure it is
dialog: mine, or if it some character’s who
dialog: we've not met yet. I’m not sure of
dialog: anything. All I know, is that at
dialog: any moment, life will surprise me.
dialog: It will bring me to my knees. And
dialog: when it does. When I think I
dialog: cannot recover, I will remind
dialog: myself...
text: She looks out, finds her parents.
speaker_heading: ELENA (CONT'D)
dialog: I will remind myself that I am my
dialog: father. That I am my father’s
dialog: father. And I am my mother, and my
dialog: mother’s mother. I am their story,
dialog: and they are mine. And while it
dialog: may be easy to wallow in the
dialog: tragedies that shape our lives...
dialog: while it’s natural to focus on
dialog: those unspeakable moments that
dialog: bring us to our knees... we must
dialog: remind ourselves that if we get up,
dialog: if we just take the story a little
dialog: bit further...
text: She is crying now. She looks directly at her parents.
speaker_heading: ELENA (CONT'D)
dialog: If we go far enough, there is love.
text: Her parents are crying now, too.
speaker_heading: ELENA (CONT'D)
dialog: (again)
dialog: If we go far enough, there’s love.
text: Elena closes her book.
text: Rodrigo and Dylan beam at their youngest daughter, the latest
dialog: hero in our ever-evolving story.
dialog: And with that, our story does what our story never really
dialog: does...
text: It ends.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
dialog:
