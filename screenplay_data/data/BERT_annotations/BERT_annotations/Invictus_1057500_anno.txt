dialog: - negotiations with the apartheid regime

dialog: - the horrifying sectarian violence leading up to the

dialog: 
text: On the bedside table, the clock clicks from 4:59 to 5:00.

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Dressed in a tracksuit and cross-trainers, Mandela comes down

dialog: 
dialog: This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the
dialog: President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous
dialog: man on the planet.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mandela steps outside, closes his front door quietly, takes a
text: moment to savor the air. It is bone dry and cold -- typical
dialog: conditions in the Highveld at this time of year.
dialog: 
text: It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is
text: completely alone in the world.
dialog: 
text: The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the
text: driveway gate.
dialog: 
text: When Mandela steps away from the house, A UNIFORMED SOUTH
text: AFRICAN POLICEMAN IN THE GUARDHOUSE pushes the button that
text: opens the gate.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANDELA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. GREY BMW - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: LINGA MOONSAMY comes to full alert as the gate opens. He is

speaker_heading: JASON
text: It makes him such an easy target.

speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: (without breaking stride)
dialog: Morning boys. How are you?

speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: Good.
dialog: 
text: Mandela picks up the pace. Jason and Linga fall back, so
text: that they are a few steps behind him.
dialog: 
text: They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares

dialog: 
dialog: (A GENERAL NOTE: starting with the window of this grocery,
text: there are pictures of Mandela everywhere. Magazine covers,

dialog: make up for all the time Mandela's image and words were
dialog: banned.)

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: BOTH MEN DROP THEIR HANDS TO THEIR GUNS. Linga steps in

dialog: 
text: Mandela is completely calm. The van screeches to a halt just

dialog: 
text: A GUY jumps out of the van holding a tied BUNDLE OF

text: The guy doesn't see them. The delivery van is gone before

dialog: 
text: Mandela heads for the newspapers -- he wants to see the
dialog: headlines.
dialog: 
text: Jason and Linga take their hands off their guns, but they do
dialog: not relax. These are dangerous times.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON

scene_heading: INT. MANDELA'S HOUSE - BEFORE DAWN

dialog:

text: that is empty but for a WOMAN'S BEADED BRACELET, broken and
text: shedding tiny colored beads.
dialog: 
text: Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer,
text: looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is
text: warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost
dialog: all the time.
dialog: 
text: But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask
dialog: that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison
dialog: face.
dialog: 
text: This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in
text: the mirror. It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey
dialog: has marked his very soul.

text: Etienne snaps out a crisp salute.

speaker_heading: ETIENNE
dialog: Captain Van Eck and team reporting

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: What duty?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ETIENNE
dialog: We're the Presidential bodyguard.

speaker_heading: (TO HENDRICK)
dialog: You're Special Branch, right?

speaker_heading: ETIENNE
dialog: You'll see that they've been

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON

scene_heading: orders: NELSON R. MANDELA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Wait here.

speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Sorry to disturb you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: You look agitated, Jason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: That's because I've got four

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: What have you done?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Me? Nothing. They say they're the

dialog: orders.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Signed by you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: Yes. They've had special training,

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: Yes, I know.
speaker_heading: (VERY GENTLY)
dialog: Forgiveness starts here, too.
dialog: 
text: Mandela lets that sink in for a moment. He knows he asks for

speaker_heading: JASON

scene_heading: INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

dialog: schedule.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ETIENNE
dialog: Are there any special orders or

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: No. Yes. Madiba gets upset if you

speaker_heading: ETIENNE
dialog: We'll call him Mr. President.

text: Jason lifts the schedule.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON

dialog: 
text: Still upset and hostile, the black bodyguards look over
text: Jason's shoulder, the white bodyguards look over Etienne's,

dialog: 
text: Apartheid is by no means dead in this cramped little office.

dialog: 
text: On the field, THE RUGBY TEAMS ASSEMBLE and face each other in
text: two lines. The BRITISH LIONS in their white on white with
text: black and red trim, the SPRINGBOKS in their green and gold.
dialog: 
text: Like their supporters, the Springboks are all white, but for
text: one man, who is "colored" (mixed race).

dialog: intense -- none more so than Jason.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: (shouting against the
speaker_heading: NOISE)
dialog: I want your eyes on the crowd at
dialog: all times. We're staying in the
text: middle of the field. He's going to
text: walk out, shake hands, walk back.
dialog: Nothing else. Got it?
dialog: 
text: They nod. They are like the players at game time, only the
text: stakes are much higher. Jason looks deeper into the tunnel,
text: straightens up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: Here we go.
dialog: 
text: Mandela strides down the tunnel towards them, wearing a dark
text: suit. Big crowds energize him. His eyes are alive with
dialog: excitement.
dialog: 
text: One pace behind him, like a huge, dark shadow, comes Linga.
dialog: 
text: Mandela gives Jason a look, Jason nods.
dialog: 
text: We follow Mandela and the bodyguards out of the tunnel --
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - DAY
dialog: 
text: -- onto the field, towards the waiting teams.
dialog: 
text: The crowd rise to their feet. Lots of them jeer Mandela,
text: lots cheer. All the old South African flags are waved at him
text: defiantly -- plus some new ones.
dialog: 
text: Mandela waves to them all, smiling proudly. To him, a crowd
text: is an opportunity to make new friends. But he stays in the
text: center of the field.
dialog: 23.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Jason and crew are hyper-alert, a human fence around Mandela.

speaker_heading: PIENAAR
speaker_heading: (SHAKING HANDS)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
dialog: 
text: Mandela shakes hands down the line of Springboks, then
text: returns, shaking hands with the British Lions. Quick,
text: perfunctory handshakes.
dialog: 
text: As Mandela does this, we take BODYGUARD POV SNAPSHOTS of the
text: crowd, increasingly keyed-up and restless. Time to play
dialog: rugby.
dialog: 
text: Mandela finishes, waves to the crowd, and begins the walk
text: along the center of the field, back to the tunnel.
dialog: 
text: Crowd noise increases. They know the opening whistle is
text: about to blow.
dialog: 
text: Then, Mandela sees something in the crowd, at field level.
dialog: 
text: MANDELA'S POV: A GROUP OF ROUGH-LOOKING WHITE MEN WAVE THE
text: NEW SOUTH AFRICAN FLAG AT HIM.
dialog: 
text: WITHOUT WARNING, MANDELA CHANGES DIRECTION, heads towards
text: this group, towards a wall of his former -- and perhaps
dialog: current -- enemies.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: Thank you for honoring our new
dialog: flag!
dialog: 
text: Some shake his hand, some -- very pointedly -- do not.
dialog: 
text: The crowd noise takes on an ugly undertone -- Mandela is
text: delaying the rugby.
dialog: 
text: Mandela is undeterred. He's into this one-on-one outreach.
text: He turns, looks for more hands to shake --
dialog: 
text: -- and Jason steps in between Mandela and the crowd.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JASON
dialog: We're delaying the rugby, Madiba.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: Oh, yes, of course.
dialog: 
text: Mandela gives one last wave, turns away.
dialog: 
text: As he does, SOMEONE WINDS UP AND THROWS SOMETHING from the
dialog: stands.
dialog: 
text: Jason and Etienne catch the movement, whirl, too late.
dialog: 
text: AN ORANGE WHIZZES PAST MANDELA'S HEAD, explodes juicily on
dialog: the field.
dialog: 
text: Mandela didn't see it, doesn't react. If anything, his smile
text: widens as he heads across the field. The bodyguards close
text: around him protectively, get him back to the tunnel.

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. LOFTUS VERSFELD STADIUM - TUNNEL ONTO FIELD - DAY

text: under the watchful eye of the referee.
dialog: 
text: Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more

dialog: 
text: The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the
text: scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum
dialog: force.
dialog: 
text: The ball comes out the back of the Lions' scrum, the
text: scrumhalf dive-passes it away to the backs, who flick it out
text: laterally to the wing, with lightning speed.
dialog: 
text: The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing
text: Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which
text: bounces erratically --
dialog: 
text: -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last
text: burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOWNSHIP KID
dialog: Only hit the other players when the
dialog: ref isn't looking!
dialog: 
text: Laughter. A good ice-breaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIENAAR
dialog: No. The first rule of rugby is you
dialog: can only pass the ball backwards or
dialog: sideways.
dialog: 
dialog: Pienaar demonstrates. (NOTE: All the rules are
dialog: demonstrated.)
dialog: 
scene_heading: VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS
dialog: - If you drop the ball, or pass it
dialog: forwards, you scrum for possession.
dialog: - This is a scrum.
dialog: - You kick forwards.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: VARIOUS SPRINGBOKS (cont'd)
dialog: If you kick it out of bounds, you
text: throw it back in to a lineout.
dialog: - This is a lineout.
dialog: - You score in four ways: a try,
dialog: when you dot the ball down behind
dialog: the try line. That's five points.
dialog: - Another two points when you
dialog: convert the try by kicking the ball
text: through the uprights.
dialog: - Three points for a penalty kick.
dialog: - Three points for a drop kick.
dialog: - Have you got all that?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KIDS
dialog: No!
dialog: 
scene_heading: SPRINGBOK HOOKER
dialog: Agh, bugger it, let's just run and
text: pass. Whoever drops the ball does
dialog: pushups!
dialog: 
text: SECOND, as the players work with the kids, they get into it.
text: Much to their own surprise, they enjoy the energy, they enjoy
dialog: the kids, they enjoy the giving. Even the grumpiest, most
dialog: conservative Springbok.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SPRINGBOK LOCK
dialog: Okay. Who wants to scrum against
dialog: me?
dialog: 
text: One huge man scrums against a horde of kids. He pushes them
text: backwards with a roar -- then lets them push him backwards.
dialog: They love it, the cameras love it.
dialog: 
text: THE THIRD THEME shows the emergence of Chester Williams as
text: the face of the Springboks. The crowd of kids around him is
dialog: twice as big as any other player's crew. Given Chester's
text: basically shy nature, he finds it all a bit overwhelming.
text: The TV cameras follow him even more closely than they follow
dialog: Pienaar.
dialog: 
text: AT ONE POINT, an errant pass puts a rugby ball right at
text: Sipho's feet. He hesitates, then picks it up. He doesn't
dialog: just hold it, he feels it.
text: END THE MONTAGE as the luxury bus pulls away, surrounded by a
text: horde of cheering kids, many of whom hold new rugby balls

dialog: 
text: Room dark but for one small desk light. Pienaar stands at

dialog: 
text: Pienaar turns away from the window, goes to the desk, where,
text: under one small light, we see "Invictus", the poem Mandela
dialog: wrote out by hand.
dialog: 
text: Pienaar begins reading it. There is a soft knock at his
text: door. Pienaar goes to it, opens it. It is Nerine,
text: accompanied by a cop.
dialog: 
text: Pienaar nods at the cop, steps back so that Nerine can enter.

speaker_heading: PIENAAR
dialog: Uh ... the honor?

dialog: 
text: The Springbok lock rises high into the air, supported on all

scene_heading: INT./EXT. NEWLANDS STADIUM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Back to action on the field.
dialog: 
dialog: The highlights we see here should match the rugby primer we
dialog: saw in the township. This continues the education of those
dialog: who do not know rugby.
dialog: 
text: So, for instance, we see a ball knocked forward, and the
text: resulting scrum.
dialog: 
text: We see a ball kicked out of bounds, and the resulting
dialog: lineout.
dialog: 
text: We see scintillating passing, rucking, mauling, tackling,
dialog: strategic kicking at it's very best. Both teams are crisp
text: and strong.
dialog: 
text: INTERCUT SHOTS OF THE RUGBY MATCH --
dialog: 
text: -- with SHOTS OF THE SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS (snipers, lots and
text: lots of uniformed cops inside and out, sniffer dogs etc. all
dialog: overseen by Jason) --
dialog: 
text: -- with SHOTS OF THE CROWD, which, unlike the earlier test
text: against the Lions, is completely and passionately united
dialog: behind the Springboks (all commentators talk about the
dialog: extraordinary passion of the crowd, that day) --
dialog: 
text: -- always returning to the VIP BOX, where something
text: interesting is taking place right behind Mandela: Linga
text: Moonsamy, the rugby scorner, the soccer lover, loses his
text: scowling reserve and gets sucked into the game.
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: When a ball soars between the uprights and everyone in the
text: box groans, Linga leans towards Hendrick and asks:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINGA
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: They scored.
dialog: 
text: When another ball soars between the uprights and the crowd
text: roars, Linga asks again:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINGA
dialog: What happened?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: We scored.
dialog: 
text: A third ball through the uprights. Before Linga can ask:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: They scored again.
dialog: 
text: A fourth ball, to the joy of the others in the box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINGA
dialog: We scored?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: Ja. We're tied.
dialog: 
text: A fifth ball through the uprights, and the crowd goes wild.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: We're up by three.
dialog: 
text: ACTION ON THE FIELD, as a Wallaby drive combining backs and
text: forwards moves relentlessly towards the Springbok try line.
text: Six times the drive is stopped by Springbok tackling, but the
text: Wallabies keep possession and, on the seventh wave of the
text: assault score a beautiful open try, which is converted.
dialog: 
text: A ripple of concern goes through the crowd --
dialog: 
dialog: -- and the VIP box.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINGA
dialog: They're ahead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: By four.
dialog: 
text: Nerves in the box.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: But not on the field, as Pienaar starts a drive with a tackle
dialog: we feel ourselves, resulting in a change of possession --
dialog: 
text: -- and a stunning, open field try scored in the corner by the
text: Springbok wing, who raises his fist in the air, after juking
text: the last Wallaby to try and tackle him.
dialog: 
text: The crowd roars.
dialog: 
text: In the VIP box, Mandela is on his feet, shaking hands with
text: everyone he can reach, including Linga and Hendrick, and the
dialog: waiter.
dialog: 
text: The difficult, angled conversion is missed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LINGA
dialog: What does that mean?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: We're only ahead by one.
dialog: 
text: Another penalty kick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: We're ahead by four.
dialog: 
text: A drop goal.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: By seven.
dialog: 
text: An incredible try by the Springbok fly half.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HENDRICK
dialog: By fourteen.
dialog: 
text: Everyone dares to dream. The classic South African penchant
text: for pessimism begins to abate.
dialog: 
text: Two things to note: The crowd roar grows and grows and grows
text: and is echoed in the VIP box. Even Jason turns to look at
text: the action on the field -- but only for a second. Also, this
text: match serves as the coming-out party for the SPRINGBOK FLY
text: HALF, who scores 22 of South Africa's 27 points this day.

dialog:

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: -- where the Springboks are pounding beers and blowing off

dialog: 
text: Even though most of the players are with their wives or
text: girlfriends, pretty, single women crowd them, two and three
text: deep, men pay for round after round of beers.
dialog: 
text: Pienaar and Nerine are part of the action. Then Pienaar gets
text: a TEXT MESSAGE which makes him shake his head, give Nerine a
text: chagrined look.
dialog: 
text: He grabs the Springbok closest to him, puts his mouth near
text: the player's ear and screams again the hubbub:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIENAAR
scene_heading: COACH'S RUN, NINE A.M. SHARP. PASS
dialog: IT ON.
dialog: 
text: The Springbok shakes his head -- bloody coach -- grabs the

dialog: 
text: Then, something catches his eye on one of the big overhead
dialog: TV's.
dialog: 
text: ON THE TV: news footage of the Mandela victory boogie. The

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ROBBEN ISLAND - DAY
dialog: 
text: Robben Island lies only eight miles from the mainland. It is

dialog: 
text: -- but for its MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON. Concrete, barbed
text: wire, guard towers.
dialog: 
dialog: (In 1995, the political prisoner wing was shut, but the

scene_heading: INT. MANDELA'S CELL - DAY
dialog:

text: are the only other objects in the room.
dialog: 
text: A couple of small lockers are screwed high to the wall. The
text: barred window is opaque. It lets in light but does not allow

dialog: 
text: When Pienaar enters, we see how small the cell really is. He
text: can reach out and touch the opposite walls at the same time.

dialog: 
text: WE HAVE SEGUED TO THE FAMOUS HAKA, a Maori war dance that
dialog: tells an opponent they're going have their daughters stolen,
text: their wives ravaged and their brains eaten right out of their
text: skulls with a sharpened tea spoon.
dialog: 
dialog: It is abundantly clear why, as the Minister of Sports told
dialog: Mandela, half of the All Blacks matches are won before the

dialog: 
dialog: This is very intimidating.
dialog: 
dialog: Especially because, this day, the All Blacks push the haka
dialog: closer and closer to the Springboks --
dialog:

dialog: advance.
dialog: 
dialog: Major, major international smackdown. This is not fake. The

text: charges after it, along with the rest of the All Blacks.
dialog: 
dialog: Game on.
dialog: 
text: We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly from
text: a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV
dialog: coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view.
dialog: 
dialog: Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful
text: piece of mayhem up close and personal.
dialog: 
text: We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see
text: the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on
text: abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with
text: subcutaneous blood.
dialog: 136.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: We feel a tackle in our own spine; we see teeth sink into
text: flesh in the intimacy of a loose scrum; we feel a hard fist
text: smacking us again and again in the hot privacy of a rolling
dialog: maul.
dialog: 
dialog: For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as
dialog: the Springbok coach wanted.
dialog: 
text: This match is all about a less talented team stifling the
dialog: best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness.
dialog: 
text: This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting
text: pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into
dialog: making mistakes. Lots of them.
dialog: 
dialog: Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of
text: movement, no electric building of momentum.
dialog: 
dialog: Because of one thing: tackling.
dialog: 
text: Tackling and tackling and tackling again.
dialog: 
text: The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation
dialog: holds its breath --
dialog: 
text: -- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height,
text: wraps him up and brings him down.
dialog: 
text: The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from
text: behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
dialog: 
dialog: We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want;
text: from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the
dialog: country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field.
dialog: 
text: ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by
text: example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield.
dialog: 
text: ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away from
text: running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles.
dialog: 
text: ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devoted
dialog: their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing for
dialog: money. They are playing for pride, for their countries.
dialog: 
dialog: Outdated notions. We miss them.
dialog: 
text: No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match
text: each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.
dialog: 
text: With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. The
text: penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to
dialog: make them or fail. That is pressure.
dialog: 137.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The score is 6 - 6 when, just before half time, the Springbok
text: fly half takes a long, perfect pass from the scrum half, and
text: with the All Black defenders looming, kicks a drop goal
text: through the uprights.
dialog: 
text: The Springboks lead 9 - 6. A tight match.
dialog: 
text: So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second
text: half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -
dialog: 9.
dialog: 
text: Until right before the end of the match, when the All Blacks
text: camp in the Springbok half.
dialog: 
text: The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half,
text: who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal.
dialog: 
text: The kick soars into the air, high and straight.
dialog: 
text: 43 million South Africans hold their breath.
dialog: 
text: All around the world, fans lean forward on their chairs.
dialog: This will be the decisive blow.

speaker_heading: PIENAAR
dialog: Keep it here. Run it forward.
dialog: 
text: The scrum goes down, wheels a little.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SPRINGBOK FLY HALF
dialog: Francois!
text: Pienaar turns his head. The fly half taps his own chest:
dialog: give me the ball.
dialog: 
text: Pienaar hesitates, then nods to the scrum half: give him the
dialog: ball.
dialog: 
text: The ball goes into the scrum.
dialog: 
text: The ball works its way back through the feet of the eight
text: Springbok forwards.
dialog: 
text: The scrum half gathers it, spins it out to the fly half --
dialog: 
text: -- who takes one step to his left and KICKS A DROP GOAL high
text: into the air.
dialog: 
text: Ball soaring past a backdrop of open mouths. Higher than the
dialog: uprights ...
dialog: 
dialog: ... but through them nonetheless.
dialog: 
dialog: Springboks 15 - 12 All Blacks.
dialog: 
text: An entire nation jumps to its feet.

scene_heading: BEGIN CLIMAX SEQUENCE:
dialog: 
dialog: This is where we fold the Rainbow Nation into the rugby
dialog: match, fully.
dialog: 
text: INTERCUT BETWEEN PEOPLE ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE RUGBY
dialog: as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at
text: the same time. Faces, postures, eyes are identical, no
dialog: matter where they are, who they are, what color they are.
dialog: 
dialog: (It would be nice if we used all the faces we've already cut
dialog: away to throughout this story.)
dialog: 
dialog: ON THE FIELD
dialog: 
text: The All Blacks attack desperately. The Springboks tackle and
dialog: tackle and tackle.
dialog: 
text: ON PIENAAR, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet
dialog: for another tackle.
dialog: 
text: He glances over at the referee, makes another tackle --
dialog: 
text: -- looks over at the referee --
dialog: 
text: -- the referee puts his hands on his whistle --
dialog: 
dialog: -- another tackle, another look --
dialog: 
text: -- the referee lifts the whistle to his lips --
dialog: 
dialog: -- another tackle, another look --
dialog: 
text: -- the REFEREE BLOWS THE FINAL WHISTLE.
dialog: 
text: It's over.
dialog:

dialog:

scene_heading: EXT. ELLIS PARK STADIUM - DAY
dialog: 
text: The Springboks say a prayer on the field. Pienaar kneels in

dialog: 
text: Behind them, a WORK CREW ASSEMBLES A PORTABLE PODIUM.
dialog: 
text: At "Amen", Pienaar's men lift him to his feet, then onto
dialog: their shoulders.
dialog: 141.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The crowd roars again and again as PIENAAR TAKES A VICTORY
text: LAP on the shoulders of the men he has led through thick and
dialog: thin.
dialog: 
text: Tears stream down his face, through his unstoppable grin.
dialog: 
text: As they near the podium, the team is intercepted by a news
dialog: crew and --
dialog: 
text: -- none other then BOLAND BOTHA.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOLAND BOTHA
dialog: Francois ... a few words ...
dialog: 
text: The interview booms through the PA system. Pienaar just nods
text: -- he isn't about to spoil the moment by reacting to this
dialog: buffoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BOLAND BOTHA
dialog: ... great game, but I don't think
dialog: you could've done it without the
dialog: amazing support of these 63,000
dialog: South Africans --
dialog: 
text: Francois grabs the mike from Boland.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIENAAR
dialog: (into mike, words booming)
dialog: We didn't have the support of
dialog: 63,000 South Africans today. We
dialog: had the support of 42 million South
dialog: Africans.
dialog: 
text: The crowd roars.
dialog: 
text: The Springbok manager grabs Pienaar's shoulder, points.
dialog: 
scene_heading: SPRINGBOK MANAGER
dialog: They're waiting for you over there.
dialog: 
text: Pienaar turns, looks.
dialog: 
text: Mandela waits at the podium, eyes alight with joy.
dialog: 
text: In front of him is the WILLIAM WEBB ELLIS TROPHY, a big gold
dialog: confection.
dialog: 
text: Their eyes meet.
dialog: 
text: Their eyes stay locked as Pienaar fights his way through the
text: press, the officials, his own team, to the podium.
dialog: 142.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Mandela holds out his hand. Pienaar takes it. Big hands,
text: one black, one white, one with bruises visible, one with a
dialog: lifetime of bruises implied.
dialog: 
text: Both wearing the NUMBER 6 SPRINGBOK JERSEY.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MANDELA
dialog: Francois, I want to thank you most
dialog: sincerely for what you have done to
dialog: our country.
dialog: 
text: Pienaar shakes his head.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PIENAAR
dialog: Mr. President, I want to thank you
dialog: for what you have done.
dialog: 
text: Eyes lock again, for just a moment, blue eyes, brown eyes --
text: African eyes, both.
dialog: 
text: And then PIENAAR RAISES THE TROPHY HIGH. A very traditional
dialog: sports hero's moment, richly deserved.
dialog: 
text: Real gold, against the green of the battered field.
dialog: 
dialog: But that is not the real prize.
dialog: 
text: The prize is what happens next, all over the nation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog:
