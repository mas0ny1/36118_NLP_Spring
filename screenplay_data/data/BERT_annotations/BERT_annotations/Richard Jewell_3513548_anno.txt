speaker_heading: JEWELL

speaker_heading: GREEN

speaker_heading: JEWELL

speaker_heading: ITSELF.

speaker_heading: DARKNESS
dialog: For a moment --

text: PAST US like rifle fire, eerie... Then we HEAR --
text: SCREAMS. TERROR. We're blind, until we SLAM UP ON --
text: Jewell’s eyes opening foggily. He turns, in SLOW MOTION,
text: and sees a HORROR:
text: COPS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR -- Miller, Green, Silver,
dialog: Jones, Shaw --
text: And Jewell’s BENCH, rocketing upwards. SMOKE pluming.

speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: You two okay? You okay?

text: TOWARD THE SCENE NOW. People reaching for cell phones.
text: A TURKISH CAMERAMAN races in, ready to start shooting.
text: But the guy COLLAPSES from a heart attack, dead on the
text: spot. More people SCREAM. We WHIP BACK TO:
text: Jewell, his eyes wide. There’s Green among the DOWNED
text: COPS. Jewell gets to his feet, his balance shaky. He
text: heads for Green, while stumbling past Shaw, and:
text: Jewell gets to Green who is face-down, his jersey and
text: flesh torn open by shrapnel.
speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: How bad?
speaker_heading: GREEN

speaker_heading: BRUCE HUGHES

speaker_heading: CLEERE
dialog: I want to be clear -- I haven't
dialog: accused him of anything.
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: I understand.
speaker_heading: CLEERE
dialog: I just... I see the attention he’s
dialog: getting; it’s the KIND of
dialog: attention he was always seeking
dialog: here when he was harassing
text: students, pulling people over on
dialog: the highway. Crazy behavior. And
dialog: I decided if my fears were correct
dialog: -- if he WASN’T actually the hero
dialog: they’re makin’ him out to be --
dialog: and I'd had information pertinent
dialog: to that fact which I’d failed to
dialog: bring to light? It could

speaker_heading: SHAW

speaker_heading: BRUCE HUGHES
dialog: Okay. I want to hear more about
dialog: Jewell. Patrick?
text: All eyes on PATRICK WILLIAMS from the Behavioral Sciences
dialog: Team --
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: When I look at Jewell, I think
dialog: about the bomb scare at the L.A.
dialog: Olympics in ‘84: a bag left ona
text: bus by the same cop who then
dialog: discovered it. And the fires in
dialog: Idaho this summer -- started by a
dialog: firefighter who wanted the credit
dialog: for putting them out. There is a
text: profile that emerges, the false
dialog: hero.
text: Tom Shaw believes that to his core. The whole room does.
speaker_heading: WILLIAMS
dialog: In interviews, Jewell’s account of
text: the bombing seems vague, and he
text: looks uncomfortable discussing the
dialog: victims. I also found his
dialog: mentioning on TV that he was
dialog: hoping to get back into law
dialog: enforcement a bit inappropriate.
dialog: There’s a lot here that’s
dialog: troubling. And everything Agent
dialog: Shaw has learned about him does
dialog: sync-up with this profile.
speaker_heading: BRUCE HUGHES
dialog: You agree with that, Tom?
speaker_heading: SHAW
dialog: I do, sir.

speaker_heading: GUMBEL
dialog: What do you think of the manner in
dialog: which the FBI has treated your
dialog: client?
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: I think whoever the bum was who
dialog: leaked that Richard Jewell was the
dialog: focus of this investigation should
dialog: be prosecuted or dealt with in
dialog: some serious way. I don’t think
dialog: that this investigation should be,
dialog: aaahhh, conducted under world
dialog: spotlight like this.
speaker_heading: GUMBEL
dialog: Why are you so convinced of his
dialog: innocence?
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: Because I’ve known Richard for a
dialog: while. I’ve looked him in the eye
dialog: and I’ve asked him the question.
speaker_heading: GUMBEL

speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: Oh. I used to work a lot of car

speaker_heading: JEWELL

speaker_heading: BOBIL
dialog: Richard, I’m scared.
speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: Me, too, Momma.
speaker_heading: BOBIL

speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: Three days, Watson. She’s had

scene_heading: INT. CHILIVIS BLDG. - CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 145
text: An odd, musty feel. Medieval TAPESTRIES hang on the
dialog: wall. The shades are down because the MOB is right
text: outside, in the alley -- so the room is sunless.
text: Jewell sits, scared, as he’s wired by RICHARD RACKLEFF
dialog: (50s, stocky, an FBI lifer, private sector now.)
speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: Don’t see why we can’t just let

speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: Can you make some more of those

speaker_heading: NADYA
dialog: Careful, Watson. In Russia if a

text: He grins. Rackleff enters, looking grim.
text: Bryant springs toward him, motioning for him to be QUIET,

text: Rackleff nods, leans in, and WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: RACKLEFF
dialog: Your boy is tanking. Hard.
text: Bryant’s eyes widen. Nadya’s, too. Bryant WHISPERS
speaker_heading: BACK.
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: RACKLEFF

text: Jewell bites into the donut, his eyes shutting.
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: Can I tell you something, Richard?
dialog: (as Jewell shrugs)
dialog: I went to Episcopal school as a
dialog: kid. When I was in first grade,
dialog: two nuns accused me of writing
dialog: something unholy on my desk --
dialog: Jewell’s wondering: Why is he telling me this?
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: I hadn't done it, but they were
dialog: sure I had. So they sent me back
dialog: to kindergarten for a week -- just
dialog: to humiliate me; then they asked
dialog: me if I’d learned my lesson. I
dialog: said I hadn’t because I hadn’t
text: written on the desk in the first
dialog: place. They asked me how I’d like
dialog: to go sit in kindergarten for TWO
dialog: weeks. I said, ‘You can throw me
dialog: in there for a year -- I still
dialog: can’t apologize for writing on the
dialog: desk because I DIDN’T DO IT.’

speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: I know. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: And who are you to make fun of a

dialog: She was going to have SURGERY; he

dialog: weird about that? Tell him.
dialog: (off no reply)
dialog: While you’re at it you can tell

dialog: newspaper seeking publicity for

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KATHY
dialog: That was added during editorial.
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: Or how he fits the lone-bomber

text: Bobi looks to her side: Bryant, encouraging her...
speaker_heading: BOBIL
dialog: I am asking the President for help
dialog: today. Mister President, my son
dialog: is a hero. I think the FBI knows
dialog: that by now; the evidence makes it

dialog: Please tell the world...
dialog: 
dialog: Bobi has one more sentence to get through. And it is --
speaker_heading: BOBIL

speaker_heading: BOBIL

text: Jewell and Bobi turn, and their jaws drop a bit because:

speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: You know what a 1001 is, Richard?
speaker_heading: JEWELL

speaker_heading: BRYANT

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LUTHERSVILLE POLICE DEPT. - HQ - DAY (2003) 170

scene_heading: OTHER LUTHERSVILLE COP
dialog: I’m goin’ to the diner, Richard.
dialog: You want anythin’?
speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: Naah. Brought my own. Thanks.

dialog: 
dialog: Eric Rudolph -- just confessed to

text: But Jewell doesn’t react. Just can’t.
speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: When’s he being arraigned?
speaker_heading: BRYANT

text: Bryant nods...
scene_heading: INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY (2005) 171
text: Jewell and Bryant emerge from a COURTROOM. THROUGH a

speaker_heading: SUPERIMPOSE:
dialog: “The real bomber, Eric Rudolph, was captured and
dialog: sentenced to four life sentences on domestic terrorism

text: Jewell hands Bryant an envelope.
speaker_heading: BRYANT
dialog: What is it?
text: Jewell shrugs, “Open it.” Bryant opens it:
text: Inside, a 100-dollar bill. Bryant grins...
speaker_heading: JEWELL
dialog: All square?
text: Bryant nods, his fondness obvious. But just then --
text: The elevator stops on 8 and a GUY gets in. Call him JOE
text: NOBODY. The doors close.
dialog: Down we go, in silence. But --
text: Joe Nobody grimaces. He KNOWS he recognizes Jewell from
text: somewhere. Just can’t figure out where. It’s bugging him.
dialog: Jewell and Bryant have experienced this 500 times now.
dialog: It's always annoying. But they let it go.
dialog: We can feel Joe Nobody racking his memory. Where have I
text: seen this guy’s face before? But he’s drawing blanks.
text: Elevator stops on the 2nd floor. Joe gets out. Finally.
text: Then, just as the doors start to close, his eyes light up.
text: It just came to him. He turns to Jewell, so excited:
speaker_heading: JOE NOBODY
dialog: Now I remember! You’re the
dialog: Olympic bomber.
text: That lands on the faces of Jewell and Bryant -- a sense
dialog: that this will never end, not really, anyway. Jewell
dialog: knows that in his soul.
text: As the doors close, we hear...

dialog: No, he’s the hero.
text: As he will forever come to his defense.
