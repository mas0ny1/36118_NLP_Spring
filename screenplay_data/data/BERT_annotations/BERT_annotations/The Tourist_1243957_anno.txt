dialog: 
text: CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day. Cool,
text: gray and beautiful.
dialog: 
text: A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All
text: around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people
text: hurrying about their business.
dialog: 
text: The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female
text: legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GARE DE L'EST, PARIS - DAY
dialog: 
text: WE FOLLOW the legs up the steps, across the concourse,
text: through the station. Men turn and stare.
dialog: 
text: CARA MASON (30, stunning) shows no sign of noticing. She
text: wears dark glasses and carries a traveling bag in one
text: hand, a copy of the International Herald Tribune in the
dialog: other.

scene_heading: INT. BRASSERIE, GARE DE L'EST - DAY
dialog: 
text: A YOUNG WAITER wiping down the bar stops to watch Cara
text: enter and take a seat at a table slightly set apart.
dialog: 
text: An OLDER WAITER approaches her. They exchange a few
text: words and he walks toward the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
text: She's waiting for someone.
dialog: 
scene_heading: YOUNGER WAITER
dialog: Probably waiting for me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: The door's waiting for you if you
dialog: don't get back to work.
dialog: 
text: A MESSENGER clad in leather, wearing a motorcycle helmet,
text: enters the cafe and looks around. He consults a
dialog: photograph.
dialog: 
text: His eyes land on Cara. He walks over and holds out a
text: document-sized envelope.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MESSENGER
dialog: C'est vous, Mademoiselle?
dialog: 2.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Oui.
dialog: 
text: As the messenger walks away she opens the folder and
text: shakes out the contents. There is a ticket for the
text: Orient Express and a handwritten letter...
dialog: 
text: She spreads it out on the table like a precious treasure
text: map. Her beautiful forehead creases with concentration as
dialog: she reads...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: (English accent)
dialog: They are following you Cara.
dialog: 
text: She looks up. Takes out a small makeup mirror and holds
text: it in front of her face to glance around behind her...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: They think you'll lead them to me.
dialog: But if you follow my instructions
dialog: closely, there is a way for us to
dialog: get away...
dialog: 
text: Cara scans the rest of the letter.
dialog: 
text: CAMERA glides down to see the signature at the bottom:
dialog: "Love, Alexander."
dialog: 
text: We barely have time to read this before Cara's perfectly
text: manicured hand crumples the letter, places it in a saucer
text: and sets fire to it.
dialog: 
text: The YOUNG WAITER hurries over, alarmed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: YOUNGER WAITER
dialog: Mademoiselle! Je vous en prie--
dialog: 
text: Cara is already gathering her things and walking away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. GARE DE L'EST STATION - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: As Cara walks toward the platform...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.)
dialog: Take the 4:25 Orient Express to
dialog: Venice. En route select a man my
dialog: approximate height and weight...
dialog: 
text: Her eyes scan the platform.
dialog: 3.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ALEXANDER'S VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Have faith Cara. I'll be with you
dialog: soon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA'S POV
dialog: 
text: Men of various shapes and sizes are boarding "The Orient
text: Express." She pauses only long enough to assess and
text: discard: too old, too young, too thin, too overweight...
dialog: 
text: Her gaze comes to rest on a WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN.
text: Medium height, medium build. Standing alone. Examining
dialog: his ticket.
dialog: 
text: Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished
text: glass window of the train. Adjusts her hair and dress.
dialog: 
text: Satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward
text: the WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN like a cat stalking prey.
dialog: 
text: The CAMERA admiringly FOLLOWS her silky approach.
dialog: 
text: The FRENCH MAN hears the click of her heels and looks up.
text: His mouth falls open...
dialog: 
text: HIS WIFE arrives and shuts it for him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: WIFE
dialog: What are you doing Vincent? Our
dialog: train car is over here!
dialog: 
text: With a regretful backward glance at Cara, he allows
text: himself to be dragged away.
dialog: 
text: Frustrated, Cara turns and casts about for another
dialog: possibility.
dialog: 
text: She spots a TOUSLE HAIRED MAN seated on a bench.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CONDUCTER (V.O.)
dialog: All aboard! All aboard the 4:25
dialog: is departing!
dialog: 
text: Tousle Hair gathers his bags to get on the train.
text: Encouraged, Cara moves to cut him off.
dialog: 
text: As Tousle Hair stands up REVEAL... he's six foot seven.
dialog: 
text: Cara stops short, irritated. The MAN behind her boarding
text: the train is fumbling with his suitcase and doesn't
text: notice. BAM he walks straight into her.
dialog: 4.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Ow!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sorry! Excuse me. Pardone moi.
dialog: 
text: FRANK TAYLOR (30's, amiable) is a cheerful American
text: tourist. Open face, completely lacking in guile.
dialog: 
text: Frank continues to mutter apologies as he walks gingerly
text: around Cara and boards the train.
dialog: 
text: Cara watches him with thinly veiled contempt. Frank is a
text: man of average size, average build... she peers over her
text: glasses at him. And her expression slowly changes. She
text: follows him onto the train.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
dialog: 
text: A GOOD-LOOKING ENGLISHMAN loitering further down the
text: platform, reading the Herald Tribune. Or rather, not
text: reading it. He's been watching Cara. He lowers the
text: paper and climbs onto the train through a different door.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. PARIS - DAY
dialog: 
text: The gleaming Orient Express pulls out of the station and
text: gets underway.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ORIENT EXPRESS - AFTERNOON
dialog: 
text: The train is moving.
dialog: 
text: The thick carpet, the mellow wood of the inlaid panels,
text: the subtlety of the Lalique mirrors and the softly lit
text: lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window
text: in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. He's wrapped
text: up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel. So wrapped up
text: that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him.
dialog: 
text: She crosses her legs. He glances up.
dialog: 
text: Slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off. Then the
text: headscarf tied around her neck.
dialog: 
text: FOLLOW her sensual movements in TIGHT CLOSE UP. The
text: effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip
dialog: tease.
dialog: 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled.
dialog: 
text: She takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes.
dialog: 
text: She goes to remove her mock-turtleneck sweater. The
text: zipper seems to give her trouble.
dialog: 
text: Without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and
text: leans toward Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I think I'm going to need your
dialog: help.
dialog: 
text: Frank is barely able to respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hmm?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: My zipper...
dialog: (off his blank look)
dialog: It's stuck.
dialog: 
text: Frank finally moves into action. He sets his book down
text: and leans closer.
dialog: 
text: Awkwardly he reaches towards Cara's beautiful neck. He
text: attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric. But the
text: zipper resists.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm afraid of hurting you.
dialog: 
text: She slides forward on her seat, to get even closer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Don't be afraid.
dialog: 
text: The train car sways slightly and throws Frank off
text: balance. He tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives--
text: with a tearing sound.
dialog: 
text: Frank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his
dialog: fingers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm... sorry.
dialog: 
text: Cara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: It doesn't matter.
dialog: 6.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe I should let you do this--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Don't give up so quickly.
dialog: 
text: Reluctantly, Frank continues with the zipper. The
text: tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by
dialog: inch.
dialog: 
text: First her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are
text: gradually uncovered. The zipper keeps going downward.
text: No sign of anything underneath.
dialog: 
text: Frank is practically sweating.
dialog: 
text: Finally he uncovers fabric. He finishes unzipping the
text: sweater and sits back into his seat.
dialog: 
text: Cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
text: And settles back into her seat, cat-like. He stares at
text: her for several moments, at a loss for words.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My name is Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Cara.
dialog: 
text: A white-jacketed STEWARD arrives.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEWARD
dialog: (to Frank)
dialog: Will you and your wife take dinner
dialog: here or in the dining car this
dialog: evening, monsieur?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Pardon me? Oh, no. We're not
dialog: actually--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: The dining car would be lovely,
dialog: thank you.
dialog:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING CAR - EVENING
dialog: 
text: Linen tablecloths. Fine china. Frank is one of the only
text: men in the dining car not in a dinner jacket.
dialog: 
text: Frank takes out a bottle of pills from his pocket, then
dialog: another and another...
dialog: 
text: He takes one or two pills from each and swallows them
text: methodically. She watches him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Are you ill?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What? No.
dialog: 
text: She looks at all the pills spread out beside his plate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Just nervous. I don't like
dialog: travelling.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: (gently mocking)
dialog: So you decided to take a holiday
dialog: on the Orient Express?
dialog: 
text: He hesitates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm on my honeymoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Your honeymoon?
dialog: 
text: Cara is annoyed at this revelation.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Should we ask the waiter to set

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She's in Pennsylvania.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're sure you want to hear this?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: If you'd like to tell me.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Two weeks ago she left me. For
text: the owner of a pizza parlor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: That's awful.
dialog: 
text: Frank nods, matter-of-fact.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No travel insurance. No refund on
dialog: the tickets. So... here I am. On
dialog: my honeymoon.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I'm sorry, Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I really loved that pizza too.
dialog: "Bala Pizza" if you're ever in
dialog: Rosemont.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I wouldn't touch it. I'm loyal to

speaker_heading: WAITER
dialog: A Cointreau for Mademoiselle. And
dialog: for Monsieur... a "Miller Light."
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thanks.
dialog:

text: amused by Frank's obliviousness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What takes you to Venice?
dialog: 
text: She nods toward his well-thumbed paperback.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: You read spy novels.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm a mysterious woman on a train.
dialog: You tell me what my story is.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Okay... you'd be a diplomatic
dialog: attaché or... let's see... a girl from
dialog: East Germany whose father's been
dialog: kidnapped by Soviet agents.
dialog: They're blackmailing you into
dialog: stealing... probably a microchip.
dialog: There's usually a microchip
dialog: involved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: What awaits me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Trouble, certainly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Danger?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No doubt. You'll probably be shot

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Is there a man in my life?
dialog: 
dialog: Beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Our target's name is Alexander
dialog: Pearce. British citizen, born in

dialog: remarkable about his childhood was
text: a preternatural gift for numbers.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman clicks a slide projected on a large screen

dialog: Your mastermind couldn't pass his

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: He didn't fix his test scores; he

dialog: in the class. It made him very
dialog: popular.
dialog: 
text: A ripple of laughter through the group.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (severely)
dialog: What started as school pranks
dialog: eventually became something much
dialog: more serious. After a year in the
dialog: training program at Goldman Sachs,
dialog: he decided that gambling suited
dialog: him better than working for a
dialog: living. That, in turn, involved
text: him with some rather unsavory
dialog: people and ultimately led him to
dialog: put his financial genius to work
dialog: in his true calling: money
dialog: laundering.

text: launderer, Mr. Ackerman.

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: There is nothing common about

dialog: he has turned money laundering
dialog: into an art form. His greatest
dialog: innovation: The False Lawsuit.
dialog: 
text: He clicks through a series of flashy Powerpoint slides
text: illustrating Pearce's financial dealings.

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

dialog: the casino pays the shell company
text: an enormous settlement.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: QUINN

dialog: The money travels from America to
dialog: the Cayman Islands...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Yes, but now the money is legal.

speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Not quite legal. The I.R.S. has

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Pearce worked with no more than a

dialog: None of them would cooperate.
dialog: We've questioned the ones we could
dialog: find, and the only thing we
dialog: learned is that Pearce apparently

speaker_heading: CARA

speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Signora. That's my husband.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He recovers his composure and alters his manner at once.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Very good, Senora Mason. Welcome

speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: The bedroom is through here. You

speaker_heading: PORTER (CONT'D)
dialog: ...you may not need. There are two

dialog: Is everything satisfactory?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Yes. Thank you.

speaker_heading: PORTER
dialog: Then I will leave you.
dialog: 
text: The Porter looks expectantly to the "husband" for a tip.

speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: 22.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DOGE'S SUITE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank walks across to the door. There is a small spyhole

dialog: Take a seat, Mr. Quinn. Can I

dialog: Breakfast.
dialog: 
text: Frank reaches for the doorknob... then pauses. Breakfast
dialog: again?
dialog: 
text: He quietly slides the chain on. Peers through the

dialog: 
text: SPYHOLE POV -- Two tough-looking men in suits stand
dialog: there: most definitely not hotel staff. One has a scar
text: on his face... Demidov's BODYGUARDS.
dialog: 
text: Frank is frozen.
dialog: 
text: Scarface takes out a silenced PISTOL and mutters
text: something in Russian to his partner. He produces a LOCK
text: PICK SET and crouches out of frame.
dialog: 
text: Frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking
text: tumblers inside the lock. He looks around wildly. Sees
text: the KEY on the entryway table and reaches for it...
dialog: 
text: Ch-chunk. The Russian picks the lock and slowly starts
text: to open the door. The chain stops it. A pause.
dialog: 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A moment later a KNIFE comes through the crack and starts
dialog: to slide the chain...
dialog: 
text: Frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast...
dialog: 
text: Frank throws his shoulder against the door. The knife
text: clatters to the floor as the door slams shut. Frank jams
text: his KEY into the lock and turns the bolt into place.
dialog: 
text: There's angry confusion on the other side of the door.
dialog: 
text: Frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the
text: back of the key-- breaking it off in the lock.
dialog: 
text: Frank scrambles out of the way...
dialog: 
text: The sound of metal scraping in the lock. Russian CURSING
text: can be heard just outside. A heavy blow as they try to
text: shoulder the door open...
dialog: 
text: Frank looks around desperately for an escape.
dialog: 
dialog: The bathroom? The sitting room? Adjoining doors? None.
dialog: 
text: There's nowhere to go.
dialog: 
text: Frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet.
dialog: 
text: He scrambles outside as...
dialog: 
text: POP! POP! POP! Bullets rip through the wood and metal,
text: blasting the lock assembly apart. The door bursts open.

speaker_heading: THE BALCONY
dialog: 
text: Frank puts one bare foot on the stonework. He grimaces
text: as he HEAVES himself onto the railing of the balcony
text: adjacent to his.
dialog: 
text: He hangs desperately, flailing, 100 feet over the street
text: below. He gets a tentative hold...
dialog: 
text: A PALLID FRENCH WOMAN drops her coffee and screams.
dialog: 
text: The Russians sprint out to the balcony. They spot
dialog: Frank...
dialog: 
text: Who shoves the Pallid Woman inside, struggles past her
text: breakfast table, and prepares to leap again-- but slips
text: on the spilled coffee.
dialog: 
text: Bullets shatter China around him. He cuts his foot on a

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Goddamn it! I'm a fucking
dialog: tourist!
dialog: 
text: Another round of shots ring out. They don't seem to

dialog: 
text: Frank goes over the railing with another awkward HEAVE.
dialog: 
text: His pursuers scale the adjoining stone work and step onto
text: the Pallid Woman's balcony.
dialog: 
text: This time Frank lands in the lap of a BURLY WELSHMAN.
dialog: 
scene_heading: BURLY WELSHMAN
dialog: Are ya bloody mad?
dialog: 
text: The Burly Welshman PUNCHES Frank in the stomach, which
text: drops him out of the way of...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TWO SHOTS
dialog: 
text: Which explode into the Welshman's shoulder. He cries out
text: and falls down on top of Frank.
dialog: 
text: The Russians stand on the Pallid Woman's balcony and
dialog: prepare to JUMP...
dialog: 
text: as Frank crawls out from under the wounded Welshman and
text: peers over the next balcony...
dialog: 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Which is at least TWENTY FEET from the roof.
dialog:

scene_heading: INT. THE WELSHMAN'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER

scene_heading: INT. SERVICE STAIRCASE - SECONDS LATER
dialog:

dialog: he's run in his entire life...
dialog: 
text: But he's slow and they gain on him enough to aim weapons
text: through the railing...
dialog: 
text: P-CHING, several bullets ricochet like pinballs in the
text: metal stairwell.
dialog: 
text: Frank pants as he pushes out a side door...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIO DEL VIN CANAL, VENICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank sprints along the edge of the canal, dodging
text: tourists and children, vendors and locals. He spots a
text: VENDOR'S three wheel BICYCLE and jumps on.
dialog: 
text: As he pedals, he realizes it's too slow so he JUMPS
dialog: OFF...
dialog: 
text: and FALLS - a painful spill, he cuts his hand - but
text: clambers to his feet as the Russians bear down. Running
text: up hidden stairs he finds the roof of a shop on the Riva

dialog: 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. RIVA DEGLI SCHIAVONI, VENICE - DAY
dialog:

text: FALLS...
dialog: 
text: ...bumping down the other side of the roof until, as he
text: topples over the edge, he thrusts a hand at the gutter,
text: smashing his head against the wall. He drops onto the
text: pavement along the edge of the small canal.
dialog: 
text: He doubles back towards the lagoon. Looking back, he sees
text: the men still in pursuit.
dialog: 
text: He turns into the Campo San Zaccaria, scattering the

scene_heading: INT. LEATHER SHOP - DAY
dialog: 
text: Ducking inside a leather shop, Frank heads straight for

dialog: 
text: He stands on the cobblestones. Blood streams from his
text: forehead as well as his hand. He has
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECONDS
dialog: 
text: to decide which way to go. The alley is long and narrow
text: on either side. An awning above. Clear sight lines.
dialog: 
text: The back of the shop upends the Grand Canal.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: The Russians burst out the back.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: He looks up and sees: the scowling face of an Italian
text: WOMAN peering out over her window box.
dialog: 
text: Frank raises a desperate finger to his lips. A prayer
dialog: that she won't give him away.
dialog: 
text: She looks at him disapprovingly. Then disappears back
dialog: inside.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON FRANK as he waits, his heart pounding.
dialog: 
text: Seconds tick past... is he safe?
dialog: 
text: Rrrrrip! A black cylinder, like the barrel of a gun,
text: tears through the awning fabric inches from his Frank's
dialog: head.
dialog: 
text: He cries out. The awning rips and dumps him down hard
text: onto the cobblestones below...
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: A MOMENTARY BLACKOUT
dialog: 
text: Frank opens his eyes and sees two pairs of black boots
text: that belong to... A PAIR OF CARBINIERI who stand over him.

dialog:

speaker_heading: DOMENICO (CONT'D)
dialog: What happened to you, anyway?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Somebody tried to kill me.

speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: Mr. Taylor, wow, you had quite a

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I have absolutely no idea.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: They followed you from the

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: Ha ha, we do that sometimes here,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOMENICO (CONT'D)
dialog: Is no domestic, then?

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: How long you know Cara Mason?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I met her yesterday.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: And you take her to the Danieli?
dialog: That must have been good meeting,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I didn't take her. She took me.

text: The infectious grin again lights up Domenico's face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: You lead an exciting life, Mr.
dialog: Taylor.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not usually.
dialog: 
text: Domenico picks up the phone and dials a number. He talks
text: in brisk Italian, listens again and replaces the
dialog: receiver.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: Signora Mason was staying with
dialog: "her husband" last night. You
dialog: marry her, Mr. Taylor?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: I think maybe Signora Mason might

dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think that's possible.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: You got a phone number, mobile?

speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: DOMENICO
dialog: You need some clothes. I'll be

dialog: 
text: He leaves Frank alone again.
dialog: 
text: Frank stands and half-heartedly follows him to the
dialog: doorway.
dialog: 
text: He spots something in the adjoining room; a computer that
text: has been left on. He wanders over and looks at the
dialog: screen.
dialog: 
text: An idea comes into Frank's head... he looks around. Nobody
text: is watching him. He glances at the inscription on the
text: WATCH...
dialog: 
text: Then quickly sits down. He does a search for "WANTED
text: INTERNATIONAL CRIMINALS" and types in the name:
dialog: 
scene_heading: ALEXANDER PEARCE.
dialog: 
text: An immediate hit in the data base. Alexander Pearce's
text: page fills the screen. The caption reads:

dialog: 
text: In place of a photograph there is just a black outline of
text: a man's head.
dialog: 
text: Frank is about to scan for more information when he hears
text: Domenico returning. He quickly steps back into the room
dialog: where he was left...
dialog:

speaker_heading: DOMENICO (CONT'D)

dialog:

dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Then, just before the doors close, Scarface turns... his

text: the doors shut first.
dialog: 
text: The lift stops again. The doors open on the first tier of
text: the subterranean car park.
dialog: 
text: Frank leaps off.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK, PADUA HOSPITAL - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Limping and terrified, Frank jogs towards the ramp marked
text: Uscita in the far corner.
dialog: 
text: An ENGINE ROAR splits the silence. The lights blind
text: Frank in the darkness as the car careers towards him.
dialog: 
text: He falls to his knees.
dialog: 
text: The car skids to a stop.
dialog: 
text: The door flies open. He squints. Sitting behind the
text: wheel, calm and beautiful as ever, is CARA. He stares.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: What are you waiting for? Get in.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CARA'S CAR - NIGHT
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Did you miss me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A little.
dialog: 
text: He glances anxiously over her shoulder.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Um... you may not believe this but
dialog: there are some people trying to
dialog: kill me--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: (calm)
dialog: I know.
dialog: 
text: Cara drives toward the ramp. He looks at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you know why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: It's because I kissed you.
dialog: 
text: She stops the car and waits for the metal gate at the top
text: of the ramp to open. It rises with a loud creaking to
text: REVEAL...
dialog: 
text: A BLACK CAR with two men inside. One of them steps out
text: and ducks under the gate as it rises up.
dialog: 
text: While he's briefly silhouetted by the car's headlights we
text: glimpse the outline of an AUTOMATIC WEAPON.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: With remarkable sangfroid she cuts the engine and lets
text: her car roll backwards, gliding silently and perfectly
text: into a parking spot.
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
text: They watch the BLACK CAR slowly descend the ramp. The
text: Russian with the gun in his hand walks carefully
dialog: alongside.
dialog: 
text: Frank watches, holding his breath.
dialog: 
text: The sound of another engine cuts through the silence. A
text: pair of headlights come up from the level below.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE CAR. The MALE NURSE from the elevator is
text: driving up toward the exit ramp, toward the exit where
text: the Russians are waiting.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE GUNMAN slipping back into the shadows and
text: readying his gun to fire.
dialog: 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: FRANK sees what is about to happen. His face betrays his
dialog: concern.
dialog: 
text: He reaches for the door.
dialog: 
text: CLICK. Cara presses the central door lock. Frank's door
text: doesn't budge. He looks over at her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (re: the Nurse)
dialog: That guy has nothing to do with
dialog: this.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Neither do you.
dialog: 
text: He looks her straight in the eye. She relents.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. If you want to play hero...
dialog: 
text: She turns over the ignition.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on.
dialog: 
text: Cara revs the car and pulls out fast, cutting off the
text: Nurse's car. He leans on the horn.
dialog: 
text: At the top of the exit ramp, the metal parking gate is
text: slowly being lowered.
dialog: 
text: She weaves around the black car, deliberately heading for
text: the gunman. He opens fire.
dialog: 
text: BRRRRRAAAP!! Bullets spray wildly, ricocheting off the
text: walls, shattering windshields... Frank covers his face as a
text: side-window pops, showering him with glass.
dialog: 
text: The GUNMAN is forced to jump out of the way as Cara
text: scrapes the side of her car along the wall. Sparks fly.
dialog: 
text: The black car burns rubber as it U-turns to follow her.
dialog: 
text: She guns it up the ramp towards the closing door.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's not enough room!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: There's enough room.
dialog: 51.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We won't make it!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I thought Americans were
dialog: optimists.
dialog: 
text: At the last second he ducks instinctively and closes his
text: eyes. The gate clips the top of Cara's car with a
text: tremendous CLANG! Traps it.
dialog: 
text: Cara presses her foot all the way down on the
text: accelerator. Smoke pours from the tires.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CRASH!
dialog: 
text: The black car RAMS them from behind.
dialog: 
text: A Russian leans out the window and fires at the outlines
text: of Cara and Frank's HEADS. Bullets shatter the back
dialog: window.
dialog: 
text: Cara pushes Frank's head down. The sound of burning
text: gears as the engine hits its limit.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, scraping paint, Cara's car SPRINGS forward,
text: jetting out onto the street.
dialog: 
text: The fence drops further and shudders to a halt. The

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: You don't know what your own

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Great.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Don't worry. I'm taking you
dialog: somewhere you'll be safe.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We should go to the police.

speaker_heading: CARA

speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Frank... Frank.
dialog: 
text: He's snoring. She pinches his nose closed...
dialog: 
text: He startles awake. She smiles mischievously.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ON A SIDE STREET
dialog: 
text: He follows her past abandoned tricycles and very old men

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And I thought I wouldn't get to do

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. RUN DOWN PALAZZO, HALL - NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: It is completely dark inside. The two of them maneuver

dialog: 
text: Finally somebody finds the light switch and--
dialog: 
text: CARA holds a .38 Taurus PISTOL in front of her.
dialog: 
text: Frank happens to be right in her line of sight. He

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whoa!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Sorry.
dialog:

dialog: 
text: Cara starts to giggle. Frank starts to laugh too.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: The apartment appears as if it was leased, stocked and

dialog: have never been used.
dialog: 
text: Frank walks over to a flat screen TV and curiously peels
text: off the protective clear film... He looks up and sees:
dialog: 
text: Cara has her head inside the OVEN.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: She pulls out, a flashlight in her mouth.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Making sure no one sabotaged the
dialog: gas lines.
dialog: 
text: Frank watches her walk over to the FUSE BOXES.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MINUTES LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank pokes through the cupboards. Stocked with fine
text: olives, tins of expensive smoked fish, viands, stewed
dialog: fruit from orchards in France.
dialog: 
text: He opens the icebox. Inside is frozen meat and fish. He
text: pulls out one package of frozen orange steaks - it is
scene_heading: labelled "BARRACUDA, CAUGHT ANTIGUA, 8/07".
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He goes Barracuda fishing?
dialog: 
text: Cara has poured herself a glass of wine.

speaker_heading: CARA

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DINING AREA, PEARCE'S "SAFE HOUSE" - LATER
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON THE FISH -- now seasoned, grilled and surrounded
text: by whipped sweet potatoes, beets and almonds.
dialog: 
text: Frank places a plate before Cara who sits with her wine
text: at Pearce's oak table. She looks appreciatively at her
dialog: plate.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: And she left you for a cook?
dialog: 
text: Frank smiles and pours himself a glass of wine. Cara
text: takes a bite.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Mmmmm! That's decadent.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: With these ingredients, it's not

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I'm glad I decided to come back
dialog: for you, Frank Taylor.
dialog: 
text: They watch one another eat for several moments.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK

dialog: 
text: She sets down her fork. Leans back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What's it like? Being a criminal?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: (scoffs)
dialog: I'm not a criminal.

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You carry a gun, you consort with
dialog: people being chased by killers... I
dialog: hate to break it to you, but--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Okay, I'm a criminal.
dialog: 
text: She takes a big gulp of wine. Moves over to the sofa.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I didn't mean for things to turn
dialog: out like this. I always lived by
dialog: a certain code. But then... I broke
dialog: it.
dialog: 
text: She lapses into silence. Frank comes and sits beside
dialog: her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: For Alexander Pearce?
dialog: 
text: She doesn't answer. Which is an answer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What's he like?
dialog: 
text: A beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: He's the most interesting man I've
dialog: ever known. When I first met him,
dialog: I wasn't expecting that. He took
dialog: me by surprise.
dialog: 
text: She shifts deeper into the leather cushions as if
text: reliving a memory of sensual pleasure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: If I'd been prepared, I might not
dialog: have loved him. But I wasn't. So
dialog: I did.
dialog:

speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Regret what?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Kissing you.
dialog: 
text: He looks into her eyes. They are sitting very close on

dialog: 
text: Frank puts an arm over her shoulders and leans in for a
dialog: kiss--
dialog: 
text: Cara stands abruptly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: What are you doing?
dialog: 
text: He looks up at her, questioningly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I thought...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: You thought what? That I saw you
dialog: on the train and my heart stopped?
dialog: That all my life I've been waiting
dialog: for a math teacher from the
dialog: Midwest to sweep me off my feet?
dialog: 
text: Frank doesn't respond.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: I picked you because of your
dialog: height. Do you understand?
dialog: 
text: He does. His humiliation complete, he rises with as much
text: dignity as he can muster and carries the plates into the
dialog: kitchen.
dialog: 
text: Cara looks after him... exasperated yet already sorry for
text: being so blunt. She is about to say something when...
dialog: 
text: Her CELL PHONE RINGS. A special ring.

speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: Signorina.

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
dialog: 
text: Paging through the cookbook, Frank locates the page. He
text: smiles in recognition at the familiar CODE pattern of red
text: dots. He pulls out a PEN...
dialog: 65.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank examines a sleek, tiny electric razor that
text: resembles a lollipop. Turning it on, he applies it.
text: Pleased, he keeps shaving.
dialog: 
text: Getting out of the shower, Frank enjoys the soft Frette
dialog: towels.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM, "SAFE HOUSE" - DAY
dialog: 
text: In the closets are dozens of flawless, custom-tailored
dialog: suits.
dialog: 
text: Flipping through the rack like a discerning shopper,
text: Frank arrives at a suit that catches his fancy. Elegant
dialog: and simple.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE MIRROR
dialog: 
text: Frank struggles to close Alexander Pearce's pants around
text: his lightly padded mid-section... a little too tight.
dialog: 
text: Frank is irritated to discover he's not quite as trim as
dialog: Pearce.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR
dialog: 
text: Frank engages himself in a spontaneous program of
text: CALISTHENICS. He struggles through a batch of push-ups,
text: then sit ups.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: IN THE MIRROR
dialog: 
text: Frank flosses his teeth. Then he backs up, taking in his
text: outfit. The lines of the suit highlight his frame.
dialog: 
text: He likes what he sees.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. DEMIDOV'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Demidov is getting dressed. It's an elaborate ritual:
text: carefully pressed pants, ironed shirt, starched collar,
dialog: etc.
dialog: 
text: His two BODYGUARDS stand nervously at attention, watching
dialog: him.
dialog: 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV
dialog: When I was a young man, times were
dialog: very hard. When an opportunity
dialog: presented itself, you took it.
dialog: 
text: He pats talcum powder on himself. The men remain stone-
dialog: faced.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
dialog: I was twelve years old when Gregor
dialog: asked me if I was ready for a
dialog: man's job. He was the top
dialog: chelovek in our housing block. So
dialog: I said yes. He gave me a crowbar
dialog: and told me to go bash in the
text: skull of another boy who had
dialog: stolen something from him.
dialog: 
text: He points at his platinum cufflinks on a bedside table
text: and snaps his fingers. Scarface hands them to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
dialog: Now it just so happened this boy
dialog: was a friend of mine. I did not
dialog: want to do this terrible thing.
dialog: But when you come from the
dialog: streets, you have no choice.
dialog: 
text: He carefully knots his tie in the mirror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
dialog: I worked very hard for years to
dialog: get past that life. So I would
dialog: not have to do these terrible
dialog: things. So I would have a choice...
dialog: 
text: He turns and smiles at his THICK-NECKED bodyguard. He
text: gestures toward the man's holstered pistol --
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
dialog: I have people like you to do these
dialog: things for me...
dialog: 
text: He holds out his hand; THICK NECK hands him the pistol.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
dialog: Except that you don't!
dialog: 
text: Suddenly Demidov pistol whips the man across the face!
dialog: 
text: Blood explodes from THICK NECK's nose. He falls down to
text: one knee, clutching his face in pain.
dialog: 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Scarface looks on in fear. Demidov calms himself almost
text: as quickly as he lost his temper. He drops the gun on
text: the carpet and steps back in disgust.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (CONT'D)
dialog: If you did your job properly, I
dialog: wouldn't have to get my hands
dialog: dirty, you piece of shit.

scene_heading: EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY
dialog: 
text: Heels clicking on the cobblestones, Cara strides quickly
text: along the Palazzo Vendramin en route to the Cipriani.
text: She checks her watch. Then walks faster.
dialog: 
text: She passes a smallish transporto via cargo (supply boat)
text: floating in the lagoon beside the Palazzo.
dialog: 
text: Cara approaches the poolside hotel restaurant.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY
dialog: 
text: From a second story SUITE of rooms, The ENGLISHMAN peers
text: through the curtains. He sees Cara seat herself at a
text: TABLE between the pool and the lagoon.
dialog: 
text: His eyes settle on the transporto. Workers step on and
text: off, carrying fresh linens into the hotel.
dialog: 
text: He leaves the window.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
dialog: 
text: There is a small cabin on the deck.
dialog: 
text: Inside the cabin, Ackerman, Goyal, a videographer, a
text: signals surveillance officer and a coordinating tactics
text: officer huddle.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman stares out the tinted window.
dialog: 
text: ACKERMAN'S POV - he can just see Cara sitting at the
dialog: table.
dialog: 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Fanning herself with a newspaper, Cara discreetly
text: evaluates the men in her sight lines. Venetian civic
text: leaders chatting by the bar, tourists reading maps...
dialog: 
text: Over her sunglasses she catches sight of a pair of YOUNG
text: LOVERS drunk in each other's grasp in the pool.
dialog: 
text: She turns away.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
dialog: 
text: Squinting, Ackerman evaluates his placements.
dialog: 
text: - A WAITER, idling at his bussing station, his eyes
text: roaming the palazzo.
dialog: 
text: - A VAPORETTO CAPTAIN, who quietly turns away requests
text: for a ride into St. Marks Square, his finger to his ear.
dialog: 
text: - An OLDER COUPLE sitting a few seats away from Cara.
dialog: 
text: And an AGENTE DI POLIZIA (police patrolman) loud and
text: jovial, joking with passersby, while quietly checking his
text: earpiece.
dialog: 
text: He speaks into the air.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENTE DI POLIZIA (V.O.)
dialog: (from the speakers)

scene_heading: EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY

scene_heading: IN THE TRANSPORTO
dialog:

dialog: Hold...wait for my signal...
dialog:

scene_heading: AT THE RESTAURANT
dialog: 
text: Cara glances up from her menu as she senses the elegant

dialog: 
text: The WAITER walks quickly toward Cara's table...
dialog: 
text: The elegant man is FRANK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: IN THE TRANSPORTO
dialog: 
text: Ackerman stares at the monitor with Frank's face on it.
text: He's quietly furious.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: What is that fool doing in the
dialog: middle of my operation?
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: AT THE RESTAURANT
dialog: 
text: Cara stares slack-jawed at Frank.
dialog: 
text: He has given himself a complete make-over. New haircut.
text: Pearce's suit fits him well.
dialog: 
text: He looks terrific. Cara notices before quickly recovering
text: her composure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Time for Alexander and me to meet
text: face to face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: I don't know what you're talking

dialog: have a quiet coffee.
dialog:

scene_heading: IN THE TRANSPORTO
dialog: 
text: Ackerman barks whispered orders into the speaker:
dialog: 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: (frustrated)
dialog: Move off. Move off.
dialog: 
text: The UNDERCOVER WAITER quickly moves away from Cara's
dialog: table.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman stares at the monitor which captures Cara's
text: angry expression.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (talking to the
dialog: screen)
dialog: Get rid of him!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: AT THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT
dialog: 
text: Defiantly, Frank pulls his chair in closer to Cara. He
text: signals to a different THIN WAITER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (to the waiter)
dialog: Caffe, per favore?
dialog: 
text: Frank turns back to Cara, who calls out--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Cameriere! No caffe for signor!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (contradicting her)
dialog: With milk!
dialog: 
text: She stares at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Do you want to be dead?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not particularly, but I'm tired of
dialog: being afraid. I've been running
text: around like a frightened mouse
dialog: long enough and I've decided I'm
dialog: finished.
dialog: 
text: Frank pulls out a Gitane cigarette. He lights it,
text: smoking while he talks.
dialog: 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: When I first saw the name I got
dialog: scared: "Alexander Pearce." He
dialog: even sounds like some super cool
dialog: master criminal with Russian
dialog: enemies and the beautiful
dialog: girlfriend... he probably works out.
dialog: He might own a pizza shop on the
dialog: side for all I know.
dialog: 
text: Frank frowns at the cigarette.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: These are disgusting.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
dialog: 
text: Goyal is seated at the communication station.
dialog: 
text: ON THE MONITOR - Frank is settled in opposite Cara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL
text: He's not going anywhere.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman peers directly out the window, as if he's going
dialog: to see something different.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Put Lipetti in. Tell him to play
text: it like he's dealing with a rowdy
dialog: guest-- escort him out.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CIPRIANI HOTEL, POOLSIDE RESTAURANT - DAY
dialog: 
text: Cara looks all around. No sign of any suitor
text: approaching.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: the hands of the THIN WAITER, who sprinkles
text: pepper carefully, presumably onto a dish. He then
text: platters the dish and lifts it over his shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Frank, you have no idea what
dialog: you're sticking your nose into.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Probably not. But I'm doing it
dialog: anyway. Alexander Pearce nearly
dialog: got me killed. It was his idea,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 72.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: He told you to pick out some
text: random sap on the train to take a
dialog: bullet for him, didn't he?
dialog: 
text: Frank works himself up, drawing courage from his anger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Well I'm not playing the role
dialog: anymore. I'm going to confront
dialog: him. He's supposed to meet you
dialog: here, isn't he? I'm going to tell
dialog: him exactly what I think of him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Wonderful. Another macho idiot.
dialog: (to the waiter)
dialog: Conto, per favore!
dialog: 
text: Frank leans in.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What's the lure, Cara? Obviously
dialog: not his character. Is it the
dialog: money? The luxury? What's any of
dialog: that worth if you're getting shot
dialog: at and you could go to jail?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I'm leaving Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: He's smooth, right? He probably
dialog: has mistresses in every European
dialog: city, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: It's really a shame you've scared
dialog: him off--
dialog: 
text: She tosses some Euros on the table.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: The two of you make a nice couple.
dialog: 
text: The THIN WAITER arrives with a PLATTER. He sets it down
text: in front of Cara.
dialog: 
text: The UNDERCOVER WAITER now moves toward the table with a
dialog: grim expression...
dialog: 
text: The THIN WAITER removes the platter. Cara looks down.
dialog: 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Spelled out in SALT and PEPPER on the plate is the
dialog: following:
dialog: 
scene_heading: "MY VILLA. TONIGHT. 8PM."
dialog: 
text: Cara no sooner reads it than the Thin Waiter, who we now
text: see is THE ENGLISHMAN...
dialog: 
text: ...BLOWS on the platter, scattering the salt and pepper
text: granules to the wind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the hell?
dialog: 
text: As Frank looks up.
dialog: 
text: The Englishman has already turned away, but the
text: Undercover Waiter is moving quickly toward Cara's table.
dialog: 
text: The Undercover Waiter picks up speed, changing course
text: slightly. WE SEE he's after The Englishman who is about
dialog: to enter the restaurant kitchen...
dialog: 
text: Then FRANK steps in front of The Undercover Waiter,
text: mistaking him for Pearce.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Frank!
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

dialog: 
scene_heading: THE POOLSIDE RESTAURANT
dialog: 
text: The Undercover Waiter tries to move past Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You hide out poolside and send
dialog: your girlfriend and a total
dialog: stranger to face the murderers who
dialog: are after you? Not much of a
dialog: tough guy, are you?
dialog: 
text: Frank SHOVES him back.
dialog: 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Where I come from, we don't treat
dialog: women like that!
dialog: 
text: Frank grabs the Undercover Waiter's collar with
text: unaccustomed strength.
dialog: 
text: Cara quietly picks up her bag and leaves the restaurant.
text: She walks as fast as she can without being noticed toward
dialog: the Palazzo Vendramin.
dialog: 
text: In the midst of his scuffle, Frank looks around and
text: realizes she's gone.
dialog: 
text: The Undercover Waiter's earpiece falls out in the melee...
text: Frank sees it and hesitates. Maybe this guy isn't
dialog: Pearce.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TRANSPORTO - DAY
dialog: 
text: Getting up from his seat in the cabin, Ackerman gestures
text: for the captain of the transporto to leave the dock.
dialog: 
text: ON THE MONITOR: Frank looks around and sees Cara: fifty
text: feet away. Walking with purpose.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: That goddamn fool.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman rubs his face and squats down, frustrated beyond
dialog: measure.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL
dialog: What do we do with him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Throw him in the lagoon.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: EXT. PALAZZO VENDRAMIN - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank brushes past tables, hits the street and RUNS down
text: the Palazzo, toward Cara.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cara!
dialog: 
text: Cara says nothing. She just shoots Frank an angry glance
text: and climbs onto A VAPORETTO (water taxi).
dialog: 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Frank runs to the edge of the water as it motors away.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly he feels the presence of somebody behind him.
text: TWO of ACKERMAN'S MEN are right there.
dialog: 
text: They pin his arms forcefully.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AGENT
dialog: Ok Signor... you can come with us
dialog: now.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks at the two big men on either side of him.
text: Then at Cara disappearing over the water. The fight
text: drains out of him and he doesn't resist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Frank sits alone in the sparsely furnished, windowless
text: room. A table, two chairs. A large mirror on the wall.
dialog: 
text: Frank straightens his slightly disheveled suit, as if
dialog: he's been dumped here without ceremony.
dialog: 
text: He glances in the mirror periodically, suspicious.
dialog: 
text: The door opens and Ackerman enters. He pulls up one of
text: the chairs and gestures for Frank to do the same.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Please...
dialog: 
text: He looks Frank up and down.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Nice suit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's borrowed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: It's a good fit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Unfortunately.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman reaches into his breast pocket and takes out his
text: INTERPOL credentials. Tosses them on the table for Frank
dialog: to see.
dialog: 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Police... better than the
dialog: alternative I suppose.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman smiles. Frank remains defiant. He jerks his
text: head toward the mirror confidently.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's watching from behind there?
dialog: 
text: Ackerman looks over at the mirror, taken off guard by the
text: question. He stands and goes to the mirror -- lifts it
text: off its hooks and sets it on the floor.
dialog: 
text: Nothing but plain wall underneath. Ackerman sits back
text: down. Frank is a little bit chastened.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: You have a vivid imagination.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I haven't needed it lately.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman smiles.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're in for a disappointment.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: I know that.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks up.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Since when?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Since the beginning.
dialog: 
text: Frank stares at him blankly...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How...?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Come. I want to show you

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: INT. INTERPOL FIELD HQ, VENICE - DAY
dialog: 
text: Ackerman leads Frank through the maze of desks and
text: police. Various members of the task force follow their
dialog: progress... Jean Luc, Jones, etc.
dialog: 
text: They arrive at a central INTEL area where Goyal sits in
text: front of several computer monitors.
dialog: 
text: He looks up as Ackerman and Frank arrive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: (to Goyal)
dialog: Pull up the CID Academy graduating
dialog: class for 2002.
dialog: 
text: Goyal raises an eyebrow, but does as he's told. A few

text: up on screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Take a good look.
dialog: 
text: Frank peers at the screen. He spots the instructor--
text: Ackerman seven years younger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
text: Take a look at the second row.
dialog: 
text: INSERT CLOSE UP on the screen.
dialog: 
text: Frank examines the second row. One of the young women
text: is... CARA MASON. Her hair is pulled back. She looks more
text: the determined police cadet than the sexy siren... but
dialog: it's definitely her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cara...
dialog: 
text: He is dumbfounded.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: We've been watching you this
dialog: entire time.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (dawning)
dialog: You saw those men try to kill me
dialog: and you didn't intervene?
dialog: 78.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: I'm trying to apprehend a major
dialog: criminal. I'm not a babysitter.
dialog: 
text: Frank grows angry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I want to speak with somebody at
dialog: the American Embassy. I'm going
dialog: to tell them that you and your
text: undercover officer knowingly and
dialog: recklessly endangered the life of
dialog: an American citizen! Let's see
dialog: what my government has to say

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: We're aware of the situation, Mr.
dialog: Taylor. But we take a long view
dialog: of these things... fortunately you
dialog: are unhurt...
dialog: 
text: Frank is incredulous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Then I'll go to the press. I'll
dialog: tell the entire story to the New

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: No. I don't think you'll do that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why not?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Because I don't think you want to
dialog: see Cara's entire career
dialog: destroyed.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Women like Cara don't come along
dialog: very often.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: In my case, they don't come along
dialog: at all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: She's the worst combination:

dialog: mind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If she's so smart, how did she get
dialog: caught up with Pearce?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
text: She explains it now as the

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Then why are you still using her?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH

text: ACKERMAN on the phone at his office.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Have you got him?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: You mean the idiot who ruined our

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Have you got him?
dialog: 
text: Ackerman glances out the window at Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
text: Cara is relieved.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: It's your own fault. We never
dialog: should have endangered a civilian.
dialog: You should have put an agent into
dialog: place.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: There was no time. Besides Pearce
dialog: is too smart for that; he would
dialog: have spotted the agent a mile
dialog: away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
text: He didn't spot me.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman smiles bitterly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Apparently he didn't have to.
dialog: 
text: Cara doesn't answer. Ackerman regrets the jibe. He
text: steps into a HALLWAY where it's quiet.
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry Cara. That was uncalled
dialog: for.
dialog: 
text: ON HER FACE as she listens to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm on edge because of our failure
dialog: today. If only the American
dialog: hadn't messed everything up... I
dialog: felt sure Pearce would show up
dialog: today.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: What makes you think he didn't?
dialog:

text: Ackerman strides into the room, calling for attention.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Okay everybody, listen up.
dialog: 
text: Jones, Quinn, Jean Luc and the rest of the team assemble.
text: Goyal has Frank with him, dragging him around like a lost
dialog: puppy dog...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We have a location and time for
text: the next meet. Pearce's villa.
dialog: Eight o'clock. We have to move
dialog: fast--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Pearce's own villa? Why would he
dialog: risk going back there? He must
dialog: know we'd be watching.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEAN LUC
text: Perhaps he's nostalgic.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: I doubt that. Maybe there's
dialog: something of value still there.
text: He left in a hurry after all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
text: Call in a search team.
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: We searched the place after the
dialog: raid last year. If there's
dialog: anything hidden there, only Pearce
dialog: knows where it is.
dialog: 
text: He picks up his coat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: We need to get agents in place all
text: around the villa.
dialog: 
text: Frank speaks up unexpectedly.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If you're all around his house,
dialog: will he show up?
dialog: 
text: A dozen heads turn to look at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: If I needed your advice Mr.
dialog: Taylor, I'd ask.
dialog: 
text: Frank shrinks down in his chair.
dialog: 
text: A beat. Ackerman turns back to the rest of the room.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Establish a wide perimeter. We'll
dialog: keep our distance and wire the
dialog: entire villa for video
dialog: surveillance.

scene_heading: INT. CIPRIANI HOTEL - DAY
dialog: 
text: A standard hotel room-- no lavish suite this time.
dialog: 
text: Cara stands in front of the mirror. Her shirt is
text: unbuttoned as she works to attach a TINY MICROPHONE to
text: her bra.
dialog: 
text: The tape gets stuck to itself and she has to start over...
dialog: 
text: A KNOCK on her hotel room door.
dialog: 84.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Come in.
dialog: 
text: Frank enters the room. Sees her half-dressed--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'm sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: It's okay. Come over here. I
dialog: need your help.
dialog: 
text: In an echo of their first meeting on the train (but
text: without the false flirtation) she turns to him and hands
text: him a piece of tape.
dialog: 
text: Their eyes meet. A flicker of a smile passes between
dialog: them.
dialog: 
text: Frank's fingers are perfectly steady this time as he
text: helps her secure the microphone and do up her shirt.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ackerman told me everything.
dialog: 
text: She takes a deep breath.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I'm sorry Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There's no apology necessary.
dialog: 
text: He steps back from her. She smooths her blouse. Turns
text: to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: (re: the wire)
dialog: How do I look?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Like the most beautiful woman on
dialog: earth.
dialog: 
dialog: The complete honesty and directness of his compliment
text: takes her by surprise. She's strangely moved by it.
dialog: 
text: She brushes her hand affectionately over his cheek.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: When will you go home?
dialog: 85.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Ackerman asked me to stay with the

dialog: thugs who came after me at the
dialog: Danieli show up. I'm the only one
dialog: who can identify them.
dialog: 
text: Something occurs to Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you tell him to keep an eye on
dialog: me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: (busted)
dialog: I told him to make sure you were
dialog: safe until this was over.
dialog: 
text: He nods. A little pleased at her concern.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You shouldn't worry about me.
dialog: What about you?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: What about me?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What are you going to do?

dialog: night of the raid just over a year ago.
dialog: 
text: Then a wind picks up and blows the mist clear.
dialog: 
text: REVEAL an undercover POLICEMAN with an earpiece walking a

dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ON THE CORNER - two blocks down is a village CHURCH.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Ackerman and his team have set up a make-shift
text: surveillance outpost here. The high-tech equipment looks
text: incongruous with the thousand year-old stone walls and
text: worn oak pews.
dialog: 
text: A bank of monitors reveals various views of the inside
text: and outside of Alexander's villa.
dialog: 
text: Frank hovers in the background behind Ackerman. He
text: notices Ackerman has a copy of the International Herald
dialog: Tribune.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You all read the same newspaper.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: It's a good paper. And sold
dialog: throughout the world. Makes the
dialog: classified ads especially useful...
dialog: 
text: Frank nods. Ackerman sits down next to Frank as if he
text: were an old pal instead of a quasi-captive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Since the internet came about,
dialog: hardly anybody uses old school
dialog: methods like that to communicate
dialog: anymore. Except Alexander Pearce.
dialog: No lines to tap. No signals to
dialog: intercept.
dialog: (admiringly)
dialog: He's a very clever man, your
dialog: double.

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I look forward to meeting him.

speaker_heading: AGENT

dialog: You'll have to turn around, sir.
dialog: There's been a chemical spill in

dialog:

scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE OUTPOST IN CHURCH

scene_heading: INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA/VIDEO MONITORS - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: While everyone is focused on the monitors showing Cara's

dialog: 
text: It shows the lower floor of the house.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (points)
dialog: Who's that?
dialog:

text: approaches the lens of the surveillance camera...
dialog: 
text: BLINK! The FEED shuts off.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman barks at a technician.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: What happened? Get it back on
dialog: line!
dialog: 
text: The surveillance techs begin madly punching buttons, etc.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: Was that Pearce?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL
dialog: How did he know there would be a

dialog: 
text: BLINK! Another monitor goes dark. Then another.

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: I can't! He's cutting the feed at
dialog: the source.
dialog: 
text: Frank looks anxiously at Cara on the monitor climbing the
dialog: stairs...
dialog: 
text: Blink! She disappears from view as well. Everybody

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Shut up! Everyone.
dialog:

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Do we still have audio?
dialog: 
text: The tech nods.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn it up.
dialog: 
text: Everybody in the Church stands stock still. Staring at
text: the dark monitors. Listening.
dialog: 
text: Cara's footsteps click up the stairs and then slow...
dialog: 
text: They move tentatively across the floor.
dialog: 
text: WE HEAR A THUMP. A door or a heavy footstep?
dialog: 
text: Cara's breathing gets louder. There's somebody else in
dialog: the building.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (V.O.)
dialog: Alexander?
dialog: 
text: No response. Click, clack, click... She takes a few steps.

scene_heading: INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

dialog: 
text: DEMIDOV. He and his two men have removed their masks.

speaker_heading: CARA (V.O.)

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

speaker_heading: JONES

speaker_heading: DEMIDOV
dialog: You're waiting for someone, Ms.

dialog: 
text: Cara doesn't reply.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: (MORE)

speaker_heading: GOYAL

speaker_heading: ACKERMAN

scene_heading: EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
dialog:

speaker_heading: SNIPER
dialog: (into his radio mic)
dialog: She's brought them to the window...

scene_heading: INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
dialog:

speaker_heading: SNIPER (V.O.)

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Demidov circles Cara dangerously close.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV
dialog: Not very polite of your boyfriend

dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
text: He loses track of time easily.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV
dialog: I have a hard time believing that.

dialog: 
text: INSIDE THE CHURCH
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think?
dialog: 
text: A long silence. The tension grows. Then we hear...
dialog: 
text: A LOUD SLAP.
dialog: 
text: Everyone in the room flinches.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You know... I have a feeling he is
dialog: around here somewhere. And if he
dialog: cares about you... if he wants to
dialog: see your lovely face again... he
dialog: should show up before it's too
dialog: late.
dialog: 
scene_heading: ANOTHER SLAP - MORE VICIOUS THAN THE FIRST. This time

dialog: 
text: Goyal turns to Ackerman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL
dialog: Sir?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Demidov's right. He's here

dialog: 
text: Another SLAP. Another scream.
dialog: 
text: Jean Luc looks to his colleagues-- Jones, Quinn... then
text: turns to Ackerman. Every one of them is about to burst.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEAN LUC
dialog: We have to do something--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: We have to wait.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEAN LUC
dialog: Yes but--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: (harsh)
dialog: She's my agent. She's my
dialog: responsibility.
dialog: 
text: A muffled THUD. Cara groans and WE HEAR her body hit the
dialog: floor. That wasn't a slap.
dialog: 93.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Every cop in the room is clenching his weapon. Desperate
dialog: for the order to move. To jump in and stop this.
dialog: 
text: They are all looking to Ackerman to give the order.
dialog: 
text: As the silence wears on, even Jones starts to waver. She
text: speaks quietly to Ackerman.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: What if he doesn't come?
dialog: 
text: Ackerman doesn't respond.
dialog: 
text: The lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing

speaker_heading: GOYAL
dialog: Where's Taylor?
dialog: 
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:

dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cara lies on her side at Demidov's feet. Blood trickles
text: from the side of her mouth.
dialog: 
text: Her eyes are clouded with fear and pain as she views the
text: room half-askew. Then they suddenly come into focus as
dialog: she sees...
dialog: 
text: A figure walks into the room. FRANK.
dialog: 
text: He stand motionless in the doorway, surprisingly calm.
dialog: 
text: Demidov turns.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV
dialog: (leans down to Cara)
dialog: Good news. He loves you.
dialog: 94.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Demidov's men take Frank by either arm and roughly drag
dialog: him forward.
dialog: 
text: Cara lifts her head with an effort.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: That's not Alexander Pearce.
dialog: 
text: Demidov ignores her and walks up to Frank.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV
dialog: You know, Mr. Pearce, I thought I
dialog: was finished with this sort of
dialog: thing. But in your case, I've
dialog: been forced to make an exception.
dialog: 
text: He holds out his hand and one of his THUGS gives him a
text: PISTOL and a SILENCER.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: He is NOT Alexander Pearce!
dialog: 
text: Demidov begins screwing the silencer onto the barrel.
dialog: 
text: The thugs push Frank to his knees.
dialog: 
text: But he's barely paying attention to them. His eyes are
text: locked on Cara.
dialog: 
text: She meets his gaze. For a moment, it's as if nothing
text: else in the world exists but the two of them.
dialog: 
text: He may only be a hapless tourist, but he loves her.
text: He's the one here, willing to give up his life to save
dialog: hers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh Frank... I'm so sorry.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Nothing to be sorry for.
dialog: 
text: Demidov finishes attaching the silencer. He points the

dialog: 
speaker_heading: DEMIDOV
dialog: Good bye Mr. Pearce.
dialog: 
text: At this moment, Cara fills her lungs and screams:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Ackerman!
dialog: 95.
dialog: 
dialog:

dialog: 
text: The huge, plate glass window shatters as the high powered

dialog: 
text: Everything explodes in a mass of blood and glass.
text: SCARFACE is blown off his feet. His body hits the ground
text: next to Frank... his gun skitters across the floor.
dialog: 
text: Demidov looks from the window to Cara with cold fury in
text: his eyes-- she's the one who has called in the artillery.
text: He raises his pistol toward her, point blank.
dialog: 
text: BANG! The gunshot takes him by surprise. He turns to
dialog: see...
dialog: 
text: FRANK holds Scarface's smoking pistol in his hand.
text: Demidov just has time to process the fact that Frank is
text: the one who shot him before the life drains from his eyes
text: and he topples...
dialog: 
text: Demidov's other bodyguard fires out the windows wildly
text: and makes a run for it. Glass flies everywhere.
dialog: 
text: Frank throws his body over Cara to protect her.
dialog: 96.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: A short and furious exchange of gunfire as the other

text: as furniture is torn apart. Finally...
dialog: 
text: One of the sniper's bullets finds its target and the

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Are you all right?
dialog: 
text: Cara nods. She looks at him for a long moment, then
text: breaks out into a smile.

speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: I did well to choose you on the

dialog:

dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You didn't get to arrest Alexander
dialog: Pearce...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: He never showed up.
dialog: 
text: Frank slides closer to her. Gently, carefully, he slips
text: his hands into Cara's cleavage.
dialog: 
text: Surprised, Cara starts to pull back-- but he puts a
text: finger to her lips.
dialog: 
text: She hesitates... looks at him questioningly. But she
text: doesn't protest as his fingers move toward her bra...
dialog: 97.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: ...and grasp the tiny MICROPHONE. With a sharp tug, he
text: rips it free. He tosses it across the room.
dialog: 
text: Then he leans a little closer and whispers in her ear:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a British accent)
dialog: You're wrong. I'm here.
dialog: 
text: She straightens up. Her heart skips a beat.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: It's me. I'm here.
dialog: 
text: She covers her mouth. Her eyes mist over with tears.
dialog: 
text: She runs her fingers over his face with loving amazement.
text: Like a blind person trying to recognize a familiar face.
dialog: 
text: Her mind reels...
dialog: 
text: Then their lips meet. They kiss. And kiss. Like
text: drinking from a fresh spring in the desert.
dialog: 
text: Finally she pulls away and looks at him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: Why?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You said I'd told so many lies,
dialog: you wouldn't believe me even if I
dialog: did tell the truth... This was the
dialog: only way to convince you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: The truth is that I love you. All
dialog: that matters is that you believe
dialog: me.
dialog: 
text: She stares into his eyes for a beat. Finally looking at
text: her without a trace of deception. She believes.
dialog: 
text: They hear voices on the stairs below.
dialog: 
text: Frank holds up a finger to her-- wait.
dialog: 
text: Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch
text: on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to
text: reveal a hidden safe built into the floor.
dialog: 
text: Frank removes the fitted floor boards. There is a
text: sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the
text: gate in the beginning of the movie.
dialog: 98.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks
dialog: open.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. ALEXANDER'S VILLA - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: TRACK WITH ACKERMAN up the stairs.
dialog: 
text: He leads the team into the PENTHOUSE.
dialog: 
text: He looks around at the mess as the agents fan out.
dialog: 
text: Cara leans on Frank's arm as she heads for the exit.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Cara... I want the paramedics to
dialog: make sure you're all right--
dialog: 
text: She blows right past him. Ackerman calls out after her.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Cara...
dialog: 
text: She pauses. Turns to face him.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman looks down for a moment, ashamed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry... I... we'll talk about
dialog: this later.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: No we won't. There's nothing to
dialog: talk about. I don't work for you
dialog: anymore.
dialog: 
text: She walks past him. For a moment Ackerman and Frank look
text: at one another.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Mr. Taylor... you're free to go.
dialog: 
text: He looks at Frank with a measure of begrudging respect.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: It seems I underestimated you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (American accent)
dialog: It seems you did, Mr. Ackerman.
dialog: 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: With that, Frank steps out of the room. Ackerman's
text: attention is distracted by--
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL
dialog: Sir... over here. Take a look at
dialog: this!
dialog: 
text: Goyal has found the safe. Ackerman comes over and looks.
dialog: 
text: INSERT CLOSE UP - the only thing in the safe is a single
text: FLASH DRIVE.
dialog: 
text: Goyal signals to one of the TECHS. He opens a laptop on
text: the desk and they plug in the FLASH DRIVE to check the
dialog: contents.
dialog: 
text: While they are doing this, Ackerman bends to inspect the
scene_heading: BIO-METRIC LOCK.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: He was here.
dialog: 
text: Jones looks on eagerly as numbers fill the screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL
dialog: Account numbers... access codes...
dialog: unless I'm mistaken... he left the
text: money behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JEAN LUC
dialog: A mistake perhaps?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: How much is there?
dialog: 
text: Goyal scans down to a total...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOYAL
dialog: Looks like 744 million.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: That's no mistake...
dialog: (walks over)
dialog: That's his tax bill.
dialog: 
text: She holds out her hand to the TECH who has just removed
text: the FLASH DRIVE.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll take that.
dialog: 
text: She slips it into her pocket, then turns to Ackerman.
dialog: 100.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Ackerman has moved away. He's staring down at the ground
text: -- from behind he looks like a man defeated.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES (CONT'D)
dialog: Well John... with the funds
dialog: recovered, I don't think there's
dialog: going to be any appetite from our
dialog: side to continue this
dialog: investigation.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman's shoulders are slumped, staring at Demidov's
text: dead body on the ground. Jones puts a hand on his back,
text: consoling him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm sorry you didn't get your man.
dialog: 
text: Then Ackerman turns... a big smile on his face.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Oh but I did get my man, Ms.
dialog: Jones.
dialog: 
text: She realizes; he was after Demidov all along.
dialog: 
text: Ackerman nods to Goyal, a twinkle in his eye.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Goyal, you may place Mr. Quinn
text: under arrest now.
dialog: 
text: Quinn is taken completely off guard. Before he can move,
text: Goyal and another agent have placed him in handcuffs.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Quinn)
dialog: What? You thought I didn't know?
dialog: You were unwittingly quite
dialog: helpful; without you Mr. Demidov
dialog: might have escaped justice.
dialog: 
text: He turns to Jones with a smile.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN (CONT'D)
dialog: After all, Demidov wasn't a target
dialog: of this investigation, was he?
dialog: 
text: Ackerman walks over to the window as Quinn is led away.
dialog: 
text: ACKERMAN'S POV - Cara and Frank walk toward the canal in
text: the street below.
dialog: 
text: A WATER TAXI approaches.
dialog: 101.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JONES
dialog: There's something I don't
dialog: understand... how did Pearce manage
dialog: to get here and open that safe
dialog: without anybody noticing? And
dialog: where did he go?
dialog: 
text: Ackerman stands at the window with his hands behind his
text: back. For the briefest of moments, Frank looks back up
text: at him and their eyes connect.
dialog: 
text: Frank gives him a little smile. Cara takes his arm to
text: climb onto the boat.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON ACKERMAN: his eyes narrow. He knows.
dialog: 
text: For a moment he doesn't move. Then, in spite of himself,
text: a small smile creeps over his face too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ACKERMAN
dialog: Because Pearce was cleverer than
dialog: all of us.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. WATER TAXI - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Cara and Frank step on board.
dialog: 
text: The DRIVER starts the engine.
dialog: 
text: He turns to REVEAL... that he is the "ENGLISHMAN" we've
text: seen throughout the movie. He and Frank look at one
text: another for a moment.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE ENGLISHMAN
dialog: $20 million dollars worth of
dialog: surgery and that's the face you
dialog: chose?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (English accent)
dialog: It's good to see you too.
dialog: 
text: They embrace warmly. Cara is in disbelief, realizing
dialog: just how completely Frank/Alexander has planned things
dialog: out.
dialog: 
text: She casts one last glance backwards.
dialog: 102.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: You really think they'll just give
dialog: up?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The Americans have their money. I
dialog: left it all for them.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CARA
dialog: What about Demidov's money?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Well...
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You have to save something for
dialog: your pension.
dialog: 
text: The Englishman opens the door to the cabin for them.
dialog: 
text: A bottle of Crystal Champagne and two glasses are set out
text: for them. Frank leads Cara in and offers her a glass.
dialog: 
text: Instead, she slips into his arms and presses against him.
text: They begin to kiss...
dialog: 
text: CAMERA STAYS discreetly behind as they pull away from us,
text: the water taxi swinging out into the Grand Canal.
dialog: 
text: As it recedes from view, the vaporetto's tail lamps
text: shimmer and blend into the beautiful lights of Venice... a
dialog: city for lovers.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: THE END
