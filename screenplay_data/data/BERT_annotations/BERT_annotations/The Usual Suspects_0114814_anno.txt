speaker_heading: 1 BLACK 1
text: The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance. Water
text: slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The
dialog: creaking of wood.
text: Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of
dialog: sirens.
text: SUDDENLY, a single match ignites and invades the darkness.
text: It quivers for a moment. A dimly lit hand brings the rest of
text: the pack to the match. A plume of yellow-white flame flares
text: and illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON, age forty.
text: His salty-gray hair is wet and matted. His face drips with
text: water or sweat. A large cut runs the length of his face from
text: the corner of his eye to his chin. It bleeds freely. An un-
text: lit cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.
text: In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of
text: a large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. He
text: sits with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel
dialog: house.
text: His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. He
dialog: looks down.
text: A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the
text: darkness. Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of
dialog: matches before throwing them into the liquid.
dialog: The liquid IGNITES with a poof.
text: The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity.
text: It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck
dialog: towards the stern.
scene_heading: 2 EXT. BOAT - NIGHT - STERN 2
text: A stack of oil drums rests on the stern. They are stacked on
text: a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge
text: crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at
text: its base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.
text: The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles
dialog: weakly to himself.
text: The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another
text: stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles
text: out pitifully with a hiss.
text: Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto
dialog: the deck from between them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 2
text: The sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move
text: over to where Keaton rests at the wheel house.
text: CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of
text: cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter
text: from the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down
text: over the flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb
text: and strikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,
dialog: somewhat showy.
text: Keaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses
text: his face. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally
dialog: resignation.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: How are you, Keaton?
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: I'd have to say my spine was broken,
dialog: Keyser.
text: He spits the name out like it was poison.
text: The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under
text: his jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Ready?
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: What time is it?
text: The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on
dialog: its wrist upward.
text: The sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Twelve thirty.
text: Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away
dialog: and takes another drag.
text: The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy
text: his last drag before pulling the trigger.
speaker_heading: GUNSHOT
text: The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.
text: MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline
dialog: still flowing freely.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 3
text: The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front
text: of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle
text: around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking
text: the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.
text: MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.
text: The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD
dialog: BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie
text: scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a
dialog: fierce fire-fight.
text: A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.
text: On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders.
text: The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon
dialog: beneath its base.
text: MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.
text: Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
dialog: out of control.
scene_heading: SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET
speaker_heading: POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.
text: MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS
text: Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.
text: Then silence. TOTAL BLACKNESS.
dialog: We hear the voice of ROGER "VERBAL" KINT, whom we will soon
dialog: meet.
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.)
dialog: New York. - six weeks ago. A truck
dialog: loaded with stripped gun parts got
dialog: jacked outside of Queens. The driver
dialog: didn't see anybody, but somebody
dialog: fucked up. He heard a voice.
dialog: Sometimes, that's all you need.
speaker_heading: BOOM
scene_heading: 3 INT. DARK APARTMENT - DAY - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO
speaker_heading: PRESENT DAY 3
text: The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark
text: room. Outside, the hall is filled with blinding white light.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 4
text: Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room. We can
text: make out men in hoods with flashlights. They are laden with
dialog: weapons.
speaker_heading: VOICES
scene_heading: POLICE. SEARCH WARRANT. DON'T MOVE.
text: It is a blur of violent action and sound. Beams of
text: flashlights cut the darkness in all directions.
speaker_heading: FINALLY:
text: A dozen flashlights land on one man. He lies naked in bed,
text: Merging from a deep sleep. He squints at the flood of blinding
text: white light, more annoyed than frightened. He nearly laughs
text: at the sound of countless guns cocking. He is McMANUS. Age
dialog: twenty-eight.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Mr. McManus?
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Police. We have a warrant for your
dialog: arrest.
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Will they be serving coffee downtown?
text: Two dozen black gloved hands grab him and yank him out of
dialog: bed.
scene_heading: 4 INT. AUTO BODY SHOP - DAY 4
text: An old paint mixer vibrates furiously.
text: TODD HOCKNEY, a dark, portly man in his thirties is working
dialog: on an old Fire-bird.
text: A YOUNG HISPANIC KID mixes paint a few feet away.
dialog: SUDDENLY, the garage door opens TO REVEAL:
text: A row of five men silhouetted by the bright sun.
dialog: Hockney squints.
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY
dialog: Can I help you?
text: Hockney's voice is gruff.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 5
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Todd Hockney?
text: Hockney reaches for something just inside the door of the
dialog: Fire-bird.
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY
dialog: Who are you?
text: All six men INSTANTLY PRODUCE GUNS and aim them at Hockney.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Police.
text: Hockney withdraws a filthy towel and wipes grease and sweat
dialog: from his forehead.
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY
dialog: We don't do gun repair.
scene_heading: 5 EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - DAY 5
text: FRED FENSTER, a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls
text: casually down the street. He is dressed conspicuously in a
dialog: loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching.
text: He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time.
text: He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown
text: Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb. He
text: picks up his step a little. The Ford keeps up.
text: He looks ahead at the corner. He tries to look as comfortable
text: as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an
text: appointment he is late for. The Ford stays right on him.
text: SUDDENLY, he bolts. He gets no more than a few yards before
text: cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny. Brakes
text: are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking. Fenster is
text: surrounded instantly. He stops short and flaps his hands on
dialog: his thighs in defeat.
scene_heading: 6 INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT - DAY 6
text: An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front
dialog: of a small New York cafe. They are charged with nervous,
dialog: excited energy.
text: The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man
text: in his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much
text: better than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him
dialog: is EDIE FINNERAN, age thirty-three, poised and attractive -
dialog: Easily the calmer of the two.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 6
text: They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant leading
text: down to a dark room. Edie takes Keaton's arm and stops him.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: Let me look at you.
text: Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the situation.
text: Still, he smiles with genuine warmth.
text: Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections
dialog: from his lapel.
speaker_heading: EDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Now remember, this is another kind
dialog: of business. They don't earn your
dialog: respect. You owe it to them. Don't
dialog: stare them down but don't look away
dialog: either. Confidence. They are fools
dialog: not to trust you. That's the attitude.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: I'm having a stroke.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: You've come far. You're a good man.
dialog: I love you.
text: Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response.
speaker_heading: PAUSE
speaker_heading: EDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Live with it.
text: She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close
text: behind. Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly stumbles
dialog: down the stairs.
scene_heading: 7 INT. RESTAURANT - DOWNSTAIRS 7
text: They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing
text: each other. Once off the stairs they instantly transform as
dialog: though hit with cold air. They assume a cool, professional
text: exterior and walk two feet apart. One would look at them and
dialog: see only two business associates here to ply their trade.
text: They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the
text: far corner where two men are already waiting. The first is
dialog: MR. FORTIER, age thirty-five, the other is MR. RENAULT, age
text: sixty. Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished
dialog: air. They stand and smile.
speaker_heading: FORTIER
dialog: Edie, nice to see you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 7
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: Sorry we're late.
speaker_heading: FORTIER
dialog: Nonsense. Sit, please.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: (struggling with
dialog: English)
dialog: You must be Mr. Keaton.
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: I'm sorry. Dean Keaton.
text: Renault's hand is already out.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Monsieur Renault. A pleasure.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: How do you do?
text: They shake hands. Keaton takes Fortier's hand next.
speaker_heading: FORTIER
dialog: Monsieur Fortier. So nice to finally
dialog: meet you.
text: Everyone sits at the table. All faces are smiling.
speaker_heading: LOW ANGLE: UNDER TABLE
text: Edie's hand reaches out and finds Keaton's leg. Her hand
text: runs high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly.
text: Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand
text: is doing. Keaton smiles and clears his throat.
scene_heading: 8 INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT 8
text: Follow a waiter past the flight of steps.
speaker_heading: PAN DOWN TO REVEAL:
text: Five sets of feet arriving at the bottom.
dialog: The feet in the middle wear shoes notably nicer than the
dialog: rest.
speaker_heading: PAN UP TO REVEAL:
speaker_heading: SPECIAL AGENT DAVID KUJAN (Pronounced Koo-yahn), U.S. CUSTOMS.
dialog: Thirtyish, dark-haired and determined.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 8
scene_heading: 9 INT. RESTAURANT - DOWNSTAIRS 9
speaker_heading: FORTIER
dialog: Edie brought us your proposal and
dialog: I'll be honest. We're very impressed.
dialog: A bit skeptical, I must admit, but
dialog: impressed.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: Skeptical.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: We find the concept brilliant, but
dialog: New York is difficult for new
dialog: restaurants. How can we be certain
dialog: that our money will be returned in
dialog: the long run?
text: Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: It's simple gentlemen, design
dialog: versatility. A restaurant that can
dialog: change with taste without losing the
dialog: overall aesthetic. Our atmosphere
dialog: won't be painted on the walls.
speaker_heading: FORTIER
dialog: This was the part of the proposal
dialog: that intrigued us, but I'm not sure
dialog: I follow.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: Let's say for example -
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: This I had to see myself.
text: Keaton looks up. He sees David Kujan. Behind him are the
dialog: very serious looking guys in suits.
dialog: Keaton is not happy to see them.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: Dave. I'm in a meeting.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: Time for another one.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: This is my attorney, Edie Finneran.
dialog: (Gesturing)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 9
speaker_heading: KEATON (CONT'D)
dialog: This is Mr. Renault and Mr. Fortier.
dialog: Everyone, this is David Kujan.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: Special Agent Kujan. U.S. Customs.
dialog: (Gestures to men behind
dialog: him)
dialog: These gentlemen are with the New
dialog: York police department. You look
dialog: great, Keaton. Better than I would
dialog: have thought.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: Is there a problem, Mr. Keaton?
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: The small matter of a stolen truck-
dialog: load of guns that wound up on a boat
dialog: to Ireland last night.
text: Renault and Fortier's confusion is giving way to suspicion.
speaker_heading: FORTIER
dialog: Mr. Keaton?
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: If you will excuse us for a moment,
dialog: gentlemen.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: We need to ask you some questions
dialog: downtown. You'll be quite awhile.
dialog: Renault starts to get up.
speaker_heading: RENAULT
dialog: We should leave you to discuss
dialog: whatever this is.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: Please. Sit.
text: Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to
text: cover the check. He looks at Edie. She moves to stand, but
text: he sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: KEATON (CONT'D)
dialog: Enjoy the meal.
dialog: (To Edie)
dialog: I'll call you.
text: Kujan takes him by the arm, but Keaton yanks away.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 10
text: He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the restaurant.
text: Everyone is looking at him with some level of surprise. If
text: Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he hides it well.
scene_heading: 10 INT. LOCK-UP HALLWAY - NIGHT 10
text: A police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel
dialog: door.
text: FOLLOW A PAIR OF FEET as they shuffle across the cement floor.
text: The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled pants
text: that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right foot is
text: turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It is
dialog: clear that the knee does not extend fully.
text: The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a
text: steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into
text: step with the first. Another steel door and another set of
text: feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet
dialog: walk single file down the hall.
text: The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to
text: another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents
dialog: and rivets.
speaker_heading: CRANE UP TO REVEAL:
text: ROGER KINT, VERBAL to his few friends. He has a deeply lined
dialog: face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best. From
dialog: his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a
text: slight but not debilitating palsy. Behind him are Dean Keaton,
dialog: Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney. Verbal steps through
text: the door, followed by the rest.
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.)
dialog: It didn't make sense that I be there.
dialog: I mean these guys were hard-core
dialog: hijackers, but there I was. At that
dialog: point, I wasn't scared, I knew I
dialog: hadn't done anything they could do
dialog: me for. Besides, it was fun. I got
dialog: to make like I was notorious.
scene_heading: 11 INT. LINE-UP ROOM 11
text: The five men are ushered into the room in front of a white
text: wall painted with horizontal blue stripes. Each has a number
text: at either end to denote the height of the man in front of
dialog: it.
dialog: Between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the
dialog: specific height in inches.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 11
text: Bright lights shine on all of them. They squint, eyes
dialog: adjusting.
text: Keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with
text: him. He shares a look of familiarity with Fenster and then
text: McManus. Hockney smiles at all of them.
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: (To Keaton)
dialog: Where you been, man?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: SHUT UP IN THERE. Alright, you all
dialog: know the drill. When your number is
dialog: called, step forward and repeat the
dialog: phrase you've been given. Understand?
dialog: The men all nod.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Number one. Step forward.
text: Hockney takes a step forward. He looks directly into a mirror
text: on the other side of the room. It is three feet square and
text: we can make out faint light behind it. It is a two-way. He
text: speaks in a complete dead-pan.
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY
dialog: Hand-me-the-keys, you-fucking-cock-
dialog: sucker.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Number two. Step forward.
text: McManus steps up and makes a gun with his thumb and
text: forefinger. He mocks criminal intensity, pointing at the
dialog: mirror. He camps up his line.
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Give me the keys, you motherfucking,
dialog: cocksucking pile of shit, or I'll
dialog: rip off your--
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
text: KNOCK IT OFF. Get back in line.
dialog: McManus steps back.
text: The rest of the men do their bit as Verbal speaks.
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.)
dialog: It was bullshit. The whole rap was a
dialog: setup. Everything is the cops' fault.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 12
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: You don't put guys like that in a
dialog: room together. Who knows what can
dialog: happen?
scene_heading: 12 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 12
text: McManus sits in a chair in front of a white wall. He smiles
dialog: at someone off-screen.
speaker_heading: OVERLAPPED:
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: This has to be embarrassing for you
dialog: guys, huh? I mean you know and I
dialog: know this is a load of shit, but at
dialog: least I don't have a captain with
dialog: his dick in my ass making me play
dialog: along. That has got to suck,
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Are you done?
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Do you work for a broad? That would
dialog: have to be the worst.
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.S.)
dialog: Are you done?
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Still, I guess dignity is a small
dialog: pries to pay for medical and a
dialog: pension. A small pension, mind you,
dialog: but a pension nonetheless.
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.)
dialog: They drilled us all night. Somebody
dialog: was pissed about that truck getting
dialog: knocked off and the cops had nothing.
dialog: They were hoping somebody would slip.
dialog: Give them something to go on. They
dialog: knew we wouldn't fight it because
dialog: they knew how to lean on us. They'd
dialog: been doing it forever. Our rights
dialog: went right out the window. It was a
dialog: violation. I mean disgraceful. They
dialog: went after McManus first. He was a
dialog: good guy. Crazy though. A top notch
dialog: entry man.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: So where'd you dump the truck?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 13
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: What truck?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: The truck with the guns, fucko.
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: You kill me, you really do. Where's
dialog: my phone call?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Right here. Suck it out.
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Clever guy.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You want to know what your buddy
dialog: Fenster told us?
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Do I look stupid enough to fall for
dialog: that? Jesus Christ. Beat me if you
dialog: gotta, but no more of the candy-land
dialog: tactics, man.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: WHERE'S THE FUCKING TRUCK?
scene_heading: 13 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 13
text: Now Fenster is in the seat. He sweats profusely.
speaker_heading: FENSTER
dialog: I want to call my lawyer. I don't
dialog: know about any truck. I was in
dialog: Connecticut all night on Friday.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: That's not what McManus said.
speaker_heading: OVERLAPPED:
speaker_heading: FENSTER
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: McManus. He told us another story
dialog: altogether.
speaker_heading: FENSTER
dialog: Was it the one about the hooker with
dialog: dysentery I swear, she never mentioned
dialog: money until I came.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
scene_heading: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dialog: p. 14
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Be fold us about the truck.
speaker_heading: FENSTER (O.S.)
dialog: To be honest, it was more like a
dialog: mobile home. She made a lot of money,
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: Who took the guns off your hands?
speaker_heading: FENSTER
dialog: Hey, are we talking about the same
dialog: thing?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: I'm losing my patience.
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.)
dialog: Fenster always worked with McManus.
dialog: He was a real tight-ass, but when it
dialog: came to the job, he was right on.
dialog: Smart guy. A gopher. Got whatever
dialog: you needed for next to nothing.
speaker_heading: FENSTER
dialog: You guys got nothing on me. Where's
dialog: your probable cause?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You're a known hijacker. You're
dialog: sweating like a guilty motherfucker.
dialog: That's my p.c. Save us the time.
dialog: Tell us where the truck is.
text: Fenster knocks on the table.
speaker_heading: FENSTER
dialog: HELLO? Can you hear me in the back?
dialog: P.C.
text: He looks under his chair.
speaker_heading: FENSTER (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is it? I'm lookin'. It's not
dialog: happening. What's going on with that?
dialog: I want--
text: Hockney's turn in the chair. He laughs it all off.
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY

speaker_heading: OVERLAPPED:
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you. You don't think I know
dialog: you're on the take. This whole fucking
dialog: precinct is dirty. You don't have a
dialog: fucking leg to stand on.
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.)
dialog: Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good
dialog: with explosives. Mean as a snake
dialog: when it mattered .
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You think so, tough guy? I can put
dialog: you in Queens the day of the
dialog: hijacking.
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY
dialog: I live in Queens. What the fuck is
dialog: this? You come into my store and
dialog: lock me up in front of my customers.
dialog: What the hell is wrong with this
dialog: country? Are you guys gonna charge
dialog: me or what?
speaker_heading: VOICE (O.S.)
dialog: You know what happens if you do

speaker_heading: HOCKNEY

scene_heading: 14 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 14
text: Now Keaton sits in the chair, cool and indifferent.
speaker_heading: VERBAL (V.O.)

text: Above his desk is a bulletin board. It is a breathtaking

speaker_heading: VERBAL

speaker_heading: KUJAN (CONT'D)
dialog: The first thing I learned on the

speaker_heading: EDIE

speaker_heading: KEATON

text: the arm, pulling gently. She glares at the others.
speaker_heading: EDIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come home, Dean.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: (Distant)
dialog: Alright.
text: Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the

text: He looks at Verbal without any expression whatsoever.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: What are you doing here? How did

text: Keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: What the hell do you want?
speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: wanted to talk to you. The other

speaker_heading: KEATON

speaker_heading: VERBAL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: LONG PAUSE - FINALLY:
speaker_heading: EDIE
dialog: So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
speaker_heading: VERBAL

speaker_heading: EDIE

speaker_heading: KEATON

speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: If you'll just let me -

dialog: Do I? Keaton was under indictment a
dialog: total of seven times when he was on
dialog: the force. In every case, witnesses
dialog: either reversed their testimony to
dialog: the grand jury or died before they
dialog: could testify. When they finally did
dialog: nail him for fraud, he spent five
dialog: years in Sing Sing. He killed three
dialog: prisoners inside - one with a knife
dialog: in the tailbone while he strangled
dialog: him to death. Of course I can't prove

speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: An order.
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI
dialog: In nineteen-eighty one, Mr. Keaton,
dialog: you participated in the hijacking of
dialog: a truck in Buffalo, New York. The
dialog: cargo was raw steel. Steel that
dialog: belonged to Mr. Soze and was destined
dialog: for Pakistan to be used in a nuclear
dialog: reactor. A very profitable violation
dialog: of U.N. Regulations. You had no way
dialog: of knowing this, because the man
dialog: shipping the steel was working for
dialog: Mr. Sate without his knowledge.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked
dialog: a twin-prop cargo flight earlier
dialog: this year out of Newark airport. The
dialog: plane was carrying platinum and gold
dialog: wiring. Also set for Pakistan.
text: Kobayashi turns and points at Hockney.
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
dialog: Two months ago, Mr. Hockney stole a
dialog: truck carrying gun parts through

text: Everyone looks at Hockney. He smiles shyly. It occurs to
dialog: them all that he robbed the truck for which they were all
dialog: arrested in the first place.
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
dialog: - guns allegedly set to be destroyed
dialog: by the state of New York. They were
dialog: to be "lost" in a weigh station and
dialog: routed to Belfast. Again, Mr. Soze,
dialog: using pawns who had no knowledge.
dialog: (turning to Verbal)
dialog: Which brings us to Mr. Kint.
text: Verbal crumbles under his stare.
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI (CONT'D)
dialog: Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's

speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: You set up the line-up.
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI
dialog: Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You
dialog: were not to be released until I came
dialog: to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's
dialog: attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit
dialog: too effective in expediting his
dialog: release. Holding the rest of you
dialog: became a moot point.
speaker_heading: KEATON
dialog: What about Redfoot?
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI
dialog: Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze
dialog: rarely works with the same people
dialog: for very long, and they never know
dialog: who they're working for. One cannot
dialog: be betrayed if one has no people.
speaker_heading: FENSTER
dialog: So why tell us?
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI
dialog: Because you have stolen from Mr.
dialog: Soze. That you did not know you
dialog: stole from him is the only reason
dialog: you are still alive, but he feels
dialog: you owe him. You will repay your
dialog: debt.
speaker_heading: HOCKNEY
dialog: Who is this guy? How do we know you
dialog: work for Soze
speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI
dialog: I don't think that is relevant, Mr.

dialog: responsible for the murder of Saul
dialog: Berg and his bodyguards. Mr. Redfoot
dialog: can attest to your involvement, and
dialog: we can see to it that he will. He is

dialog: The offer is this, gentlemen. Mr.
dialog: Soze's primary interest, as I am
dialog: sure you all know, is narcotics.
dialog: He's been - competing shall we say,
dialog: with a group of Argentinians for
dialog: several years. Competing with Mr.
dialog: Soze has taken its toll. These
dialog: Argentinians are negotiating the
dialog: sale of ninety-one million dollars
dialog: in cocaine in three days time.
dialog: Needless to say, this purchase will
dialog: revitalize the diminishing strength
dialog: of their organization. Mr. Soze wants
dialog: you to stop the deal. If you choose,
dialog: you may wait until the buy. Whatever
dialog: money changes hands is yours. The
dialog: transaction will take place on a
dialog: boat in San Pedro. Mr. Soze wants
dialog: you to get to the boat and destroy
dialog: the cocaine on board. Then you are
dialog: free of your obligation to Mr. Soze.

dialog: Kobayashi tell it, anybody could
dialog: have worked for Soze. You never knew.
dialog: That was his power. The greatest
dialog: trick the Devil ever pulled was
dialog: convincing the world he didn't exist.
dialog: One story the guys told me - the
dialog: story I believe - was from his days
dialog: in Turkey. There was a petty gang
dialog: of Hungarians that wanted their own
dialog: mob. They realized that to be in
dialog: power you didn't need guns or money
dialog: or even numbers. You just needed the

speaker_heading: KOBAYASHI

text: Keaton sees him looking and waves again, hurrying him along.
text: Verbal turns away and focuses on the van.
speaker_heading: 114 EXT. DECK 114
text: Keaton hears a noise behind him. He swings around and points
text: his gun at McManus again. He puts the gun down.
text: McManus smiles. He walks slowly across the deck towards
dialog: Keaton. Something is not right about him.
speaker_heading: MCMANUS
dialog: Strangest thing...
text: He slumps to the deck. Keaton rushes over to him. He kneels
text: down and sees a pipe sticking out of the back of McManus's
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: 115 EXT. PIER 115
text: Verbal approaches the van, stepping over Hockney's body. He
text: closes the back doors of the van. He looks to his left at
text: the huge loading crane. He glances upward along the giant'
text: arm as it swings steadily on.
text: Somewhere, off in the distance, the sound of SIRENS can be
dialog: heard.
speaker_heading: 116 EXT. DECK 116
text: Keaton kneels by McManus, trembling with rage. After a moment
text: he stands, looking down at McManus' dead body.
speaker_heading: 117 EXT. PIER 117
text: SUDDENLY, Verbal realizes something. He turns and goes to
text: call out a warning to Keaton. He is too late.
speaker_heading: 118 EXT. DECK 118
dialog: Keaton never sees the crane coming.
speaker_heading: WHAM
text: The pallet of barrels hits him square

speaker_heading: 119 EXT. PIER 119
text: Verbal runs down the ramp as fast as he can. He comes to a

text: stops dead in his tracks, looking up at the boat.
text: From where he stands, he can just make out the figure of a
text: TALL, THIN MAN walking along the edge of the deck. He moves
text: quietly and calmly in the shadows towards the crane, looking
dialog: out of place in his expensive suit.
dialog: Something about this man terrifies him.

speaker_heading: KUJAN

speaker_heading: BANG
text: Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. He turns in

dialog: the gangway.
text: Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now. The man

speaker_heading: KUJAN

speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: Wha- No.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: He was a stool pigeon for the Justice

dialog: to Federal Marshals that he had seen
dialog: and could positively identify one
dialog: Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge
dialog: of his business, including, but not
dialog: exclusive to, drug trafficking and
dialog: murder.
speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: I never heard of him.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: His own people were selling him to a
dialog: gang of Hungarians. Most likely the
dialog: same Hungarians that Sate all but
dialog: wiped out back in Turkey. The money
dialog: wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians
dialog: were going to buy the one guy that
dialog: could finger Soze for them.
speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: I said I never heard of him.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was
dialog: his extradition advisor. She knew
dialog: who he was and what he knew.
speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: I don't -
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: There were no drugs on that boat. It
dialog: was a hit. A suicide mission to whack
dialog: out the one man that could finger
dialog: Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves
dialog: put to it. Men he knew he could march

dialog: to send you off with the money when
dialog: he could have used you to take the
dialog: boat?
speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: He wanted me to live.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: Why did he want you to live? A one-

speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: Edie.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: I don't buy that reform story for a
dialog: minute. And even if I did, I certainly
dialog: don't believe he would send you to
dialog: protect her. So why?
speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: Because he was my friend.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: No, Verbal. You weren't friends.

speaker_heading: KUJAN

dialog: man that could identify him.
speaker_heading: VERBAL
dialog: This is all bullshit.
speaker_heading: KUJAN
dialog: He left you to stay behind and tell

speaker_heading: KUJAN

dialog: You're not safe on your own.
speaker_heading: VERBAL

speaker_heading: It reads: QUARTET - SKOKIE, ILLINOIS
text: Kujan's eyes flash all over the bulletin board. He finds a
