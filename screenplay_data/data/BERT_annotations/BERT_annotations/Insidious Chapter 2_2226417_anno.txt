scene_heading: TITLE OVER BLACK: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, 1983
scene_heading: EXT. LORRAINE’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: A very ordinary house.
dialog: That’s how you would describe it, if you saw it. Not ominous,
dialog: but ordinary.
text: An ordinary car arrives to join the house - a Honda Accord.
text: It sputters to a halt curb side. A woman clambers out of it.
text: We can’t see her properly, she is hidden in silhouette.
text: She glares up at the two story house, pausing. Apprehensive.
scene_heading: INT. ENTRY WAY/LIVING ROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT (1983)
text: LORRAINE LAMBERT (28) scampers to answer a knock at the door.
text: She is clad in jeans and T-shirt; a strong single mother who
text: knows how to be a father too. She peels the door open to
text: reveal ELISE RAINIER (40s). The Honda Accord owner.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You must be Lorraine.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: You must be Elise.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You must be crazy to wear a T-shirt
dialog: in this cold.
text: Elise cracks up. She has an easy, infectious laugh.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I’m sorry it’s so late. My day job kinda
dialog: makes raising my son a night job.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It’s fine. In my line of work,
dialog: things don’t tend to happen until
text: it gets dark.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Lorraine guides Elise into the spacious, well-lit living
text: room. Elise gazes around, smiling, surveying the house.
text: A man is fiddling with a 16mm camera in the center of the
text: room, sitting on an equipment box. This is CARL STANAWAY (36)
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Carl is a soft-spoken, wise old soul. Everything he says and
dialog: does is considered and thoughtful.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Ahoy there, Carl.
text: Carl looks up, smiling ruefully. He is relieved to see Elise.
text: He rises and embraces her. He looks ragged.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Thank you for coming, Elise.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I’m always happy to help.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Would you like some coffee? Or tea?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No, thanks. I’d like to get started
dialog: right away, if that’s okay. Carl
dialog: told me on the phone that your son
dialog: is the one affected, is that right?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Yes. That’s right. My son Josh.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: May I meet him?
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Of course. I’1l go get him.
text: Lorraine hustles up the stairs. Carl lowers his voice to a
text: grave whisper.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I didn’t know what else to do.
dialog: Except call you.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You had a terrible psychic presence
dialog: that was making you sick and you
dialog: thought you’d make it my problem?
text: She cracks herself up again. Carl doesn’t share it. Elise
text: explores the living room as Carl talks to her. She approaches
text: a series of framed photos tacked to the wall. Most of them
text: are of a young boy.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I started with the usual checks.
dialog: Mental health tests, medical
dialog: records. All normal.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Elise beams as her eyes trace across the photos, taken by the
text: young boy’s cuteness.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: I interviewed the boy, but he
dialog: doesn’t want to tell me anything.
dialog: He’s scared. I thought maybe you
dialog: could get something out of him.
text: Elise pauses on one particular photo...the boy at around ten.
text: He is slouched on a couch in a baseball uniform. Behind him
text: is a set of drapes, a lamp, all shrouded in shadow, the
text: exposure focused on the boy.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: There’s definitely something in this
dialog: house. I can feel it. It doesn’t
dialog: want me here. It’s the strongest
dialog: presence I’ve ever felt. I’m afraid
dialog: of it, just like the boy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I need your help, Elise. I failed.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: You worry too much, Carl. Always
dialog: have. This isn’t an exact science.
text: Elise turns back to the photo. Her smile slowly deflates. A
text: hint of concern in her eyes. Is there something in the
text: shadows? A person? Hard to tell by looking. Elise senses it.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE (0.S.)
text: She's right there.
text: Elise STARTS, jolted out of her focus. She turns to see
text: Lorraine herding the young boy from the photo down the stairs
text: - JOSH LAMBERT (10). Lorraine tows and Josh resists.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Josh; firm)
dialog: Come on, just say hi to her. She
dialog: just wants to talk to you for a
dialog: little bit. You’re not being polite,
dialog: Josh. No politeness, no baseball.
text: Josh sees that Elise is looking at him. Softens, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: Hi.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Hi Josh. I’m Elise.
text: Josh musters a half-hearted smile. Distracted.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: ELISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Your mom’s right, I’d love to ask
dialog: you some simple questions. The good
dialog: kind, the kind you can’t get wrong.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - LATER
text: We see a POV FROM THE 16MM CAMERA - it frames up Josh,
text: sitting on the couch, pulsing in and out of focus at first.
speaker_heading: ELISE (0.S.)
dialog: Do you like living here?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: ELISE (0.S.)
dialog: Good for you. Are there a lot of
dialog: kids your age in this neighborhood?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
text: A few. One kid lives next door.
speaker_heading: ELISE (0.S.)
dialog: Oh, that must be nice.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: Nah. He’s pretty lame.
text: OUT OF POV - The camera whirs as it chews up film. Carl
text: operates the camera. Lorraine observes from the corner,
text: clutching a cushion like a life-preserver.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Is there anything you don’t like
dialog: about living in this house?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Nothing bad happens here at night?
text: A long beat. Josh scans the room.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: I get scared when it gets dark. I’m
text: a wimp.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No. You’re not. It gets dark for all of
dialog: us eventually. And we’re all scared of
dialog: it.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Josh is clearly not comfortable talking. Elise changes tact.
speaker_heading: ELISE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to try something with you,
dialog: Josh. I promise it won’t hurt.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - LATER
text: A hand lights a candle. It is Elise. The flame frolics across
text: her face. The room is darker now. Josh is still sitting
text: opposite Elise.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Close your eyes. I want you to
dialog: relax.
text: Josh gulps and closes his eyes.
text: Elise takes out a METRONOME, propping it on the table next to
text: her and setting it in motion. Tick...tick...tick...
speaker_heading: ELISE (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen to the ticking...focus on
dialog: it. Tune everything else out.
text: WE PULL AROUND JOSH’S BACK, circling the room.
speaker_heading: ELISE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
dialog: Take a deep breath. Feel yourself
dialog: getting sleepier...
text: When we complete the circle, Josh is in a deep trance. The
text: whole house is silent. Carl triggers the camera again.
speaker_heading: ELISE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m going to ask you some
dialog: questions, and I want you to tell
dialog: me the truth. Can you do that?
text: Josh replies in the narcotic tones of the hypnotized, his
text: body as still and sullen as a sculpture.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I want you to tell me who all the
dialog: people are in this house right now.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: Me, my mom, Elise, Carl...and the
dialog: old woman.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Carl looks up from the camera, prickled by goosebumps.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What old woman, Josh?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: She talks to me at night.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: What does she say?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: She wants me to go with her.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Go with her where?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
text: Out into the dark, where she lives.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Where is she, right at this moment?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: I can’t tell you. She doesn’t like
dialog: other people. Only me.
text: Elise gets up, leaning in close to Carl and whispering. Carl
text: opens his equipment box and wrests two walkie-talkies out of
text: it, handing one to Elise.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: How about if we play a game, Josh?
dialog: It’s called hot and cold. I’1l1 walk
dialog: around the house and you tell me if
dialog: I’m getting warmer or colder. Do
dialog: you know that game?
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: Yes.
text: Carl squats in front of Josh, holding the walkie up to his
text: mouth. Elise leaves the room, headed for the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: A dark, spotless kitchen. Elise shuffles inside, gazing into
text: the murk. The walkie squawks in her hand.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (V.O.)
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: Cold.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Elise re-enters, pacing the living room to the front door.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: Colder...
text: Elise wanders over to the stairwell.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Warm...
text: She takes a step, then another, marching up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Elise gapes into the darkened hall that yawns in front of her.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (V.O.)
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: Warmer.
text: She passes a door. She opens it - it is Lorraine’s bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. LORRAINE’S BEDROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Elise leaves the light off, stalking through the dark.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (V.O.)
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: Cold.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Elise steps back into the corridor. At the end of the hall is
text: a door decorated with colorful stickers. The door is ajar. A
text: light is on inside. Elise is drawn to the door, hesitating in
text: front of it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (V.O.)
dialog: (from walkie)
text: Very warm.
text: Elise prods the door. It keens as it opens. The cluttered
text: room of a pre-teen boy greets her.
scene_heading: INT. YOUNG JOSH'S BEDROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: Elise troops inside. She scans the room. It is devoid of
text: life. A bedside lamp provides the only light.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
text: Elise floats to the window, peering through. She stoops down
text: and lifts the bed sheets...unveiling the mess under the bed.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (V.O.)
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: Cold.
text: The closet door behind her CREAKS as it moves outwards
text: slightly. Elise turns to face the closet. Steps towards it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (V.O.)
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: Hot...
text: Elise treads closer.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: Hotter...
text: She draws the closet doors open. A row of baseball jersey’s
text: dangle on coat-hangers inside it.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: Very hot.
text: Elise cleaves the row of clothes in half.
text: She gropes outwards, reaching into the pitch dark space
text: beyond the coat hangers.
dialog: Slowly.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - SAME TIME
text: Josh JOLTS, still in a trance.
text: He turns, eyes still closed, facing into the far corner of
text: the room, into the shadowy corners where the drapes are.
speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH
dialog: This door stays locked until I come
dialog: out of my shell.
text: CLICK. The camera rolls out of film.
text: A garbled, whispered voice spits out of the walkie. Carl
text: holds it to his ear, listening. It’s Elise. Her whispering is
text: barely audible, distant.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: ELISE (V.O.)
dialog: (from walkie)
dialog: ..-what do you want?...why?
text: Lorraine carefully approaches Josh. Bends in front of him.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Honey? Are you okay? Honey?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: No. He’s not okay.
text: Lorraine whips around to see Elise, descending the stairs.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What did you see?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I saw what haunts him.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What was it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It was a parasite. I spoke to it.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What does it want?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: It wants to be him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Your son has a gift, Miss Lambert.
text: When he sleeps at night, he is able
dialog: to explore another world. But it
dialog: can be a dangerous gift. He can
dialog: attract the attention of the
dialog: darkest part of that world.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: What can you do to stop it?
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I could wipe his memory of his
dialog: gift. Make him forget how to visit
dialog: that world.
text: Lorraine turns to face her boy, still in a trance state. Her
text: fear and concern for her son swirl on her face.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Do it. Make him forget.
text: FADE TO BLACK.

scene_heading: INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)
text: A woman is hunched in a chair opposite a police detective.
text: She is pale, traumatized, her face streaked with tears.
scene_heading: This is RENAI LAMBERT (32). The officer is DETECTIVE TERRY
text: SENDAL (40). He regards Renai with a relaxed, coaxing eye. A
text: true professional who listens rather than speaks. A crushing
text: silence envelopes the stark room. Finally:
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: My son had been sick.
scene_heading: DET. SENDAL
dialog: He was in a coma?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: DET. SENDAL
dialog: What was the cause of the coma?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: No doctor could tell us. One
dialog: morning he just wouldn’t wake up.
dialog: We took him to the best hospital we
dialog: could find, but they had no idea.
dialog: Eventually we brought him home. A
dialog: nurse would monitor him...but
dialog: nothing would bring him out of it.
text: Sendal thumbs through a medical report.
speaker_heading: RENAI (CONT'D)
dialog: Then things started...happening...
text: around the house. Unexplained
dialog: things. I got so freaked out that
dialog: we moved. But they kept happening.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: You believed that there was some
dialog: sort of ghost following you?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: More than one. I saw them.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: When did you hire the services of
dialog: the deceased, Elise Rainier?
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: When we ran out of places to go.
text: Sendal picks up a report, reading from it.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: It says in your report, Renai, that
dialog: last night at approximately ten PM,
dialog: Elise put your husband, Josh, into
dialog: a state of hypnosis. She did this
dialog: as part of a ritual that she
dialog: believed would allow Josh to
text: project his unconscious into a...
text: He leans in closer, stuck on a word.
speaker_heading: SENDAL (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-Spirit realm - I can’t read my
dialog: own handwriting - where he could
dialog: locate your son and bring him back
dialog: to consciousness.
text: Sendal looks up.
speaker_heading: SENDAL (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you believe her?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: I had to.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: Did you pay Elise for this?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: I never had the chance.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: Is this something you’ve been
dialog: interested in before? Ghosts? The
dialog: supernatural?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: No. But it worked. My son woke up.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: What happened after he woke up?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: I was in the kitchen with Dalton. I
dialog: was so happy to have him back. Then
dialog: I heard a noise coming from the
dialog: living room. I ran in there to see
dialog: what it was...

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
text: Renai scurries into the living room. She is confronted by the
text: frozen death mask of Elise, stock-still on the couch.
text: With horror, Renai seizes a flashlight and flits down the
dialog: corridor.
speaker_heading: RENAI (0.S.)
dialog: Josh! Josh!
text: Renai returns to the living room. She rakes up a digital
text: camera from the floor. An image an Old Woman is burned into
text: the viewing window.
text: Renai GASPS, her hand flying to her mouth. Another hand grips
text: her shoulder from behind.
speaker_heading: JOSH (0.S.)
dialog: Renai...I’m right here.
text: Renai STARTS, wheeling around. She sees Josh, dread in her
text: tear-brimmed eyes. She reels away from him.
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: No!
text: Josh is alarmed by her fear.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What? What?!
text: Renai keeps backing away. His mother, LORRAINE, and son,
text: DALTON, run into the room, startled by Renai’s screaming.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Renai?
text: Renai says nothing - just points to Elise. Josh locks his
text: eyes on Elise, his face dropping. He seems horrified.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh Jesus...Elise...
text: He rushes to her.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom, get Dalton out of here!
text: Lorraine shields him, hustling him out of the room, returning

speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: No...no...call an ambulance!

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
text: She’s gone.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: She could be --
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
text: She's dead.
text: Josh seems like he might faint. He staggers back, then looks
text: up at Renai. Her eyes are locked on him.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Why are you looking at me like
dialog: that, Renai?
text: She backs against the wall.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: You think that I did this?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why are you looking at me like
dialog: that?
text: Renai holds out the digital camera, showing him the pixilated
text: image of the Old Woman. Josh takes the camera, stunned.
speaker_heading: RENAL
text: It’s Elise’s camera. It was by her
dialog: feet. That’s the last picture she
dialog: took.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Oh my God...this face. I know this
dialog: face.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This is the face that haunted me as
text: a child.
scene_heading: INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, POLICE STATION - DAY (PRESENT)
text: Sendal studies Renai intensely. Her every twitch.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
text: So he claims he was out of the room
dialog: when it happened?
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: Do you believe him?
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: He’s my husband.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: That’s not what I asked.
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: Yes, detective. I believe him.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: You know, ninety per cent of
dialog: detective work is looking for nose
text: hairs at a crime scene. The rest is
dialog: people watching. I have to say, your
dialog: body language right now tells me
dialog: that you don’t believe him.
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: There were...strange things
dialog: happening in our house that night.
speaker_heading: SENDAL
dialog: I’m not interested in ghosts, Mrs.
dialog: Lambert. I’m interested in the
dialog: living people who create ghosts.
text: Sendal pushes the file aside, sitting back.
speaker_heading: SENDAL (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s been a long night, so I’m
dialog: going to end it there for now.
dialog: But you should know that our
dialog: forensics team has already claimed
text: a result from the fingerprints on
text: Elise’s neck.
text: Renai holds her breath.
speaker_heading: SENDAL (CONT'D)
dialog: The fingerprints did not match your
dialog: husband's.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
text: The sun flares down on a large congregation of mourners. They
text: are gathered around an open grave.
text: A casket is lowered into the grave. Lorraine, Josh, Renai and
text: Dalton hover over it. Renai cradles Cali, and FOSTER slinks
text: behind Josh, who is wearing DARK SUNGLASSES.
text: We PAN across the disparate group of grievers. So many
text: different ages and races. A true mix, all dressed in black.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library
dialog: 15.
text: One of the mourners is CARL, who we met in the opening scene.

text: We finally come to rest on two men - SPECS and TUCKER.
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: -..and this is not the end...for
dialog: though dear Elise’s body may have
dialog: left us, her spirit goes on to the
dialog: kingdom of Heaven and the life

text: Specs looks up, finding Josh in the crowd and staring at him.
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY - LATER
text: The mourners dissipate, scattering like leaves.
text: Specs and Tucker meander away from the crowd, heads down. A tall
text: man in an ill-fitting suit huffs up the hill behind them. This
text: is DAVID FOX (47). He is holding a folder of papers.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: Gentlemen, a moment of your time!
text: They stop and turn, suspicious.
speaker_heading: FOX (CONT'D)
dialog: I’ve had some trouble reaching you.
dialog: You’re not easy men to locate.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: If the US government feels the same
dialog: way then my plan is working.
text: Fox holds out the folder. Specs accepts it.
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I wanted to give you these papers.
dialog: I’m David Fox, the attorney
dialog: representing Elise Rainier’s
dialog: estate.
speaker_heading: SPECS
dialog: Her estate?
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: You are Steven ‘Specs’ Fisher and
dialog: Tucker Croft, are you not? Did you
dialog: work as Elise’s assistants for the
dialog: four years leading up to her death?

speaker_heading: SPECS
dialog: Yeah, but...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: As the executor of her last will
dialog: and testament, I’m here to inform
dialog: you that Elise left a substantial
dialog: amount of her estate to you
dialog: gentlemen. I’11l need you to come to
dialog: my office so we can discuss the
dialog: terms and settle everything
dialog: contractually.
text: Tucker takes the file from Specs’ hands, flipping through it.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Is there one of us who got more in
dialog: particular, or is it kind of an
dialog: equal thing or...?
speaker_heading: SPECS
dialog: Tucker...
speaker_heading: FOX
dialog: I can’t list every particular, but
dialog: basically, she left you guys her
dialog: home...and everything in it.
scene_heading: EXT. LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING
text: The house we met in the opening scene. She’s weathered a
text: little with age, but is still a home to be proud of.
text: Lorraine’s car veers into the driveway.
scene_heading: INT. LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: The front door groans open and the family lumbers inside,
text: still bedecked in their funeral black. The whole brood looks
text: dour, fatigued by the emotions of the day.
text: Josh and Renai are lugging gym-bags and suitcases.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Make yourself at home. My house is
dialog: your house.

dialog: My mother taught me better than
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: I’1ll go and make up the beds.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’ll help. Come on, guys.
text: Josh tows a sleepy Dalton and Foster away, leaving Renai
text: alone. She is a deer in the headlights. She steps out of the
text: doorway, surveying the house. The living room is recognizable
text: as the living room from the opening, with updated furniture.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Renai unloads the dishwasher. She heaves a stack of plates
text: out of it, slotting them in a cupboard. Lorraine enters,

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Oh no, Renai, please let me do that.

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: FOSTER
dialog: Oh, man.
text: Josh enters and slumps down on Dalton’s bed.
speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: DALTON

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: No, I didn’t. And neither will you.
speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: Daddy, does dying hurt?
speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: DALTON
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: And you've got a lot of sleeps to go

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Renai pads down the corridor, stopping at a particular door.
scene_heading: INT. CALI’S BEDROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Renai tip-toes inside. As soon as she does, the crying
text: CEASES. The room is dark, save for a glowing NIGHT LIGHT.
text: Renai leans over the crib - seeing that Cali is sound asleep.
text: Unnerved, Renai claws through a cluttered baby bag on the
text: floor, fishing out two BABY MONITORS.
text: She sets one down beside Cali’s crib, exits with the other.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Renai heads down the corridor, towards a bedroom.
text: The baby monitor in her hand SPITS to life, the mournful cry

text: Renai STARTS, listening, then heads back the way she came.
scene_heading: INT. CALI’S BEDROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Renai shuffles inside. The crying on the monitor drains away.
text: She FREEZES. The crib is EMPTY.
text: Alarmed, Renai whips around the room, stopping when she sees
text: her baby - asleep on the floor.
text: Renai scoops up her daughter, pressing her close. An all too

text: of the room, still clinging to the baby.
scene_heading: INT. SPARE BEDROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

speaker_heading: RENAL

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: It’s not a place where you see

dialog: Exactly the way Elise described
dialog: it...like a void. There were people
text: in there. They were screaming,

speaker_heading: JOSH

speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay. Alright. Let’s just get it

dialog: the accusations you’re lying awake
dialog: ‘not thinking’ about. I didn’t do

text: Josh approaches her and she backs away.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: What exactly is it that you think

speaker_heading: RENAL

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: What about it? I don’t know how it

text: Renai still doesn’t seem convinced.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: We invited some extremely evil

dialog: and one of those things murdered
dialog: Elise. It’s as simple as that. You

scene_heading: EXT. ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Specs and Tucker stand outside a modest house.
text: They are not wearing white shirts and ties, instead more

text: Specs approaches the front door, letting a batch of keys fall
text: out of an envelope. He rivets one of them into the lock,
text: opening the door.
text: There is some mail at his feet. He scoops it up. It is
text: addressed to Elise Rainier.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Specs taps a switch and recessed lighting gives a gentle
text: ambience to a room full of quirky, fun bric-a-brac. There is
text: a vintage pinball machine wedged into one corner.
text: Specs moves past a table cluttered with photos. Many shots

speaker_heading: SPECS
dialog: All the stuff we’ve seen, the

speaker_heading: TUCKER

text: Specs places the photo down. Tucker moves to a door on the

text: several in the lock. One after the other. Then -- CLICK.
text: Specs prods the door. It whines open and stabs a blade of

speaker_heading: SPECS
dialog: You first.
speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Hunter ninja bear?
speaker_heading: SPECS

scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM, ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Draped immediately behind the door there is a curtain.
text: Tucker parts it, shuffling into a large, dark room with a
text: small card table at the center, flanked by four chairs.
text: A hanging lamp dangles above the table, which is covered by a
text: red TABLE CLOTH. Tucker flicks a switch and the lamp gives
text: off a pale glow, revealing a deck of TAROT CARDS fanned out
text: on the cloth.
text: This room is also filled with bric-a-brac...but not of the
text: bright kind like upstairs. Shelves are lined with artifacts of
text: the occult, strange instruments, books on the afterlife.
text: Against the back wall is a FILING CABINET, a 16MM FILM

scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (IN FILM)
dialog: Hot...hotter

speaker_heading: YOUNG JOSH (IN FILM) (CONT'D)

scene_heading: INT. LORRAINE’S BEDROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: As opaque and still as the deep ocean.

scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Lorraine slinks stealthily into the darkened hall. She passes

scene_heading: INT. YOUNG JOSH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Lorraine enters, crossing the dark room and looming over her

scene_heading: LORRAINE'S BLOOD FREEZES.
text: Over her shoulder, we see what she does not...the silhouette
text: of a FIGURE. Standing behind Lorraine. Shrouded in shadow.
text: Lorraine turns her head slowly...very slowly.
text: As she turns her head, the figure walks away, disappearing.
text: Lorraine glowers into the dark. She reaches over and flicks
text: the bedside lamp on. It is bright enough to light the whole
dialog: bedroom.
text: She takes a deep breath and gets up, marching to the door. A
text: PITCH BLACK corridor extends beyond the door. Inky black.
text: She reaches into the dark, groping for the hallway light

text: Deathly quiet. Lorraine’s fingers find the switch. The light

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Lorraine steps into the bathroom, flicking on the light,

text: facing the wall.
text: Lorraine freezes with terror. Keeping quiet. Very slowly, she
text: turns away from the mirror to face the door. We TRACK WITH
text: HER, following her eyes to see that the figure is still
dialog: standing there. This was no illusion.
text: The figure looks like a woman, in a short, dirty night gown.
text: Modern, not Victorian. Her scraggly, oily blonde hair coils
text: down her back. She presses her forehead against the wall of
dialog: the corridor.
text: Lorraine’s eyes are locked on the woman. The woman appears to
text: be holding A BABY. The baby has PALE, DEAD SKIN.
text: The woman turns her head, glaring over her shoulder at Renai.
text: Eyes like portals into Hell. The woman’s skin is wrinkled.
text: The bathroom door groans as the breeze from outside pushes it
text: closed, blocking Lorraine’s view of the woman.
text: Lorraine takes a step towards the door. Then another. She
text: grips the handle...and opens the door.
text: It creaks open...very slowly --

text: Lorraine steps inside the room, easing onto the edge of his

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Please don’t leave us again.
text: From Dalton’s POV, we see a figure STANDING BEHIND Lorraine,

speaker_heading: DALTON (V.O.)
dialog: I could see someone else in my
dialog: room. I told her.
speaker_heading: DALTON
text: There’s someone standing behind
dialog: you, Grandma.
text: Lorraine turns her head, flooded with fear. The figure leaves

dialog: herself.
speaker_heading: DALTON (V.O.)

speaker_heading: DALTON (V.O.)

text: someone we cannot see or hear - only Josh’s responses.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yes...I understand...I will, I
dialog: promise.
text: The figure talking to Josh leans in and whispers something in
text: Josh's ear. We see that the figure is a woman - THE SAME
dialog: WOMAN Lorraine saw.
text: Josh turns and faces Dalton, eyes burning with rage.
speaker_heading: DALTON (V.O.)
dialog: Then daddy saw me and he came after
dialog: me.

dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was a bad dream, that’s all.
text: She hugs him.
text: We see on her face, resting on Dalton’s shoulder, that all is
dialog: not fine with her at all.

text: This time, as she watches her husband, her smile is gone.
text: A babies cry lilts into her ears, disrupting the silence.
text: Renai leaves the kitchen and we TRACK WITH HER into --
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR, LORRAINE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
text: -- the hallway. She plods up the hall, towards the stairs,
text: passing the entrance to the LIVING ROOM.
text: Inside the living room, on the far side of the room, we can
text: see a WOMAN holding a baby, her back to us.
text: Renai keeps going, not noticing the woman...
text: ..+-until she hears the warbles of the baby.
text: Renai HALTS - backing up and glaring into the living room.
text: She sees the figure pacing, soothing the infant.
speaker_heading: RENAL

text: She reaches the arched doorway where the mysterious woman

text: Quietly.
text: When she reaches the corner where the woman lurked, there is
text: no sign of her.
text: All is mute. Though it is daytime, the room is darker.
text: Renai steps into the center of the living room and we TRACK
text: AROUND HER. There is no sign of the woman.
text: We STOP TRACKING AROUND RENAI, seeing her from the back.
text: For a moment, all we can hear is Renai’s breathing --

speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: Don’t you dare!
text: The woman SLAPS Renai across the face with POTENT FORCE.
text: Renai REELS BACK, stunned, spilling onto the floor. (IT IS
text: THE WOMAN THAT LORRAINE SAW IN THE HALLWAY).
text: Renai HOWLS, whipping her head back and SEEING NO ONE. The
text: woman is gone.
text: Dalton rushes in, alarmed by her shriek. The back door opens
text: and Josh barrels inside.
speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: I saw one of those things again -
dialog: she hit me! She slapped me!
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Take Dalton outside. Now.

speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I can. I’m not afraid of these

text: Dalton scuttles over and aids Renai to her feet. They exit,
text: leaving Josh all alone.
text: He ambles into the living room. Eerie quiet envelops him.
text: A long beat of nothing. Finally:
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you there?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Show yourself.
text: We CIRCLE AROUND Josh. No response comes forth.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you?
text: The sound of BREATHING rises - the rasping wheeze of an
text: asthmatic, whistling through phlegm.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Where are you?
text: Josh turns, his eyes landing on a PAIR OF FEET, visible below
text: the lace curve of the curtains. A FIGURE is hiding there.
text: Josh approaches the figure. He is calm. Stops short, in front
text: of the curtain. Keeping a safe distance, head bowed.
speaker_heading: JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you want?
text: An EYE peeks out from behind the curtain - a blackened bulb of
text: despair, glaring at Josh. We hear A VOICE. A whisper dragged
text: through gravel.
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I want you to be a good girl. Kill
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Yes, mother.
text: Josh keeps his eyes down. He looks up into the mirror mounted

speaker_heading: IT IS JOSH.
text: Script provided for educational purposes. More scripts can be found here: http://www.sellingyourscreenplay.com/library

text: He stares helplessly from beyond, a look of terror on his

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEYOND MIRROR (THE FURTHER) - CONTINUOUS
text: A dark world beyond the mirror - The Further version of

text: Josh has been replaced by an OLD WOMAN. Behind him, we see

text: Specs rises, checking a small BLACK AND WHITE SECURITY

text: On it, he can see a man. Waiting patiently.
speaker_heading: SPECS
dialog: He’s here.
text: Specs hastens up the stairs. We hear the front door open,
text: inaudible chatter. Footsteps thump overhead, the floorboards
dialog: complaining.
text: Specs tromps back down the stairs, followed by another man -
text: it’s CARL (60s). He ducks as he steps into the reading room,

speaker_heading: LORRAINE
dialog: Hi Carl. It’s been a long time.

speaker_heading: CARL

scene_heading: INT. READING ROOM, ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
text: A RAPID MONTAGE - Specs and Tucker organize the room the way

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: I call this a Wiki-Board. It’s my

dialog: We've had pretty amazing success
dialog: with it in terms of contact.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: SPECS
dialog: They just don’t make toys anymore
dialog: like they did in the eighties, huh?
text: Tucker shoots Specs a glare. He raises a microphone on a

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: You speak into this. You then ask
dialog: the entities to speak through the
text: device. Their answers will appear

speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Please Elise...we need to speak to

text: And then - a SOUND. The soft tone of a letter appearing on
text: the Speak N Spell display. The letter Y.
dialog: Then E.
dialog: Then Ss.
speaker_heading: Y-E-S.
text: Everyone sucks in a sharp breath. The candle flame flickers.
speaker_heading: CARL (CONT'D)
dialog: Elise, we need to know who killed

text: Tucker flicks another flashlight on, swatting the beam around
dialog: the room -

speaker_heading: TUCKER
dialog: Listen!

speaker_heading: SPECS

text: Parched.
text: With TERROR, he turns his hand over. The skin is withered,
text: wrinkled. Not to an alarming degree, but enough for someone

speaker_heading: LORRAINE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RENAL
dialog: Dalton? Foster?

text: Possessed Josh hobbles into the bathroom, closing the door.

text: With horror, he glares into the mirror at his aging

text: With his other hand, he reaches up and claws a handful of his

speaker_heading: POSSESSED JOSH
dialog: You're right, I don’t remember you.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I haven't spoken to you since you

dialog: And I came to your house, this

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Haven’t lost that arm?
speaker_heading: POSSESSED JOSH
dialog: Not one bit.
text: Carl looks into his eyes, then lets go and moves to the wall
text: of photographs. He zeroes in on the SAME PHOTO Elise studied
dialog: when she first visited this house. When he is out of
text: Possessed Josh’s line of sight, his expression melts into one
dialog: of fear.
speaker_heading: POSSESSED JOSH (CONT'D)
dialog: Would you like a coffee? I’m making

text: Possessed Josh sits on his back, making sure Carl is dead. He

text: He finds them, leaves the room. He returns with blankets,
text: wrapping them around Carl’s corpse.
text: He spies through the drapes, seeing Carl’s car parked in the
dialog: driveway.
text: He hefts Carl’s body up, his spine cracking with the effort,
text: opening the door and limping outside. The door closes.
text: The house is quiet.
text: We TRACK ACROSS IT...past the furniture...all the way to the
text: MIRROR mounted on the wall. We move INTO THE MIRROR -

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM, BEYOND MIRROR (THE FURTHER)
dialog: -- The Further.
text: A cold, midnight version of Lorraine’s house.
text: Carl is standing in the center of the room, dressed as he was

text: It is Josh. He steps close to Carl.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: I’ve been here before...but I was

dialog: Elise. You have to find Elise.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: How?
text: Carl moves to the door, opening it and unveiling an infinite
dialog: darkness.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Into the further we go.
text: They step through the door.
scene_heading: EXT. BLACK VOID - NIGHT (THE FURTHER)
text: Darkness closes in around Josh and Carl like a suffocating
dialog: blanket.
text: They stagger forward, not knowing which direction to head in.
text: There is nothing in front of them. Josh whirls and stares
text: back at the house, the lantern held out in front of him.
text: They lurch on through the unfolding nothingness.
text: The sounds of this world are a muffled aural cacophony.
text: Distant SCREAMS, distorted and tortured. The whinny’s and
text: snorts of ANIMALS. The wheeze of asthmatic BREATHING - all of
text: it swirling together in the distance, as if coming through a
text: tinny, faraway speaker.
speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: Elise?
text: The cry echoes back to them.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Elise!

speaker_heading: CARL
dialog: We're looking for Elise. Where is
dialog: she?
text: The man doesn’t answer. His fingers shake. Finally, he points
text: over their shoulders, behind them.
text: They turn - AND JOLT.
text: A huge horde of pale figures is crowded behind Josh and Carl.
text: The figures reach out with gnarled fingers.
text: Josh and Carl stagger back - hitting another wall of figures.
text: THEY ARE SURROUNDED.
text: The figures rip and tear at Josh.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: Get away from me. Get away!
text: And then - the entities suddenly SCREAM.
text: A BLINDING LIGHT casts over them. They react to the light as
dialog: if it were fire.
text: The sea of dead parts, retreating into the darkness. The
text: light flickers and dies down...a FIGURE EMERGING FROM IT.
text: IT IS ELISE. She is glowing with an inner light of her own.
text: Her and Josh embrace, lingering long on the hug.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: I wish I could say it’s good to see
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JOSH
dialog: I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: ELISE
dialog: Everybody's time comes. I knew that
