dialog: October 19, 1995
scene_heading: A1. TITLES OVER "HOME MOVIES" from the 1960's -- FLICKERING, GRAINY,
scene_heading: HAND-HELD, KODACHROME COLORS. MUSIC OVER.
scene_heading: 1. E X T . V A N O R T O N H O U S E - D A Y (HOME MOVIES)
text: A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and
text: round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning. MAIN TITLE.
text: It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey. The dizzy boy is given
text: a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a
text: large cardboard donkey. He pins the tail on its nose.
text: 2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts...
text: a CLOWN ties balloon animals. CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover
text: about; there's even a real-live PONY. The party take splace in the
text: gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION.
text: 3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday
text: party. He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he
text: poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking
text: society matron. A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places
text: the baby in Schuyler's arms. Schuyler is ultra-careful, over-
text: whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID).
text: 4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic
text: show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief,
text: a DOVE FLIES OUT. CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house...
text: 5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of
text: about 40, wearing glasses. He stands on a high balcony at the top
text: story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette. The
text: unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man. When he realizes
text: he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes
text: inside the house. The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 6. E X T . V A N O R T O N H O U S E - D A Y (PRESENT DAY)
text: TITLES CONTINUE. Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an
text: ornate Victorian or Arts &amp; Crafts). The landscaping has changed,
text: there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the
text: carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive.
text: MUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES
text: IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier...
text: it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN. We move THROUGH THE GLASS...
scene_heading: 7. I N T . M A S T E R B E D R O O M - D A Y
text: TRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan,
text: free weights, a treadmill. Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs
text: STOCK QUOTES. A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN
scene_heading: ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW). The Bang &amp; Olufsen CLOCK RADIO
text: CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report.
scene_heading: HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE,
text: where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony.
text: END TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this
text: adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING...
scene_heading: 8. I N T . M A S T E R B A T H R O O M - D A Y
text: In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now
text: 38. He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his
text: world. He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself
text: and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (on phone)
dialog: Van Orton... Yes, it is my
dialog: birthday, Bob, is that why you
dialog: called...? Ah... No, I'm not
dialog: carrying Alan Baer another inch,
dialog: fuck him, BG Lumber is history...
text: As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q-
text: tips, etc. (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.)
scene_heading: 9. E X T. S A N F R A N C I S C O S T R E E T S - D A Y
text: The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic.
scene_heading: 10. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S C A R - D A Y
text: SCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering
text: aggressively through traffic. His laptop RUNS in the passenger
text: seat, its cellular antenna up.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (on carphone)
dialog: Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know
dialog: me, of course I'm behind Baer-
dialog: Grace a hundred per cent... great,
dialog: see you at the shareholders'
dialog: meeting next month...
text: He hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion.
scene_heading: 11. I N T . V A N O R T O N O F F I C E S - D A Y
text: TRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices. He passes
text: a discreet sign: "THE VAN ORTON GROUP." Schuyler is on a cell-
text: phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged
text: secretary. She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (on cellphone)
dialog: I've got buyers for the BG paper mill,
dialog: goose the lawyers, final papers in
dialog: three weeks... sure it's sad, but an
text: old dog loses its teeth and pisses
dialog: itself, you put it to sleep...
text: As Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he
text: ignores. He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of
text: items, follows him into his office.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Carol from the museum called.
dialog: She's sending architect's sketches
dialog: of the wing...
scene_heading: 12. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S O F F I C E - D A Y
text: The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money. A window
text: overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: That Business Week reporter called again--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Tell him to fuck himself. Nicely.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (awkwardly)
dialog: --and, um, somebody who identified
dialog: himself as, um, P.P. Willy.
text: SCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but
dialog: he swore you'd know who he was. He
dialog: wanted to meet you for lunch, I told
dialog: him you had appointments all--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Cancel. Cancel the whole afternoon.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: But you--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Do it. Did he leave a number?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: No. He just said he'd be at Leo's
text: in the Haight. At noon.
text: Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: That's all, Maria.
text: She heads out quickly. Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to
text: look out the window, lost in thought.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 13. I N T . L E O ' S - D A Y
text: A working class bar, an ALCOHOLIC or two, pinball machines.
text: SCHUYLER sits a table near a window, checking his watch, it's not
text: his kind of place. A WAITRESS arrives in a too-small uniform--
text: young, multiple earrings, CHRISTINE according to her name tag.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Can I take your order?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I haven't seen the menu.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Oh, right. Here, see ya.
text: She hands him a menu and starts off. Schuyler calls after her.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: An iced tea, please--
text: She waves a hand, "yeah, right," without looking back. Schuyler
text: sighs and opens the menu. Suddenly, someone BACKHANDS the side of
text: his skull, he assumes a defensive posture. Schuyler sees his
text: LAUGHING brother: DAVID VAN ORTON.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yo, Sky. Happy birthday.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (rubs his head, annoyed)
dialog: Thanks, "Pee-pee." I never get
dialog: tired of that.
text: DAVID slides into the seat opposite him. He's in his early 30's,
text: good-looking but unkempt, wears bright, funky clothes, an earring
text: and a perpetual grin. There's an intense, edgy quality to him
text: which Schuyler has some trouble readjusting to.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Well... long time.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Yeah, since Mom died-- what, five
dialog: years? So how you been?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Business as usual...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: How's Elizabeth? Any kids?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
text: A little girl.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Congrat--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: It's not mine, she married a
dialog: pediatrician in Sausalito.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're divorced...
dialog: (off Schuyler's nod)
dialog: Too bad, she was actually interesting.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: She stopped drinking, I guess
dialog: getting rid of me was the 13th step.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: So you're all alone in the House of Pain.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I redecorated. Where have you been?
speaker_heading: DAVID
text: All over. Nowhere in particular.
dialog: Didn't your fucking gumshoes keep
dialog: you informed of my every movement?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I called them off two years ago,
dialog: David. You'd kicked the heroin, you'd
dialog: left the ashram, you were windsurfing
dialog: somewhere in Central America...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's gorgeous down there... you
dialog: should go sometime.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Look, are you in trouble, is there
dialog: anything you need? You can't have
dialog: gone through the trust fund...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (looks at him, hurt)
dialog: That's not why I'm here, Sky, I
dialog: just wanted to see you... I even
dialog: brought a gift, for a change.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You didn't bake me a cake, did you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You can't still be mad about the
dialog: hash brownies...
text: Schuyler's unamused by the memory. David grins and pulls a small
text: envelope out of his pocket, tosses it on the table in front of him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Happy birthday, bro.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What is this.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's a bomb. Open it!
text: Schuyler shrugs, opens the envelope and shakes out--
text: A BUSINESS CARD in BLUE and ORANGE: "CONSUMER RECREATION SERVICES."
text: The C, R and S are HIGHLIGHTED, a PHONE NUMBER at the bottom.
text: SCHUYLER picks up the card, fingers it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Consumer Recreation Services. OK...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I can't tell you very much about it,
dialog: that'd ruin the surprise. Just
dialog: promise me you'll give 'em a call.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just call 'em. OK look, it's simple,
dialog: really. They entertain you.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Is this an escort service?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: No, it's nothing like that.
dialog: They're a business, they're for
dialog: real... They guarantee just one
dialog: thing-- you won't be bored.
text: Schuyler gives him a bored, blank look. David throws up his hands.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They make your life fun.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Fun.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You've heard of it.
text: Christine the waitress has shown up with Schuyler's iced tea. She
text: puts it down hastily, spilling some across the table. Schuyler
text: shies away, grabbing a napkin and blotting it up before it can drip
text: into his lap. Cracking gum:
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Sorry.
text: She moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Just a cheesebur... how'd you find
dialog: this place?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Old connection used to meet me
dialog: here. So you gonna call 'em?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (a sigh, carefully)
dialog: You know, David, this is sweet, but
dialog: it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the
dialog: midst of a delicate liquidation--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (mimicking him bitterly)
dialog: "A delicate liquidation," God, you
dialog: would do this...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: David--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We can't get together once without
dialog: you making me feel like shit. That's
dialog: important to you, isn't it?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Forget about it, don't bother.
text: David slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Are you still on medication...?
text: David glares at him. With the impeccable timing of all waitresses,
text: CHRISTINE appears, chipper.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: You guys know what you want?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Go away.
text: She curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth.
text: He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating. Calmly:
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I just thought you'd like it. I did,
dialog: it was a blast, best thing that ever
dialog: happened to me. And for your
dialog: information, I'm not on anything
dialog: anymore, I'm not even seeing a
dialog: shrink, I'm in a better place than
dialog: I've ever been, I'm even happy-- but
dialog: that's something else I wouldn't be
dialog: able to explain to you.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: OK, OK, I'll give them a call...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Look, take a pill. Just be normal
dialog: for thirty seconds and tell me what
dialog: this is. I hate surprises.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I know.
text: David WINKS, puts a finger to his lips-- not another word.
text: CLOSE as Schuyler slips the brightly-colored CARD into his pocket.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 14. E X T . V A N O R T O N O F F I C E B U I L D I N G - N I G H T
text: ESTABLISH the moonlit exterior of an older, classy building in
text: downtown San Francisco. MOVE IN on a high window, one of the few
text: LIT at this hour. We hear the SOUND OF A PHONE CHIRPING OVER.
scene_heading: lS. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S O F F I C E - N I G H T
text: COMPUTERS run, stacks of PAPERWORK, etc. PHONE continues to RING.
text: FIND SCHUYLER as he punches the SPEAKER:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Van Orton.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: Hello, Schuyler.
text: ELIZABETH is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to
text: subtlety. STAY WITH SCHUYLER, who half-smiles, looks at his watch.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Eleven forty, you almost didn't
dialog: make it.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: I always call on your birthday.
dialog: How was it?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Oh, the usual, big party, circus
text: clowns, naked lady in a cake...
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: (slight chuckle; serious)
dialog: How are you, Sky?
text: She has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person,"
dialog: someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out.
text: Schuyler GRIMACES, then mimics the tone:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'm just fine. How are you?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: It wasn't a trick question.
dialog: Thirty-eight, I thought that might
dialog: be a-- a difficult year for you...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Hm? Just another birthday,
dialog: another year closer to death.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: I meant-- because of your father.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Oh that's right, I guess he was 38,
dialog: wasn't he? I hadn't thought about
dialog: it, to tell the truth, but thank you
dialog: for the reminder.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: Why do I call you...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I honestly don't know, but it's a
dialog: nice change of pace from talking
dialog: to your attorneys. So, still
dialog: working at the hospice?
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: Mm-hmm, couple days a week...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Great, that's great. Well, give my
dialog: regards to Dr. Mel and the baby--
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: She has a little brother on the
dialog: way... we just did the ultrasound.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Really. Congratulations-- two
dialog: kids, an official nuclear family,
dialog: you must be very happy.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: We are, Sky. Very happy.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Well, you deserved someone who
dialog: wanted the same things you did--
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH
dialog: Are you? Happy?
text: SCHUYLER hates this question. He quickly changes the subject.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Speaking of little brothers, I saw
dialog: David today.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: He asked about you. He's on a new
dialog: kick, some personal improvement cult.
dialog: I'm gonna check it out, I'm sure he's
text: getting fleeced again.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: Who knows, maybe it'll be good for
dialog: you. Send David my love.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Right. Well, thanks again for
dialog: calling, Elizabeth, take care.
speaker_heading: ELIZABETH (on speaker)
dialog: You too, Schuyler-- I mean that--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Mm, good luck, bye.
text: He PUNCHES off the phone in the middle of her "Good-bye." Schuyler
text: returns to his work, as if the call hadn't taken place-- but a few
text: seconds later, we see his concentration is completely shattered, he
text: leans back in his SQUEAKING deskchair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 16. E X T . P A C I F I C H E I G H T S - N I G H T
text: SCHUYLER'S MERCEDES cruises on the hilly streets, past impressive
text: mansions on all sides, a CRESCENT MOON overhead.
scene_heading: 17. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S C A R - N I G H T
text: CLASSICAL MUSIC plays. SCHUYLER drives, looking unsettled.
scene_heading: 18. E X T . P A C I F I C H E I G H T S - D A Y (60'S/FLASHBACK)
text: POV DRIVING SHOT, from the backset of a LIMOUSINE. PERIOD CARS,
scene_heading: FASHIONS, etc. MUSIC CONTINUES OVER.
scene_heading: 19. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S C A R - N I G H T
text: SCHUYLER changes the RADIO STATION, trying to drown out his
text: thoughts with LOUD ROCK AND ROLL.
scene_heading: 20. E X T . V A N O R T O N H O U S E - N I G H T
text: THE ELECTRIC GATE slides open, and Schuyler's Benz pulls in.
scene_heading: 21. E X T . V A N O R T O N H O U S E - D A Y (FLASHBACK)
text: A LIMOUSINE pulls into the ungated carriageway. THE BACK DOOR
text: OPENS and SCHUYLER (7) emerges from the backseat, carrying
text: elementary schoolbooks. As he approaches the front steps, he looks
text: upward at something, blinks and squints.
text: ANGLE UP-- MR. VAN ORTON, in his robe, stands on the balcony
text: railing, looking up at the sky. He turns his gaze slowly downward.
text: YOUNG SCHUYLER is puzzled, gives his dad a tentative wave.
text: MR. VAN ORTON waves back, his eyes dead, expression blank.
text: YOUNG SCHUYLER opens his mouth to call to his father-- instead we
scene_heading: hear an URGENT ELECTRONIC BEEPING--
scene_heading: 22. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S K I T C H E N - N I G H T
text: A MICROWAVE OVEN BEEPS that the meal is "READY." SCHUYLER opens
text: the door, takes out his upscale junk food, grabs a fork.
scene_heading: 23. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S D E N - N I G H T
text: ON A BIG-SCREEN TV, a CNN NEWSCAST shows a FIRE OUT OF CONTROL.
text: MOVE FROM THIS through the manly, book-lined den. The house is
text: traditional, opulent, densely decorated with "good pieces"-- and it
text: feels like a mausoleum.
text: FIND SCHUYLER peeling open the plastic food container. He sits in
text: a leather armchair. A BOTTLE OF DOM PERIGNON sits on the coffee
text: table, near a champagne flute glass, a CUPCAKE with a CANDLE in it.
text: The LAPTOP computer is RUNNING.
text: ON TV, BERNARD SHAW comes out of the story.
speaker_heading: BERNARD SHAW (TV)
dialog: --for the residents of the
dialog: Crescent Heights project, a truly
dialog: tragic day is over at last--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'll drink to that.
text: SCHUYLER raises his champagne glass to the TV, his birthday done.
text: Then he toasts in the direction of a FRAMED PICTURE on the coffee
text: table-- a WEDDING PHOTO OF SCHUYLER and ELIZABETH.
speaker_heading: BERNARD SHAW (TV)
text: --up next, the latest in sports.
dialog: For all of us here at CNN, thank
dialog: you for watching--
text: SCHUYLER reaches for the REMOTE CONTROL. He settles back on the
text: sofa, CHANNEL HOPPING. He despairs of this quickly, points the
text: remote at his own head-- CLICK, CLICK. He closes his eyes.
scene_heading: 24. E X T . V A N O R T O N H O U S E - D A Y (FLASHBACK)
text: MR. VAN ORTON stands on the edge of the balcony, waving as before.
text: He looks skyward one last time, then suddenly LAUNCHES HIMSELF INTO
text: SPACE in a head-first dive. We hear what sounds like a SCREAM--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 25. E X T . C R S B U I L D I N G - D A Y
text: --it's a CAR HORN. The vehicle passes to reveal SCHUYLER striding
text: toward a postmodern building in the financial district; a ramp
text: leads to a parking garage beneath. Casually dressed, he glances up
text: at the facade for a few moments, then goes in.
scene_heading: 26. I N T . C R S L O B B Y A N D A T R I U M - D A Y
text: The very new, dramatic structure is built around a central twelve-
text: story atrium narrowing to a SKYLIGHT above. There's still some
text: minor construction underway on the ground floor, scaffolding about.
text: Schuyler crosses to a bank of lobby elevators.
scene_heading: 27. I N T . C R S E L E V A T O R - D A Y
text: Schuyler looks out the glass elevator as it rises vertiginously.
text: HIS POV as the atrium shrinks below him.
scene_heading: 28. I N T . C R S O F F I C E S - D A Y
text: Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray. Office
text: doors open off a reception area. CRS EMPLOYEES move about
text: hectically. Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused.
text: A friendly female RECEPTIONIST glances up from her desk.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Can I help you?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Is this Consumer Recreation
dialog: Services? I have an appointment,
dialog: the name's Van Orton.
text: The woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, CRS. IN
text: BG, JIM FEINGOLD pays a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY for a BAG OF FOOD.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Hm... I don't seem to--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week.
text: The woman shakes her head. FEINGOLD slows as he crosses past
text: Schuyler, carrying the bag. He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer,
text: looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Problem?
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: This gentlemen says he has an
dialog: appointment, but...
text: Feingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Van Orton, huh? I'll take him.
dialog: (shakes his hand)
dialog: Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of
dialog: engineering and data analysis.
text: The man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks
text: in a couple, then finds what he's after. He snatches up a couple
text: of pages, hands them to Schuyler. Then he finds a clipboard on the
text: floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Sorry about the chaos, we're still
dialog: in the process of moving...
dialog: follow me, I've got an office
dialog: around here someplace.
text: He reaches into a box of PENS, passes one to Schuyler.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON PEN-- the CRS LOGO.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 29. I N T . F E I N G O L D ' S O F F I C E / H A L L W A Y - D A Y
text: A modern, dramatic office. Swoopy furniture, imposing ART, all
text: very cool-looking. Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a
text: couple of white cartons.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: I can't remember the last time I ate
dialog: in a restaurant, all I do is work...
text: SCHUYLER sits on a couch, looking at the forms.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I know what you mean. Look-- what
dialog: is all this?
text: The fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office,
text: occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with
text: chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Application, MMPI and TAT tests,
dialog: financial statement...
dialog: (indicating food)
dialog: Want some? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
dialog: (as Schuyler shakes his head)
dialog: The tests serve a threefold purpose.
dialog: First off, are you right for us?
dialog: Are we right for you? Unfortunately,
dialog: there's a limited number of slots--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Let's back up here--
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: (over him)
dialog: B, we need an idea of your abilities
dialog: and limitations, what turns you on,
dialog: and off. Numero tres, our insurance
dialog: company requires it.
dialog: (a beat, studying Schuyler)
dialog: You're familiar with our service,
dialog: aren't you?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Not at all. What are you selling?
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Well... it's a game.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: A game.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Recharges the batteries, gets you
dialog: off the treadmill, it's an
dialog: experience. Sort of a-- vacation
dialog: for the guy who's been everywhere.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: This really doesn't sound like my
dialog: sort of--
text: Feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and
text: smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What's so amusing?
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Nothing. I know who you are.
dialog: You're David Van Orton's brother,
dialog: he got you in here.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: So.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: (remembering fondly)
dialog: David was-- impressive, one of the
dialog: better I've seen. But frankly, I

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: The type.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: You know, a player.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'm not a player.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: I don't mean anything personal by it--
dialog: I know you're an important guy,
dialog: powerful guy, you're used to being on
dialog: top. It's just, this isn't for
dialog: everyone. Not everyone can handle it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (nearly losing it)
dialog: What kind of fu-- game is this?
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: The ultimate fucking game. I wish I
dialog: could tell you more, but it's
dialog: different every time.
dialog: (rising)
dialog: Thanks for coming in--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (doesn't move)
dialog: I'm not an idiot. I see what you're
dialog: doing. First the vague yet intriguing
dialog: pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like
dialog: my manhood's in question because I'm
dialog: not up for, what, some motivational
dialog: role-playing fantasy nonsense--
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Interesting, you don't know the first
dialog: thing about it but you've already
dialog: decided what it is... Listen, I
dialog: don't wanna waste any more--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get
dialog: shit. I've got the afternoon
dialog: free, I'll take your silly tests.
text: Feingold cocks his head, reappraising him. Then, with a smile, he
text: calls to an attractive young WOMAN passing in the hall; Schuyler,
text: meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Ms. Nelson, are you busy? We need
dialog: someone to run Mr. Van Orton.
speaker_heading: MS. NELSON
dialog: This way, sir...
text: As she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold WINKS at him.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: I'll catch up with you after the physical.
text: Schuyler reacts-- a physical? He throws up a hand and follows the
text: woman into the hall. Alone now, Feingold cracks a fortune cookie
text: and glances at the slip of paper inside. He furrows his brow with
text: concern at the fortune-- then tosses it aside.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 30. CRS OFFICES - SERIES OF SHOTS
text: During the following QUICK CUTS, SOUNDS will be layered in and
text: CONTINUE over one another, e. g. the SOUND of a scraping pencil,
text: the BLIPS of machinery, HEAVY BREATHING, MURMURING VOICES of
text: TECHNICIANS giving instructions...
scene_heading: A. X-CLOSE: A #2 pencil FILLS IN box after box on a long MMPI
dialog: form. CLOSE on a couple of these: "I sometimes hurt animals... I
text: feel guilty when I masturbate..." each followed by TRUE and FALSE
dialog: boxes.
text: B. A WHITE-WALLED ROOM: Schuyler concentrates on a drawing held by
text: a stone-faced PSYCHOLOGIST, a TAT test; he laughs as he speaks into
text: a tape-recorder, analyzing the pictures.
text: C. X-CLOSE: The DRAWING, a large ant with an apron feeding a TV
text: dinner to a human child. The card moves just as we register it to
text: reveal another DRAWING of a smiling man toppling backwards in a
text: chair, perched on the edge of a cliff.
text: D. A LAB: Electronic MONITORS and PRINTERS record Schuyler's EEG
text: and EKG. We see him on a doctor's table, wearing a medical gown
text: with the CRS logo. He's hooked up to the wires, a female
text: TECHNICIAN studying the readouts while a NURSE takes his blood
dialog: pressure.
text: E. X-CLOSE: The traveling trace of intersecting colored waves.
text: F. A DARKENED ROOM: Schuyler in FG, still in the gown, watches a
text: screen as images FLASH-- geometric SHAPES, WORDS, PHOTOS. His
text: finger hovers over a bank of three buttons, he presses different
text: ones from time to time. There's a MIRROR to one side of the room--
scene_heading: G. X-CLOSE: A COMPUTER SCREEN shows green columns of NUMBERS--
text: SCHUYLER'S NAME is steady at the top of the screen, with an account
text: number. CAMERA MOVES FROM THE SCREEN to show an unseen COMPUTER
text: OPERATOR watching Schuyler through the one-way glass.
text: The CACOPHONY of the MONTAGE ends abruptly as we CUT TO:
scene_heading: 31. I N T . C U B I C L E - N I G H T
text: Schuyler, in the gown, sits on an examination table with his hands
text: in his lap in a small, featureless cubicle-- he seems vulnerable,
text: looks around blankly. To himself, irritated and bemused:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: David, you suck.
text: FEINGOLD BURSTS IN, a slew of COMPUTER PRINT-OUTS under his arm.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Sorry to keep you waiting,
dialog: a client's head exploded...
dialog: (grins)
dialog: You can get dressed, we're done.
text: He throws open a closet door. Schuyler reaches inside for his
text: clothes, which are neatly folded and on hangers. Feingold turns
text: his back on him as he DRESSES, perching on the examination table
text: and studying the unburst print-outs.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
text: Looks promising at this point.
dialog: You test well, you're in decent
dialog: shape for someone in your tax
dialog: bracket... Hm, some resistance to
dialog: the psych questions, but we got
dialog: the general idea...
text: He heads out, beckons for Schuyler to follow.
scene_heading: 32. I N T . C R S M A I N F L O O R - N I G H T
text: Feingold leads him through the office-- SECRETARIES and other
text: WORKERS pack up at the end of the day.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: We design the game around your
dialog: schedule, you're free to give it
dialog: as much or as little time as you
dialog: wish. And of course, you can call
dialog: it quits at any point.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: This was actually a gift. Did my
dialog: brother pay in advance?
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: You'd have to ask our billing
dialog: department... the price varies. But
dialog: our service comes with a guarantee.
dialog: If you're not satisfied, there's no
dialog: charge. And we've never had an
dialog: unsatisfied customer...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You mean dissatisfied.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: (looking at a form)
dialog: Mm, that's right-- you're a left-
dialog: brain word fetishist.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I get that all the time.

scene_heading: 33. I N T . F E I N G O L D ' S O F F I C E - D A Y
text: CLOSE ON PAPERWORK as it's dropped on the desktop.
text: SCHUYLER, CRS pen in hand, looks at this dubiously.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: So I'm supposed to sign up for a
dialog: game when I don't know the rules,
dialog: I don't know the object, I don't
dialog: know how much it costs...
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: It's a leap of faith. But at this
dialog: stage, there's no commitment-- we
dialog: just need to process your
dialog: application. And if you qualify,
dialog: you're in for the ride of your
dialog: life. What have you got to lose?
text: Schuyler CLICKS the ballpoint pen, they both lean over the papers.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Initials-- initials-- sign here.
text: Schuyler's about to sign when Feingold grabs his wrist.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: In blood.
speaker_heading: (a WINK)
dialog: ---Just kidding.
text: CLOSE, as Schuyler SIGNS on the dotted line.
text: FEINGOLD snatches up the forms, suddenly seems in a hurry for
dialog: Schuyler to go.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Very good, Mr. Van Orton. Please,
dialog: keep the pen.
text: Schuyler shrugs, sticks it in his breast pocket, starts out.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: When can I expect to hear--
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: We'll be in touch.

text: THROUGH A WINDOW, we see SCHUYLER playing violently, pumping
text: sweat... he's alone. We hear the sound of a PHONE CALL OVER:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (V. O.)
dialog: David, where the hell are you, we
dialog: were supposed to meet at the club--
speaker_heading: DAVID (V. O.)
dialog: Oh, shit, sorry Sky, I spaced--

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (V. O.)
dialog: I'll be in Seattle.
speaker_heading: DAVID (V. O.)
dialog: Buy you lunch soon as you get
dialog: back, I swear...
text: Fed up with playing alone, Schuyler lets the ball bounce, exits the
text: court and heads for a LOCKER ROOM down the hall...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (V. O.)
dialog: I checked out CRS by the way--
speaker_heading: DAVID (V. O.)

text: SCHUYLER, in casual clothes, hair still wet from a shower, comes
text: out of a locker room area toward an outdoor BAR by a SWIMMING POOL
text: at this upscale country ciub. He passes PETE and JOHN, two middle-
text: aged RICH MEN sitting at a table near the bar; he overhears a
dialog: snippet of their conversation--
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: --like fuckin' wildfire, just
dialog: opened an office in Frisco here--
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: I played my game in New York...
dialog: What do you think John, will CRS
dialog: ever go public?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Not likely, would you?
text: Schuyler slows down, eavesdropping, then moves toward the bar,
text: addresses the BARTENDER with a nod toward John and Pete.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: New members?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I believe so.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: This round's on me.
text: Schuyler moves casually toward the men--
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: 38(N). SAME LOCATION, LATER, the bartender brings another round of
text: drinks to the table, Schuyler and the men have been chatting a
text: while, all seem relaxed. Pete, the friendlier (drunker) of the
text: two, puffs a CIGAR as he speaks:
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: ...last time I played Pebble, I swore
dialog: I'd never pick up a club again...
text: The others CHUCKLE knowingly. Schuyler sips his drink, blinking
text: and coughing discretely at the smoke; there's a slight pause.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Great thing about golf, the way it
dialog: takes you out of your life...
dialog: Speaking of games-- I take it you
dialog: two are familiar with CRS...?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Uh-oh. Time to piss...
text: He slides off his stool. Pete studies Schuyler, sizing him up.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Why do you ask, Schuyler?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I couldn't help overhearing--
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: We don't usually talk about it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I only bring it up because, well,
dialog: I recently tested for it.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Did you? Kudos.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I just wasn't sure if they're for
dialog: real, whether it's worth it--
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Worth it... Gee, I dunno... they did
dialog: save my fucking life...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Sorry?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Look, I don't know you, you don't know
dialog: me, but... I hit a certain point,
dialog: nothing meant anything. My work, the
dialog: wife and kids-- hell with 'em, I was
dialog: sick of it all, y'know? But CRS... they
dialog: changed everything. "Are they for
dialog: real?" Who cares, maybe nothing is.
dialog: (raises his glass)
dialog: To reality.
text: Schuyler raises his glass, numbed by this outpouring. Pete drains
text: his drink, chuckling to himself. His friend comes back, looking
text: concerned, takes the man's arm.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: C'mon Pete.
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: (winks at Schuyler)
dialog: Good luck, pal. You'll need it.

speaker_heading: PLYMPTON

speaker_heading: LAWYER
dialog: But there's simply no--
text: THWAP! Schuyler DROPS the stack of papers on the table, SILENCE.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No is not an option. If you fail
dialog: to recognize that, I'll find ten
dialog: other law firms in the yellow
dialog: pages that can get the job done--
text: CHIRP. Schuyler's CELL-PHONE has started RINGING during the above.
text: He finally removes it from his pocket and moves to a quiet corner.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (impatient)
dialog: Yes.
text: QUIET COMMOTION resumes IN BG during the following. On the other

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Yes, who is this?
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA (filter)
dialog: This is Cynthia at CRS...

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: This is absurd--
speaker_heading: CYNTHIA (filter)
dialog: Thank you for thinking of CRS.
text: CLICK and a DIAL TONE. Schuyler shuts the phone and replaces it in
text: his pocket, his mind suddenly far away from the meeting at hand.
text: PLYMPTON, a wel1-meaning man with a fatherly attitude toward
text: Schuyler, steps close to him and speaks quietly, concerned:
speaker_heading: PLYMPTON
dialog: Bad news, Sky?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No, nothing. Sorry, Bob.

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Hello! What are you doing here?
text: THE BODY doesn't stir. He approaches gingerly.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Wonderful. You OK? You dead?
text: He crouches by the wino, winces at a strong smell, covers his nose.
text: He reaches out to touch the body, but hesitates, pulls back. Alive
dialog: or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Shit, shit, shit...
text: The "wino" suddenly SPRINGS UP like a jack-in-the-box, bending
text: backwards impossibly at the hips. Schuyler lets out a CRY and
text: scrambles back toward his car.
text: THE HEAD swivels to face him-- it's a grotesque HARLEQUIN, its head
text: made of COLORED GLASS, LIT from within. The MOUTH DROPS OPEN and a
text: tongue in the shape of a corkscrew SPRINGS OUT.
text: A SMALL KEY ON A HOOK dangles from the tip of the tongue. One of

speaker_heading: BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV)
dialog: Locate emergency shut-offs for all

text: SCHUYLER doubles back, avoiding a window, his panic mounting--
speaker_heading: BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV)
dialog: Find a heavy piece of furniture such as
dialog: a desk or table and get under it--
text: SCHUYLER looks around, sees no such appropriate spot in the room.
speaker_heading: BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV)
dialog: If no such furniture is immediately

speaker_heading: CYBERSHAW (on TV)
dialog: Welcome to the Game!
dialog: Congratulations on your decision

speaker_heading: CYBERSHAW (on TV)
dialog: This might be a good time to lay out

text: handshake. They have to SHOUT over the WHIRRING BLADES:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Alan! What's wrong with a car--
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: I'm giving you an overview of our
dialog: little operation! You gotta see the
dialog: new breed of high yield saplings...
text: SCHUYLER looks uncomfortable with this prospect. The driver is
text: already loading his bag into the chopper. Baer claps a hand on
text: Schuyler's shoulder, leading him under the wash, into the chopper.
text: THE RASTA MAN is walking slowly across the tarmac nearby. He
text: watches the HELICOPTER ASCEND with a half-smile.
scene_heading: 48. I N T . H E L I C O P T E R - D A Y
text: SCHUYLER and BAER in the back of the chopper.
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: How was your flight?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Fine.
text: Schuyler looks out the window.
text: SCHUYLER'S POV - On the PASTA MAN in his colorful clothes, now
text: holding up a dangling KEY on a chain. Moments later, he's
text: invisible in the MIST.
text: ON SCHUYLER, looking disappointed, and annoyed with himself-- he
text: realizes he's missed something. He reaches into his pocket as Baer
text: DRONES ON beside him. Schuyler pulls out his KEYS, fingers the
text: gold one with the CRS logo, thinking.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 49. E X T . M O U N T A I N S - D A Y
text: The HELICOPTER swoops low over a beautiful FORESTED MOUNTAINSIDE.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 50. I N T . B A E R - G R A C E O F F I C E S - D A Y
text: PAN from a WINDOW. Outside, we see a sign-- BAER-GRACE LUMBER--
text: and the helicopter, now idle on a pad. MOVE PAST a HUMMING FAX
text: MACHINE, find Schuyler addressing Alan Baer across a table. A
text: couple of other LUMBER EXECS are present. Everyone wears a
text: stricken expression, Schuyler's tone is matter-of-fact.
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: You've been planning this for months,
dialog: haven't you? Sandbagging me like
dialog: this, selling us for scrap...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: BG lumber is not profitable and
dialog: hasn't been for years, my duty is to
dialog: salvage what I can. These are the
dialog: closing papers, in ten minutes I'm
dialog: going to present the sale terms to
dialog: the shareholders and elect my new
dialog: management team.
text: As he speaks, Schuyler moves to the fax machine. A TRANSMISSION
text: has come through, he picks up the sheaf of papers.
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: I was friends with your father, you
dialog: bastard, I watched you grow up, and
dialog: now you kick me in the balls--
text: Schuyler squints at the papers in his hand, flipping through them.
text: CLOSE, the entire transmission has been GARBLED. The words all
text: BLEED TOGETHER incomprehensibly, it looks like a child's scribbles.
speaker_heading: BAER (O.S.)
dialog: That's not how you play the game.
text: SCHUYLER turns on him, a suspicion forming...
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: You could've fucking told me!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What game?
text: Schuyler studies the SENSELESS PAGES for a moment then puts them
text: down, shaking off his apprehensions.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Never mind... we'll just have to
dialog: go with the earlier draft.
text: In BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who
text: moves out of the room. Schuyler moves to his briefcase. It's
text: LOCKED. He starts patting his pockets.
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: Can't find your keys?
text: Baer has a malevolent expression. Schuyler looks at him.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Where are they.
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: Up your ass?
text: A couple of execs stifle chuckles. Schuyler's suspicions mount.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Up my ass, very funny...
text: His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in
text: front of him. He picks it up:
scene_heading: INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note:
text: "CRS CALLED." We don't see what's written below.
text: SCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't-- OK. OK, you're with CRS...
text: Baer stares at him blankly. Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes,
text: seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: So the game, it's just a screen, to
dialog: blow this deal...
speaker_heading: BAER
dialog: I'm not following you.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Like hell you aren't. How did you
dialog: get my brother involved, that's
dialog: unforgivable.
text: The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion. As
text: he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK. Schuyler
text: stares at him menacingly. Hesitantly:
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Um... sorry to interrupt. We've
dialog: been having some trouble with this
dialog: fax, so they re-sent the material.
dialog: It's all OK now.
text: The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents
text: in front of Schuyler. The assistant fishes in his pocket.
speaker_heading: ASSISTANT
dialog: Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these
dialog: yours? The pilot found 'em on the
text: floor of the chopper...
text: Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out,
text: looks from them to the paperwork. Then he glances back at the
text: handwritten note on the table:
text: INSERT NOTE: It actually reads "CBS CALLED." (Schuyler's thumb or
text: a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look
dialog: like an R.) It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..."
text: SCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his
text: watch. He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
text: Everything seems to be in order.
dialog: Please disregard my last comments.
dialog: The shareholders meeting is about
dialog: to get underway... Shall we?
text: He heads for the door. As he leaves, the execs exchange looks.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 51. I N T . S E A - T A C T E R M I N A L - N I G H T
text: Schuyler wanders through the terminal, carrying his bags, glancing
text: periodically at the DEPARTURES monitor and the clock. His manner
text: now has changed, he eyes every PASSERBY, especially the ODD ONES.
speaker_heading: P. A. VOICE (filter)
dialog: Flight 177 to San Francisco is now
text: boarding at Gate 14...
text: Suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk,
text: Schuyler TRIPS and goes sprawling. The Rasta Man steps out, now
text: wearing SUNGLASSES with PINK LENSES.
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention.
text: Schuyler gets up, dusts himself off. As calmly as possible:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Listen, I quit.
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: Free at last... you won't be
dialog: needin' this, then.
text: He snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces. Schuyler
text: speaks as if to a child.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No, cretin. I'm quitting the game.
text: The rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear.
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: Wha's that, mon? I didna hear you.
text: Schuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I said I-- shit!
text: The rasta turns and RUNS, Schuyler bolts after him, unable to
dialog: believe this is happening. They draw a lot of looks during the
text: brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment
text: bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta.
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: Help, help! The mon is crazy!
text: He runs into a MEN'S ROOM, Schuyler follows a moment later.
scene_heading: 52. I N T . A I R P O R T M E N ' S R O O M - N I G H T
text: Schuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the
text: briefcase. Both are out of breath. PISSING MEN look wary.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Where is it?
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: Got something better.
text: The rasta men holds out a SHINY KEY on a chain. Schuyler narrows
text: his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I realize you're just some bit
dialog: player, but I'd like you to get a
dialog: message to your employers. This
dialog: bullshit is interfering with my
dialog: work, it's breaking my concentration
dialog: and I can't allow that to happen--
text: THE RASTA makes a sad face, SNIFFLES, still dangling the key.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: If I take that stupid key, will you
dialog: give me back my briefcase and go away?
text: The rasta nods with a big grin. Schuyler steps forward, hand
text: extended. The rasta flings open the door of a STALL beside him and
text: hurls the key into the TOILET. Instinctively, Schuyler moves to
text: grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and
text: sleeve DRIPPING. The key is missing from the end of the chain.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What the fuck am I doing?!
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit.
text: He drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an Ivy League accent:
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: So try looking at it through rose-
dialog: colored glasses... here.
text: He takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the
text: pocket of Schuyler's suit. Then he reaches above him and pulls
text: down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall.
text: Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I told you, this is over! I quit!
speaker_heading: RASTA MAN
dialog: They all say that at first.
text: He gives Schuyler a hearty SLAP on the back and strolls off,
text: HUMMING. Schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head. He
text: puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket.
text: CLOSE ON SUNGLASSES-- there's the image of a tiny GOLD KEY embossed
text: on each of the arms.
text: SCHUYLER puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a GLIMPSE
text: of himself in the mirror-- he looks silly. He quickly takes them
text: off. As Schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the
text: Rasta has slapped a colorful SIGN that reads "KICK ME" on his back.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 53. E X T . L E O ' S - D A Y
text: THE NEON SIGN FIZZLES in front of this low-rent establishment.
scene_heading: 54. I N T . L E O ' S - D A Y
text: BELLS RING and LIGHTS FLASH as a DRUNK plays a PINBALL MACHINE with
text: a lot of body English. SCHUYLER, stuck at a table right next to
text: the machine, winces at the noise, checks his watch and rises. He
text: makes his way through the lunch hour CROWD to the bar, leans toward
text: the bartender, a gravelly-voiced woman-- RONNIE.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I was supposed to meet someone
dialog: here, a David Van Orton-- I was
dialog: wondering if he'd left a message.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: 'Fraid not, sorry.
text: He drums his fingers, then whips out a CELLPHONE, spins around
text: quickly as he starts to dial--
text: --and SMACKS into Christine the waitress as she emerges from the
dialog: kitchen carrying a tray--
text: --SCHUYLER gets hit in the chest with a TRAY OF DESSERTS, colorful
text: JELLO, CREAM PIE, etc. He stands there, stunned and DRIPPING.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Fuck me!
text: She starts picking up plates and silverware, oblivious to
text: Schuyler's own plight; Ronnie charges out from behind the bar.
text: After the first shock, Schuyler CHUCKLES with annoyance. He wipes
text: the phone clean, pocketing it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Oh this is cute. Very cute.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: What happened here, you OK?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: It was an accident--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No it wasn't.
text: Ronnie gives Christine a look as she starts wiping at Schuyler with
text: a rag. He picks at his chest, examines the WHIPPED CREAM, tastes
text: it. Schuyler addresses the kneeling Christine:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What's next, a giant banana peel?
text: CHRISTINE squints up at him, puzzled.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Huh? Oh I get it-- you're nuts.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Chrissy, just apologize...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Dickhead here was on the phone, he
dialog: walked right into me!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Drop the act, you've been waiting
dialog: all day for this moment.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Shut the fuck up.
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: Go home, you're fired.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What?...
speaker_heading: RONNIE
dialog: You heard me.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Fuck you too.
text: She THROWS a plate on the ground, it shatters, then storms off into
text: the kitchen. Schuyler CHUCKLES angrily, pushing through the slop
text: on the floor with his shoe, looking for something.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Let's get this over with... Where's
dialog: the next key? Does she have it?
text: Ronnie stares, uncomprehending... Schuyler goes after Christine.
scene_heading: 55. I N T . L E O ' S K I T C H E N - D A Y
text: He crosses past a short-order COOK in the grimy industrial kitchen,
text: pulling a cube of JELLO out of his lapel pocket. He finds
text: Christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers, as she finishes
text: changing into her street clothes. Her brown uniform hangs from a
text: locker door, the nameplate "CHRIS" prominent.
text: CLOSE as his fingers touch the CRS of CHRIS-- they even look a bit
dialog: brighter than the H and the I.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I wish you people could be a
dialog: little more subtle.
text: CHRISTINE notices him for the first time.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Asshole, just send me the goddamn
dialog: dry-cleaning bill. Could you--?
text: She waves a hand at him, "go away" and ducks out of view, finishing
text: dressing into punk-grungy street clothes. She SLAMS the locker,
text: starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Don't you have something for me?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Uh-huh sure, here you go.
text: She puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her
text: middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry.
text: Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Wait, you really work here--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Not anymore, thanks to you.
text: She's out the SWINGING kitchen door. Schuyler absorbs his blunder
text: for a moment, then hurries after her.
scene_heading: 56. E X T . L E O ' S - D A Y
text: Schuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a MUNI station,
text: LIGHTING a cigarette. A few PEDESTRIANS come off the steps from
text: the arriving elevated train in this residential SF neighborhood.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Slow down-- you don't understand, I
dialog: thought it was a gag.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: No, you don't understand. I carry
dialog: mace and I know how to use it.
text: She reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I was only trying to apologize.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Shit, it's in here somewhere--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Fine.
text: He starts to move away, then they both hear GASPING O. S.--
text: ON THE STEPS, a HEAVY MAN, 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed,
text: struggling for breath, very pale. Christine and Schuyler are the
text: only pedestrians around now.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Shit--
text: She rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he JOLTS.
text: SCHUYLER looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still
text: clinging to his suit.
text: CHRISTINE reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting CPR. She
text: shoots a look at Schuyler.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: You got a fucking phone, call an
dialog: ambulance!
text: Schuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as
text: Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: This is just too weird-- it can't
dialog: be real--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: You really are insane!
text: SCHUYLER leans close to look at the man.
text: ON THE MAN'S FACE-- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes
text: rolling back as he GAGS his last...
text: CHRISTINE grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: We need an ambulance, guy's having a
text: heart attack near the MUNI station at
dialog: 5th and Market--
dialog: (to Schuyler)
dialog: What's the number on this thing?!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't give it out--
dialog: (off her horrified look)
dialog: 731-5723--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: 731-5723-- yeah, thanks--
text: She stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns
text: to the mouth-to-mouth. Schuyler looks around uncomfortably,
text: starting to believe this is a real heart attack.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Is there anything I can do?
text: CHRISTINE ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life...
text: 56A. WIDE as an AMBULANCE pulls up, SIREN BLARING. A couple of
text: MALE PARAMEDICS hurry out with a stretcher.
text: ON THE STEPS, the two PARAMEDICS lift the unconscious HEAVY MAN
text: onto the stretcher while Christine and Schuyler stand aside. Both
text: have small EARPIECES that look like hearing aids, with wires into
dialog: their clothes. Throughout the following, there's a lot of MEDICAL
text: BUSINESS-- feeding the victim OXYGEN, giving him INJECTIONS, etc.
speaker_heading: PARAMEDIC #1
dialog: (to Schuyler)
dialog: Could you come with us, help us
dialog: fill out a few forms--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No! I have work to do--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I'll go.
text: She climbs into the back, they start to shut the doors.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Wait a minute, you've got my phone--
text: He climbs in to get it back, they SLAM THE DOORS and start moving.
text: THE AMBULANCE peels out. We now see the LOGO on the back:
text: "CITYWIDE RESCUE SYSTEMS," with the C, R and S in RED.
scene_heading: 57. I N T . A M B U L A N C E - D A Y
text: The PARAMEDICS are intent on the gasping man. The SIREN BLARES, a
text: bit MUFFLED in here. Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely
text: pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Chill, will you?!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't want to be here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Neither do I, now siddown, get
dialog: outta their way!
text: A BUMP almost sends him flying atop the stretcher. Schuyler sits
text: near Christine on a ledge near the back doors. Petulant:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'd like my phone back please.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 58(NEW). I N T . H O S P I T A L E N T R A N C E / G A R A G E - D A Y
text: An UNDERGROUND RAMP, signs reading "EMERGENCY VEHICLES ONLY," a set
text: of DOORS leading into the lobby of an EMERGENCY ROOM; MEDICAL
text: PERSONNEL visible inside, INJURED PEOPLE, etc., a few PEOPLE mill
text: outside the doors.
text: THE AMBULANCE SCREECHES to a stop, the back doors fly open, the
text: PARAMEDICS wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance,
text: automatic doors OPEN and CLOSE for them. Schuyler and Christine
text: climb out, disoriented, walking more slowly to the doors. The
text: AMBULANCE pulls away behind them. Schuyler nearly slips in a
text: mysterious dark PUDDLE.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Oh, this day keeps getting better.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What is your problem, you think
dialog: the whole fucking world revolves
dialog: around you?
text: As she says this, she walks right into the ELECTRIC DOORS, which
dialog: fail to open for them.
text: THEIR POV-- THROUGH THE DOORS the gathered STAFF and PATIENTS all
text: turn at once to regard Christine and Schuyler. They GRIN and WINK.
text: ON SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE, who barely get the chance to register
dialog: this before--
text: THE LIGHTS GO OUT... PITCH BLACKNESS and SUDDEN SILENCE. We hear
text: only SCHUYLER'S BITTER LAUGHTER. Dialogue OVER DARKNESS:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: As a matter of fact...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What the fuck is going on?!
text: We hear RUSTLING in a purse, but still see next to nothing.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: It's a little hard to explain...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Try!
text: We hear the STRIKING OF A MATCH, there's some ORANGE LIGHT--
text: CHRISTINE holds the match. The whole area is DESERTED, except for
text: the two of them. SCHUYLER kicks at the glass doors-- they're not
text: going to give, nothing is visible beyond them.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I seem to be playing a game. This
dialog: is supposed to be funny--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
text: --a challenge, a puzzle.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: OK, I'm puzzled. Where are we?
text: SCHUYLER has found a STEEL DOOR with a GLOWING RED SIGN: EMERGENCY
text: USE ONLY. He yanks it open and a PAIL swings down, dumping WATER
text: on his head. He's facing a BRICK WALL through the door.
text: CHRISTINE can't help but LAUGH, then YELPS in pain as the match
text: burns her fingers. LIGHTS another. Schuyler flips open his phone.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Damn it, no signal.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Here's a lightswitch--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I wouldn't--
text: She flips it on, A BLINDING STROBE FLASHES for a few seconds-- both
text: CRY OUT-- then the BULB EXPLODES in a shower of sparks.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't know the rules, if there are
dialog: any, but it seems the obvious move
dialog: usually backfires...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Of course. I have no idea what
dialog: you're talking about.
text: They've taken a few steps forward, exploring the DARK. She LIGHTS
text: a cigarette with the next match, nearly running into ANOTHER DOOR.
text: She RATTLES it-- locked.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Son of a bitch.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I think I have a key.
text: Schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold CRS key-- nope.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Damn it...
dialog: (a beat, thoughtful)
dialog: Wrong key...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Last match.
text: In the matchlight, we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling
text: out the ROSY SUNGLASSES from the Rasta. He puts them on.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Too bright for you, is it?
text: SCHUYLER'S POV as the last MATCH GOES OUT-- CHRISTINE GLOWS RED in
text: the matchlight for a moment, then as soon as it goes out, we see a
text: GLOW of FLUORESCENT PAINT on the ground... a series of STRIPES and
text: ARROWS in DIFFERENT COLORS, GLOWING. These start PARALLEL near
text: where he stands, then RADIATE in different directions. CHRISTINE
text: is but a SILHOUETTE against the COLORED LINES.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
text: I can see now. Grab my arm.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: No way! You're crazy!
text: CHRISTINE moves away from him.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Stay on the path!
text: A BURST OF FLAME erupts from the GROUND close enough to scare the
text: shit out of CHRISTINE, who SCREAMS. SCHUYLER hurries toward her.
text: The FLAMES VANISH, she lurches in a differrent direction--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Christine, don't move!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Leave me alone!
text: She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a
text: gentle SLOPE.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Help!
text: SCHUYLER follows. FALLING himself. They try to reach toward each
dialog: other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper.
text: 58A. In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four-
text: foot deep round CHILDREN'S POOL, but it isn't full of water.
text: There's a bit of BLACK LIGHT here, enough to make out--
text: --COCKROACHES, thousands of them, a TEEMING ROIL OF INSECTS in a
text: CHURNING LIQUID. There's a BUZZING NOISE, both SCREAM.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Aaggh! BUGS!!
text: SCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out. She starts to pull him
dialog: upward, but--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Where are the glasses?!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Fuck the glasses!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: We can't get out of here without them!
text: He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick,
text: finally coming up with the glasses. He shakes them free of INSECTS
text: and clambers out to join Christine, who's GASPING and brushing the
text: bugs off of her. SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a BUG.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: They're rubber. Hold onto me,
dialog: I'll get us out of here.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Ha!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Fine, stay.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: No!
text: She grabs his arm; both are now covered in MUCK from the bug soup.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What's your favorite color?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: ...Blue?
text: He takes off the glasses, puts them on her. She looks around.
text: HER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Wow... OK, this is kinda cool. Hey!
text: SCHUYLER slips the glasses off her, puts them back on.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Sorry, it's my game. But we'll
dialog: take blue.
text: HIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them, going
text: in circles now and then, INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other
text: colors, up a series of ramps. This space sometimes resembles a
text: PARKING GARAGE, scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL.
text: CHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Talk about the blind leading the
dialog: blind... what's your name anyway?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Sky Van Orton.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Sky? Were your folks hippies or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Far from it.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I'm Christine Kaminsky.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: 58B. LATER, CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now, as they move in a
text: seemingly random pattern in the darkness.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: It's a company called Consumer
dialog: Recreation Services, CRS. I never
dialog: know what's gonna happen next.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Well, who does.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Until recently, I had a pretty
dialog: good idea... Duck.
text: The BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL, soon they're
text: crawling on hands and knees.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: So are you like a serious masochist,
dialog: or just really, really bored?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been
dialog: dragged into this.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Well... I have to tell you
dialog: something. Some guy came into
dialog: Leo's yesterday, showed me your
dialog: picture, offered me 250 bucks to
dialog: spill that food on you.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Said it was a practical joke. I
dialog: figured what the hell, I can use
dialog: the money-- I got him up to 500.
dialog: I hated that fucking job anyway--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Wait, so the heart attack, you
dialog: knew that was a joke too--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: No! It scared the shit out of me--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: But that CPR routine--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I used to be a lifeguard.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (points)
dialog: We're getting somewhere...
text: The TUNNEL has opened up again. There's even a tiny bit of VISIBLE
text: LIGHT now. He takes off the glasses, gives them to her.
text: HER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different
text: directions. A few steps onward they all converge at a point, like
text: the spokes of a wheel, at a WHITE SPOT on the ground...
text: SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE look around, then Schuyler points upward--
text: A WHITE RING overhead... it looks like the underside of a MANHOLE
text: COVER, with an illuminated CIRCLE OF LIGHT around the rim, a halo.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: How do we get up there?
text: SCHUYLER steps on the circle of WHITE-- it's a BUTTON. A ROPE
text: LADDER drops down.
scene_heading: 59. E X T . W A L K W A Y - E V E N I N G
text: A MANHOLE COVER slides aside, SCHUYLER climbs out and helps
text: Christine up. It's a short, covered WOODEN WALKWAY in an alley.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Well, that was pointless... but
dialog: different... kind of fun...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Mm, a different kind of fun.
dialog: What's your middle name?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Louise... why?
text: SCHUYLER points to some GRAFFITI-- a HEART with "SVO + CLK."
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You're supposed to be here... they
dialog: picked you for a reason.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: But-- why?
text: They start to move shakily down the CONSTRUCTION WALKWAY, both
text: bedraggled, covered in goo. HANDBILLS cover one wall.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Probably knew you'd play Good
dialog: Samaritan for that guy, drag me
dialog: along-- but they could have hired an
dialog: actor for that, less of a risk...
text: ON THE WALL, a series of HANDBILLS say, "AREN'T YOU FORGETTING
text: SOMETHING?" SCHUYLER puzzles over these as they move, gets to one
dialog: last one-- "BEHIND YOU, STUPID."
text: SCHUYLER looks back toward the end of the alley--
text: A YELLOW DUMPSTER with the logo, "CONSOLIDATED REFUSE SUPPLY" and
text: the smaller image of a KEY. SCHUYLER moves quickly to it, throws
text: open the lid.
text: ANGLE IN DUMPSTER-- a MOUNTAIN of SHREDDED PAPER.
text: SCHUYLER rolls his eyes, sorting through it. Christine approaches.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: This is really sick. I think
dialog: they're trying to fix us up.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Maybe you can't play alone--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Who says I want to play?
dialog: (a sigh)
dialog: OK, what the fuck are you doing in
text: the dumpster.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: There's something in here I need.
text: He climbs inside, dives in... and pops up again in a moment with--
text: CLOSE-- A Z-SHAPED WINDOW CRANK. Sure enough, there's a KEY
text: embossed on the side.
text: SCHUYLER climbs out again, brandishing the small crank.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What's that for?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I imagine I'll find out.
scene_heading: 60. E X T . C R S B U I L D I N G - E V E N I N G
text: SCHUYLER pockets the crank as he and CHRISTINE emerge from the
text: alley. PEDESTRIANS give them a wide berth. To a PASSERBY:
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What are you looking at?
text: Schuyler heads straight for the CRS doors, the large numbers 636
text: printed above-- it's LOCKED. He tries his little GOLD KEY on a
dialog: deadbolt, it's USELESS of course.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: This is their offices. We must
dialog: have been in their garage... my
text: office is just a few blocks from
dialog: here, we can get cleaned up there.
text: He walks a few steps on, she stands still for a moment, then nods
text: agreeably and follows.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 61. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S O F F I C E - N I G H T
text: START ON THE SKYLINE-- SCHUYLER moves from the window, as we hear a
text: DOOR OPEN. CHRISTINE emerges from the attached dressing area and
text: bath, toweling damp hair, in an oversized Harvard sweatshirt and
text: gym shorts, with a large plastic bag containing her filthy clothes.
text: She looks good, clearly she put some effort into her make-up.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Your turn.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (moving past her)
dialog: Find everything you need?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: You're outta conditioner.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: My apologies, I'll have it taken care
dialog: of. Help yourself to the fridge.
text: He points to a MINI-FRIDGE, shuts the door, a moment later we hear
text: WATER RUNNING. She looks around the office, letting down her
text: facade. She seems quite impressed, and intimidated, by the place.
text: She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isn't so
text: bad after all. From this point, she takes a more seductive tack.
scene_heading: 62. I N T . D R E S S I N G A R E A / B A T H - N I G H T
text: LATER, Schuyler has cleaned up, is finishing dressing, pulling a
text: pair of jeans over boxer shorts, tucking in a sport shirt.
text: Christine talks through the closed door.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE (O. S.)
dialog: So um... how rich are you anyway?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (amused)
dialog: Rich enough. Bit forward, aren't you?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE (O. S.)
dialog: Well, what exactly do you do?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Manage investments, some venture
dialog: capital, I'm on the board of a number
dialog: of publicly traded companies...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE (O. S.)
dialog: So you just like, move money around?
scene_heading: 63. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S O F F I C E - N I G H T
text: Schuyler emerges, shoes in hand.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Basically. Beats working, huh?
text: Christine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder,
text: eating an APPLE. She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: You don't look so bad, without the tie.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Look, I hope you haven't been too
dialog: put out... I could probably get
dialog: you another job, I have a stake in
dialog: a couple of restaurants--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I'm not much of a waitress, really.
dialog: Y'know, today's been kind of--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Can you type?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Kind of a turn-on, you know?
dialog: (getting no response)
dialog: I didn't mean-- just, the danger...
dialog: Like fucking in a graveyard.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Mm. So where do you live?
text: Christine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back,
text: tossing her unfinished apple in the trash.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Out in Concord, with my folks,
dialog: unfortunately. They're never
dialog: gonna believe that I've been
dialog: hanging out with a guy like you.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Nothing, just-- most of the guys I
dialog: see have tats, y'know?
dialog: (off his confused look)
dialog: Tattoos...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Of course. We'd better head
text: downstairs, the limo's waiting.
text: Christine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 64. I N T . L I M O - N I G H T
text: Schuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Mind if I smoke in here?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Yes.
dialog: (leaning forward)
text: Up here on the left.
text: As the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other. It's
text: a somewhat awkward moment.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: So what's our next move? I mean, in
dialog: the game. Obviously we need to figure
dialog: out what that crank thing is for--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'm not playing anymore.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I have a life. Jack'll take you
dialog: home, or wherever you want to go.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little
dialog: ballroom dancing before bed--
text: The limo has stopped now. Schuyler has started to open the door.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Wait, what about your clothes?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Forget it.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt.
text: So saying, she pulls it off. She's wearing a black bra... a ROSE
text: is tattooed on her shoulder. Schuyler can't help but react. She
text: thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No, it's not-- just-- back from
dialog: the cleaners.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: (throatily)
dialog: You dry clean your sweatshirts...
text: He nods slightly... as he reaches to take it--
text: --CHRISTINE leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him
text: a LONG, HARD KISS.
text: JACK THE DRIVER, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a
text: glimpse of this, quickly turns away.
text: CHRISTINE breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat,
text: waiting for Schuyler to make the next move.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: See ya.
text: Schuyler nods again, torn. She's looking at him expectantly. He's
text: clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female. Sadly,
text: he waves a hand.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Good night.
scene_heading: 65. E X T . L E O ' S - N I G H T
text: Schuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly
text: DIMS OUT out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a
text: CURSE. Schuyler moves toward his MBZ, the limo IDLING. He's about
text: to get inside when he sees a TICKET IN AN ENVELOPE under the
text: windshield wiper. He SNORTS-- insult to injury-- tosses it on the
text: dash as he climbs in.
scene_heading: 66. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S M B Z - N I G H T
text: He sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo
text: disappear. He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then STARTS at the
text: sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street.
text: ANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year, model and color
text: as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse
text: of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a
text: gun? A camera with a long lens? The car makes a quick U-turn and
text: drives in the same direction as the limo.
text: SCHUYLER, curious, STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue. Then he
text: glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye. He
text: doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead...
scene_heading: CLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words "OPEN ME" are printed in BLOCK
text: LETTERS on the outside. He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket
text: inside, but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear
text: wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS: "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY."
text: SCHUYLER frowns at this and throws the note aside. He flips on the
text: WINDSHIELD WIPERS (it's started to DRIZZLE) and pulls out.
text: POV THROUGH WINDESIELD-- A DARK FIGURE runs from the curb by Leo's,
text: right in front of the car, SCHUYLER SLAMS on the BRAKES--
text: --It's DAVID. He hurries around to the passenger door and jumps
text: in, looking haggard, scared, a man on the run.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Drive. Anywhere.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Jesus, David, you scared the shit
dialog: out of me--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm sorry Sky, just drive, please--
text: SCHUYLER pulls forward.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Where were you today?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I almost didn't make it at all. I
dialog: been in the bar for hours, waiting
dialog: for you to come back to your car--
dialog: Jesus, I can't believe I did this to
dialog: you, I'm so sorry--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Slow down, take a breath-- what
dialog: are you talking about?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The game! It just doesn't stop!
dialog: I thought I'd finished playing a
dialog: long time ago, I paid the bill,
dialog: then it started all over again,
dialog: they won't leave me alone--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (slowly, evenly)
dialog: Calm down. What are they doing to you?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Everything. It just doesn't stop.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Look. That's crazy. Yes, it's a
dialog: pain in the ass, but why would they
dialog: keep playing once you paid them?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know! I paid them MORE to
dialog: make it stop, God help me I even
dialog: gave you to them... but they won't
dialog: leave me alone!
text: He sees the crumpled note on the floor, picks it up--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: What's this?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: It was on my windshield--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh shit, oh SHIT they must be
dialog: following us--
text: He cranks his neck around, looking for pursuers. Schuyler looks at
text: him for a beat-- BANG! He almost loses control of the wheel.
scene_heading: SCENES 67-71 DELETED
scene_heading: 72. E X T . C I T Y S T R E E T - N I G H T
text: A TIRE HAS BLOWN. Schuyler drives ON THE RIM, struggles to get
text: over to the curb, BRAKES hard and stops.
scene_heading: 73. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S M B Z - N I G H T
text: David's losing it, looking around.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: They're shooting at us!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: David, get a grip, it's just a
dialog: flat tire!
text: He picks up the phone, punches buttons, gets nothing.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Damn it, the phone's not working--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Of course not.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (climbing out)
dialog: Fine, I'll change the fucking
dialog: thing myself.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Just hurry-- I'll pop the trunk.
text: David reaches for the glovebox.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No, you can't do it from--
text: CLOSE ON GLOVEBOX-- it POPS OPEN and KEYS SPILL OUT. There are at
text: least fifty of them jammed in there, all kinds, silver and gold...
text: and all have CRS stamped on them.
text: SCHUYLER leans closer, intrigued. David's eyes go wide as he
text: fingers a few of these keys.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What the fuck are those--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (whirling on him)
dialog: Like you don't know. Sonofabitch,
dialog: they got to you first, didn't they?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Um, David-- hello?
scene_heading: 74(NEW). E X T . G O L D E N G A T E P A R K - N I G H T
text: David gets out of the car in a hurry, amidst the greenery in the
text: park. RAINING HARDER now.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: It's more than that isn't it? You're
dialog: part of it, you're one of them! Of
dialog: course, it makes perfect sense!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: They planted those keys! I don't
dialog: know what the hell they're for--
text: Schuyler tries hard to be rational, but David is over the edge.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You're behind the whole thing aren't
dialog: you? You and your sick fucking
dialog: friends set it up--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What?! What friends? Get a grip,
dialog: David-- why would I do that?
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I don't know, out of boredom, to
dialog: get back at me--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: For what?!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: For being a weirdo, for trying to
dialog: be happy? Well, congratulations,
dialog: you win. Now make it stop!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (grabbing him)
dialog: I can't! Listen to me--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Fuck you!
text: David SLUGS HIM in the face, Schuyler staggers back, clutches his
text: BLEEDING nose. David runs, full tilt, into the woods near the
dialog: Japanese Tea Garden.
text: SCHUYLER pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of
text: breath, calling after David, who's vanished. He leans against a
text: tree, PANTING, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a SCRAP OF TISSUE
text: from his pocket. He hears a PHONE RINGING, moves toward it,
text: emerging through bushes near the ACADEMY OF SCIENCE...
text: He pauses at the RINGING PAYPHONE. He decides not to pick it up,
text: looking around at the deserted MUSEUM BUILDINGS and hurrying toward
text: civilization. He passes other PAYPHONES en route to the park
text: exit... each one STARTS RINGING as he approaches it. He moves
text: faster, freaked. At the edge of the park, he snatches one up--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (on phone)
dialog: What have you done to my brother,
dialog: you bastards?! This is over, I'm
dialog: not playing anymore--
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hello, is anyone there--
speaker_heading: PHONE VOICE
dialog: If you'd like to make a call,
dialog: please hang up and dial again-- if
dialog: you need help--
text: SCHUYLER slams the phone down. He dabs his nose one more time,
text: tosses the paper scrap into the trash.
text: CLOSE ON SCRAP-- "CRS" with the emergency NUMBER, the blue ink has
text: BLED with the rain and Schuyler's BLOOD...
speaker_heading: SCENE 75 DELETED
scene_heading: 76(NEW). E X T . F U L T O N S T R E E T - N I G H T
text: POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD, as Schuyler emerges from the park. The
text: car suddenly MOVES FORWARD--
text: WITH SCHUYLER. He walks to the curb, distractedly raises a hand
text: for a cab, which pulls up instantly. He climbs in.
scene_heading: 77. I N T . C A B - N I G H T
text: An aged, battered CAB; PLEXIGLAS between the CABBIE and the back.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Six three six Mission, please.
text: The cabbie nods and hits the gas.
scene_heading: 78. E X T . S A N F R A N C I S C O S T R E E T - N I G H T
text: The cab roars down the street, KICKING UP WATER from the gutters.
scene_heading: 79. I N T . C A B - N I G H T
text: Schuyler bites his cuticle, not watching where they're going; the
text: windows are wet and fogged. Then he looks out, narrows his eyes
text: and RAPS on the PLEXIGLAS PARTITION.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You're heading the wrong way.
speaker_heading: CABBIE (filter)
dialog: Relax, pal, you'll get where
dialog: you're going.
text: The cabbie turns IN PROFILE for a moment. He appears to be wearing
text: a HEARING AID, a round piece of plastic, a tiny WIRE disappearing
text: into his shirt. And there's something familiar about his face.
text: Schuyler glances at the driver ID on the back of the seat--
text: CLOSE ON PHOTO, the man is the RASTA from the airport, with a new
scene_heading: hairdo. The COMPANY NAME-- "CONSOLIDATED REGENCY SEDANS." CRS.
text: SCHUYLER rubs his head, very angry.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Why are you doing this--
speaker_heading: CABBIE/RASTA (filter)
dialog: We do it all for you! We're the best
dialog: friends you got, no one ever worked
dialog: so hard to make you feel alive... but
dialog: you gotta let it happen...
text: The cab STOPS at a RED LIGHT. SCHUYLER tries the doorhandle-- it
dialog: doesn't work.
scene_heading: 80. E X T . S A N F R A N C I S C O S T R E E T - N I G H T
text: The cab PEELS OUT when the light turns green, heads for a pier.
scene_heading: 81. I N T . C A B - N I G H T
text: Schuyler looks around in increasing panic.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What the fuck is this--
speaker_heading: CABBIE/RASTA
dialog: Have a nice day...
text: The cabbie opens his own door and leaps out of the MOVING CAB--
scene_heading: 82. E X T . W H A R F - N I G H T
text: The cabbie/rasta hits the ground and ROLLS in a perfect stunt fall.
text: The cab rockets to the end of the disused wharf and--
text: --GOES FLYING off the edge into the San Francisco Bay, illuminated
text: by SPOTLIGHTS from the end of the wharf.
scene_heading: 83. I N T . C A B - N I G H T
text: Schuyler SCREAMS as the cab plunges and HITS the water.
scene_heading: 84. E X T . B A Y - N I G H T
text: The STEAMING cab's nose slowly DIPS below the surface.
scene_heading: 85. I N T . C A B - N I G H T
text: FILLING WITH WATER from the car's floor, from overhead. EERIE
text: LIGHT from the front of the cab. Schuyler tries to roll down the
text: window, the handle SPINS, nothing happens.
scene_heading: 86. E X T . B A Y - N I G H T
text: The cab GOES UNDER with a BURBLE of BUBBLES.
scene_heading: 87. I N T . C A B - N I G H T
text: Schuyler CRANKS the other window handle desperately, now up to his
text: waist in water, water GUSHING IN now. INCREASING BLACKNESS through
text: the windows as he sinks. The handle falls off in his hand.
scene_heading: 88. U N D E R W A T E R S H O T - N I G H T
text: The sinking cab, HEADLIGHTS and INTERIOR LIGHTS STILL ON, Schuyler
text: inside KICKING at the windows and the Plexi, without any success.
scene_heading: 89. I N T . C A B - N I G H T
text: Schuyler stops his frantic kicking, tries to think coolly. He's up
text: to his neck by now. Angry at himself for not realizing it sooner,
text: he pulls what he needs out of his pocket-- the HANDCRANK he found
text: in the dumpster. He takes a deep breath and--
text: 90. SUBMERGES. UNDERWATER he inserts the crank into the window
text: handle hole... a perfect fit. He CRANKS FAST, WATER FLOODS IN.
scene_heading: 91. U N D E R W A T E R S H O T - N I G H T
text: Schuyler SLITHERS OUT the open window. Cheeks puffed out, he kicks
text: frantically for the surface.
scene_heading: 92. E X T . B A Y - N I G H T
text: He BURSTS to the surface, SPLUTTERING, catching his BREATH. A
text: FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Mister-- are you all right?!
text: Schuyler, treading water, turns around--
text: A CABIN CRUISER at the dock nearby. A very beautiful GIRL in a
text: yellow rain slicker, holding a powerful FLASHLIGHT leans over the
text: edge, tosses him a life preserver, hauls him toward her.
scene_heading: 93. E X T . C A B I N C R U I S E R - N I G H T
text: SCHUYLER clambers onto the rear ladder with the girl's help, teeth
text: CHATERING. HOLD ON the boat's colorfully painted name on the
text: stern: "POSEIDON'S CURSE," and in small letters, "COSTA REY SOL."
text: SCHUYLER boards the large, ritzy craft.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Thank you... I'm very grateful.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Shouldn't swim in the Bay, you
dialog: could get hepatitis.
text: Schuyler nods, looking around, recovering from the shock.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I have to get in touch with the police.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You're freezing, I got some dry
dialog: clothes below.
scene_heading: 94. I N T . B O A T C A B I N - N I G H T
text: Schuyler's wet clothes hang from a hook, he's in a towel, starting
text: to pull on a fresh set of casual clothes.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Do you need any help?
text: His back is turned as the girl climbs down, opens her raincoat--
text: only a STRING BIKINI beneath. She could be a Playboy centerfold.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Uh, no. I'm fine. These fit...
dialog: (buttoning his pants)
dialog: ...perfectly.
text: He turns slowly, just as the girl reaches behind her.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Sure I can't do something for you?
text: She WINKS as she lets her top drop. Schuyler smiles strangely.
text: She takes this for lust, approaches him with open arms. He GRABS
text: her by the hair. Menacingly:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I am finished playing.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: OW! Let go!
text: She pounds at him, tries to kick. He wrestles her to the floor,
text: kneels on top of her. He seems about to hit her.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: This has got to fucking STOP!
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You're hurting me!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Who are you!?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I just got hired to show you a good
dialog: time! C'mon please get off me...
text: Schuyler gets his rage under control, horrified at himself. He
text: climbs off her, she scrambles away, afraid, covering herself.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I am not into this kinda shit!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Who hired you.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: I don't know, the service set it up.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: The service?
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Y'know, Fantasy Girls. They said
dialog: you had this wild fantasy, I
dialog: should just wait in the boat...
text: Schuyler realizes he's not going to get anything more out of her,
text: pulls on a shirt, grabs his wet clothes and leaves the cabin.
scene_heading: 95. E X T . W H A R F - N I G H T
text: Schuyler leaps off onto the wharf. The girl, pulling the raincoat
text: on, leans over the deck.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Doncha want your thing? I'm supposed
dialog: to give you this, this key thingie...
text: Schuyler pauses, turns slowly, approaches.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: A key.
text: THE GIRL nods quickly, reaches over the railing to hand him a SMALL
text: WOODEN COFFIN with a BLACK BOW and a RED KEY BURNED into the lid.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: They said you'd figure out what to

text: SCHUYLER takes it from her gingerly, undoes the bow, opens the lid:
text: ANGLE IN COFFIN-- an ornate HATCHET with a KEY DESIGN on the blade.
text: SCHUYLER REMOVES it from its QUILTED resting place. THE GIRL backs
text: away, nervous to see SCHUYLER with a weapon.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'm supposed to carry a fucking

speaker_heading: PLYMPTON

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: 99. LATER. UNIFORM #1 SPEAKS into his walkie-talkie, COP TALK; #2
text: pokes around in a box full of SHREDDED PAPER; Plympton CONFERS with

text: carpet, back to an empty wall. Barnett checks his notes.
speaker_heading: BARNETT
dialog: Management company for the building
dialog: said this floor hasn't been rented. We

speaker_heading: PLYMPTON
dialog: Recreation service.
speaker_heading: BARNETT
dialog: Right. No sign of the boat or the

text: Gallo, who'd been talking on a phone IN BG, approaches.
speaker_heading: GALLO
dialog: The numbers you gave us are
dialog: disconnected, sir, this was the only
dialog: address the phone company had. And
dialog: we found your car-- it's in impound.
speaker_heading: BARNETT
dialog: I'm a little confused as to motive
dialog: here. You said your brother sent you
dialog: to these people...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: It's not his fault, he's unstable,
dialog: he didn't know what he was doing--
speaker_heading: BARNETT
dialog: And they were supposed to show you
dialog: a, a good time?
speaker_heading: GALLO
dialog: (a cautioning look at Barnett)
dialog: My guess is this Feingold guy's

dialog: else you can tell us about him?
text: Schuyler spots an empty CHINESE FOOD CARTON crumpled in the corner.

text: SCHUYLER CURSES and shakes his hand out. He looks around in
text: disbelief-- the walls are covered in GRAFFITI.
text: "GAME OVER" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the
text: HARLEQUIN, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a
text: GLOSSY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO is stuck in its teeth.
text: SCHUYLER pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling--
text: A POLICE PHOTO of MR. VAN ORTON, his body sprawled in a pool of
text: blood. It's stamped "PROPERTY SFPD" in red...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Oh, God--

text: OVER THE MANTLEPIECE, A NOTE is stuck into a PAINTING with a

scene_heading: INSERT NOTE, PAN DOWN SLOWLY, X-CLOSE: "Like my father before me,
dialog: I kill what I love. Goodbye, cruel world, blah blah blah..." A

text: SCHUYLER GROANS and crumples the note. He reaches for a phone-- he
text: PICKS up the receiver, it's been MELTED into the body of the

text: a MAN HANGING HIMSELF, a BROKEN HEART, a PENIS, a NAKED WOMAN, etc.
text: Across the walls, over the TV, are the words, "YOU ARE NOT ALONE."

speaker_heading: CRS-MAN (on TV)
dialog: Boy oh boy, you fucked up big-time!

dialog: No no no--
speaker_heading: CRS-MAN (on TV)

speaker_heading: CRS-MAN (on TV)
dialog: Simple, we duped your keys the day you

dialog: You rich people all have alarms, but

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER

speaker_heading: CRS-MAN (on TV)
dialog: Sky, I just came to say good-

speaker_heading: DESK CLERK
dialog: Mr. Van Orton. Here's your credit
dialog: card... and the maid found this

dialog: CRS... I saw pictures, girl with a

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: (touches her shoulder)
dialog: Ssh, my folks don't know about

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: No, I thought they were trying to

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Why would they do that?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I have no idea, nothing they do makes any

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: So that's the only reason you came

text: unscrews the head, it's a decanter. He takes a sniff and puts it
text: back with a bemused expression. He takes another sniff, noticing
dialog: something else in the air...
text: A WISP OF SMOKE rises from the lamp Christine turned on.

text: ANGLE INSIDE LAMPSHADE-- a new PRICETAG dangles from the shade
text: against the bulb, starting to TURN BROWN, smoking.
text: SCHUYLER licks his fingertips, reaches inside the shade to PULL OFF
text: tag-- in doing so, he burns his fingers on the hot bulb, STIFLES a
text: curse and jerks his hand away. He KNOCKS OVER the picture, which

text: on it. He pulls open a kitchen drawer--
text: ANGLE IN DRAWER-- completely empty.
text: SCHUYLER, curious now, opens a cabinet, absently drying his hand on

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: (quick glance)
dialog: Mm-hmm, First Communion.

dialog: What's the matter, you look a

text: He grabs her hand away. Icily:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Don't touch me.
text: His tone alarms her-- he stares at her with hatred. A silent BEAT
text: between them, each tries to assess the new situation. She realizes
text: he's onto her. She swallows, makes a quick decision. Suddenly she
text: leans close to him, reaching around him to SHUT OFF the table lamp.
text: She leaves her arms around him and HISSES in his ear-- she drops
text: her lower-class accent, speaks in a clipped, educated voice:
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Don't be stupid. Don't say anything,
dialog: not here, they're watching.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (sickened; to himself)
dialog: God damn it...

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: (back in character, accented)
dialog: OK, I know a good place we could
dialog: go and like, be alone...
text: She glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling--
text: ON CEILING, a large SMOKE DETECTOR with a RED LIGHT, a cable from
text: it-- there's a small LENS in the center... A HIDDEN CAMERA.
text: SCHUYLER looks at this, starting to rise. She moves to a window,

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: It's a beautiful night, isn't it?

text: The MBZ SIDESWIPES a car as Schuyler runs a light, his WINDSHIELD
text: CRACKS, the side of the car's CRUNCHED IN, but he keeps driving.
text: He crosses lanes directly in front of an oncoming TRUCK-- the VAN
text: HITS THE BRAKES to avoid getting squashed.
text: Schuyler SKIDS into a narrow alley. THE VAN, having lost a half a
text: block, misses this and continues straight.
scene_heading: 121. I N T . M B Z - N I G H T
text: Christine's looking behind as Schuyler drives.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: OK, we lost 'em--
text: She's THROWN FORWARD as Schuyler SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, reaches

text: the collision. He gives her a shove, she clings to the doorframe--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What are you doing!?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Get out of my car.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I coulda handed you to them! They

text: Christine tumbles into the wet gutter.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Listen to me you bastard-- I know
dialog: what's going on! No one else is
dialog: gonna tell you!
text: Schuyler pulls the door shut, the car starts BACKING AWAY.
text: Christine gets to her feet, looks after him. He reaches the end of
text: the alley and stops-- then SCREECHES FORWARD. She jumps to the
text: edge of the alley, fearing he's trying to run her down. Schuyler
text: HITS THE BRAKES a few feet away. He leans across, calls to her.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Get in.
scene_heading: 123. I N T . S C H U Y L E R ' S M B Z - N I G H T
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: No cops, I got an outstanding warrant.

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Heard about this big swindle and--

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Spare me the snide comments. And
dialog: please don't do that in here--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Second-hand smoke is the least of

dialog: (blows it in his face)
dialog: Shit, they really screwed up, I can't

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Wait, how did-- before the game,
dialog: you were working in that bar--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: They planted me in advance, your

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Oh God, David's in on it...?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: It's not his fault, he thought it was
dialog: the only way out... just another victim.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: How the hell did they think they
dialog: were gonna get my money?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Honey, they already got it.
text: She gives him a pitying look. Schuyler throws her a sidelong

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I'm sorry. They already did your

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (on phone)

text: of earshot, arms folded, staring at the dark horizon.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER (on phone)
dialog: Bob, listen carefully, this is an
dialog: emergency. Feingold and his people,
dialog: I've called all my banks, they've
dialog: drained the accounts, personal and
dialog: corporate, everything-- tell the cops
dialog: I've got one of them with me, we'll

speaker_heading: CLERK

speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: I think I have some cash.
scene_heading: 132. E X T . C O N V E N I E N C E S T O R E - N I G H T
text: They emerge from the store with a couple of grocery bags, Christine
text: sucks an ice cream pop. They toss the bags in the trunk.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Money isn't everything, right?
text: Schuyler is seething, clutching the trunk lid for a beat, then
text: SLAMS it hard when she steps back, making her jump.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: It might be best if you didn't
dialog: speak. I very nearly crushed your
dialog: skull just now.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: C'mon chill, what'd they take you for, a
dialog: couple hundred G's? Chump change for a
dialog: guy like you, chalk it up to experience.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (quietly, restraining himself)
dialog: Just under a billion dollars.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: A bil--?
dialog: (nervous laugh)
dialog: You're kidding, right?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Do I look like I'm kidding?
dialog: This is about more than my
dialog: personal lifestyle-- your pals
dialog: raided pension plans, charitable
dialog: foundations, company payrolls...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Oh my God--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't know what kind of jerk-off
dialog: con games you've played in the
dialog: past, but now you're in the big

dialog: sabotage a small portion of the

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 135. E X T . O R E G O N L A K E - D A Y
text: A beautiful Northern lake-- dense forests on the mainland, pines

text: parked at the shoreline. MOVE TO FIND Schuyler and Christine, as
text: they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly
text: humble, somewhat decrepit cabin on it. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 136. I N T . O R E G O N C A B I N - D A Y
text: CHRISTINE pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood-burning
text: stove in which a FIRE CRACKLES. This cabin is genuinely rustic and
text: run-down-- hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust.
text: WATER DRIPS from the ceiling in a few places. LIGHTNING FLASHES in
text: BG through the scene, the STORM has gotten pretty bad.
text: SCHUYLER finishes taking out his contacts, DROPPING them in cups
text: full of water. He slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed
text: family photos on the coffee table in front of him. Christine,
text: barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You're not having any?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Never drink it. Makes my tits hurt.
text: Schuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo.
text: ON PHOTO-- he rubs away the dust from a shot showing Schuyler's
text: father, with young Schuyler, on a boat with fishing equipment.
text: CHRISTINE takes a step and CRIES out, clutching her foot and
text: sitting beside Schuyler. A small FISHHOOK protrudes from her foot,
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Hold still.
text: He talks while he carefully removes the hook from her foot.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Sorry, this place hasn't been cleaned
dialog: in a while. My dad built it himself,
dialog: spent a lot of time here alone.
speaker_heading: (regards a LEAK)
dialog: Rotten carpenter...
text: He pulls out the hook, puts it aside; she rubs her foot.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Thank you.
text: SCHUYLER suddenly starts LAUGHING, wipes tears from his eyes.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What's so funny?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Just-- private joke...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Tell me.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Well... I always told myself I
dialog: wasn't gonna end up like him. And
dialog: now here I am, running his
text: corporation, living in his house,
text: hiding in the cabin where he went
dialog: to hide right before he... I even
dialog: look like the bastard.
text: Christine looks at the photo of MR. VAN ORTON, then at Schuyler.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Not that much.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Mm, plus I'm a helluva lot more
dialog: gullible than he ever was...
text: THE CELL-PHONE CHIRPS, Schuyler shakes off his self-pity, snatches
text: up the handset.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Yes.
text: CHRISTINE mouths, "Who is it?"
speaker_heading: PLYMPTON (filter)
dialog: (careful, worried)
dialog: It's me, Schuyler... I got your message...
dialog: I'll admlt, I was very disturbed...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (hand over phone)
dialog: My, lawyer.
dialog: (to Plympton)
dialog: So. What's our next move?
text: During the following, Christine's eyes go wide, she shakes her head
text: frantically, draws a finger across her throat--
speaker_heading: PLYMPTON (filter)
dialog: I've been on the phone all morning... your
dialog: funds are intact, nothing's changed,
dialog: there's been no activity whatsoever...
text: SCHUYLER struggles to absorb the import of this as well as
text: Christine's behavior. She shakes her head with a sigh, rises to
text: refill his coffee cup.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Wait-- that's not true--
speaker_heading: PLYMPTON (filter)
dialog: (firmly)
dialog: It is true, no one is after your
dialog: money, no one is trying to hurt you--
text: SCHUYLER looks at Christine with horror. She nods and WHISPERS:
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: He's in on it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Oh, God...
speaker_heading: PLYMPTON (filter)
dialog: Listen to me, Sky!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What are they paying you, Robert?
dialog: Piece of the action?
speaker_heading: PLYMPTON (filter)
dialog: Schuyler! Look, you've done the
dialog: right thing going up there, maybe
dialog: it's best if you just sit tight for
dialog: a while, forget about everything,
dialog: it's all under control--
text: Schuyler HANGS UP, breathing hard, pacing, clutching the phone.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: We have to get out of here!
text: Christine approaches him with a fresh cup of coffee, which he sips.
text: The PHONE CHIRPS again, Schuyler THROWS it violently against the
text: wall, it's silenced. He gulps more coffee, rising again, looking
text: at the smashed phone, sickened by his own loss of control.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Well, that was stupid.
text: Christine watches him closely. He keeps balling his hands into
text: fists as he paces, trying to think out his next play.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: OK, they've gotten to him. OK.
dialog: Is there anyone I can trust?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: It's out of your hands.
text: He takes a step, stumbles, shakes his head to clear it. She rises,
text: picks up his half-empty cup and heads for the kitchen area. His
text: gaze follows this, he realizes he's been drugged.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Christine!!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: That's not my name.
text: With a CRY OF RAGE he lunges after her, but CRASHES into the wall,
text: clutching at a hanging ROD, which falls when he does-- he KNOCKS
text: OVER the table of photos as he goes down, PANTING for air like a
text: fish out of water, clutching his stomach, nauseated.
text: HIS POV-- SIDEWAYS, LOW ANGLE. SFX, BLOOD POUNDING in his head.
text: Schuyler's eyes FOLLOW the GROOVES of the wet, warped hardwood
text: floor, they lead to-- and almost seem to point to-- Christine.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE-- from the counter she picks up a small vial
text: with a bit of powder at the bottom, slips it into her pocket.
text: SCHUYLER's eyes roll into his head as he struggles against the
text: effects, tries to get to his hands and knees. He gasps:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Why...
text: CHRISTINE approaches, stands a few feet away, lights a cigarette,
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: We needed you to call your banks.
dialog: Cellular calls can be intercepted,
dialog: rerouted, y'know.
text: She crouches by him, flicking ashes a few inches from his nose.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: All those calls to Switzerland and
dialog: Chase Manhattan-- you were talking to
dialog: our people. See, we were still
dialog: missing a lotta pieces-- access
dialog: codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton
dialog: didn't have-- but now we have
dialog: I everything. I guess you are pretty
dialog: fucking stupid-- but thanks.
text: He CLAWS at her helplessly with a GROAN, but misses. His glasses
text: fall off, he collapses again.
scene_heading: SCHUYLER'S POV-- everything a BLUR NOW, except in EXTREME FG-- the
text: photo of himself and his father, which now lies on the floor.
scene_heading: 137. FLASH-CUT TO: FLASHBACK POV-- THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, as MR.
text: VAN ORTON'S FACE SMASHES into the ground, his GLASSES SHATTERING,
text: BLOOD SPRAYING from his head.
text: 138. CUT BACK TO: SCHUYLER writhes, fighting the drug.
text: 139. FLASH-CUT TO: The moment of his father's jump-- only in this
text: HALLUCINATION, SCHUYLER himself wears the robe, leaps into space.
scene_heading: 140. SCHUYLER'S POV-- FROM FLOOR-- Christine moves INTO FOCUS,
text: crouches near him, studying her victim almost clinically.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: It's over. Just let go...
text: The SFX POUNDING STOPS, and--
speaker_heading: CUT TO BLACK
text: BREATHING... THEN SCREAMING, POUNDING and KICKING...
scene_heading: 141. I N T . C R Y P T - D A Y
text: A WOODEN LID SPLINTERS as SCHUYLER pounds his way out of a COFFIN.
text: DIM LIGHT through CRACKS in the walls, this is an old and moldering
text: MAUSOLEUM, other COFFINS nearby. FRESH FLOWERS surround his
text: resting place, otherwise everything is completely DECAYED.
text: By the time SCHUYLER gets out of the coffin, his arms are BLOODIED.
text: He's been dressed in an ALL-WHITE BURIAL SUIT. A RED ROSE is TAPED
text: to his chest. He blinks and stares about wildly--
text: HIS POV-- BLURRY, can't make out much.
text: SCHUYLER blinks, breathing hard, utterly freaked. He notices the
text: ROSE on his chest, tears it off, SNIFFS it, then THROWS IT aside
text: with a frustrated CRY. He stumbles to the heavy door of the crypt,
text: tugs, then realizes it opens the other way-- he gives it a PUSH--
scene_heading: 142. E X T . C E M E T E R Y - D A Y
text: IT COLLAPSES immediately. SCHUYLER tumbles out of the crypt into
text: the HOT SUNLIGHT. He's in a ramshackle city of the dead, a SPANISH
text: GRAVEYARD. There are endless rows of TOMBS, rioting tropical
text: VEGETATION, many FLOWERS, impossibly bright COLORS. It should be
dialog: quite beautiful and peaceful...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What?
text: He walks around tentatively, SQUINTING. AN OLD WOMAN in black sits
text: contemplating a grave, fingering her rosary. SCHUYLER slips a hand
text: absently into his pocket, and finds something there, pulls it out--
text: SCHUYLER'S POV-- BLURRY shot of a NOTE in SPANISH, with a KEY on
dialog: the stationery...
text: SCHUYLER blinks, slips the note in his pocket.

text: TIGHT SHOT on Schuyler blinking, disoriented, JOSTLED by a sea of
text: HISPANIC PEOPLE on this busy street.
text: SCHUYLER'S POV-- WALKING TENUOUSLY. The world's a BLUR, FACES move
text: in and out of FOCUS. They're dark, foreign, many POOR PEOPLE,
text: poverty-scarred features. Scraps of SPANISH. He grabs a DARK MAN.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Where am I?!
text: The man replies with an EXCLAMATION in SPANISH, pushes Schuyler
dialog: away, CAMERA TUMBLES--
text: OBJECTIVE SHOT-- Schuyler's on his knees in the middle of this
text: third-world thoroughfare, utterly disoriented. STREET VENDORS sell
text: weird-looking foods, squads of SQLDIERS march with rifles,
text: MUSICIANS PLAY odd instruments... Schuyler clutches his head, as if
dialog: trying to wish it all away.
text: A COP IN BEIGE UNIFORM suddenly prods at him with a nightstick,
text: YELLING AT HIM in SPANISH to move on.
text: SCHUYLER'S POV-- the COP looming over him, a BLURRY menace, the end
text: of the nightstick SHARP in FG as it POKES at him.
text: ANOTHER ANGLE-- Schuyler pleads with the man:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Please, help me, I'm an American!
dialog: I'm lost! Please!!
text: This doesn't seem to help. He tries to get away from the stick,
text: but the cop pursues. He bangs into people as he tries to move
text: quickly, the stick right behind him.
text: Schuyler FALLS over a BEGGAR on the ground, in far worse shape than
text: he is. The cop YELLS at him. Schuyler covers his head, holding
text: out the NOTE WITH THE KEY, which the cop finally snatches away. He
text: studies it for a moment, then BARKS with LAUGHTER.
text: SCHUYLER'S POV-- the cop reaches down to him--
text: OBJECTIVE ANGLE-- Schuyler cringes, expecting a blow, but the cop
text: just pulls him to his feet. He drags him away with him, speaking
text: more gently IN SPANISH, amused. Schuyler nods thankfully.
text: HIGH ANGLE-- the THRONGS on this crowded street.

speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: Tegucigalpa.

dialog: Tegucigalpa. Tegucigalpa?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: That's gibberish!
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: It is the capital of Honduras.
text: SCHUYLER buries his face in his hands, nods. He's relieved to have

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: DESK SERGEANT
dialog: So-- you have become, lost from,

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER

speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: Mr. Van Orton... is this a joke of

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: WORKER
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Well, without any identification it

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Yeah, well I, I seem to have lost my

text: The pawn shop owner nods knowingly. There's one other CUSTOMER, a

text: BIN full of sports equipment. He seems to have been eavesdropping,
text: the pawn shop owner now exchanges a few words with him IN SPANISH,

dialog: Huh, close enough...
speaker_heading: PAWN SHOP OWNER

text: INTERCUT POV with his REACTIONS, as everything falls into place in

scene_heading: SCHUYLER'S POV-- SLOW PAN OVER the assortment of nighttime RIDERS--

text: CAMERA PAUSES on a patch of GRAFITTI: typically unreadable SCRAWL,

text: SCHUYLER narrows his eyes at the man, then looks away pointedly.
text: He puts the notebook into A PLASTIC BAG. Beneath it, cradled in
text: his lap, is the mysterious black book. He opens this carefully--
text: CLOSE, the book is hollow. Inside is an expensive HANDGUN.

speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: End of the line, man.
text: SCHUYLER starts; the PUNK keeps the knife on him. He's a young,

text: heading down to his waist. Schuyler nods, starts studying the
text: man's arms, heavily TATTOOED with crude cabalistic SYMBOLS.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Are the tattoos supposed to mean

speaker_heading: PUNK
dialog: (momentarily thrown)

text: grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car,

text: beneath the seat, both men reach for it...
speaker_heading: TRANSIT COP

speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: What do you think you're doing,

dialog: cuffs Schuyler to an armrest--
speaker_heading: TRANSIT COP
dialog: Wait here--
text: He dashes into the next car after the punk. Schuyler looks at the
dialog: floor of the car, sees--
text: THE SMALL RADIO and its EARPLUG attached by a WIRE. The radio has
text: a tiny LOOP/RABBIT EAR antenna on it. He snatches it up, then
text: YANKS at the cuff. He spots the knife under the seat, grabs it,
text: starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post.
text: FROM THE NEXT CAR he hears SHOUTS, SCREAMS, a serious commotion
text: going on, he doesn't know who's winning. Schuyler's almost gotten
dialog: free as the TRAIN SLOWS, when--
text: --the DOOR at the far end of the car opens, it's the PUNK, bruised
text: and bloody, ready to kill.
text: He lunges at Schuyler just as he PRIES THE ARMREST off the seat and
text: CLOBBERS him with it. The punk reels back. The train has stopped,

text: onto the platform just before they shut again.

speaker_heading: ELIZABETH

text: Late afternoon. PAN FROM THE ENTRANCE to find SCHUYLER buying a
text: ticket and hurrying in.
text: 181. IN THE ZOO, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy.
scene_heading: SCHUYLER'S POV-- ZOO-GOERS gazing at the ANIMALS... CAMERA FINDS
text: Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle. He's
text: doing his best to supervise THREE OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN, two boys and
text: an older girl. He's just another dad at the zoo, far from
text: impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled.
text: When he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd
text: the children together as Schuyler moves in on him... he can't get
text: away. Schuyler grabs the man's shirt.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Bill Fisher, hi! I really admire
dialog: your work...
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Oh please... I got my kids here...
text: Schuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes.
text: Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Get rid of them.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: (to the kids)
dialog: Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty!
dialog: Snack time!
text: He dangles the bill over their heads, the KIDS CHEER, leap like
text: dolphins after fish. The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run
text: for a nearby concession. Schuyler and Feingold stroll together.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Look, buddy, it was just a job--
dialog: nothing personal, y'know? I play
dialog: my part, improvise a little,
dialog: that's what I'm good at, I still
dialog: do a little stand-up--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I've seen your resume. I'm sick
dialog: of foot soldiers, I've gotta get
dialog: to whoever's in charge.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Of CRS? Christ, nobody knows, nobody
dialog: gets the big picture--
dialog: (looking away)
dialog: Jason, Tommy, cut it out!
text: FEINGOLD'S BOYS ARE THROWING ROCKS at the monkeys. They give their
text: father a look and saunter along.
text: SCHUYLER's not interested in the zoo drama.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Goddammit, why do they do that.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: How do I find them!? Their
dialog: offices were abandoned--
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: They own the whole building, they
text: just move from floor to floor.
text: Schuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: OK... They know you, you've worked for
dialog: them. You're going to get me inside.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Tell them anything, tell them the cops
dialog: are after you, you've gotta talk to
dialog: someone or you'll blow the whistle.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: No way, it's too dangerous.
text: Schuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him. Right in his face:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You don't seem to understand. Right
dialog: here, right now-- I'm the danger.
text: Feingold gets the message.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: 182. E X T . C R S B U I L D I N G - N I G H T
text: LIGHTS OFF in the building. A battered STATION WAGON rounds a
text: corner, PAUSES before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same
dialog: garage he and Christine were once tormented in.
scene_heading: 183. I N T . S T A T I O N W A G O N - N I G H T
text: FEINGOLD drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to
text: him, junk galore; he's apparently alone.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: We're here, Sky. They said they're on
dialog: the twelfth floor.
text: BEHIND THE SEAT-- Schuyler crouches under a blanket.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Drive in, then.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Look-- what are you gonna do? Really?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Really-- I don't know. Improvise. Go!
scene_heading: 183A. I N T . C R S G A R A G E - N I G H T
text: The station wagon stops at the bottom of the ramp. A BEEFY GATE
text: GUARD behind glass glares at Feingold, who waves timidly. The
text: STEEL GATE RISES and the station wagon drives in.
text: THE STATION WAGON parks near an elevator bank; a handful of CARS, a
text: few white CRS SECURITY VEHICLES and VANS parked nearby. Feingold
text: climbs out, trying hard not to look scared. ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN
text: and a beefy, frightening-looking SECURITY MAN in a suit steps out.
text: He looks around carefully as Feingold joins him. He takes
text: Feingold's arm and pulls him toward the elevator. They wait.
text: SCHUYLER'S POV from the back seat-- just as the DOORS OPEN, the
text: Gate Guard steps up behind Feingold, puts a gun in his back.
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD
dialog: You're not authorized to be here.
text: HE FIRES-- Schuyler glimpses a SPRAY OF BLOOD, Feingold collapses.
text: The Security Man grabs the body as it falls, starts dragging it out
text: of sight while the Gate Guard puts a hand to his ear, talks into a
text: mini-transmitter in his other hand. He follows the Security Man
text: out of sight. The elevator doors remain open.
text: With the guards out of sight, Schuyler rises slowly. He looks
text: stunned and sickened as he lets himself out cautiously, sneaking
text: behind vehicles. The main gate is sealed, he has no idea how long
text: the guards will be gone. THE OPEN ELEVATOR DOORS beckon.
text: Schuyler crawls on his belly the last few yards, starts, finding--
text: CLOSE, a RUBBER BUG on its back.
text: SCHUYLER creeps military style, on hands and knees, the rest of the
text: way to the elevator. He puts a hand in some of Feingold's BLOOD,
text: winces, then gets in the elevator.
scene_heading: 184. I N T . C R S E L E V A T O R - N I G H T
text: SCHUYLER presses the button for 12-- the top floor.
text: ON PANEL-- nothing happens, the button LIGHTS for an instant but
text: GOES OUT again. The elevator won't move.
text: SCHUYLER's getting exasperated.
text: ON PANEL-- he tries BUTTONS allover, same story.
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD
dialog: Yo!
text: ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the gate guard jogs TOWARD the elevators,
text: pulling his gun.
text: SCHUYLER starts to panic, pulls his own gun and POINTS IT AT THE
text: GUARD, who freezes and raises his hands. Behind him, the Security
text: Man approaches Schuyler from a different angle, his gun out.
text: Schuyler can't get a bead on both of them.
speaker_heading: SECURITY MAN
dialog: You're a dead man.
text: Schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel--
text: AT BASE OF PANEL, a gold keyhole. CLOSER-- the letters CRS are
text: printed beneath it, very small.
text: SCHUYLER shakes his head-- it couldn't be; but what else can he do?
text: ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the guards are fanning out and getting closer.
text: SCHUYLER reaches with one hand for his keys, fumbling for the small
text: gold key he received at the start of the game.
text: ON PANEL-- his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key... it
text: fits into the hole; he turns it and PUSHES THE BUTTON for 12.
text: WIDER-- as the DOORS CLOSE, both guards train their guns-- but too
text: late. Schuyler's on his way up.
text: 184A. THE GLASS ELEVATOR RISES through completely blackened spaces.
text: SCHUYLER stares at a BULLET HOLE in the back of the glass elevator,
text: a remnant of Feingold's murder. He holds the gun in front of
text: himself in both hands... then he closes his eyes, steeling himself,
text: almost in an attitude of prayer.
scene_heading: 185. I N T . A T R I U M - N I G H T
text: PITCH BLACK but for the LIT ELEVATOR ascending swiftly through the
text: darkness... Schuyler, like a solitary spaceship pilot, looks upward
text: toward his unknown destination.
scene_heading: 186. I N T . C R S E L E V A T O R - N I G H T
text: The DIGITAL READOUT slows as it comes to 10, 11 and STOPS at 12.
text: SCHUYLER comes out of his trance, slips the revolver back into his
text: jacket pocket, keeps a hand there, and stands against a wall of the
text: elevator as the DOORS OPEN ON--
scene_heading: 187. I N T . 1 2 T H F L O O R C O M M I S S A R Y - N I G H T
text: --A BUSTLING, NOISY COMMISSARY. Schuyler keeps the gun concealed
text: as he steps out of the elevator-- nobody here is paying any
text: attention to him anyway. There's a cafeteria style counter along
text: one wall, people CHATTING and LAUGHING at Formica tables... amongst
dialog: others, everyone from his game appears to be here... there's the
text: RASTA, the PARAMEDICS with the HEART ATTACK VICTIM, JOHN and PETE
text: from the men's club, the GIRL from the boat, the DESK CLERK and
text: BELLHOP... also the HONDURAN TRUCK DRIVER, the SECURITY PEOPLE from
text: his house, the PUNK and the TRANSIT COP... and a lot of ENGINEERS.
text: SCHUYLER inches into the room, meets the eyes of--
text: CHRISTINE, who's just come away from the cafeteria counter with a
text: tray of food. She nearly drops it, looks over her shoulder to see
text: if anyone is watching. Suddenly, Schuyler is in front of her,
text: backs her into an alcove-- she holds the tray between them as if to
dialog: protect herself.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What are you doing here?
text: For a moment, Schuyler's not sure. His voice is flat, monotonal:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I'm back from the dead.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Listen, everything's OK, nobody
dialog: touched your money, nobody stole a
dialog: thing, that's impossible--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I don't give a fuck about the money,
dialog: I wanna know who's behind this, who
dialog: did this to me, how, why--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: It's just a game!
text: Even though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the GLASS and
text: SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING. She starts to move toward a
text: table, he blocks her path.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You're not going anywhere.
dialog: Feingold, or or Fisher, was that
dialog: just a game too?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: I watched him die...
text: Schuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND. Christine looks utterly
text: perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Seemed like a nice guy, actually,
dialog: father of three--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Well, look, I'm sure it's just
dialog: another stunt-- that can't be
dialog: real, taste it.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You taste it, you fucking vampire.
text: He pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then
text: puts a finger to her ear as--
text: THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from
text: downstairs burst into the commissary.
text: Suddenly the ROOM QUIETS, many others are touching their ears.
text: They all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine. The gate
text: guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile.
speaker_heading: GATE GUARD
dialog: Could you come with us, please?
dialog: You're not authorized to be here.
text: Schuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his
text: GUN to her neck.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Back off. Everybody back off.
text: He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally
text: toward the nearest door, she CHOKES and GASPS.
scene_heading: 188. I N T . S T A I R W E L L - N I G H T
text: The door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead UP.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Shit, how do we get out--
text: Christine STOMPS his foot and ELBOWS his gut, breaks free and bolts
text: up the stairs. Schuyler catches his breath and pursues. Beneath
text: him, the stairwell door opens, GUARDS PURSUE.
scene_heading: 189. E X T . C R S R O O F - N I G H T
text: A HIGH LEDGE surrounds the roof on all four sides, a ROOF ENTRANCE
text: at each side as well. The NUMBER "636" is painted large for
text: helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc. A
text: MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed
text: by Schuyler. She spins, her back to the EDGE of the atrium, a
text: black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT, a
text: white RAILING around it.
text: Schuyler SLAMS the door, a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE.
text: He throws the HEAVY BOLT. He and Christine circle each other
text: warily, his gun trained on her. POUNDING from the other side,
text: MUFFLED VOICES that can't be heard.
text: For the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then
text: clutches the railing.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Wait a minute. What's that?
text: Schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child:
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: It's my gun...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: We didn't give it to you? Where did
dialog: it come from?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
text: A gun store.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: We searched your house!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Guess you fucked up again.
text: Christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her
text: hand to her mouth, speaks urgently.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
text: He's armed, he's got a real gun.
dialog: Real Situation, real--
text: Schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the EAR PIECE and
text: HAND MIKE away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Yeah, it's real all right.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Schuyler this is all fake, tricks,
dialog: it's all part of the game--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Stop it. Every word out of your
dialog: mouth is a lie--
text: Christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: The key!! They, we gave you a key
dialog: to the elevator! Why would we do
dialog: that?! We wanted you to come up--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Of course you did. So you could kill
dialog: me or, or frame me for murder--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: No, no, it's THE GAME!! Blanks,
text: squibs, high-tech special effects,
dialog: none of it's real! Just open that
dialog: door and I'll show you!
text: Schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
text: I open the door and I die.
text: ON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE, but the ALARM DROWNS out the
text: sounds of VOICES on the other side.
text: SCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him. He points
text: the gun at her again. He looks ready to use it. The following
text: DIALOG overlaps and collides, growing AURAL CHAOS--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You move again I swear I'll kill
dialog: you, you bitch.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: THINK ABOUT IT!! They followed you
dialog: every step of the way, the cab, in
dialog: the trunk, we had a diver--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: They? We?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: --the guy in Honduras, the cop on
dialog: the train, there was always a
dialog: safety net, always--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Shut up, shut the fuck up!!
text: AXES DENT the metal door, which BULGES.
text: He looks at the monitor in his hand, the one he tore from her body,
text: putting it in his own ear, letting the rest of the device dangle.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (filter)
dialog: --just hang in there, keep talking
dialog: him down, we're on our way--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: We've been trying to end it since
dialog: you got back, our people came to
dialog: your house, they tried to bring
dialog: you in from the subway, you kept
dialog: running, you weren't supposed to
dialog: keep getting lost--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You just said you wanted me to
dialog: come here-- you're making this up
dialog: as you go along!
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Please Sky, please. Take a breath
dialog: and think about it!
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Stop. Fucking. With my head!
text: Schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead, the gun TREMBLING
text: in his hand. Christine's regaining control. Schuyler's mind
text: whirls, he GROANS, almost crying as he considers for the first time
text: that she might be telling the truth. She steps closer.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: You're all right, it's OK, just relax...
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (filter)
dialog: Are you there? How's he doing?
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Please... when you open the door, the
text: game ends... just open the door... Bill
dialog: Fisher's out there, he's fine, nobody
dialog: got hurt. Why would we do the crazy
dialog: things we did, if it wasn't part of a
dialog: game? We thought you knew that...
text: He looks at her, almost ready to lower the gun. He raises his
text: bloody hand to his lips, about to taste it.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (filter)
dialog: --we're at the North entrance,
dialog: Number 2, just a few more seconds
dialog: and we'll nail him--
text: Schuyler's eyes dart toward--
text: ANOTHER DOORWAY, on the other side of the atrium, like the one
text: that's bolted. The number 2 is painted on it in RED. The handle
dialog: starts to TURN just as--
text: --CHRISTINE LUNGES AT HIM to wrest the gun away.
text: SCHUYLER comes to his senses, struggling. The GUN GOES OFF, the
dialog: report should be DEAFENING.
text: He spins, points the gun at Door #2 and FIRES again, several times.
scene_heading: THE ALARM STOPS-- SILENCE.
text: Christine STIFFENS, falls backwards onto the ground, clutching her
text: BLOOD-DRENCHED stomach. Schuyler just stares. Dark blood SPILLS
text: from her mouth as she CHOKES in pain...
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Oh God. I blew it... we blew it...
speaker_heading: DOOR #2 OPENS and--
text: DAVID steps through. He wears a brightly colored, silly looking
text: PARTY HAT, carries a magnum of CHAMPAGNE bearing a huge BOW that
text: reads, "SURPRISE." BLOOD PUMPS from HIS CHEST. He DROPS THE
text: BOTTLE, which SHATTERS... David collapses amidst the broken glass.
text: A BLOW OF THE AXE SEVERS the deadbolt and Door #1 flies open behind
text: Schuyler. FEINGOLD is the first of a group to come charging
text: through, he wears a TUXEDO with a ROSE in the lapel, holds the axe.
text: SCHUYLER spins, points the gun at this axe-wielding man, then,
text: utterly stunned, lowers it in disbelief.
text: FEINGOLD looks from Schuyler to the wounded Christine-- her agony
text: is painful to watch. He drops the axe with a CLATTER and runs to
text: her side, kneels. His voice CRACKS.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: You shot her!? No!
dialog: (looking toward David)
dialog: Qh God no...
text: THE GUARD and SECURITY MAN come out on the roof looking very
text: disturbed, followed by the RASTA and a few OTHERS. Many are
text: dressed for a party now. Feingold looks to their horrified faces.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: He fucking shot them!!
speaker_heading: RASTA
dialog: I'll call an ambulance.
text: The Rasta dashes downstairs. Schuyler backs away, drops the gun,
text: staggers over to David. He's GASPING for breath. CRS EMPLOYEES
text: give the brothers a wide berth, move toward Feingold and Christine.
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: David, David, no, no--
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, I
dialog: don't wanna die, I don't wanna--
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: You're not gonna die. I'm here,
dialog: you're not gonna die...
text: David's already DEAD, eyes wide, body limp.
text: WITH FEINGOLD and CHRISTINE. He holds his colorful cummerbund over
text: her stomach to staunch the bleeding. She CHOKES in pain.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Hang on, just hang on, you're
dialog: gonna make it--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: That stupid...
text: They stare over at Schuyler, registering David's death. Schuyler
text: is now drenched in his brother's blood, rocking him in his arms.
text: Most of the assorted CRS people move to get out of the building
text: before the cops show, MURMURING amongst themselves in fear.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Oh God. I thought you could
dialog: handle it. All the tests... they
dialog: said you could handle it...
text: CHRISTINE yells at Schuyler, unable to stand--
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: You fucking psycho, you piece of
dialog: shit, how could you--
text: SCHUYLER gently lowers his brother and rises, like a zombie now.
text: The big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it,
text: keeping it out of his reach.
text: Schuyler backs away from the body, starts to SHAKE, looks as if he
text: really has lost his mind. Feingold SOBS aloud.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: God, why-- there was no point. It was
dialog: supposed to be fun...
text: Schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded Christine-- who
text: GASPS silent curses, beyond speech-- to David's body...
text: He slowly turns to the Atrium pit directly in front of him. He's
dialog: strangely calm...
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: Fun...
dialog: SHIFT TO SLOW MOTION:
text: SCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit...
text: THE OTHERS react in HORROR, SHOUT "NO!!", lunging TOWARD HIM...
text: DAVID'S HEAD suddenly MOVES, he BLINKS...
text: SCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit.
text: CHRISTINE jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended,
dialog: SCREAMING, just as--
text: SCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE, and--
text: DAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: SKY, NOOOO!!
dialog: SCHUYLER sees this, too late--
text: HE AND DAVID make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void,
text: arms outstretched. Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable
text: error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an
text: agonizing MOMENT.
text: THEN HE FALLS... LEAVE SLOW MOTION.
scene_heading: 190. I N T . A T R I U M - N I G H T
text: SCHUYLER CRASHES through the skylight, TUMBLING-- SPARKLING SHARDS
text: surround him like stars as he PLUNGES, SPINS, SCREAMING.
text: 191. RAPID CUTS-- the CLOWN, CHRISTINE's face, SCHUYLER and DAVID
text: as CHILDREN, HIS FATHER's head striking the landing. These FLASH
text: PAST so rapidly we can't quite process them.
text: 192. INTERCUT WITH: INCREASING DARKNESS, GROUND RUSHING CLOSER...
text: ON SCHUYLER'S FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes before
text: the end. BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him, his
text: eyes roll into his head, closing--
text: ANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real, they've COME ON to show--
text: SCHUYLER'S IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back, arms outstretched, eyes
dialog: squeezed shut--
text: --and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION that
text: covers the floor of the atrium.
text: SCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a
text: rest, harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him.
text: He doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed.
text: CLOSER ON HIS FACE... muscles twitch. His eyes open.
text: HIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the
text: building around the atrium. THE FULL MOON in the very center
text: through the hole in the glass.
text: All the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH, packed with people.
text: SCHUYLER stares upward, mouth open, motionless.
text: DAVID comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and
text: bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Hey, bro, how you doin'?
text: Getting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Admit it, you weren't bored...
text: SCHUYLER remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and
text: starts shaking him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Jesus. Sky, c'mon Sky--
text: SCHUYLER begins to LAUGH, a tremendous catharsis. DAVID laughs
text: too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet.
text: THE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING
text: surface, LAUGHING. CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the cushion,
text: CHEERING and APPLAUDING.
text: SCHUYLER wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement. Then he
text: hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw, sending him flying onto his
text: back on the cushion. MORE CHEERS from the crowd, as if they were
text: watching a boxing match.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 193. I N T . C R S L O B B Y - N I G H T
text: THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS from Handel's "Messiah" plays. SCHUYLER and
text: DAVID enter together from the atrium, the CUSHION deflates behind
text: them. David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: You've been wanting to do that for
dialog: a long, long time, haven't you?
text: Schuyler half-smiles. The SECURITY MAN unlocks Schuyler's
text: handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Like they'd really leave a loaded gun
text: lying around. They went over the
dialog: whole place with a metal detector,
text: then packed that thing with blanks.
text: They turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets
text: the gun, looks up in wonder...
scene_heading: SCHUYLER'S POV-- a SURPRISE PARTY: A STEREO, STREAMERS and
scene_heading: BALLOONS, a CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN, CAKE and FOOD. CRS EMPLOYEES
text: (mostly ordinary-looking office workers) CLAP and CHEER for
text: Schuyler. They wear PARTY HATS, blow PLASTIC HORNS.
text: SMILING PEOPLE eager to offer CONGRATULATIONS surround him. He's
text: pretty shaky, like a newborn calf. JOHN and PETE shake his hand.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Good one, buddy, really had you
dialog: going, didn't we?
speaker_heading: PETE
dialog: Wait'll you try level two...
dialog: (a wink)
dialog: Joke.
text: The RASTA SLAPS his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his
text: shoulder for a gag message.
speaker_heading: RASTA
dialog: That look on your face up there?
dialog: Shit, man, I almost lost it.
text: The RECEPTIONIST POPS a bottle of Dom Perignon, hands it to Sky.
speaker_heading: RECEPTIONIST
dialog: Awesome game-- best I've seen.
text: Not knowing what else to do, Schuyler takes a slug. The GIRL from
text: the boat KISSES his cheek. TECHNICIANS, men with STUNTS UNLIMITED
text: T-SHIRTS, the NURSE from the asylum, the SECURITY PEOPLE, CRS
dialog: GUARDS, AGENTS, all want a piece of him at once.
text: The "MESSIAH" FADES and an R &amp; B BAND breaks into ROUSING MUSIC as
text: Feingold approaches and sticks a CIGAR in his mouth, LIGHTS it.
speaker_heading: FEINGOLD
dialog: Sure glad you jumped, compadre.
dialog: Otherwise I was supposed to throw
dialog: you off.
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: It's not strictly legal, so don't
dialog: tell anyone...
dialog: (a beat, off Schuyler's look)
dialog: The cigar. It's a Monte Cristo,
dialog: straight from Havana.
text: Christine approaches, wobbly and dazed herself; she touches his
text: arm. Her voice is soft for the first time, accents gone.
speaker_heading: CHRISTINE
dialog: Hey... you all right?
speaker_heading: SCHUYLER
dialog: (nods slowly)
dialog: I think so. You?
