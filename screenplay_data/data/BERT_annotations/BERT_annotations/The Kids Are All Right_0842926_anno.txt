speaker_heading: FADE UP ON:
dialog: 1 1
text: The humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer's
text: day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver,
text: dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways.
text: On a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic-
text: looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his
dialog: friend, CLAY (15).
text: Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of
text: charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and
text: drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house.
scene_heading: INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 2 2
text: They walk inside. We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another
dialog: room.
scene_heading: INT. CLAY'S, BATHROOM - LATER
dialog: 3 3
text: Clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to
text: powder. Laser watches.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I don't know, dude.
text: Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: B minus in geometry, yo! This
dialog: shits the bomb!
text: Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort. Then hands
text: the rolled up bill to Laser.
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Add it up, son.
text: Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.
scene_heading: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - GIRL'S BEDROOM - DAY
dialog: 4 4
text: Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning
text: against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room.
text: She pours over a game of Scrabble.
text: Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18).
text: Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE.
dialog: 2.
text: Joni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her,
text: calculating his next Scrabble move.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Oh my God, Joni, there are so many
dialog: hotties in your class. You are so
dialog: gonna hook up the first week.
speaker_heading: JAI
dialog: Just cause you're a 24 hour drive-
dialog: thru doesn't mean everyone else has
dialog: to be...
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Hey, she worked her ass off! She
dialog: deserves some hot jock sausage!
text: Jai looks repulsed, and hurt.
speaker_heading: SASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: (flip)
dialog: Whatever. Why don't you guys just
dialog: do it and get it over with?
text: Joni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their
dialog: crush on each other.
speaker_heading: SASHA (CONT'D)
dialog: What? I'm just asking.
speaker_heading: JAI
dialog: Uh, maybe because we're friends...
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Oh, really...?
text: Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.
scene_heading: INT. CLAY'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER
dialog: 5 5
text: Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches
text: a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad
text: looks back, menacing.
speaker_heading: CLAY'S FATHER
dialog: Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch.
text: The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. Again, they
text: knock into the couch. Clay's dad spins around, pissed.
speaker_heading: CLAY'S FATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What did I just say?!
dialog: 3.
text: The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the
text: couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face
text: into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the
text: brutal play. Clay laughs manically.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Let me go!
speaker_heading: CLAY'S FATHER
dialog: Don't do the crime if you can't do
dialog: the time.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Dad, your pits smell like burnt
dialog: ass! Get off me!
text: As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son,
text: we note a trace of longing on his face.

speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: What?! I'm not doing anything.
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MAGIC HOUR

scene_heading: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING
dialog: 10 10
text: Nic enters. Drops her bag and heads for the table.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Hi guys. Sorry I'm late.
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Don't worry. We just started.
speaker_heading: NIC
text: 27 fibroids. All in the lining.
text: She kisses Jules.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Honey, that's disgusting. We're
dialog: eating.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Did you do that laparoscopically?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: That's right, Smart Girl. And we
dialog: got `em all.
text: As Nic settles in...
speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, whose truck is that?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Mine.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Yours?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: For the business.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: What business?..
dialog: (getting edgy)
dialog: The gardening?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: (protective)
dialog: Isn't it landscaping.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yes, thank you very much.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (strained)
dialog: Okay...
dialog: (then)
dialog: Do we have any Cabarnet left?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I didn't look, honey.
dialog: 5.
text: Nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine. Laser's cell
text: phone RINGS. He answers it.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Hey, what's up?
text: Jules puts her hand on Laser's arm.
speaker_heading: JULES
text: Laser, no phone calls at the table.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Lemme hit you back.
text: Laser hangs up. Nic re-enters with a large glass of red.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (sitting down)
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Nobody. Clay.
text: Jules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal
text: windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Can I ask you something?
dialog: What do you get from your
dialog: relationship with Clay?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: What do you mean, "get"?
text: Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Do you feel like he's the kind of
dialog: person who will help you grow?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Mom, you're windshield wiping me.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Hey, did you start on those thank-
dialog: you notes for your birthday gifts?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Not yet. But I will...
dialog: 6.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: I just think it's easier to knock
dialog: them out when it's fresh.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Great...I mean, you don't want to
dialog: have to start with an apology. You
dialog: know? Then it's embarrassing.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Okay, honey. She got it. Let it
dialog: go.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Okay, I'll let it go...
dialog: (then)
dialog: I mean, if it was up to you, our
dialog: kids wouldn't even write thank-you
dialog: notes, they'd just send out good
dialog: vibes.
text: Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through
text: increasingly plum-stained teeth.
speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)
dialog: I can't believe my baby's 18.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (devolving into baby talk)
dialog: Big girl. You're a big girl...
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Mom...
text: Joni mimes wiping her teeth. Embarrassed, Nic starts licking
text: at her stained teeth.
scene_heading: INT. JONI'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 11 11
text: As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: What?
text: Laser looks nervous.
dialog: 7.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Have you thought any more about,
dialog: you know, making that call...?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Yeah. I don't want to.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Okay...I was just wondering if you
dialog: changed your mind.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I haven't.
text: He starts to leave, but her answer bugs him. He turns back.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: How can you not even be curious?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Sorry, Laser. I just don't want
dialog: to, okay? I'm leaving soon and I
dialog: don't want to deal with that right
dialog: now.
dialog: (co-dependent leak)
dialog: And also, that could really hurt
dialog: moms' feelings...
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: God, why do you worry about them so
dialog: much? They don't even have to know
dialog: about it!
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Look, you can do it when you turn
dialog: 18, okay?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I never ask you for anything.
text: Laser walks out of the room. Joni feels horrible.
scene_heading: INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT
dialog: 12 12
text: Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: I just don't understand why you
dialog: bought the truck now.
dialog: 8.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Because if I'm starting this
dialog: business I need something to haul
dialog: my equipment in.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Okay. It just seems a little
text: cart before the horse.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Sweetie, you don't even have any
dialog: clients yet.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well you're the one who's always
dialog: telling me to "act as if!"
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (back peddling)
dialog: That's true. I do. You're right.
text: The women settle back. Nic sees Jules feels bad.
speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, I'm sorry. It's good you
dialog: bought the truck. Its proactive.
text: Nic caresses Jules' arm, wanting to make it better.
speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey...
text: Jules doesn't look at Nic. She keeps her eyes on the T.V.
speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Wanna watch a movie?
text: Jules perks up. Nic immediately regrets her suggestion.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: A movie-movie?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Yeah. We haven't done that in a
dialog: while.
scene_heading: MINUTES LATER -- NIC AND JULES
text: are cozied up side-by-side facing the TV.
dialog: 9.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON - THE TV
text: The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise
text: longue. One guy fellating the other.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE - SAME
dialog: 13 13
text: Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the
text: mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a
text: drawer. She rummages though with clear intention.
text: She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover. We see the
dialog: words: "Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life."
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 14 14
scene_heading: ANGLE ON - THE BED
text: We now only see Nic. Jules has slipped under the blanket,
text: and is now between Nic's legs. We see Nic trying to get into
text: it, but having a hard time.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: I don't like the guys in this one.
dialog: They're too shaved.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Don't focus on it.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: How about the one with the biker
dialog: gang?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We left it in Hawaii.
text: Jules wrestles with the blankets. Wants them out of her way.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (pulling them back up)
dialog: I'm cold, honey.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Sorry. I couldn't breathe.
text: Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.
text: The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top
text: sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME
text: CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full
dialog: volume.
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MAN IN MOVIE
dialog: Suck that fat cock mother-fucker...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Shit!! Where's the remote?!
speaker_heading: MAN IN MOVIE
dialog: I'm gonna fuck that tight ass!...
text: Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the
text: mass of bedding. They struggle to find it as the grunting
text: and 70's disco music blares.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - JONI
dialog: 15 15
text: Joni turns to the wall, confused. She hears the porno music
dialog: pulsing though.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 16 16
text: Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Jesus Christ!
text: Nic flops back, traumatized.
speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)
dialog: The whole neighborhood heard that!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No, they didn't.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Well, that was a vibe kill.
text: Jules looks defeated.
scene_heading: INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 17 17
text: Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though
text: some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4

text: camera with a big, open grin.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: EXT. FARM - DAY
dialog: 18 18
text: We see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes
text: and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni
dialog: and Laser's biological father.
scene_heading: INT. PAUL'S RESTAURANT - "WYSIWYG" - DAY
dialog: 19 19
text: Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches
text: TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: How you doing, foxy?
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh, sorry...
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: No, I like it. It's earthy.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What can I say. I've just been out
dialog: there, you know...hoe-ing.
dialog: (looking at the seating
dialog: chart)
dialog: How's it looking tonight?
text: They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Gonna be tight.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Really...
text: Paul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads
text: for the kitchen, answering.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Hi, is this Paul Hatfield?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It is. Who's this?
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: My name is Wendy Minter. I'm
text: calling from The Pacific Cryobank.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay. What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: I just need to confirm that you
dialog: donated sperm with us between 1991
dialog: and 1993.
text: At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah...I did a little bit of that
dialog: back then...
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
dialog: 20 20
text: Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for
text: the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: As you know the Cryobank has a
dialog: confidentiality policy which
dialog: prohibits us from releasing your
dialog: identity without your consent.
text: A cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him. Paul nods:
text: "Can't talk." Hands her the box of tomatoes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Uh-huh.
text: Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.
scene_heading: INT. PANTRY - SAME
dialog: 21 21
text: Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.
speaker_heading: WENDY (O.S.)
dialog: Well we've been contacted by a
dialog: young woman conceived using your
dialog: semen, and she's asked if you'd be
text: open to having contact with her.
text: Paul's speechless.
speaker_heading: OMITTED

scene_heading: LATER THAT NIGHT
dialog: 23 23
text: Paul gets dressed while Tanya lays on her messy bed.
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: You must of figured you'd get a
dialog: call at some point.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Not really. I mean I was 19 when I
dialog: did it. It was so long ago...I
dialog: just figured no one actually used
dialog: my stuff.
text: Tanya moves closer to him, flirty.
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Why? I'd use it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (ignoring the innuendo)
dialog: This is so weird. I mean, a part
dialog: of me's really curious...
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: So what are you gonna do?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know.
scene_heading: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM
dialog: 24 24
text: Joni and Jules play scrabble at the table. Joni's cell
text: rings. She grabs it off the counter and answers.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
dialog: 25 25
text: Paul anxiously paces his overgrown back-yard on his cell
text: phone. He picks weeds as he talks. Conversation intercut.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hi, I'm looking for Joni Allgood.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: This is she...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hi. This is Paul...
dialog: (clearing his throat)
dialog: Uh, your donor...?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Oh! Hi...
text: Joni shoots up out of her chair and starts leaving the room
dialog: to get some privacy away from her mom.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Is this a good time to talk?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Where are you going? It's your
dialog: turn.
text: Joni doesn't answer. She just walks out to her backyard.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So...
dialog: (doesn't know what to say)
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I'm good. How are you?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm well, thanks.
text: Banal, awkward pause. Paul jumps in to fill the void.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: So, Wendy at the Cryobank said you
dialog: call--
text: Joni cuts in, nervous and businesslike.
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Actually, my brother asked if I'd
dialog: call you because I'm 18 and he's
dialog: only 15 which is too young to call--
dialog: anyway, he'd like to meet you...if
dialog: you want to...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (thrown)
dialog: Your brother?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Yeah. Well, technically my half-
dialog: brother. Each of my moms had a
dialog: kid, you know, with your sperm...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. I didn't know.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Both of them?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Like in two?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Uh huh. Like in gay.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Good deal. I love lesbians.
text: Paul cringes at his lameness. Joni doesn't know what to say.
speaker_heading: OMITTED.
dialog: 26 26
scene_heading: EXT. "WYSIWYG", PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY
dialog: 27 27
text: Joni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant
text: to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I just don't want you to have big
dialog: expectations.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Will you quit saying that? I don't
dialog: have any expectations.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Okay. I'm just saying he
dialog: might be weird. I mean, he donated
dialog: sperm...
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Well if he hadn't done it, you
dialog: wouldn't be here. So respect, yo!
scene_heading: INT. "WYSIWYG" - DAY
dialog: 28 28
text: Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance. He nervously
text: checks the door as customers enter.
scene_heading: MINUTES LATER-
text: Joni and Laser enter the restaurant. They look nervous too.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON PAUL
text: He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around.
text: Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction,
text: spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over.
text: The moment is rife. Paul holds out his hand to Joni.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Joni. Hey. Nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Nice to meet you too.
text: Paul holds out a hand to Laser.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: And Laser, right?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Very cool name.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Thanks for making the trek all the
dialog: way over here.
dialog: No one knows what comes next.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Cool, I got a table set up for us
dialog: out here...
text: Paul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area.
scene_heading: EXT. OUTDOOR DINING AREA - MINUTES LATER
dialog: 29 29
text: They all sit eating. Paul can't help but study their faces.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Listen, feel free and ask me
dialog: anything you want, okay?
dialog: (off their stares)
dialog: Or we can just hang out. That's
dialog: fine too. Whatever you guys want.
speaker_heading: LASER/JONI
dialog: Okay.
text: Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Anything you want to ask me, Laser?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I...uh...I didn't really have any
dialog: specific questions...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (helping him out)
dialog: That's fine. I'd love to know
dialog: about you guys. What about you,
dialog: Joni? What are you up to?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Uh, well, I just graduated high
dialog: school. I'm starting college in
dialog: the fall.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh yeah? Congratulations.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Joni's the brains in the family.
dialog: She won a National Merit
dialog: Scholarship.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Shut the front door!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Yeah. And she got like an 800 on
text: her Verbal SAT.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Okay, Laser...
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: What? I'm just saying you're
dialog: really smart.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: No, I just work harder than you.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Don't stress it, Laze. School
dialog: wasn't my thing either and I turned
dialog: out okay.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: (re: his name)
dialog: Laser.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I'm sorry. Laser.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So tell me about you, Laser. What
dialog: are you into?
text: Laser freezes. So his sister jumps in.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Laser's an amazing athlete.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh yeah?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Did you play any sports in school?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I played a little basketball in
dialog: junior high.
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Pretty much. The whole "team"
dialog: thing got on my nerves, you know
dialog: like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass,
dialog: man!" What about you?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I play some Soccer. Basketball.
dialog: Baseball. You know, team sports.
text: Paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in
dialog: general. Teams are great. I'm
dialog: just weird like that.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Yeah, I like teams.
text: We can tell Laser is growing frustrated at his inability to
text: connect with Paul. Joni jumps in.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: So this is your place?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, I've been working on it for a
dialog: while. I also have this organic co-
dialog: op farm down the road. We use a
dialog: lot of the stuff we grow there for
dialog: the restaurant.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: (excited)
dialog: That's so cool. I'm totally into
dialog: local.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: (busting her)
dialog: You are?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like
dialog: trying to get moms to buy local for
dialog: forever.
text: Laser tries again to reconnect.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: So, like, do you raise pigs and
dialog: stuff?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No. No pigs...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But it's a great spot. You guys
dialog: should come check it out sometime.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Yeah...Definitely...
text: Excited, Joni turns to Laser. He seems uninterested.
scene_heading: EXT. WYSIWYG, PARKING LOT - DAY
dialog: 30 30
text: The kids and Paul exit the restaurant. Paul walks to a
text: classic BMW motorcycle. Lasers tries to hide his awe.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Is that yours?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah. You like motorcycles?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Yeah, but...our moms are kind of
dialog: anti-motorcycle.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: And by "kind of" he means they'd
dialog: kill us if we ever rode one.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's too bad. They're fun.
text: Time to say goodbye. Again, no one knows the protocol here.
text: After an awkward beat, Paul holds out his arms for hugs.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Really nice to meet you, Laser.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I just never pictured him that way.
dialog: I just...I don't know...He was so
dialog: cool and interesting. I can't
dialog: believe that was him...He was so
dialog: nice, you know?...
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I guess...
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: You guess?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Yeah...
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: God, Laser! You're the one that
dialog: wanted to meet him so bad!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Well what did you think of him?
speaker_heading: LASER

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Hey bug, come here. We're watching
dialog: "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda."
speaker_heading: LASER
text: I saw it. It was gnarly.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Clay's.
text: Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Don't be back late, okay?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Can I have a hug before you go?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Mom...
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Just a quick one. Please!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Hug her. That's what she's there
dialog: for.
text: Laser leaves. Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him
dialog: down and ask him already.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What? "Are you and Clay fucking?"
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: "Exploring" is the word I'd use...
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: And what if he is "exploring?"
dialog: This is the age for that. Why
dialog: should we care?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: We shouldn't...
dialog: (then)
dialog: I just don't understand why he's
dialog: exploring with that loser.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Look, we don't even know what the
dialog: deal is. We're jumping to
dialog: conclusions.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: I feel like he has so much
dialog: potential and he's just wasting it.
text: Nic's comment hits a nerve in Jules.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: What are you trying to say?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: What do you mean, what am I trying
dialog: to say?
speaker_heading: JULES
text: It feels like there's some subtext
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I don't know: Like mother like son?
dialog: Is that it? Both of us aimless,
dialog: wandering in the darkness, "wasting
dialog: our potential?"
dialog: Nic won't go there.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Okay, honey, you're on a whole
dialog: other tangent and I have no idea
dialog: what you're talking about.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the
dialog: plane of consciousness for you yet.

speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Yeah. Maybe not.

speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: So what were they like?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sweet. They were really good kids.
dialog: The boy's kind of a sensitive jock
dialog: and the girl's kind of innocent but
dialog: whip-smart and super cute.
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Sounds like you connected.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, we kinda did.
speaker_heading: TANYA
dialog: Where'd you leave it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: We didn't really leave it anywhere.
text: Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a

speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Hey Paul.
text: Paul leans over the basket.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Whatcha got? Oh cool. First
dialog: strawberries of the season.
speaker_heading: BROOKE
dialog: Don't they look awesome? I thought
dialog: you should have the first taste.
text: And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.

speaker_heading: LASER

speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Hold up.

speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa!
text: Clay turns on the dildo. It starts to gyrate.
speaker_heading: CLAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Yo, it's alive!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Dude, put it back!!

speaker_heading: JULES

scene_heading: INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING
dialog: 41 41
text: We enter a family conference already in progress.
text: Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their

speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Laser, your mom and I accept you
dialog: and love you unconditionally? You
dialog: know that, right?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: And you know you can be open with
dialog: us about anything.
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Yeah, I know.
text: Jules steels herself for a frank discussion.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Laser, is there anything you want
dialog: to talk about?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Like what?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Anything. Anything on your mind.
text: Laser cracks his knuckles.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Well there is something.
text: Nic and Jules share a look. "Here we go."
speaker_heading: LASER (CONT'D)
dialog: It's more of a question, really.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: That's okay.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: We won't judge you.
text: Laser looks at his moms. Nic and Jules brace themselves.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Why do you guys watch gay man-porn?
text: Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Well, first I have to say we rarely
dialog: watch that movie--
text: Jules touches Nic's arm.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Honey...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: And secondly, I really don't
dialog: appreciate you snooping around our
dialog: room. Was that Clay's idea? I
dialog: have to say again, I don't like
dialog: him. He seems untended...!
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Honey, that's not what he asked--
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (snapping)
dialog: Fine. Do you want to answer his
dialog: question?!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, sweetie, human sexuality is
dialog: complicated. And sometimes,
dialog: people's desires can be...counter-
dialog: intuitive...
dialog: (soldiering on)
dialog: For instance, since women's sexual
dialog: responsiveness is mostly internal,
dialog: sometimes it's exciting for us to
dialog: see sexual responsiveness more, you
dialog: know...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: ...externalized.
text: Laser looks at them, still baffled.
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: Like with a penis.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: But like, wouldn't you rather watch
dialog: two women doing it?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You would think that. But in most
dialog: of those movies, they've hired two
dialog: straight women to pretend and the
dialog: inauthenticity is just unbeara--
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Okay, that's enough! Laser, your
dialog: mom and I have a sense there's some
dialog: other stuff going on in your life
dialog: and we just want to be let in.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Are you having a relationship with
dialog: someone?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: You could tell us, honey. We'd
dialog: understand and support you.
dialog: 29.
text: Laser looks confused. How did they find out about Paul?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I just met him once.
text: Nic and Jules share a worried look.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: What do you mean once?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Did he find you on-line?!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Who did you meet once?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Paul! I met him with Joni.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Who's Paul?!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Why was Joni there?!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: She set it up.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Forget the set-up! Who is Paul?!!
speaker_heading: LASER

speaker_heading: JULES

dialog: be curious about your biological
dialog: father. That's totally natural.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: But why didn't you tell us?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Because we knew you'd be upset.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: WE'RE NOT UPSET!!
text: Jules calms her riled-up partner.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Honey...
dialog: (to Joni; expressing her
dialog: upset more calmly)
dialog: We just wish you'd have included us
dialog: in your thinking. But what's done
dialog: is done. You met him, and now you
dialog: guys can move on--
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: (sheepish)
dialog: Actually...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want to see him again.
speaker_heading: JULES LASER
dialog: You do?! You do?!
speaker_heading: JONI (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Laser)
dialog: Yeah. I was gonna tell you.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Whoa! Whoa! No. No way.

speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Yeah, I get it. He's their
dialog: biological father and all that crap
dialog: but it still feels really shitty.
dialog: Like we're not enough or something,
dialog: you know?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Of course I know. I don't want to
dialog: time-share our kids with someone.
dialog: Especially when it's Joni's last
dialog: summer home. No way.
text: When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I know...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Let's just kill him with kindness
dialog: and put it to bed.
speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hi, great to meet you two.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I hope the traffic wasn't too bad.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, I've got my bike so...I just
text: sort of weave through.
text: Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Great. Well, come on in.
text: As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This is for you. I don't know if
dialog: you guys like wine...
text: Nic takes it.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Are you kidding? We love it.
dialog: (checking the label)
dialog: And a Petit Syrah. What a treat!
dialog: Let me get some glasses.
text: Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules. Little silence.
text: Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity.
dialog: 33.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Beautiful house. How long you guys
dialog: lived here?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Almost ten years. Wait, has it
dialog: been that long?
dialog: (rambling nervously)
dialog: We moved right after Laser broke
dialog: his leg, I remember that because we
dialog: had a ramp for a while, so that
dialog: would have been...ten, no, nine?
dialog: No, ten years this fall.
text: Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay.

scene_heading: THE KITCHEN --
text: Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (not okay)
dialog: Yeah. Fine.
text: Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest.
speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: NIC

dialog: managing...

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: The food's great. Can't go wrong
dialog: with salmon and corn.
text: Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: So Paul, did you always know you
dialog: wanted to be in food-services
dialog: industry?
text: Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, I always liked food.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: No, I was asking because I remember
dialog: reading in your file, back when we
dialog: were looking for, you know, sperm,
dialog: anyway, you said you were studying
dialog: international relations.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time
dialog: ago. Yeah, I was considering it,
dialog: but then I dropped out of school.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: You dropped out of college?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Yeah, it wasn't my thing.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (squinching)
dialog: No? Why's that?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It just seemed like a massive waste
dialog: of money after a while. I mean, I
dialog: wasn't "doing" anything. I was
dialog: just sitting on my ass listening to
dialog: people spout off ideas I could've
dialog: just as easily learned reading a
dialog: book.
text: Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I'm not saying higher learning
dialog: uniformly sucks. I mean, college
dialog: is great for some people.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Joni, I'm sure you're gonna love
dialog: it. That's just me. I'm just
dialog: weird that way.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Which is probably why I ended up in
dialog: the food-services industry.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: See what he did there, mom? You
dialog: said "food-services industry," then
dialog: he said "food-services industry..."
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Yeah, I got it, Laser. Thanks.
dialog: (apropos of nothing)
dialog: So, Paul, what about your social
dialog: life?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: My social life?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: You know, are you married,
dialog: divorced, seeing anyone?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Mom!
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: What? We're getting to know Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, never been married or divorced.
dialog: I date a little, but I'm just kind
dialog: of focused on my work right now.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Oh.
text: Paul wants a break from the heat.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So, how'd you guys meet?
text: Jules smiles, embarrassed. Nic jumps in.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: We met at UCLA. I was a resident
text: in the ER and Jules had an
dialog: emergency.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: My tongue went numb.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Really?
text: THUD! We turn to see Laser, pounding his head on the table.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Laser, that's not nice.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: What's not nice is subjecting your
dialog: kids to the same story 1000 times!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (ignoring Laser)
dialog: What happened to your tongue?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I don't know. I just lost all the
dialog: feeling in my face and tongue and I
dialog: thought I might gag and then, you
dialog: know...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Choke? Die?...
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yeah...exactly...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Well it was pretty clear to me she
dialog: was just having an anxiety attack
dialog: and she'd be fine.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So what'd you do for her?
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get
dialog: her to relax, talk, move her tongue
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Mom, that's gross!
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (ignoring Laser, to Nic)
dialog: Actually, she started teasing me
dialog: and that really helped.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: I was trying to distract you.
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I know. And it worked. You were
dialog: really funny.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: You were really pretty.
text: Nic reaches over and caresses Jules' hand. Joni rolls her
text: eyes, embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: So that's it. My tongue started
dialog: working again.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: And we've been glued at the hip
dialog: ever since.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's a great story.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (beaming)
dialog: We like it.
text: Laser and Joni share a look.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: So Nic, I know you're a doctor.
dialog: How `bout you, Jules? What do you
dialog: do?
dialog: Jules never likes this question.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Well, I, you know, I studied
dialog: architecture in college...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right...
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: But I'm not an architect. I mean I
dialog: was on my way to becoming one. But
dialog: I quit before the kids were born.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, that happens...
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: When they got a little older, I
dialog: started a Balinese furniture import
dialog: business...
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Right on.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yeah. But that didn't work out.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, business aren't easy--
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Actually, I'm in the process of
dialog: starting a new business.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Good for you. What kind?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Landscape design...
dialog: (before he can respond)
dialog: But not like a gardener! I mean,
dialog: yes, there's a gardening component
dialog: to it, but the real work is to
dialog: create unique, eco-friendly outdoor
dialog: spaces that harmonize with the
dialog: surrounding environment. Do you
dialog: know what I mean?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Absolutely.
text: In Nic's mind, Jules is drowning in verbiage. So she jumps
dialog: in to save her.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Hey Paul, did Joni tell you about
dialog: her graduation speech?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, she didn't.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: It was incredible. So full of
dialog: wisdom and hope...
dialog: (turning to her Joni)
dialog: Hon, go get it. I'm sure he'd love
dialog: to hear it...
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: (blushing)
dialog: No, mom, I'm sure he wouldn't...
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Sure he would. Come on. Go get
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: (getting upset)
dialog: No, it's okay...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: I'm not embarrassed! Jesus! Give
dialog: it a rest already!
text: This outburst stuns Nic into silence. Her daughter has never
text: spoken to her like this. Laser stands up.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I'll get the ice-cream.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: (standing up)
dialog: I'll help you.
text: Joni and Laser leave the room. Nic pours herself the last of
text: Paul's Petit Syrah. Jules smiles, covering her anxiety.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Honey, that's your forth glass.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Actually, it's my third. But
dialog: thanks for counting.
text: Paul turns to Jules, trying to revive the mood.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Hey, I was just thinking. You
dialog: know, I bought this place last year
dialog: and the backyard's a wreck. Would
dialog: you be interested in working on it?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (insecure)
dialog: Oh, that's okay.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, seriously. I don't have time
dialog: to work on it myself.
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Thank you. That's really sweet.
dialog: Why don't you think about it.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why? I just did.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I mean, if you're not up for it
dialog: that's okay--
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (jumping on it)
dialog: No! I am!
dialog: (getting excited)
dialog: I'm up for it!...

speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: ...I'm just saying, the plan was to
dialog: limit his involvement--
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: You're unbelievable. You're all
dialog: over me about getting clients, I
dialog: finally get one and you're--
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: He's not just a client, Jules.
dialog: ,
dialog: He's our sperm donor! Have you
dialog: ever heard the phrase "Don't Shit
dialog: Where You Eat?"
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yes, and I think it's disgusting.
text: The two separate, go down separate isles. When they rejoin,
text: Nic is contrite.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: I'm sorry. He just seemed sort
dialog: of...self-satisfied to me.
dialog: 41.
text: Jules grabs the olive branch.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yeah, he was working the whole
dialog: "alternative" thing pretty hard.
speaker_heading: NIC

scene_heading: EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
dialog: 52 52
text: Jules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: ...We could do a kind of a Secret
dialog: Garden thing with trellises and
dialog: topiary...
dialog: (clocking his face)
dialog: ...or something more Asian,
text: minimal, with a rock garden feel.
dialog: It's up to you...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Personally, I'm tired of minimal.
dialog: I'm into more is more. Let's not
dialog: try to tame the space. I think it
dialog: would look great all lush and
text: overgrown and fecund...
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Fecund?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: I'm sorry, you know, fertile...
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, I love that word. You just
dialog: don't hear it that often.
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: More is more. Yeah. Let's do that.
text: Jules is staring at Paul.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Sorry, I just keep seeing my kids
dialog: in your expressions...
text: Jules looks more intensely at Paul's face.
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: You and Laser have the same mouth.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: You think so?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yeah.
text: The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind

speaker_heading: NIC

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: 20-3...match point.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: So how'd it go today?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Great. We settled on a concept.
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: It's hard to explain. You have to
dialog: kind of see the space to get it.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (to Laser)
dialog: Laser, did you write Pup-pup a Get
dialog: Well card?
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: Laser! What do I have to do?! I
dialog: bought you a card. I left it on
dialog: your desk. All you had to do was--
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Mom, settle! I will...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Don't tell me to settle, mister.
dialog: And if it's not in the mail by
dialog: tomorrow morning, we're not going
text: to the Dodger game Saturday.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Whatever, I have other plans
dialog: anyway.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: What other plans?
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: I'm asking you a quest--
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I said I'd do something with Paul!
text: Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He

speaker_heading: NIC

scene_heading: EXT. ALLEY - DAY
dialog: 54 54
text: We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something. Laser
text: is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: This may not be a good idea.
dialog: 44.
speaker_heading: CLAY (O.S.)
dialog: Are you filming?!
text: We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall.
text: He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land
text: his board on the ground.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (to Laser)
dialog: He's not gonna make it.
dialog: (calling to Clay)
dialog: Clay, you're not gonna make it!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I think he may be right, dude.
dialog: Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Will you quit being a man-gina and
dialog: run the camera! I'm only doing
dialog: this once so keep my shit in frame!
text: Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser,
text: wondering why he puts up with this guy.
text: VIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up with
text: an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally, he
text: starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air and
text: hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go into
text: the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and Laser
text: rush up and look over the edge.
speaker_heading: PAUL/LASER
dialog: ARE YOU OKAY?!
text: There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: Did you get that?!
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Seriously, dude, are you okay?
speaker_heading: CLAY
dialog: I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you

scene_heading: EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CLAY'S HOUSE - LATER

text: Paul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Maybe next time we can hang out
dialog: just you and me.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Clay's cool. He's just gets a
dialog: little amped sometimes.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: That's not amped. That's being a
dialog: dick.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: He's not a dick, that's just his
dialog: way.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Okay...I just didn't like the way
dialog: he was talking to you.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: (defensive)
dialog: Well, you don't know him.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: (back-peddling)
dialog: You're right...I don't...
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Hey, can I ask you a question?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: Why'd you donate sperm?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, it's a lot more fun then
dialog: donating blood.
text: Laser doesn't laugh. Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a
dialog: "non-joke" answer.
speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't know, I guess I thought,
dialog: you know, if I can help somebody in
dialog: need, somebody who wants a baby...
dialog: Laser's not really buying that.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: So you did it to help people?
dialog: 46.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It was a long time ago...
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: How much did you get paid?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why do you want to know?
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: I'm just curious.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.
speaker_heading: LASER
dialog: That's it?
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: It was worth more back then. You
dialog: know. With inflation...
dialog: (off Laser's look)
dialog: Hey, I'm glad I did it...
text: Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism. He looks over at
text: him, then away.

speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox.
speaker_heading: JAI
dialog: Must you take everything beautiful
dialog: and make it dirty?
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: I'm just saying. Spermster's a

speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Okay, first of all, ewww. Second,

dialog: prefer it if you didn't taint him

text: Sasha hops up, energized by the banter.
dialog: 47.
speaker_heading: SASHA
dialog: Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta

text: Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous

speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: You want to keep playing?
speaker_heading: JAI
dialog: Sure.
text: As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni
text: gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it
text: but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni.
speaker_heading: JAI (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha,
dialog: you know...
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Yeah...
text: Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch
dialog: by inch.
text: Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him
text: which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same
text: time. To the point where he lets slip...
speaker_heading: JAI
dialog: It's like she has to sexualize
dialog: every experience, you know? It's
dialog: just sad...
text: That stops Joni in her tracks.
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: Yeah, it is. It's really sad.
text: Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.

speaker_heading: NIC

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Yeah, well...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: You've been really patient with me.

speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)

scene_heading: CUT TO - JULES

speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: How's the water?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Perfect. You wanna come in?
speaker_heading: NIC

speaker_heading: NIC (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No, don't stop...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: No, I meant to put `em in....

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Nic?!!
dialog: No response.

speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: What's that?
speaker_heading: PAUL
text: Strawberry rhubarb pie. Fresh from
dialog: my garden.

speaker_heading: PAUL (CONT'D)
dialog: Good, huh?
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Oh my god. That is criminal.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Have more.
speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: PAUL

text: Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: So...you're good with the plants?
dialog: (off his silence)
dialog: Look, we don't have to do that. We

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: No, I'm just thinking. Hang on.
dialog: (covers his eyes)
dialog: Yeah, I'm good with the plants.
speaker_heading: JULES

dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I wasn't criticizing you.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No, I know...I just...

speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Just give it to the kids.
speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: Okay! God, you're such a pusher!
text: Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost

text: Jules snaps back, freaked.
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: (jumpy)
dialog: What do you mean?
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: NIC

speaker_heading: JULES
dialog: No, we just talked...conceptually.
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: Oh, so it was less of a "doing"

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Why? What's she doing?
speaker_heading: JONI
dialog: She's treating me like I'm 12.

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: JONI

speaker_heading: LASER

speaker_heading: CLAY

speaker_heading: PAUL

speaker_heading: LASER

speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: Senora, I didn't give no looks!
speaker_heading: JULES

speaker_heading: NIC

speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Nic, hold on...

speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: No, you hold on! Let me tell you
dialog: something, you really hurt my kids!
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: Well, they're kinda my...
speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: (cutting him off)
dialog: No! They're not. This is not your

dialog: just a fucking interloper...
text: Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.
speaker_heading: PAUL
dialog: I didn't mean to hurt anyone...

speaker_heading: NIC
dialog: If you want a family so much, go

text: looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through
text: the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite
text: smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate
text: and walks out of view.
text: Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike,

dialog: okay?!
text: Everyone is silenced by the outpouring. Jules soldiers on.
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: So sometimes you're together so
dialog: long, you just stop seeing the
dialog: other person. You just see weird
dialog: projections of your own junk. And
text: instead of talking to each other,
dialog: you go off the rails, and act
dialog: grubby and make stupid choices.
dialog: Which is what I did. And I feel
dialog: sick about it because I love you
dialog: guys and I love your mom and that's
dialog: the truth. Sometimes you hurt the
dialog: ones you love the most. I don't
dialog: know why. Maybe if I read more
dialog: Russian novels I would...
text: Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all.
speaker_heading: JULES (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyway, I just wanted to say how
