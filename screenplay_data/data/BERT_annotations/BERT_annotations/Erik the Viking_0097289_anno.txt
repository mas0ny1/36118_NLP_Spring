dialog: "ERIK THE VIKING"
dialog: Screenplay by
dialog: Terry Jones
dialog: 
speaker_heading: BLACKNESS
text: Flames begin to lick upwards from the bottom of the screen.
text: Suddenly all hell breaks loose. Screaming, yelling. Black
text: figures flash across the foreground, with the flames still
text: burning behind. There follows a confusion of burning, raping,
text: killing and looting -- we don't clearly see what's going on.
text: Suddenly we cut to the interior of a hut. The door is in the
text: process of being broken down. The camera pans onto the close-
text: up face of an attractive girl who is staring in horrified
text: fascination at the door. Her arms are white with fresh dough
dialog: and flour.
text: Suddenly the door bursts open and a wild-looking Viking leaps
text: into the hut. He holds a sword. He looks around wildly and
text: then his eyes come to rest on the girl.
dialog: This Viking, I'm afraid, is Erik. We are about to see him in
dialog: the worst possible light so be prepared. The girl, whose
text: name is Helga, cowers, and looks terrified but resolute.
text: Erik glances round.
text: Then slowly he advances on the girl, forcing her back onto a
text: chest. Erik holds his sword to Helga's throat with his right
text: hand, while his left hand searches to find the thongs holding
text: up his trousers.
text: He is clearly having difficulties trying to hold his heavy
text: sword to Helga's throat at he same time as undoing his
text: trousers. He fumbles and lowers his sword for a moment.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Have you done this sort of thing
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Me? Of course! I've been looting and
text: pillaging up and down the coast.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: (looking skeptical)
dialog: Looting and pillaging, eh?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (on the defensive)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: What about the raping?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: It's obvious you haven't raped anyone
dialog: in your life.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Sh!
text: He covers her mouth with his free hand, and looks round to
text: make sure no one's heard. Then he carries on trying to undo
text: his trousers, but he is now somewhat more than half-hearted
text: about it. Helga watches suspiciously.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Do you LIKE women?
text: Erik is clearly shocked and stung by the insinuation. He
dialog: stops.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Of course I like women... I LOVE
dialog: 'em.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: (pointing out the
dialog: obvious)
dialog: You don't love ME.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No... right... this is RAPE... Mark
dialog: you, I'm not saying I couldn't get
dialog: to like you... in fact... well, to
dialog: be quite honest, I prefer it when
dialog: there's some sort of mutual feeling
dialog: between two people...
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: What -- rape?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No. It isn't rape then, is it?
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Oh, get it over with.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (hesitates again)
dialog: I don't suppose... no...
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I don't suppose you... you DO like
dialog: me at all?
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: What d'you expect? You come in here,
dialog: burn my village, kill my family and
dialog: try to rape me...
text: This is too much for Erik. We withers under the irony.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I'll kill you if you say anything
dialog: about this to anyone.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: (puzzled)
dialog: About raping me?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: About NOT raping you...
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: You DON'T like it, do you?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Well it just seems a little bit crude,
dialog: that's all.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: What about the killing and looting?
dialog: That's just as crude, isn't it?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh well -- you've GOT to do them.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Why? Why have you got to go round
dialog: killing and looting?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: To pay for the next expedition, of
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: But that's a circular argument! If
dialog: the only reason for going on an
dialog: expedition is the killing and looting
dialog: and the only reason for the killing
dialog: and looting is to pay for the next
dialog: expedition, they cancel each other
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh! Stop talking as if we were
dialog: married!
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Well you started it.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I just said I didn't feel like raping
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: And I was just saying that rape is
dialog: no MORE pointless or crude than all
text: the killing and looting that goes
dialog: on.
text: Erik vents of his frustration on the already shattered door.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Scream.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Ah.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Louder.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Aaagh! Rape!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (he'd forgotten about
dialog: that)
dialog: Oh, thanks.
text: Two more Vikings burst in with eyes blazing. They have the
dialog: very unfortunate names of Ernest and Jennifer, but it doesn't
dialog: really matter, for reasons which will become obvious very
text: quickly. They are also slightly drunk.
speaker_heading: ERNEST
dialog: Rape?
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: Where?
text: Jennifer the Viking sways and leans against a door post. The
text: marauder's eyes come to rest on Erik and Helga who are
text: standing, fully clothed, about six feet apart. They look
text: slightly puzzled.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: He raped me standing up.
text: There is a pause. Erik looks up at Helga. Why has she saved
text: his face by telling this lie? Jennifer the Viking turns to
dialog: Erik.
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: You finished, then?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh... yes... I suppose so...
speaker_heading: ERNEST
dialog: Right! Me first!
speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: No! I asked!
text: Ernest leaps on top of Helga and pins her to the ground.
text: Jennifer joins in. Erik looks stunned for a moment. Then he
text: suddenly leaps to Helga's defense.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Leave her alone!
text: He pulls Jennifer off, but Jennifer fights back. Erik forces
text: Jennifer back until he falls into the kneading trough. They
text: fight in the dough for some moments, until Erik runs Jennifer
text: through. The dough is stained red, and the film is rid of
text: such an inappropriately named Viking once and for all.
text: Erik then turns his attention on Ernest who is still on top
text: of Helga. Without a moment's hesitation, Erik runs him through
text: the back. Ernest screams. So does Helga. Erik turns white,
text: and pulls out his sword. Ernest falls over into a heap with
text: his co-misnomer, and Erik kneels beside Helga to find a
text: bloodstain under her breast where he has inadvertently run
text: her through. She is clearly not long for this world.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Thanks for saving me from a fate
dialog: worse than death.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I didn't mean to!
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: (gasping for breath)
dialog: Oh, that's all right then... it's
dialog: the thought... that counts...
text: Erik cradles her head and tries helplessly to staunch the
dialog: blood.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You told them I raped you -- why?
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: (dying)
dialog: I dunno... you looked so... so
dialog: vulnerable...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Why should you care?
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: (dying)
dialog: Why... should YOU care?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Tell me your name?
text: Helga looks up at him, but dies in his arms, without ever
text: saying her name.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Tell me... what IS it...?
text: Erik realizes she has gone. He gazes at her for some time.
text: He looks around at the two dead bodies beside them. Then he
text: listens to the sound of raping and slaughter continuing on
text: the outside. Screams and bloodthirsty shuts echo alongside
text: the roar of flames and the cries of animals. The camera tracks
text: into a big close-up on Erik.
scene_heading: SUPERIMPOSE THE TITLE: "ERIK THE VIKING"
scene_heading: SECOND TITLE: "TIM ROBBINS"
text: Mix through to wide shot of the burning village. Figures
dialog: running here and there.
text: Superimpose the rest of the opening titles.
text: By the last of the opening titles the last of the flames are
text: dying down.
text: Cut to a close-up of a very loud-looking Viking screaming
text: into the camera, as he hurls an axe. This Viking's name is
dialog: Thorfinn Skull-Splitter.
text: The axe thuds into the wall a few inches away from the face
text: of a frightened girl, Unn, who is pinned to the wall with
text: her braids spread out. The Vikings are hurling axes at her a
dialog: la Kirk Douglas in "The Vikings".
text: Several Vikings sitting at ale-bench, laugh in a rather
text: unpleasant way. Erik, however, frowns. He is sitting at a
text: table on a dais, next to his grandfather, the chief of the
text: village. His grandfather almost chokes with merriment. Erik's
text: mother glances at him with some hostility. Meanwhile the
text: drunken Thorfinn has just lifted the totally legless Ivar
text: the Boneless up off the floor and presses an axe into his
text: hand. A tremor of nervousness ripples round the females in
text: the Mead Hall. Ivar is clearly in no condition to throw
text: anything, except, perhaps, the contents of his stomach. Unn
text: winces.
text: Finally, amidst much giggling, Ivar throws wildly, and the
text: axe smashes into a jug being carried by one of the serving
text: girls. The menfolk erupt into drunken hysterics at this. The
text: women clearly feel that the occasion is getting out of hand.
text: But before any of them can work up enough courage to
text: intervene, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter has thrust an axe into
text: the hands of the even more plastered Sven the Berserk. Now
dialog: Sven is not the Viking to let a little matter like not being
text: able to see straight stop him heaving the axe at a young
text: maiden. He takes the axe and whirls it wildly over his head.
text: Even the other drunken Vikings realize this could be
text: dangerous, and they cower behind the table. Sven lets go of
text: the axe. Unn shuts her eyes prepared for the worst. There is
text: a dull thud and a grunt and then a whoop of mirth. Unn opens
text: her eyes to find that the axe has come to rest in the back
text: of a totally stupefied Viking who merely slumps forward onto
text: the table he is sitting at. On the opposite side sits Harald
text: Missionary, a rather seedy cleric who has long since given
text: up trying to convert the pagans and found solace in their
text: mead. He thinks about intervening, but decides that it's a
dialog: bit late really and that he might as well finish off his ale-
text: cup instead. Grimhild Housewife (his only admirer) refills
dialog: it for him.
text: At this moment, however, the axe-throwers have run out of
text: axes, so, as they go to retrieve the ones they've thrown,
text: Harald Missionary salves his conscience by lurching across
text: to the unfortunate Unn. He pokes his dog-eared bible under
text: her nose.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: If you were thinking of converting,
dialog: my dear, this would be an... ideal
dialog: opportunity...
speaker_heading: UNN
dialog: Not now!
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: (who is used to rebuffs)
dialog: No, of course not...
dialog: (he hesitates)
dialog: You might not get another chance,
dialog: you know...
speaker_heading: UNN
dialog: Go away.
text: At this moment another axe thuds into the wall, speeding up
text: Harald's desire to get back to the ale-bench.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Yes, of course... I'll pray for you
dialog: anyway, my dear...
text: Suddenly an axe shatters a large earthware vessel.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Yes.. That's what I'll do...
text: Harald scuttles back to the ale-bench as fast as he can.
text: Erik meanwhile, stares in astonishment as, for a fleeting
text: moment, he sees Helga, the girl he accidentally killed,
text: standing there with her braids spread out in place of Unn.
text: He shakes his head and the vision passes.
text: In the meantime, however, Ivar's mum (perhaps the toughest
text: lady in the village) has decided that enough is enough.
speaker_heading: IVAR'S MUM
dialog: Let her go!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Yes, why?
scene_heading: SVEN THE BERSERK
dialog: Why should we let her go?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: We haven't hit a single braid yet!
text: The Vikings all guffaw.
text: Ivar's mum has had enough. She throws the contents of a jug
text: of ale over Thorfinn. He is shocked, but after the first
text: shock he grins evilly, because now he's been given carte
text: blanche to do the thing he enjoys doing most. Without another
text: thought he throws a vicious right hook at Ivar's mum and
text: lays her out cold.
text: Erik reacts with disgust.
text: His granddad, however, gives a whoop of glee.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: Whoah! Heee! That showed her!
text: Meanwhile a little shriveled old man is jumping up and down.
scene_heading: INGEMUND THE OLD
dialog: Hey! He hit my wife!
text: Ingemund starts to go for Thorfinn, but Thorhild beats him
text: to it. She grabs one of the long-handled cooking griddles
text: from the fires and swings it at Thorfinn.
text: Thorfinn, however, ducks, and the red-hot griddle hits Sven
text: the Berserk, who is standing with his back to Thorfinn.
text: Sven screams and goes berserk, turning round and hitting
text: Thorfinn who is now standing upright again.
scene_heading: INGEMUND THE OLD
dialog: Leave him alone.
text: Ingemund hits Sven. Thangbrand hits Ingemund and a general
text: fight breaks out.
text: Erik's granddad clearly considers this the highlights of the
text: evening, but Erik looks at it in disgust and at his granddad
text: in despair. Eventually he gets up and walk out of the Mead
dialog: Hall.
text: His granddad notices and frowns. He knows something's wrong
text: with his grandson but hasn't a clue what it could be. Erik's
text: mother frowns and nods to his granddad.
text: Grandad gets up and fights his way through the melee to follow
text: Erik out of the Hall.
text: The snow lies thick over the village as Erik's grandfather
text: joins his grandson beside the little quay. Erik is staring
text: broodily into the night.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: What's the matter, son?
text: Erik doesn't reply. His grandfather glances back at the Mead
text: Hall, whence the sound of the fight drift across the snow.
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: We're missing all the fun...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's it all about?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We toil and labor, we loot and
dialog: pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: You talking piffle, son?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: Who have you been talking to?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I met this girl...
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: It's always the women that start the
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: She got me thinking...
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: So? What'd you do to her?
text: Erik stops in his tracks -- as if brought up short by the
text: horror of what he has done.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I... I... KILLED her...
speaker_heading: GRANDFATHER
dialog: That's my boy!
text: Erik's grandfather gives him a paternal hug. Erik looks at
text: him and thinks about the generation gap.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: FEET RUNNING IN THE SNOW - DAY
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Freya!
text: Erik looks around him and calls out again.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Freya!
text: Erik runs into the distance -- a small figure against the
text: dramatic wintry landscape.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: REMOTE, BARREN MOUNTAINSIDE
text: Erik climbs up into shot, and continues climbing until he
text: reaches a cave. He enters it. As his eyes get used to the
text: dark he can make out a few signs of life: a cooking pot on a
text: fire, a straw bed, a pile of rune-sticks.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Freya? Freya?
text: There is a bundle of rags behind Erik. A head rises from it.
dialog: This is Freya.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: Ah... Erik... Erik the "Viking"...
text: It is not clear whether her words are not a little mocking.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: Now what CAN you want with me, Erik
dialog: the "Viking"?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I shouldn't have come.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: They will make fun of you for
dialog: listening to an old woman's stories?
text: Erik doesn't reply. Freya watches him craftily.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: Young men are only interested in
text: fighting and killing.
text: Erik looks up at her sharply. It is as if she has read his
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But has it always been like that,
dialog: Freya? From the beginning of time?
text: Freya doesn't reply. Instead she walks to the mouth of the
text: cave. Erik follows her. They look out at the grey, desolate
text: landscape. Nothing but arctic wastes, snow and desolation.
text: Above them the black clouds boil ceaselessly.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: What do you see, Erik?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I see the world.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: Is it night or day, Erik?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It is day, of course, Freya.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: Is it summer or winter, Erik?
text: Erik looks round at the snowy wastes and ten back at Freya,
text: puzzled.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: The winter is past, thank goodness,
text: Freya. It is summer.
text: Freya puts her face close to Erik's and peers into his eyes.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: The sun is up beyond the clouds --
dialog: where it always is.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: But have you ever seen it? Think
dialog: back...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Of course not... but... when I was a
dialog: child... I remember a dream.... it
dialog: was as if the whole sky was blue...
speaker_heading: FREYA
text: The sky WAS blue, Erik... once.
text: Erik looks at her.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: The Old Stories tell of an age that
dialog: would come such as this -- when Fenrir
dialog: the Wolf would swallow the sun, and
dialog: a Great Winter would settle upon the
dialog: world. It was to be an axe age, a
dialog: sword age, a storm age, when brother
dialog: would turn against brother, and men
dialog: would fight each other until the
dialog: world would finally be destroyed.
text: Erik looks out across the bleak and gloomy landscape and the
text: black, boiling clouds in the sky.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (almost to himself)
dialog: Then... this is the Age of Ragnarok?
text: Freya turns to go back into the cave.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Wait, Freya!
text: Erik re-enters the cave.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Is there nothing men can do?
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: The Gods are asleep, Erik.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I will go and wake them up!
text: Freya turns and looks at him. She clearly enjoys his earnest
text: enthusiasm, but is afraid he doesn't know what he is talking
dialog: about.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Tell me what I must do, Freya!
text: Freya thinks for some moments. The she speaks.
speaker_heading: FREYA
text: Erik... Far out in the midst of the
dialog: Western Ocean there is a land... men
dialog: call it Hy-Brasil. There you will
text: find a horn that is called Resounding.
dialog: You must take the Horn Resounding,
dialog: and three times you must blow it.
dialog: The first note will take you to
text: Asgaard. The second will awaken the
dialog: Gods, and the third note will bring
dialog: you home. But remember... once you
dialog: are in the spell of the Horn, hatred
dialog: will destroy you.
text: Erik turns to go and then hesitates.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: And will the dead ever return, Freya?
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: That I cannot tell you.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A BIG CLOSEUP OF A HEAD BEING BANGED ON THE GROUND
text: It is Thorfinn Skull-Splitter's. The person doing the banging
text: is an enraged Sven the Berserk.
text: Suddenly Erik pushes his way through the crowd and separates
text: them. There is general disgruntlement all round, and murmurs
dialog: of: "Who does he think he is?"
speaker_heading: ERIK'S GRANDAD
dialog: What are you doing, Erik? Thorfinn
dialog: just said Sven's grandfather died of
dialog: old age.
scene_heading: INGEMUND THE OLD
text: They must fight to the death.
scene_heading: THORFINN SKULL-SPLITTER
dialog: That's right! Sven must kill me.
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Yes.
dialog: Stay out of this.
dialog: What's it to do with you?
text: Sven grids his teeth and struggles to get at Thorfinn, but
text: Erik still keeps them apart.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Aren't you afraid of death, Thorfinn
dialog: Skull-Splitter?
text: Thorfinn shrugs.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Not death by the sword! It means I
dialog: shall drink in Valhalla with the
dialog: great warriors.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
text: Engaged in his usual business of chatting up any available
dialog: female.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: You don't still believe in all that
dialog: Valhalla stuff, do you?
text: THORHILD THE FEMALE
dialog: Go away.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Fine... right... just checking.
text: He moves off.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: And you, Sven, aren't you afraid of
text: crossing the Rainbow Bridge to
dialog: Asgaard?
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I will join my grandfather there.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: He's not in Valhalla! He died of old
dialog: age!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: You liar!
text: They start trying to kill each other again, and crash through
text: a fence into the pig-sty. Pigs squeal and run in all
dialog: directions.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Leave them alone! Keep out of it,
dialog: Erik!
text: The others pull Erik away.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: There's only one way to settle it.
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: He MUST kill me!
speaker_heading: EVERYONE
dialog: Yes! That's right!
text: Sven struggles again to oblige, and they both topple into
text: the duck pond. Erik dives back to keep them apart.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: There is another way.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: Who gets killed?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Nobody gets killed.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Oh, well...
text: He starts attacking Sven again. Erik decides there is only
text: one way to make his point. He lets fly with his fists and
text: lays both the antagonists out for a moment.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But it will be dangerous. Maybe none
dialog: of us will return.
scene_heading: SNORRI THE MISERABLE
dialog: Ah well, that's much more sensible
text: than just Thorfinn getting killed.
dialog: Shall we all go and pack now?
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: What are you talking about, Erik?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What if we could find Bi-Frost the
dialog: Rainbow Bridge?
text: This causes a sensation amongst everyone watching, on the
text: lines of "You can't do that" and so on. They scoff at Erik.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: (in disbelief)
dialog: FIND the Rainbow Bridge?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Find it... AND cross it!
dialog: Super-sensation amongst everyone -- except for Harald
text: Missionary who shakes his head sadly.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Look! You can't find somewhere that
dialog: doesn't exist.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: (to Harald)
dialog: Shut up!
text: Harald shrugs.
speaker_heading: SVEN
text: Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's the matter? Are you afraid to
dialog: try?
text: Thorfinn and Sven are put on the defensive.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Of course we're not afraid to try,
dialog: but...
text: Erik rounds on Thorfinn, sensing he had the advantage.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: "But" what?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What?
text: Thorfinn's mental powers find it hard to articulate any
dialog: proposition on such a vast metaphysical concept. Sven comes
text: to his rescue.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow
dialog: Bridge to Asgaard.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We'd be the first!
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: You mean we'd be dead?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No! We'd be the first living men to
text: set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
text: Pause. Uncomfortable shifting.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: But HOW?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I don't know -- but I'm not afraid
dialog: to try.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Well I'M certainly not, either.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Neither am I.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Then you'll come.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: But there isn't such a place as...
dialog: Look...
speaker_heading: THORFINN & SVEN
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What d'you say?
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Well... I'm game.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Me too.
text: Erik grins. He has persuaded them against their will.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: Aren't you going to go on fighting?
speaker_heading: SVEN & THORFINN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Oh...
text: There is general disappointment all around.
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
dialog: Oh, go on...
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: Just have a bit of a fight.
scene_heading: INGEMUND THE OLD
dialog: I'll fight someone.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: You're too old.
scene_heading: INGEMUND THE OLD
dialog: No, I ain't.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN ADZE STRIKING TIMBER
text: The Viking's ship, Golden Dragon, is being repaired and fitted
text: out for a journey. Erik is there, directing operations.
text: The camera tracks through all the activity and finally comes
text: to rest on Keitel Blacksmith. He is a magnificent mountain
text: of a man in an Arnold Schwarzeneggerish sort of way. He
text: hammers a sword, and sparks fly, but his eyes keep returning
text: to the preparations for the voyage. Clearly something is
text: worrying him.
text: His assistant, Loki, sidles up to him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Wish you were going too?
text: Keitel grunts angrily and plunges the sword into cold water.
text: Steam and bubbles.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: But you CAN'T because you're too
dialog: busy.
text: Keitel pulls the sword out of the water and tests it. It

speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You could charge him what you like.
text: Loki takes the sword from Keitel and stacks it alongside a
text: lot more freshly made swords.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You just can't make enough swords
text: and spears and knives and daggers to
dialog: satisfy the demand. You could charge
dialog: Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (shocked)
dialog: Oh, I couldn't do that! The
dialog: Blacksmith's Code says...
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Yes yes... of course.... the
dialog: "Blacksmith's Code"...
text: Keitel goes back to his forge and pulls out a fresh dollop
text: of white-hot ore. Loki comes up behind him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: If this IS the Age of Ragnarok, Keitel
dialog: Blacksmith, it is GOOD to us.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (banging with his
dialog: hammer)
dialog: Can't make enough swords!
dialog: BANG! BANG! BANG!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Can't make enough axe-heads!
dialog: BANG! BANG! BANG!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: But, Keitel, if Erik ever finds the

dialog: Bi-Frost, the Rainbow Bridge... if
dialog: he ever wakens the gods..
text: Keitel stops smiting the metal on his forge. He stares into

speaker_heading: KEITEL
text: They chase Fenrir the Wolf from the

speaker_heading: LOKI
text: The Age of Ragnarok ends...
speaker_heading: KEITEL
text: The bottom falls out of the sword
dialog: business!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It's not just YOUR livelihood that's

dialog: livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (this touches a nerve
dialog: in his muscular mind)
dialog: My brother blacksmiths!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: The Blacksmith's Code says I must...
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
text: (as if reciting his

dialog: Together we stand!
speaker_heading: LOKI

speaker_heading: THORFINN

speaker_heading: THORFINN

dialog: I know, Dad.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: I was a Berserk for King Harald

speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: You went berserk...
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: I went berserk in every battle I

speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: So did your father...
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: So did my father and his father before
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: But it's a responsibility...
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: But it's a responsibility being a

speaker_heading: SVEN

speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: You must only let the red rage take
dialog: hold of you in the thick of battle.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (losing his temper)
text: I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND
dialog: TIMES!
text: A sudden silence falls, as all the village turns to stare
text: nervously at Sven. He goes berserk and demolishes a nearby
text: hut with his head. Ulf the Maddeningly Calm shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: No no... you'll never make a Berserk.
dialog: If you let it out now you'll have
dialog: nothing left for battle...
speaker_heading: IVAR'S MUM
dialog: Besides... it's dangerous.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD

speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: I thought I might do a bit of business

speaker_heading: SNORRI

speaker_heading: HARALD

speaker_heading: SNORRI
text: There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife.

dialog: Same thing, isn't it?
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: No, it is NOT.
scene_heading: MEANWHILE IN ANOTHER PART OF THE VILLAGE
text: Loki is strapping a large consignment of swords onto a pony.
text: He glances round and then sneaks surreptitiously out of the
text: village, over the barren hills of Norway, under the boiling
text: black skies of Ragnarok. Back at the quayside, Golden Dragon
text: is ready for the journey. Erik addresses the villagers.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Well... we'll be off now...
text: Erik's grandad waits for some time before he realizes that
text: Erik isn't intending to say anything else.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: You need to say a bit more than that!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh... er... yes...
text: The faces of the village-folk turn towards him. There are
text: many moist eyes. Erik's mother starts to cry.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh, there, Mum...
text: (he turns and addresses
dialog: everyone)
dialog: Don't be sad.... You all know why
dialog: we're going, so don't grieve. Maybe
dialog: untold dangers do lie ahead of us,
dialog: and some of you may well be looking
dialog: at the one your love for the last
dialog: time...
text: Someone bursts out sobbing. Erik desperately tries to rally
dialog: their spirits.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But don't grieve! Even though the
dialog: Hordes of Muspel tear us limb from
dialog: limb... or the Fire Giants burn each
dialog: and every one of us to a cinder...
text: More crying.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: ...though we may be swallowed by the
dialog: Dragon of the North Sea or fall off
dialog: the Edge of the World... don't cry.
text: More crying.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No! Don't cry....
text: By this time most of the village is blubbering profusely.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
text: He has his arm round his weeping girlfriend.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: Sh... There... it's all fantasy,
dialog: there's no Dragon of the North Sea,
dialog: no Edge of the World...
scene_heading: GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE
dialog: That's what YOU say.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (aside to his Grandad)
dialog: What's the matter with them?
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: Just say something cheerful.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh... right!
dialog: (he can't think of
dialog: anything)
dialog: Well... CHEERS everybody!
text: Erik smiles broadly and waves. The entire village stares
text: back at him with tears in their eyes, and biting their lips.
text: Suddenly one mother can't hold it back any more.
speaker_heading: THORFINN'S MUM
dialog: Don't go!
text: Another mother rushes out and grabs Ivar the Boneless.
speaker_heading: IVAR'S MUM
dialog: My son! I don't want you to go!
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: I don't want to go, either...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh gods! Please, everybody! Keep
dialog: calm! It's not certain ALL of us are
dialog: going to die... and in any case we
dialog: may not die HIDEOUS deaths...
text: More renewed sobbing. Grandad's eyes go heavenwards.
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: (to Erik)
dialog: I think we should go...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Right.
text: (he turns for a last
dialog: salute)
dialog: Farewell... for the last time... may
dialog: the gods prevent...
speaker_heading: GRANDAD
dialog: No, don't say anything else!
text: Suddenly Keitel Blacksmith steps forward. His muscles ripple.
text: His handsome face radiates heroism and manliness.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Wait, Erik!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Keitel Blacksmith?
text: They stop and turn.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: You can't go without me. Who will
dialog: repair your swords and mend your
dialog: shields?
text: Renewed sobs from the women.
speaker_heading: WOMEN
dialog: Oh, no! Ah, lackaday! Not HIM too!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's the matter now?
speaker_heading: UNN
dialog: If Keitel Blacksmith goes with you...
speaker_heading: THORHILD
dialog: We'll have no one to do the things
dialog: he did for us.
scene_heading: THORKATLA THE INDISCRETE
dialog: Or sharpen our knives and make our
text: pans.
text: An awkward silence. The others all turn on her and frown --
text: a bit of shin-kicking goes on. It's clear that Keitel is
text: popular amongst the womenfolk. Erik doesn't notice.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You will have Keitel's assistant,
dialog: Loki, to do all that.
speaker_heading: WOMEN
dialog: Loki? Eurrgh!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's wrong with Loki? He's become
dialog: very good at blacksmithing.
speaker_heading: WOMEN
dialog: Yes... but...
speaker_heading: THORKATLA
dialog: He's so small and...
text: The others all shush her up. More shin-kicking.
speaker_heading: THORHILD
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: Oh, yes... we've got Loki... That's
dialog: true...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: LOKI

scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: ERIK AND HIS MEN
text: Getting into Golden Dragon.
text: Erik notices Thorfinn and Sven quarrelling over Leif the
dialog: Lucky.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Hey, you two! What's going on?
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I was sitting there.
speaker_heading: LEIF
dialog: No, you weren't.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Leif's sitting here. I need a bit of
dialog: luck.
speaker_heading: LEIF
dialog: See.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Look, I bagged it last week.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Yes it does! We could be at sea for
dialog: months.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Well, what difference does it make
dialog: where you're SITTING?
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I don't want to have to sit next to
dialog: Snorri all that time.
text: Sven nods towards Snorri the Miserable -- an Eeyore of a
dialog: Viking if ever there were one.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Thank you VERY much indeed.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Now stop it!
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: It's SO nice to feel wanted.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit
dialog: there. Harald, you'd better sit over
dialog: there...
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Trust me to get the missionary.
text: Suddenly Erik notices Sven's father climbing aboard.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What are YOU doing here?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: You may need a real Berserk.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I AM one, Dad!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We haven't got a spare place.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: He can have my place. I don't want
dialog: to go anyway.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Well, you ARE!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's the matter with Bjorn?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped
dialog: his hand off last night.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: He was lucky...
dialog: (to Sven's dad)
dialog: Sit there.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: You can't have Sven's father sitting
dialog: next to Sven. They'll argue the whole
dialog: time.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: That's true.
dialog: (to Sven)
dialog: You'd better sit there.
dialog: (to Sven's dad)
dialog: You there, and Ornulf there.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Now you've got all the big ones on
text: one side.
text: Erik looks around. It is true that all the tall burly ones
text: are on one side.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: All right, you go there. You here...
text: Sven's dad and Ornulf swap places.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Shut up. You there. You there and
dialog: you there.
text: Ivar and Ornulf swap places. Erik surveys this re-arrangement.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: That's better.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Now you've got all the ones with
text: beards on one side and all the
text: moustaches on the other.
text: This is true. Erik thinks some moments and then:
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It doesn't matter.
text: They start to haul the sail up. Ropes are released. The boat
text: rocks. Suddenly a voice cuts through the crowd. It is Erik's
dialog: mother.
speaker_heading: ERIK'S MUM
dialog: Wait! Wait! Wait!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What is it?
dialog: (he is clearly a little
dialog: embarrassed)
speaker_heading: ERIK'S MUM
dialog: Here, son.
text: She tries to hand Erik what looks unmistakably like a pillow.
text: Erik is dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: ERIK'S MUM
dialog: Your father always made sure he could
text: rest his head at night.
text: Erik is mortified. The others snigger, though not without
dialog: some sympathy for Erik. They've ALL been embarrassed by their
text: mums at one time or another.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I can't take THAT on a voyage!
speaker_heading: ERIK'S MUM
dialog: It was your father's!
text: Erik will find it hard to refuse now. But he hesitates.
speaker_heading: ERIK'S MUM
text: It was the pillow HE took with him.
dialog: He said it once saved his life.
text: Erik reluctantly takes the precious object. His mother kisses
text: him. Everyone has fallen silent now. The relatives stand
text: helpless on the shore as Golden Dragon starts to drift away
text: from them. The Vikings sit in their places, hands on the
text: oars looking back at their loved ones. Erik stands at the
text: prow of Golden Dragon. For a moment he thinks he sees the
text: girl he killed, standing, white in death, the spear-wound
text: still fresh. Erik raises his hand in a half-goodbye. We cut
text: back to the loved ones, now the girl is no longer there.
text: They too half-raise their hands. Erik suddenly turns and
text: gives a shout:
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Huuup!
text: The oars go up and then into the water, and GOLDEN DRAGON
text: commences her voyage.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: GOLDEN DRAGON AT SEA
text: Snorri is feeling queasy and gazing gloomily at the receding
text: coastline of Norway. Thangbrand is sitting near him and
text: feeling equally queasy.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Have a good look... that's the last
dialog: we'll see of old Norway.
text: Snorri is desperately trying to control his insides.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Goodbye home... goodbye family...
dialog: goodbye loved ones...
text: (he starts to throw
dialog: up)
dialog: Goodbye lunch...
speaker_heading: THANGBRAND
dialog: Oh! Shut up.
text: Harald Missionary puts his arm around Snorri.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: You know, my son, our lord said...
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Your lord.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer
dialog: of Faith shall have the sick."
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: I hope the Dragon of the North Sea
dialog: gets YOU AND your lord.
text: Harald Missionary gives him a condescending smile and a weary
text: shake of the head. He knows the Dragon of the North Sea does
dialog: not exist.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Darkness and ignorance...
text: Meanwhile Ivar the Boneless and Sven the Berserk are both
text: suffering from the effects of the sea.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (keeping a wave of
dialog: nausea down)
dialog: It's not so bad when you're rowing.
scene_heading: THORFINN SKULL-SPLITTER
dialog: That's right.
text: Thorfinn gobs onto the whetstone with which he is sharpening
text: his axe. Sven can control himself no longer. He rushes for
dialog: the side.
scene_heading: SVEN THE BERSERK
dialog: I want to die.
text: This sets off Ivar.
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
dialog: Uh oh!
text: He leaps up and pukes over the side. Mass puking breaks out
text: all over the boat.
text: Keitel Blacksmith looks around at his preoccupied shipmates,
text: and it slowly dawns upon him that this might be the moment
dialog: to try a little sabotage.
text: He goes to the ship's lodestone, which is hanging from the
text: mast. Keitel glances around. No one is looking, but this
text: sort of covert behavior goes against his normally sunny and
dialog: open disposition.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: The Blacksmith's Code...
text: He steels himself, takes down the lodestone, snaps out the
text: piece of metal in the base and throws it over the side. Keitel
text: hangs it up again on the mast.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Are you all right?
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: No, I'm not.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: You don't need to feel bad about
dialog: being sea-sick, you know.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: How can you help feeling bad when
dialog: you're sea-sick?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: I mean many of the greatest sailors
dialog: were.
dialog: Pause.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: I know. I know.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on
dialog: every single voyage... the whole
text: time... non-stop... puke... puke...
dialog: puke.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: Look! I don't feel BAD about it. I
dialog: just feel ILL.
text: Thorfinn pauses and waits for a wave of nausea to creep up
dialog: on Ivar.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: He used to puke in his sleep.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: Bastard.
text: He throws up.
text: Meanwhile Erik is in the stern, gazing out behind them.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Thorfinn... look over there.
text: Thorfinn leaves Ivar and joins Erik.
text: On the horizon a sinister sail is following them. Thorfinn
text: grins with evil pleasure. He scents a fight.
text: Erik turns to the crew.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Break out the oars!
text: Thorfinn's smile disappears and he spins round to confront
dialog: Erik.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (to his reluctant
dialog: crew)
dialog: Come on, move it!
text: Most of the men are being sea-sick.
speaker_heading: MORD FIDDLE
dialog: We've only just started cooking lunch.
text: The crew glance at Mord Fiddle and then throw up again.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Move it!
text: Reluctantly the crew take up their rowing positions. Thorfinn
dialog: buttonholes Erik (except of course that he doesn't have any
dialog: buttonholes).
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: It's Halfdan the Black!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
text: Snorri is sitting in position but without his oar. Keitel
text: has meanwhile joined them. He, too, stares at the horizon.
text: He is a little puzzled by this turn of events. Loki has said
dialog: nothing about Halfdan coming after them.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (uneasily)
dialog: Do you suppose he wants to stop us
dialog: waking the Gods?
text: Erik looks at Keitel with a certain amount of contempt. Keitel
dialog: is not renowned even amongst these Vikings for his brain-
dialog: power.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: But how could he know... unless...
text: Keitel stops in mid-sentence as he realizes it must be Loki's
dialog: doing.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: (scornfully)
dialog: So are you going to run away from
dialog: him, Erik?
text: Erik turns to Thorfinn.
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: Row, Thorfinn Skull-Splitter.
text: Thorfinn hesitates.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: But...
text: Keitel shrugs and turns to take up his rowing position. He
text: is still a little confused by this turn of events. Erik
text: confronts Thorfinn.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I gave an order. Or didn't you hear?
text: There is something about Erik's manner that carries an
text: authority that Thorfinn cannot argue with.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Come on, Ivar.
text: Erik manhandles Ivar over to his drum and thrusts his
text: drumsticks into his hands.
text: Halfdan's ship is twice the size of Erik's and, as Erik is
text: only too well aware, consequently travels at twice the speed.
dialog: There is no real chance of them escaping, unless... Erik
text: suddenly catches sight of a thick bank of mist in the
text: distance, and steers his ship towards it.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: (still feeling ill)
dialog: I want to die...
dialog: (then, suddenly
text: catching sight of
text: Halfdan's ship behind
dialog: him)
dialog: No, I don't!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Row! Row! Row!
text: Ivar tries to get into the new rhythm, but has a bit of
text: difficult. As Halfdan's ship gains on them inexorably, GOLDEN
text: DRAGON glides into the sea mist. There is a tremendous roll
text: of thunder very close. All the Vikings look scared. Erik,
text: however, grins.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Row! Row! Row!
text: He doubles the speed. The drum beats faster.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: (shouts out angrily)
dialog: We can't keep this up!
text: Erik grins and then leans on the steering oar. Golden Dragon
text: curves around to its left. Then Erik lays his hand on Ivar's
text: drum and silences it.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oars up!
text: The Vikings ship their oars and sit there in the mist
text: listening to beating of Halfdan's drum getting closer and
dialog: closer.
text: At the final moment, however, Halfdan swings his ship in the
text: opposite direction from Erik's and the sound of his drum
text: disappears into the mist. Erik's men breathe a sigh of
dialog: relief... even Keitel Blacksmith...
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: SOME TIME LATER
text: Golden Dragon is still drifting in the mist. Erik has his
text: fish-lodestone and is trying the direction, but the lodestone
text: is just swinging round uselessly. After trying a few times,
text: Erik gives up and throws the lodestone away into the boat.
text: The men peer into the thick mist; they are lost. Suddenly
text: Erik sees something ahead.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: The Gates of the World...
speaker_heading: MORD FIDDLE
dialog: What?
text: Golden Dragon silently guides between two weird islands.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We have passed through the Gates of
dialog: the World
text: (he looks around at
dialog: the other)
dialog: Now we are in the Unknown...
text: Golden Dragon drifts on and the mist gets thicker. There is
text: a crash of thunder. Then a series of flashes lights up the
text: mist around them. The Vikings are uneasy, sensing a storm
text: brewing. Suddenly Erik points above them. The others look up
text: too. They all gasp.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (hardly daring to
dialog: breathe)
dialog: So THAT is what the sun looks like!
text: Above them hangs a luminous yellow globe, its light just
text: breaking through the mist.
speaker_heading: VIKING
dialog: (to each other)
dialog: The sun! It's the sun! Look!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: (in wonderment)
dialog: I never though I should live to see
text: the sun again.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: Where?
text: The Vikings all gaze up above them in awe. Harald looks from
text: one to the other and then tries to follow their eyelines. He
text: clearly can't see it. Magic music fills the air. Suddenly
text: the "sun" swoops off to one side and starts swaying from one
dialog: side to another.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Should the sun do that?
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: What are you looking at?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Look out!
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Ah!
text: The Vikings scream and flatten themselves against the sides
text: of the boat, as the "sun" suddenly lurches down on them out
text: of the sky, revealing for the first time that it is NOT the
text: sun at all but a strange monster with a long neck that
text: disappears off into the mist and a glowing globe for a head,
text: and huge chomping jaws. The Vikings are, understandably,
text: terrified.
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: It's not the sun! It's not the sun!
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: It's the Dragon of the North Sea!
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: (knowingly)
dialog: Ah! THAT'S why I can't see it.
text: As the Dragon of the North Sea rises up again, however, its
text: jaw apparently drops off and falls to the deck, and lands on
dialog: Snorri.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Aaah!
text: Keitel nervously picks it up and holds it up for everyone to
text: see. It is a strand of sea-weed. The Vikings are non-plussed.
text: They look back at their now jawless monster. Harald Missionary
text: picks up the sea-weed.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Some dragon! Ooh!
text: He tosses it back amongst his terrifies companions. Suddenly
text: there is an incredibly loud clap of thunder and flames shoot
text: out of the mist.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Look out!
text: As... unbelievably... a huge monstrous visage looms out of
text: the mist... It is a creature from the nethermost depths of
text: the ocean... and the incandescent globe is no more than a
text: sprouting on the end of its nose! More fire shoots out from
text: its nostrils and sends all the Vikings (and even Harald
text: Missionary) diving for the deck. Then the monstrous head
text: disappears back into the mist as quickly as it came, taking
dialog: its light with it...
text: The Vikings are paralyzed with fear for one brief moment.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Row! ROW!
text: They all scramble for the oars in a determined hysteria.
text: Ivar the drummer, in his panic, has set a ridiculously fast
dialog: rate and nobody can keep up with it.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: (hoarsely)
dialog: Sorry.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: What's all the panic about?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
text: (in a panic, shouting
text: back over his shoulder)
dialog: The Dragon...
text: Harald gives a patronizing smile.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Children afraid of the dark...
text: Suddenly there is another roar, and flames shoot out of the
text: mist and across the deck of Golden Dragon. One man, Ornolf
text: Fishdriver, who hasn't had much to say so far, is set on
text: fire. Another, Bjarni Jerusalem-Farer, who has and will have
text: even less to say then Ornolf Fishdriver, leaps out of the
text: way of the flames and falls over the side.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Man over board!
text: Thorfinn starts trying to fish him out. Ivar has started to
text: panic and is beating the drum too fast.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Slower! In... Out...
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: Sorry!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (his eyes showing
dialog: their whites)
dialog: We're being attacked! KILL! Kill!
dialog: Kill!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Not now, Sven...
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I must KILL! Kill!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: It's no good going berserk against a
dialog: dragon!
text: Sven's dad slaps him around the face. There is another roar
text: from the monster. Erik turns to Ivar.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Faster!
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: Make your mind up.
text: Suddenly the Dragon's head appears out of the mists above
text: them once again. There is panic amongst the Vikings as some
text: start to row faster than others. Screams.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Keep up the strike!
text: The Dragon's jaws open. Flame licks out, and down the center
text: of the vessel. There are screams as the Vikings leap out of
text: the way. Sven goes berserk again.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: KILL! KILL!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Stop it!
text: The Dragon's eyes dilate and its jaws open. The men throw
text: themselves to the deck as if expecting more fire. But instead
text: the creature's fangs crash into the wood of the stern of
dialog: Golden Dragon.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: ROW!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: DEATH!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: SHUT UP!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: ROW!
text: Erik looks around at his terror-stricken crew. He realizes
text: this is an important moment. It is up to him to save the
text: situation. Suddenly an idea occurs to him, as he catches
text: sight of the pillow that his mother gave him.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Keep rowing!
text: Erik dashes to his sea-chest under the mast and pulls out
dialog: the pillow.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Erik! Row! What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (holding up the pillow)
dialog: It saved my father!
text: Erik starts to shin up the mast.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Barmy.
text: Sven's dad is desperately holding Sven back.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: HOLD it! HOLD it in!
speaker_heading: SVEN
text: DEATH TO DRAGONS!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Row!
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Has anyone told him we've got a dragon
dialog: eating our boat?
text: Erik has reached the top of the mast and is now right up
text: with the incandescent globe on the end of the long stalk
text: that grows onto the monster's nose. He grabs hold of it and
text: swings across onto the monster's nose. At his moment Sven
text: breaks free of his dad and throws himself onto one of the
text: Dragon's teeth.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Red mist!
text: He bangs his head against the monstrous denture. Sven's dad
text: looks heavenward in despair.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
text: Who is offering his bible to the petrifies Vikings in the
dialog: prow.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: It's at time like this that you'll
dialog: find this book MOST useful, you
dialog: know...
text: Keitel takes the bible from him and hits him over the head
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Row! You idiot!
text: The monster's eyes dilate wildly as they try to focus on the
text: tiny figure of Erik on its snout. Erik shoves the pillow up
text: one of the Dragon's nostrils. Snorri watches Erik
text: incredulously. He shakes his head.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: His father went crazy too... Used to
text: take forty winks in the middle of a
dialog: battle...
text: Thorfinn frowns -- he has a glimmering of an idea of what
text: Erik is doing. Erik now plunges his sword through the pillow
text: in the Dragon's nostril, and feathers immediately fly into
dialog: the air.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Now... take a deep breath.
text: The Dragon goes cross-eyed, trying to see what's going on on
text: its snout.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Go on! Breathe in, you cod-brain!
text: Meanwhile the Dragon's tongue suddenly licks out around its
text: tooth. Sven instantly slices through it with his sword. The
text: bright blood spurts, like bursting a sausage. The Dragon
text: gives an agonized roar and a sharp intake of breath. The
text: feathers that have leaked out from the pillow are instantly
text: sucked inside and the whole pillow disappears right up the
text: Dragon's nose.
text: For a moment everyone holds their breath. The Dragon's eye
text: dilate wildly. Then it wrinkles its snout. Then it starts
text: what is unmistakably a sneeze.
scene_heading: THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA
dialog: Ah... ah... ah...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Hold TIGHT!
scene_heading: THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA
dialog: Ah... ah... ah...
text: Erik leaps back across the mast.
scene_heading: THE DRAGON OF THE NORTH SEA
dialog: CHOO!!
text: A hurricane of wind and feathers blasts out of the Dragon's
text: nostrils and hits all the Vikings at once. Everyone is
text: disgusted by the Dragon's breath.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Urgh! What's it been eating?
text: But the blast has already catapulted the boat into the sky,
text: and it hurtles through the clouds. leaving the Dragon of the
text: North Sea far behind. They all look up at Erik and cheer.
text: Shot of Erik. He doesn't look too happy.
text: Neither does Ivar the Boneless, because he too has just
text: noticed that they are now flying and the ocean is several
text: thousand feet below them. Ivar screams. The other all rush
text: to the side to look too.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No! No! Get back!
text: Unfortunately they all rush to the same side and the boat
text: tips over with far more instability than when it is in the
text: water. Leif and Thangbrand are catapulted down into the sea.
text: We watch them descend into tiny dots and tiny unheard splashes
dialog: below.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Who was that?
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Leif the Lucky.
text: Others are almost falling out. There is renewed panic.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Get back!
text: Poor Erik is still up the mast but has been dislodged and is
text: now hanging on by his hands, dangling over the open sea.
text: Some of the men -- Thorfinn and Sven the Berserk amongst
text: them -- are hauling themselves up the almost vertical slope
text: of the deck, trying to redress the balance. Meanwhile Keitel
text: Blacksmith is dangling by one hand.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: I can't hold on! I can't hold on!
text: Sven worms his way along the edge -- at great peril to himself --
text: and grabs Keitel's wrist just as his fingers slip.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Aaagh!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Got you!
text: Keitel looks up in Sven's eyes. He is totally at Sven's mercy.
text: What thoughts are going through his mind? How is he going to
text: betray Sven in future if he is rescued? Guilt suddenly
text: overwhelms him.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Let me go, Sven.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: I'm not worth risking your life for.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If
dialog: you go... I go too...
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: For your own sake... For the others...
dialog: I...
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Hang on...
text: The boat begins to right itself just as Erik finally can't
text: hold on any more, and he plummets, straight into the ship,
text: and through the bottom up to his waist. His legs dangle.
text: At the same moment the prow of the boat tips and suddenly
text: they are plummeting down towards the ocean. They hit the
text: water with an almighty splash. Erik is thrown clear of the
text: hull by the force of the water now cascading up through the
dialog: hole he has made.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: First we're flying -- now we're
dialog: sinking!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Well, come on!
text: He whisks off his helmet and starts bailing. All follow suit.
text: Night falls.
scene_heading: SOME TIME LATER
text: The Vikings are still bailing out, but the water is up to
text: their thighs.
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
dialog: Who are we fooling? It's hopeless!
text: Ivar flings down the helmet with which he's been bailing.
text: The others look at each other. They are reconciled to the
dialog: fact that they are going to drown.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: (hopelessly)
dialog: Let's sing something!
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Anyone know any good drowning songs?
text: The suggestion falls flat.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy-
dialog: Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn
dialog: Resounding... but at least we've
dialog: tried... and at least we shall have
dialog: died like men.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Like fish.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: (raising his sword)
dialog: Erik's right! We'll all meet in
dialog: Valhalla.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: I don't want to die!
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: Isn't there ANYBODY who'd like to be
dialog: christened before we go down?
text: Silence. A distinct lack of enthusiasm.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: It can't do you any HARM...
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: What do we have to do?
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Nothing... I just immerse you in
dialog: water...
scene_heading: THORFINN AND OTHERS
dialog: Get lost...
text: The ship creaks and starts to go under. Erik picks his up
text: his sword. The others follow suit.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Don't let me drown, Thorfinn!
text: Water starts to pour over the sides of the boat. Erik and
text: Thorfinn raise their swords to each other.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Till we meet in Valhalla.
text: They all prepare to run each other through. The boat sinks
dialog: rapidly.
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
dialog: I'm too young! Oh Odin! Not me! Please
dialog: not me! Perhaps I'd rather drown...
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: I do WISH you'd let me convert you.
text: Then Erik pauses in his attempt to kill Thorfinn and looks
text: around. The ship has sunk, but the prow and the stern posts
text: are still sticking up out of the water, and the Vikings
text: themselves are only up to their chests.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: How deep IS the ocean?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Very deep... usually...
text: The realization gradually dawns on the Vikings that they're
text: not going to sink any more.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Wait! Nobody kill anybody!
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: THE SUN SHINING DOWN FROM A BLUE SKY
dialog: The Vikings have fallen asleep where we last saw them -- up
text: to their necks in water. Gradually the warmth of the sun
text: coaxes them awake -- Thorfinn is the first to look up and
text: see the brilliant shining orb in the sky.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: What is it?
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
text: (he panics and turns)
dialog: It's the Dragon again!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No.. no, it isn't...
text: Ivar has turned and is staring at something else.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Look, the sky is blue...
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: The sun! That's it!
text: Ivar, meanwhile, is recovering from the amazement that has
text: immobilized him. He taps Erik on the shoulder. Erik turns
text: and he, too, gasps.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Look!
text: They all turn to see they are standing in the shallow waters
text: of a natural harbor. Above nestle the white walls of a
text: beautiful city set in a green and pleasant land.
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Yeaaaah!
text: The Vikings wade ashore, enchanted by the paradise they see
text: before them. All at once Thorfinn spies something. He draws
text: his sword and they all approach with caution to find that
text: under a weeping willow tree lies the most beautiful girl.
text: She is raven-haired, scantily dressed and fast asleep. The
text: Vikings approach her with trepidation, their swords and axes
text: drawn. They glance around uneasily.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: She's got no clothes on!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: It's disgusting.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Get her weapons.
text: Sven kneels quietly beside the girl. She stirs. Sven freezes.
text: The others look around fearfully.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: She hasn't got any.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (incredulous)
dialog: She MUST have a knife or something...
text: But they look. She hasn't.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: What kind of place IS this?
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELES
dialog: P... p... perhaps they've got weapons
dialog: we haven't even dreamed of...
text: Suddenly the girl stirs again in her sleep. The Vikings
text: retreat several paces and grip their weapons, and glance
text: around as if expecting an ambush.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Let's hack her to pieces.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Well, what else do we do?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: How about making friends?
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (with disgust)
dialog: "FRIENDS"?
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Eurrgh!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's wrong with making friends?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: You don't go through all the hardships
text: of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: We can make "friends" at home...
text: This conversation has woken the girl, Aud.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Welcome!
text: The Vikings react with terror, take a step back and raise
text: their swords and axes.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: WHAT did you say?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: I said welcome.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (suspiciously)
speaker_heading: WELCOME?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Well, of course. We always welcome
dialog: friends.
text: The Vikings look at each other and at their swords. They
dialog: don't think they look that much like friends themselves.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy-
dialog: Brasil.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Hy-Brasil?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Well, of course.
text: The Vikings erupt into an impromptu dance of joy, hugging
text: each other and waving their swords in the air.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Please! Please! What are those?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What are what?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Those things in your hands.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: These? What are THESE? They're swords.
text: Aud instantly recoils with terror.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Oh no! NO! Put them down! PUT THEM
speaker_heading: DOWN!
text: The Vikings gradually cease their mock battles and turn to
text: look at Aud with incredulity.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What's the matter?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: PLEASE! You don't know what you're
dialog: doing!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Put them down!
dialog: (to Erik)
text: PLEASE make them put them down.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: Yes, why?
speaker_heading: AUD
speaker_heading: WHY?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: But surely you know...?
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Er... n... no...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Know what?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP OF KING ARNULF
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: The wonderful blessing under which
dialog: we live here on Hy-Brasil!
text: The king beams. The Vikings shift uneasily. They look out of
text: place and extremely scruffy in the midst of the scantily
text: dressed courtiers of Hy-Brasil. Aud sits beside her father
dialog: the King.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No... we don't...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: The Gods decreed that if ever a sword
text: spills human blood upon these shores,
dialog: the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink
text: beneath the waves.
text: King Arnulf beams rapturously at the Vikings, expecting them
text: to be overjoyed. Instead they are horrified.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: That's terrible!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You mean if just ONE PERSON gets
dialog: killed?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Yes!
dialog: (he thinks: isn't it
dialog: wonderful?)
text: The Vikings look at each other,
text: feeling they haven't quite understood.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: You mean... you can't kill ANYBODY?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Right! Isn't it wonderful?
text: The Vikings are non-plussed.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: What? Not being able to kill anybody?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (bemused)
dialog: Well, of course.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (interested)
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (explaining the obvious)
dialog: Well... for a start... er... there's
dialog: no killing...
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Well... isn't it great?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: But how d'you take revenge?
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (guiltily)
dialog: How do you punish people?
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: How do you DEFEND yourselves?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (getting a little
dialog: irritated)
dialog: We don't have to. We're all terribly
dialog: nice to each other. Aren't we?
speaker_heading: COURT
dialog: Yes!
text: Aud catches Erik's eye and gives him a dangerously slow wink.
text: A pause of disbelief from the Vikings.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: ALL the time?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Well, of course! We HAVE to be.
text: He turns and conducts the courtiers, who chant in unison:
speaker_heading: COURT
dialog: "Being nice to each other is what
dialog: it's all about."
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (rising as if to sing)
dialog: You see? We're terribly nice to each
dialog: other We're friendly bold and free.
dialog: We never say anything nasty 'Cause
dialog: we dare not...
speaker_heading: COURT
dialog: (almost singing)
dialog: No sirreeeee!
text: They hold the note while King Arnulf looks anxiously at the
dialog: Vikings.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Would you like us to sing to you?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: That's very kind of you, but we're
dialog: in rather a hurry... We're...
text: King Arnulf claps and the court stop singing.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: What's the matter, don't you WANT to
dialog: hear our singing?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh... well, yes, of course; it's
dialog: just we're looking for the Horn
dialog: Resounding and --
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: You don't think our singing's going
dialog: to be good enough for you?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn
dialog: Resounding is...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: A lot of people like our singing.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I'm sure it's lovely.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: But you don't want to hear it.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (changing tack)
dialog: No... no...
text: (he looks at the others)
dialog: We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Oh... yes.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Well, you'll have to ask us REALLY
dialog: nicely.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (realizing he has to
dialog: be diplomatic)
dialog: Er... well... we... we... would be
dialog: TERRIBLY grateful if you... all...
dialog: would sing for us.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: You're just saying that.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Well, of course he is!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Sh!
text: They restrain Sven.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Of course we're not; we'd genuinely
dialog: like to hear you sing.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: REALLY?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Really.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: And you're not just saying it because
dialog: you think we want you to?
text: Erik swallows hard.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No.
dialog: (he bites the lie)
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Right! Summon the musicians! We'll
dialog: do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM-
scene_heading: TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
speaker_heading: COURT
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Oh...
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: REALLY?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (apologetically to
dialog: Vikings)
dialog: It isn't the one we're BEST at.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Couldn't we do the one that goes "TI-
scene_heading: TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM"?
text: The rest of the court look hopeful.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Not when we've got guests.
scene_heading: VOICE FROM COURT
dialog: How about the one that goes "TI-TUM-
scene_heading: TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TI-TUM"?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Don't be silly.
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: That was a stupid suggestion.
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Sorry! I just thought they might
dialog: like to hear something that we can
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE
dialog: Yes! At least we know that one.
scene_heading: YET ANOTHER VOICE
text: Nobody knows the "TUM-TUM-TUM-TUM-TI-
dialog: TUM-TUM" one.
scene_heading: REST OF COURT
dialog: No!
dialog: Right!
dialog: I agree!
speaker_heading: ODD MAN OUT
dialog: I do!
scene_heading: REST OF COURT
dialog: Sh!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER VOICE
dialog: It's too difficult!
speaker_heading: CHAMBERLAIN
dialog: Sh!
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: All right. We'll do the one that
text: goes "TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TI-
dialog: TUM". Ah! The musicians!
text: The musicians are huge, unshaven, have broken noses and
text: tattoos, and are covered in black oil -- like mechanics.
text: Their instruments are like heavy industrial machinery, pushed
text: in large vats of black oil that drip all over the show.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Right... Oh dear...
text: (he glances across at
dialog: the Vikings)
dialog: I'm sure you're not going to like
dialog: this...
text: Erik and the others smile reassuringly.
text: There is a lot of coughing. The King raises his baton and
text: then brings it down, humming to himself as he does so. There
text: is a most awful din; caterwauling, crashing and banging,
text: whining, screaming...
text: The Vikings look at each other, trying to pick out some tune,
text: but it's impossible. Ivar the Boneless can't stop himself
text: bursting out into giggles and this eventually spreads to the
text: other Vikings. King Arnulf notices and bangs the throne for
dialog: silence.
text: Gradually the din stops. King Arnulf sinks down in despair.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (tragically)
dialog: We're just not a very musical
dialog: nation...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No, no... It was very... er, nice.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY,
dialog: totally, genuinely honest with me.
dialog: Did you really, truly, honestly like
dialog: it?
text: Erik thinks for some moments and then decides to make a clean
text: breast of it.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (goes hysterically)
dialog: They didn't like it! Oh God! I want
dialog: to die!
text: The whole court looks as if it's about to commit mass HARA-
text: KIRI, while the musicians look rather dangerous. Erik takes
text: the moment to get down to business.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Your Majesty! We come from a world
dialog: where there IS no music. Where men
text: live and die by the axe and by the
dialog: sword...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Well, how d'you think I feel?
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: YOU try to be nice to people, when
dialog: they're rude about your singing...
text: Erik feels he is making a mess of all this diplomacy.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We must find the Horn Resounding!
text: The King glares at Erik.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Is it HERE in Hy-Brasil?
text: King Arnulf thinks for a moment and then speaks.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: I'll tell you what...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Yes?
text: King Arnulf hesitates -- he bites his lip and then takes the
text: plunge.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-
scene_heading: TUM-TUM-TI-TUM-TUM". Perhaps you'll
dialog: like that better.
text: Erik gives up. A lot of throat clearing. Aud, the King's
text: daughter, gives Erik another dangerously slow wink. The
text: terrible "music" starts up, shattering the calm of the
dialog: beautiful city.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: THE GOLDEN DRAGON
text: Now afloat once more, riding at anchor in the bay. Ivar is
text: standing on guard in it. Suddenly he sees something that
text: makes him gabe in horror. We don't find out what it is,
dialog: however, because we immediately
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: He is deeply in love. He is also in bed with the King's nubile
dialog: daughter, Aud.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Have you ever felt like this about
dialog: anyone else?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What... you mean "got into bed with"
dialog: them?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No, of course not, silly -- I mean
dialog: FELT like this about them?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You mean... you HAVE got into bed
dialog: with somebody else?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No, I mean have you ever felt that
dialog: for the first time in your life you'd
dialog: met somebody you could believe in
dialog: with your whole heart... someone
dialog: whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR
dialog: goals... whose dreams seem to be
dialog: YOUR dreams?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: HAVE you ever been to bed with anyone
dialog: else?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: What does that matter? But you've...
dialog: you've... FELT like this before...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It was different...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: (just for a moment it
dialog: is Helga speaking)
dialog: What was she like?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh... oh, I didn't know her very
dialog: well...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: But you LOVED her all the same...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We never went to bed together.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Why do you go on about that? What
dialog: does it matter?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You've been to bed with somebody
dialog: else, haven't you?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: I've never LOVED anybody!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I've never been to bed with anybody!
text: Suddenly there is a banging on he door.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF (V.O.)
dialog: Open up! I know you're in there!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Ah! It's my father!
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF (V.O.)
dialog: Open up! I know you're in there!
text: Suddenly the note from Ivar's horn rings out across from the
text: bay. Erik rushes to the window and looks out to see what
text: Ivar saw previously: a black ship approaching on the horizon.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh, no! Halfdan!
text: There is more banging on the bedroom door.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF (V.O.)
dialog: Aud! You've got someone in there
dialog: again, haven't you?
text: Erik gives her a sharp look.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Quick! Throw this over you!
text: She throws a shabby bit of cloth over Erik and at that moment
text: the door bursts open, and King Arnulf enters.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Right! Where is he?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Who, Father?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here
dialog: of course!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: There IS no one.
text: The King starts prowling round the chamber. Erik stands there,
text: naked and petrified, with the cloak hanging over his head,
text: just where it landed.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: I can SMELL one of those strangers...
dialog: That's who it is, isn't it?
text: Aud keeps mum.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
text: This is the fifth one this week.
text: Before he can stop himself, Erik blurts out:
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Fifth...
text: Aud motions him to be quiet, but it's too late. The King
text: spins round to see who she is signaling to. The King appears
text: to be looking straight at Erik. Erik can hardly bear the
text: suspense.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Well... where is he?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: There's nobody here, Father. Look
dialog: for yourself.
text: King Arnulf looks around the chamber carefully. He looks
text: straight through Erik as if he weren't there. Suddenly the
text: King strides over to Erik and Erik instinctively cowers out
text: of the way. The King walks straight over to a very small
text: cupboard no more than a foot high, flings the door of it
text: open, and starts throwing clothes around the room.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: He wouldn't be a midget, Father!
text: The King turns on her.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: You're losing your temper!
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (becoming instantly
dialog: pleasant)
dialog: Of course I'm not. I never lose my
dialog: temper...
text: Ivar's horn sounds again. A shadow passes over King Arnulf's
text: face.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Oh dear... more visitors!
text: He strides to the window and sees Halfdan's ship. As he does
text: so, Erik has to leap out of the way, inadvertently knocking
text: a chest. The King spins round and addresses the chest.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Come out... come out like a man... I
dialog: know you're in there...
text: King Arnulf flings the chest open, revealing nothing but
text: clothes. He is baffled. He reluctantly starts to leave.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: (gently)
dialog: It's all in your own mind, Father...
dialog: It's YOU who imagine that I'm always
dialog: up here with some man or other....
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: I don't know how you do it, Aud... I
dialog: sometimes think you've got some of
dialog: your mother's magic...
text: He suddenly spies a small trinket-box and looks in that. But
text: he doesn't find any strange man in it.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: There is no magic, Father... My mother
dialog: had no magic...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: She did, I tell you! She could blind
dialog: me as easily as the night the day.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: It's your fantasy...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: But one day I'll catch you... Like I
dialog: caught her...
text: He leaves. Aud closes the door. Erik throws the cloak off
text: and starts getting dressed.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: The Cloak Invisible. It was my
dialog: mother's parting gift.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: "The fifth one this week"!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Oh, for goodness' sake!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: And I thought you said it was
dialog: something special...
text: Aud runs to his side and puts her arms around him.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: That's just what I was trying to
dialog: tell you. You ARE...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Five this week; how many the week
dialog: before?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: You're as bad as my father.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: And the week before that?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Erik...!
dialog: (she is really sincere)
dialog: I want to help you get to Asgaard.
text: Erik is torn. He doesn't know whether to believe her or not.
text: Ivar's horn sounds for a third time. Erik races to the window.
text: He looks out. Halfdan's ship is even closer.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We mustn't let him land!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Halfdan the Black.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: But, Erik...
text: But Erik is off out of the door.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No. Wait! My father will be --
text: There is a thump and a yell as Erik is set upon by the King's
dialog: two musicians.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: I might have known it was you!
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #1
text: (pinning Erik's arms
dialog: behind him)
dialog: I'm not hurting you, am I?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #2
dialog: You WILL tell us if we hurt you?
text: They start to march Erik through the palace.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Let me go!
text: Erik struggles.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (to musicians)
dialog: Careful!
dialog: (to Erik)
dialog: They're not supposed to hurt you.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You've got to let me go!
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #2
dialog: Oh no! We can hold onto you -- just
dialog: so long we don't squeeze too hard or
dialog: bump you.
text: In the distance we hear the horn again.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Halfdan the Black's here!
text: They have reached a cell. The musicians starts to chain Erik
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: It's all part of our safety
dialog: regulations. You see if someone were
dialog: to get hurt they might get angry and
dialog: then... well...
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan
dialog: the Black lands! Ow!
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN
dialog: Ooh! I'm terribly sorry.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Who is Halfdan the Black?
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: He's trying to stop us waking the
dialog: Gods.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Because that's how he makes his money,
dialog: by war and plunder!
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Don't talk nonsense.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: He wants to kill US!
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Not when we explain about the Great
dialog: Blessing.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You don't know Halfdan the Black.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: I know that the Great Blessing has
dialog: kept the peace for a thousand years,
dialog: and will keep it for the next
dialog: thousand.
text: The horn sounds again. Erik is about to argue this point
text: when Thorfinn suddenly bursts in.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Erik!
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #2
dialog: We're not hurting him!
speaker_heading: MUSICIAN #1
dialog: (to Erik)
dialog: Are we?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Just let me go!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Halfdan the Black's here!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I know!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: (to the King)
dialog: He wants to KILL us.
text: They both look at King Arnulf. The King thinks.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You don't want him to kill us ON Hy-
dialog: Brasil! Do you?
text: The King thinks some more. The horn sounds once more.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE GOLDEN DRAGON
text: Erik and the Vikings are scrambling into their war gear.
text: They glance nervously over to where Halfdan the Black's ship
text: is riding on the waves.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: I feel strange.
text: Erik looks at Thorfinn, shocked.
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
dialog: (his throat dry)
text: Sort of wobbly and excited?
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Sort of...
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: That's fear.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: But Thorfinn doesn't know the meaning
dialog: of fear.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Is it sort of... like a sinking
dialog: feeling in your stomach?
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: That's it!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But. You're not even afraid of DEATH,
dialog: Thorfinn!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: I know. I know.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: It's magic.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What "magic"?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: I've heard stories of a magic that
dialog: strikes fear into the heart so you
dialog: cannot fight.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (deadly serious)
dialog: Yes... I can feel it.
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
dialog: (eagerly)
dialog: I always feel like this!
text: Suddenly Halfdan's ship rises up out of the water, and
text: revealing the secret of its hidden power. Under the water-
text: line is another line of oars! The Vikings are dumbfounded.
text: Ivar drops trembling to his knees. The rest go white. Thorfinn
text: draws his sword. Erik realizes his men are rapidly talking
text: themselves into a blue funk.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It's not magic! It's just a trick!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: (turning on him angrily)
dialog: Don't you FEEL it?
text: Erik looks around at his paralyzed crew. He realizes he is
text: the only one who can save the situation.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Very well! It they're using magic --
dialog: we'll use magic of our own!
text: He leaps out of Golden Dragon and races up to the shore
text: towards the city of Hy-Brasil.
text: Erik races into the Forum and gazes up at the high walls of
text: the Palace. Without a thought he produces two daggers and
text: plunges them into the stonework. Then he hauls himself up
text: the sheer cliff of wall up to Aud's bedchamber fist over
text: fist. It is, indeed, a prodigious feat. He arrives at Aud's
text: window exhausted. Aud, who has appeared at the window, looks
text: at him curiously.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Why didn't you come up by the stairs?
text: Erik looks around and notices for the first time the
text: magnificent flights of stairs leading up to the top of Aud's
dialog: tower.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (rather miffed)
dialog: Just give me a hand.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: I mean, you could have killed
dialog: yourself.
text: Erik clambers into Aud's room.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Where's the Cloak Invisible?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Why?
text: Erik looks around and is suddenly suspicious.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I can't see it!
dialog: (indignation suddenly
dialog: seizes him)
dialog: Have you got another man in here?
text: Erik starts feeling the air as if expecting to find an
text: invisible body.
speaker_heading: AUD
text: It's in the chest.
text: Erik races over and grabs the cloak.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I'll bring it back.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Erik. You don't understand.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No. It's YOU who doesn't understand,
text: Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and
dialog: destroy. We brought him here. We
text: must stop him.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: (pointing at the cloak)
dialog: But you don't realize....
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Goodbye, Aud...
text: Erik leaps out of the window. For a moment Aud is surprised
text: and then alarmed as she realizes he's jumped out of the
text: window, which is some forty feet off the ground.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Erik!
text: She rushes to the window in time to see Erik parachuting
text: down, holding the four corners of the cloak. Erik lands safely
text: and waves with the cloak.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
speaker_heading: AUD
text: No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak
dialog: Invisible! It only seems to work on
dialog: my father!
text: But Erik cannot hear her. He is already racing back to his
dialog: ship.
text: BACK ON THE GOLDEN DRAGON
text: Thorfinn is taking "Being Scared" lessons from Ivar the
dialog: Boneless.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: That's it! AND you keep wanting to
dialog: go to the lavatory.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Oh, yes! I hadn't noticed that!
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Oh, shut up, you two. You're making
dialog: us ALL nervous.
text: Erik leaps into Golden Dragon brandishing the Cloak Invisible.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: So Halfdan the Black's using magic,
dialog: is he? Well, I have a magic to match
dialog: his!
text: (he holds up the Cloak
dialog: Invisible)
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: SNORRI
text: A magic dishcloth.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: To the oars!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: D'you think I've got time to go behind
dialog: that bush?
text: Ivar starts to drum and the Vikings begin to row. Golden
text: Dragon heads out of the harbor.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HALFDAN THE BLACK
text: flanked by his advisers, Gisli Oddsson and Eilif the Mongul.
text: He gives a nod and Eilif bangs his staff of office on the
text: deck, as a signal for the galley slaves to speed up. Down in
text: the galley, the slave master (a diminutive Japanese) stalks
text: down the decks lashing the sweat-streaked galley slaves and
text: cursing them in incomprehensive Japanese.
text: Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately) a translation appears
text: in subtitles.
scene_heading: SLAVE-DRIVER
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Row! You incomprehensible, horizontal-
dialog: eyed, Western trouser-wearers! Eurgh!
dialog: You all look the same to me! How I
dialog: despise your lack of subtlety and
dialog: your joined-up writing! You, who
dialog: have never committed ritual suicide
dialog: in your lives!
speaker_heading: SLAVE
dialog: (whispering to his
dialog: neighbor)
dialog: You know, I don't think it would be
dialog: so bad, if we knew what he was
dialog: saying...
scene_heading: SLAVE-DRIVER
text: SILENCE! Unceremonious rice-pudding
dialog: eaters! How I abominate your milk-
dialog: drinking and your lack of ancestor-
dialog: worship and your failure to eat your
dialog: lunch out of little boxes!
text: Meanwhile the Vikings are growing increasingly uneasy as
text: they row towards Halfdan.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You'll see!
text: At this point, back on the Black Ship, Halfdan gives another
text: nod and Eilif raps out yet another command with his staff.
text: This time the prow of the Black Ship opens up like a pair of
text: jaws. The Vikings see it and panic.
scene_heading: IVAR THE BONELESS
dialog: I've done it!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Oh, yes...
dialog: (he has too!)
text: Halfdan nods again and another order is rapped out. This
text: time a harpoon is fired from the prow. It thuds into GOLDEN
text: DRAGON and two of Halfdan's dog-soldiers start to winch the
text: line in. The two ships are hauled closer and closer.
text: The Vikings panic even more. Erik holds up the Cloak Invisible
text: and grins round at his men, knowing he is going to surprise
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Here! Here is the magic from the
dialog: King's daughter!
text: Erik's men watch, half skeptical and half hopeful. Erik enjoys
text: the moment of suspense. The he throws the Cloak Invisible
text: over his head and shoulders and grins round at his men
text: triumphantly, imagining he has vanished from their sight.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: There! I have become the wind!
text: The Vikings look at him, rather puzzled. Only Harald seems
dialog: to be impressed.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: How did he do that?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Vanish into thin air?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: He hasn't.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Well, where is he then?
text: Harald looks around. He is the only one who can't see Erik.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: He's THERE!
text: At this point Halfdan's ship suddenly bites into the side of
text: Golden Dragon. Erik leaps onto the side of Golden Dragon and
text: swings across onto Halfdan's ship. The Vikings react to the
text: horror of Halfdan's ship biting into Golden Dragon and to
text: Erik's blithe leap onto the enemy boat. Erik lands on the
text: deck of Halfdan's ship, and grins at the ferocious skull-
text: helmeted dog-soldiers.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Ooh! Scary! Scary! Don't we look
dialog: mean?
text: Two dog-soldiers look at each other, totally non-plussed.
text: Erik grimaces at Halfdan's men, and does a little pirouette
text: to show them all that he's invisible from every angle.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You can't see me! But I can see you!
text: He breaks into a little dance. Halfdan glares at his advisers.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: GISLI ODDSSON
dialog: That's Erik.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: Well, why isn't he scared of us?
text: Erik, meanwhile approaches one of the dog-soldiers and makes
text: silly faces at him.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Boo!
text: The dog-soldier topples overboard. The galley slaves watch
text: another dog-soldier fall into the hold amongst them and lie
text: there stunned. His sword falls onto the deck between the
text: slaves. One of the slaves throws down his oar, and picks up
text: the dog-soldier's sword. The slave-master suddenly appears.
text: Once again he speaks immaculate Japanese.
scene_heading: SLAVE-MASTER
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Hey! What's going on? Your big-
dialog: breasted women give me no pleasure
dialog: with their warmed-up fish and...
dialog: Urgh!
text: The slave-master strides down the ship to flay the offending
text: slave, but another slave trips him up and in a twinkling of
text: an eye four others have leapt on the slave-master (despite
text: their chains) and are extracting his keys.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: What's the matter? Haven't you seen
dialog: anyone fight before?
scene_heading: DOG-SOLDIER #1
dialog: No.
scene_heading: DOG-SOLDIER #2
dialog: They're usually too scared of us.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: KILL him!
text: Erik, still thinking he's invisible, is running amongst the
text: dog-soldiers, having fun. He runs one dog-soldier through
text: and kicks another overboard, then he runs past a few more,
text: right up to Halfdan himself. He whisks the Cloak Invisible
text: off his head for an instant.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (thinking he's
dialog: revealing himself)
dialog: Here I am!
text: Then he turns and is off. Halfdan turns to his aides.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: What?
text: BACK ON THE GOLDEN DRAGON
text: The Vikings' disbelief has turned to admiration.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I'm just building up to it, Dad.
text: Sven starts banging his head on the side of the boat.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: He's gone batty!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: No! The fear's gone!
text: Halfdan grabs a sword off one of his dead dog-soldiers and
text: thrusts it into the unwilling hands of his military adviser,
dialog: Eilif.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: Fight, damn you! Fight!
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
scene_heading: THE GOLDEN DRAGON
text: Now Sven leaps across onto Halfdan's ship followed by Ivar,
text: yelling. Snorri looks back at Keitel.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Well! Come on!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: I... I...
text: Keitel is thinking: "Maybe I should let Halfdan win" but he
dialog: knows he can't let a thing like that happen, now he is faced
text: with the reality of it. The companionship of the voyage has
dialog: brought them all too close for that.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Hang the Blacksmith's Code!
text: Keitel leaps to his feet and joins in the attack. Erik,
text: meanwhile, is swinging across the deck from a rope.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I am the air! I am the wind!
text: Keitel and Thorfinn are now fighting side by side.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: This is life, eh?
text: Keitel grins and strikes out. Ivar turns on Eilif who has
text: reluctantly joined the fray. Maybe he's singled Ivar out as
text: the most harmless. Ivar suddenly realizes he's only armed
text: with drumsticks. Eilif smiles evilly.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: Ooh... er...
text: Eilif's sword slices through Ivar's drumsticks. Ivar turns
text: to run, but is stopped by a dog-soldier. Eilif takes the
text: opportunity to run him through from behind.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: (as he dies)
dialog: Ouch.
text: Erik sees Ivar's demise.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Ivar!
text: Erik leaps to take revenge. He jumps into the galley-pit and
text: out again a la Douglas Fairbanks in "The Thief of Baghdad"
text: and dispatches Eilif with a single thrust. Sven and his dad
text: are fighting surrounded by dog-soldiers.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Well, go on! Go berserk!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: GIVE US A CHANCE, Dad!
text: Snorri appears from behind.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: (to Sven's dad)
dialog: What about you? Why don't YOU go
dialog: berserk?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: I got to keep my eye on HIM...
text: Sven's dad looks uneasy. He is surrounded and, as a seasoned
text: campaigner, knows they haven't much chance. Halfdan smiles
text: to himself. The battle is going his way. Thorfinn meanwhile
text: is fighting two dog-soldiers but is attacked from behind by
dialog: a third.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Look out! Thorfinn!
text: But it's too late. Thorfinn is run through the back. Sven
text: goes berserk and kills all three dog-soldiers. Sven's dad
text: looks on, proud of his son for the first time. Maybe their
dialog: relationship will never be the same again.
text: Now Snorri sees something that cheers him up. Slaves are
text: coming up from below to join the battle. They are armed with
text: oars and swords. They join the fray, knocking dog-soldiers
text: overboard with their oars. The dog-soldier are suddenly
text: outnumbered. Halfdan's smile fades, and he looks around for
text: an escape route. The tide of battle has now turned
text: dramatically as dog-soldier after dog-soldier is tossed over
text: the side or laid low by the combination of Vikings and slaves.
text: Halfdan and Gisli slip into a lifeboat and sneak off. The
text: rats are leaving the sinking ship.
text: BACK ON THE DECK
text: All the dog-soldiers are dead or overboard. The slaves and
text: Vikings are cheering and embracing each other. At the other
text: end of the boat, Sven is cradling the dying Thorfinn in his
text: arms. All around are jubilant slaves celebrating their
dialog: freedom.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Thorfinn! You can't die!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: I'm not frightened... of anything...
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: (dying)
dialog: No... he's not... not... there...
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Tell him I'm coming!
text: Thorfinn dies. Sven holds him and a tear comes down his face.
text: The danger has made comrades of the two rivals.
text: Erik, however, is still fighting a last lone dog-soldier;
text: but just as he is about to run him through the dog-soldier
text: is stabbed in the back. He sinks to the floor, revealing
text: another dog-soldier. Erik is outraged by this act of treachery
text: and turns on the assassin.
scene_heading: DOG-SOLDIER
dialog: No! No! Wait! Please wait, Erik!
text: The dog-soldier pulls his mask off to reveal he is, in fact,
text: Loki. Erik is totally non-plussed.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Halfdan wanted to stop you waking
dialog: the Gods... so... I disguised myself
dialog: to sabotage their plans.
text: Erik has meanwhile been joined by the remaining comrades.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: To save YOU, Erik.
dialog: Erik is about to say "But how can you see me? I'm wearing
dialog: the Cloak Invisible."
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But --
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It was my master Keitel's idea.
text: All eyes turn on Keitel who looks very uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Wasn't it, Keitel?
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Well... I... I thought...
text: Keitel is overcome by the power of Loki's will, but he is
text: deeply ashamed of his complicity in Loki's deeds. Snorri
text: gazes at Keitel with growing suspicion.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But... How is it you can see me?
dialog: (he looks round)
dialog: You can all see me?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What d'you mean?
scene_heading: SNORRI AND OTHERS
dialog: Why shouldn't we see you?
speaker_heading: HARALD
text: I can't see him.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I'm wearing the Cloak Invisible....
text: Erik takes it off to demonstrate.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Oh! There you are!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: You mean... you could see me all the
dialog: time?
text: The Vikings look at each other, mystified.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Weren't we supposed to?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh... I feel a little... oh...
text: Erik's knees give way and he faints onto the deck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: KING'S HALL - SOME TIME LATER
text: A victory celebration is in progress. It is a little bit
text: like a Hampstead cocktail party, and the rough, battle-stained
text: Vikings look rather out of place holding their little canapés.
text: Suddenly the King claps for silence.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: We are grateful to you, Erik, and to
dialog: your men...
speaker_heading: COURT
dialog: Yes, we are...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: And there is only ONE way we can
dialog: repay you... Musicians!
text: King Arnulf claps his hands. Erik rushes over to him, anxious
text: to avoid another Hy-Brasilian concert.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (hurriedly)
dialog: Well, we'd love to hear you sing
dialog: again, but what we'd really appreciate
dialog: would be if you could see your way
dialog: to lending... not giving of course...
dialog: but just lending us the... um...
dialog: the, well, to be quite blunt... the
text: Horn Resounding.
text: All the time Erik is talking the doors of the hall behind
text: are opening and a vast lur or horn is carried in by six
text: bearers. One or two of the Vikings have turned to look and
text: are now standing speechless. King Arnulf beams at Erik.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: It's yours.
text: Now Erik finally turns and looks at what everyone else is
text: looking at. Erik's jaw drops. Everyone in the court beams at
text: Erik, except Aud who is looking sad and disappointed.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (when he can find his
dialog: voice)
dialog: Is THAT it?
text: A cloud passes over King Arnulf's happy face.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Is there something the matter with
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Oh! No! No... of course not... it's
dialog: just I hadn't expected it to be quite
dialog: so big.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Well, it's not called the Horn
text: Resounding for nothing.
dialog: (aside)
dialog: You DO know how to play the horn,
dialog: don't you?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Yes... oh, yes...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Then I expect you'll be leaving first
dialog: thing in the morning.
text: The King manhandles Erik away from his daughter. Perhaps we
text: have the feeling that she's isn't going to let Erik go as
text: easily as that... Mix through to later that night. The Vikings
text: are lying asleep on the Great Hall, beside the Horn
text: Resounding. The camera closes in on Keitel. Suddenly a voice
text: comes from the shadows:
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Keitel! Keitel Blacksmith!
text: Keitel opens his eyes and finds Loki close beside him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What's the matter, Keitel Blacksmith?
dialog: Have you forgotten why you came on
dialog: this voyage?
text: Keitel is silent.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Are you going to let Erik wake the
dialog: Gods?
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: How can we stops him now?
text: Loki looks around and then opens his hand in front of Keitel.
text: In it is the mouthpiece from the Horn Resounding.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Take this and throw it from the cliff
dialog: heights. They'll never make the Horn
text: Resounding sound without it.
text: Keitel frowns. Then an obvious thought limps across his
dialog: muscular mind.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: But why me? Why don't you do it?
text: Somebody stirs.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Sh! Hurry!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: YOU do it!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You'll be able to throw it further
dialog: than I could.
text: Keitel thinks. This is true.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: It must go far out to sea.
text: Loki presses the mouthpiece on Keitel. Keitel takes it, but
text: reluctantly. Another Viking stirs.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Surely you haven't forgotten the
dialog: Blacksmith's Oath?
text: Keitel is about to reply and say he's been having second
text: thoughts about it, but somehow he can't. Loki has such power
text: over him.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: I...
text: Suddenly another Viking stirs, and Loki hisses at him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Hurry!
text: Loki pretend to go back to sleep. Keitel (feeling a bit
text: lumbered) thinks about his task and hesitates... Who knows?
text: Perhaps he is about to stand firm, but Loki plays his trump
dialog: card.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (without opening his
dialog: eyes)
dialog: Or I might have to tell Erik why you
dialog: really came on this voyage.
text: Keitel is caught. He closes his eyes in resignation and then
text: reluctantly starts to make his way out of the Hall. As he
text: gets to the doors he trips over Snorri, who wakes. The
text: mouthpiece falls a few feet away.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Who's that?
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: It's me. I'm just going to water the
dialog: dragon...
dialog: (he gives a false
dialog: laugh)
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Oh...
text: Snorri notices the silver mouthpiece on the floor, but he
text: pretends he hasn't.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Oh... clumsy idiot.
text: Snorri pretends to go back to sleep, but he opens one eye
text: and watches Keitel Blacksmith recover the mouthpiece, and
text: then follows Keitel out. Loki gets up too. He follows to
dialog: keep an eye on Snorri.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: AUD ON THE SHORE
text: Gazing moodily out to sea. She is brooding in Erik's imminent
text: departure. Suddenly a stone falls from above; she looks up
text: and sees a figure appear on the cliff above. Hurriedly she
text: withdraws into the shadows. Keitel Blacksmith appears on the
text: cliff-top. In his hands he holds the mouthpiece of the Horn
text: Resounding. He examines it, turning over in his mind whether
text: he is doing the right thing or not. Then he decides he must.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: My fellow blacksmiths.
text: He prepares to throw it.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: Keitel!
text: Keitel jumps out of his skin.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Get away, Snorri.
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: What have you got there?
text: Snorri advances towards Keitel. Keitel backs away, dangerously
text: near to the edge of the cliff. His boot slips and he jerks
text: himself forward. At the same time Snorri makes a grab for
text: the mouthpiece. A scuffle ensues, during which the mouthpiece
text: of the Horn Resounding is dropped. It bounces off the cliff
text: and falls down to the shore below. Aud steps out of the shadow
text: and picks it up. She frowns and looks up, and then screams,
text: as she sees the men fighting.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No!
text: But it's too late. Snorri goes white, gives a hideous gasp...
text: and sinks slowly to his knees -- revealing Loki standing
text: behind him with a bloody knife. As Keitel and Loki watch
text: Snorri die, a drop of blood from the knife falls to the
text: ground. The moment it lands, there is a deep subterranean
text: groan, and the earth begins to tremble violently. Keitel and
text: Loki look around in alarm.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Oh Gods! What have we done?
text: BACK IN THE KING'S HALL
text: Sven, Sven's dad and Harald are wide awake, but for the moment
text: paralyzed, as bits of masonry crash around them. The cheerful
text: figure of King Arnulf appears at the top of a stairway. He
text: raises his hands.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Stay calm! This is NOT happening.
text: The King then hurries out of a door at the top of the
text: staircase.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: What did he say?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Look out!
text: The doors of the Great Hall burst open and a wall of water
text: crashes through, knocking the Vikings off their feet. There
text: is little doubt that the whole of Hy-Brasil is sinking see a
text: street go down, a statue sink and then we:
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLOSEUP OF KING ARNULF
text: He is standing at the top of the Forum steps addressing a
text: crowd of anxious citizens. They are keeping surprisingly
text: good order considering they are already standing ankle-deep
text: in water, and the whole town is rapidly sinking around them.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Now, I know what some of you must be
dialog: thinking... the day has come....
dialog: we're all going down, etc. etc. But
dialog: let's get away from the fantasy and
scene_heading: look at the FACTS. FACT ONE -- The
dialog: threat of total destruction has kept
dialog: the peace for one thousand years.
dialog: FACT TWO -- The chances of it failing
dialog: now are therefore one in three hundred
dialog: and sixty-five thousand. FACT THREE...
text: By this time the water is up to people's knees, and several
text: have crowded onto the lower steps to avoid getting wet.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
scene_heading: FACT THREE -- Our safety regulations
dialog: are the most rigorous in the world.
dialog: We are all nice to each other, we
dialog: never rub each other up the wrong
dialog: way or contradict each other, do we?
speaker_heading: CROWD
dialog: No.
text: Rumble. The buildings sink and masonry falls.
speaker_heading: CITIZEN
dialog: We... er... do seem to be going down
dialog: quite fast, Your Majesty -- not trying
dialog: to contradict you, course.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: No, of course you're not, citizen.
dialog: But let's stick to the facts. There
dialog: has NEVER been a safer, more certain
dialog: way of keeping the peace. So
dialog: whatever's happening, you can rest
dialog: assured, Hy-Brasil is NOT sinking.
dialog: Repeat, NOT sinking.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: AN UNFORTUNATE HY-BRASILIAN
text: Who looks out of a window to see if it's raining, but is
text: immersed before he can find out.
text: The citizens in the Forum, however, are reassured by the
text: King's words -- even though they are now up to their waists
text: in water. One of them steps forward.
scene_heading: ANOTHER CITIZEN
dialog: May I just make a point in support
dialog: of what King Arnulf's just said?
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: We'd be delighted -- wouldn't we?
speaker_heading: CITIZENS
dialog: Yes, we'd certainly like to hear
dialog: what one of us has got to say...
text: Erik, Sven, Sven's dad and Harald struggle out of the Great
text: Hall, carrying their belongings and the Horn Resounding,
text: while the citizen is still speaking most articulately in
text: support of the King. They are ALMOST in a panic.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What are you all doing?
text: CITIZEN AT THE BACK
dialog: (cheerfully)
text: It's all right. It's not happening.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (urgently)
dialog: The place is sinking!
text: CITIZEN AT THE BACK
dialog: Yes... I thought it was too, but the
dialog: King's just pointed out that it can't
dialog: be.
speaker_heading: CITIZEN
dialog: (still speaking in
dialog: support of the King)
dialog: ...and, of course, we mustn't forget
text: King Arnulf's EXCELLENT eye for flower-
dialog: arranging.
text: There is a smattering of applause. A few people pull their
text: robes up out of the wet. Erik leaps onto a wall and shouts
text: to the crowd.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Save yourselves! Hy-Brasil... is
dialog: sinking.
text: There are a lot of knowing smiles amongst the citizens.
scene_heading: CITIZEN FROM MIDDLE
dialog: Look, you don't know our safety
dialog: regulations.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: It can't happen.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But it IS! Look!
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: (ignoring Erik)
dialog: The important thing is not to panic.
speaker_heading: CITIZENS
dialog: Quite... yes... we understand...
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: I've already appointed the Chancellor
dialog: as Chairman of a committee to find
dialog: out exactly what IS going on, and
dialog: meantime I suggest we have a sing-
dialog: song!
speaker_heading: CITIZENS
dialog: Good idea!
speaker_heading: ANOTHER
dialog: Can we do the one that goes "TUM-TI-
scene_heading: TUM-TI-TUM-TI-TUM"?
text: Erik looks around in despair.
text: Meanwhile in another street someone is struggling in the
text: floodwater.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I can't swim! I can't swim!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Relax!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I'm drowning! Help!
text: Loki grabs Keitel round the neck.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Let go!
text: But Keitel is pulled under. He re-emerges spluttering.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Help!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: You'll drown us bo...
text: But they go under again. At this point Erik, Sven, Sven's
text: dad and Harald swim round the corner, pushing the Horn
text: Resounding. They see the figures disappearing under the water.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Help!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Help!
text: Erik, Sven and Co. swim as fast as they can to rescue the
text: drowning pair. They struggle to overpower the panic-stricken
text: Loki, but he puts up a manic fight. Unexpectedly, Harald
text: Missionary suddenly unleashes a vicious right hook and lays
text: Loki out cold. There is a moment's stunned silence that is
text: no unmingled with indignation.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (with hurt surprise)
dialog: You hit him!
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Well, it's what you're supposed to
dialog: do... isn't it?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Look!
text: They look up as Golden Dragon sails around a corner of the
text: street, piloted by Aud. As the Vikings scramble aboard, the
text: sound of the "sing-song" reaches a particularly noisy and
text: discordant climax attract their attention.
text: BACK IN WHAT WAS THE FORUM
text: A crowd of unconcerned-looking citizens is sitting on the
text: last roof and just coming to the end of another appalling
dialog: song.
speaker_heading: CITIZENS
dialog: ...Te... Tum!
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: You know, I think we're getting
dialog: better.
speaker_heading: CITIZEN #1
dialog: (with genuine interest)
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: KING
dialog: (a bit stumped)
dialog: Er...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Father!
text: The King looks up.
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: It's all right! It isn't happening!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: But, Father, it IS!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Get on board!
speaker_heading: CITIZEN #2
dialog: No THANKS!
speaker_heading: CITIZEN #3
dialog: Who do you think YOU are?
speaker_heading: CITIZEN #1
dialog: Panic-monger!
text: The roof is now sinking rapidly, though the citizens appear
text: as unperturbed as ever.
speaker_heading: CITIZEN
dialog: Leave us alone!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Yeah. Leave 'em alone.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
speaker_heading: KING ARNULF
dialog: Well, my dear, I think you'll find
dialog: it's all a question of what you want
dialog: to believe in.... I have slightly
dialog: more experience of these matters
dialog: than you...
text: Unfortunately, at this point, the entire gathering of
text: citizens, the King and the Forum Temple disappear below the
dialog: waves.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Father!
text: (tears spring to her
dialog: eyes)
text: Harald Missionary has put his arm around Aud in a fatherly
dialog: way.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: There, my child... it's at times
dialog: like this that this book can be a
dialog: great help...
text: Erik shoos him away.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: (with his usual
dialog: promptness)
dialog: Right!
text: GOLDEN DRAGON spins alone in the wide ocean.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: SOME TIME LATER
text: They are all gathered in front of the Horn Resounding.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: We must blow the first note... he
dialog: note that will take us to Asgaard...
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (nervously and with
dialog: awe in his voice)
text: Over the Edge of the World.
text: The other men look up at the Horn Resounding, and begin to
text: feel a bit nervous.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We are going where only the dead
dialog: have been before...
text: Erik takes a deep breath and then puts his lips to the Horn
text: Resounding. He blows. There is a splutter, and one or two of
text: the Vikings titter amongst themselves. He has another go.
text: But again, all he produces is a pathetic spluttering.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (not unkindly in his
dialog: manner)
dialog: Uh! Here! Give it to me!
text: Sven pushes Erik aside. Sven blow... he becomes redder and
text: redder. But all he produces is a splutter. He gets a bit
dialog: angry.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Thor's blood!
text: Sven's dad looks heavenwards.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: You're not using the right technique.
text: Sven's dad tries to take it over.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: No! I'm doing it!
text: They start to struggle.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (getting angry)
dialog: You're always telling me... TELLING
dialog: me!
text: Erik tries to separate them.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Sven!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: (to his dad)
dialog: Let me do something for myself for a
dialog: change!
text: Suddenly Aud comes forward.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No! Don't quarrel!
text: Sven and his dad stop fighting, surprised by the vehement in
text: her voice.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: We'll never get where we want to go
dialog: if we fight.
text: Aud crosses to the Horn and inserts the mouthpiece. Loki
text: glances at Keitel. He hadn't bargained for this!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Er... don't blow it! You never know
dialog: WHAT might happen...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: It has not spoken for a thousand
dialog: years... You must bring it to life
dialog: with a kiss...
text: She puts her lips to the mouthpiece and just touches it with
text: them... almost a kiss... then... very gently... she begins
text: to blow... a soft... slight note can just be heard... Aud
text: takes her mouth away from the mouthpiece... and the soft
text: note goes on... reverberating... A sweet note... a magic
text: note... the Vikings stand stock-still, enchanted by the
text: sound... and the sound all the time is getting louder and
text: the Horn begins to vibrate with the note. As the volume
text: increases the Golden Dragon itself begins to reverberate
text: with the sound. Rings of ripples begin to radiate out from
text: the boat across the calm water. The note grows louder and
text: louder, and the Vikings, who at first were laughing and
text: cheering at Aud's success, begin to get rather alarmed. Louder
text: and louder gets the note and the Horn shakes and the boat
text: vibrates. Things start to be shaken loose, and fall onto the
text: deck. Ropes uncoil and run loose. A heavy block suddenly
text: crashes down to the deck, crowning Harald and laying him out
text: flat. Louder and louder grows the note, and the Vikings have
text: to stop their ears for the pain. The water around the ship
text: becomes more and more agitated. And then another sound is
text: heard. It is the thunder of water in the distance like a
text: million distant waterfalls. And suddenly they notice the sea
text: is running like a river -- all in one direction... sweeping
text: the ship forward with incredible momentum. In no time they
text: are engulfed in a mist, still traveling at a rate of knots.
text: Almost at once an appointed rock looms out of the mist ahead
text: of them. Erik flings himself at the steering oar, and everyone
text: is thrown about as the ship veers wildly and just misses the
text: rock, only to see another looming up ahead of them. The ship
text: veers again, as a third rock looms ahead. This time Sven has
text: grabbed a coil of rope, and as they pass the third rock, he
text: throws it like a lasso over the rock. Loki and Keitel leap
text: to grab the rope just as the rope goes taut and the ship
text: comes to a lurching stop, anchored by the rope, but still
text: swaying and buffeted in the racing waters. Those on board
text: shout to each other, soaked to the skin. It is difficult to
text: make out what they are shouting.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Help!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What d'you think? Help! Somebody
dialog: help us!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (pointing at Aud)
dialog: She wants to kill us!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: She wants to take us over the Edge
dialog: of the World!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: You want to get to Asgaard, don't
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: How do we know this is the way?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: We blew the Horn Resounding.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (screaming and pointing
text: an accusing finger
dialog: at Aud)
text: SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (shouting)
dialog: Don't you see, Erik! She wants
dialog: revenge!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: (to Keitel)
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: She knows it was our fault!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never
dialog: have listened to you!
text: Loki looks around desperately.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You've lost your mind.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: We came to stop you waking the Gods,
dialog: Erik! But I didn't want anyone to
dialog: get hurt!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: You fool!
text: Suddenly Loki produces his stiletto and leaps onto Keitel,
text: stabbing at him.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: I should have got rid of you long
dialog: ago!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Like you got rid of Snorri!
text: Erik tries to separate them.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No! No! We are in the spell of the
dialog: Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: That's right!
text: For a split second Erik is distracted. He looks across at
text: Aud and for a moment he sees Freya standing there.
speaker_heading: FREYA
dialog: Once you are in the spell of the
dialog: Horn, hatred will destroy you...
text: Then it is Aud once more. But in that split second Loki has
dialog: stabbed Erik.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Arrgh!
text: Erik staggers back clutching his arm. Keitel gives a roar of
text: rage, and picks Loki up bodily and hurls him out of the boat
text: into the maelstrom. The other Vikings look on aghast. Keitel
text: turns on them.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: He killed Snorri! He caused the land
dialog: of Hy-Brasil to sink! SHE knew!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: I didn't know!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Now she wants to send us over the
dialog: Edge of the World!
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: How else d'you think we're going to
dialog: get to Asgaard?
text: The Vikings look at each other amidst the roaring waters and
text: the thick spray. Erik holds his bleeding arm and looks at
text: Aud. Should he trust her or not? Suddenly he turns on the
dialog: others.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (shouting above the
dialog: din)
dialog: Do YOU know the way to Asgaard, Keitel
dialog: Blacksmith?
text: Keitel shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Do YOU know the way to Asgaard, Sven?
text: Sven shakes his head.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: There is one road before us, and
text: that leads over the Edge of the World.
text: Harald sits up as he returns to consciousness.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: There IS no Edge of the World.
text: Sven's dad bonks him again. Erik takes the rope and begins
text: paying it out. With grim faces the Vikings turn and face
text: towards the roaring of the waters, as Erik edge the ship
text: further into the mist. The noise is deafening. It would be
text: almost impossible to hear any voice above it.
text: The faces of the Vikings betray their fear as they find
text: themselves emerging from out of the mist at the Edge of the
text: World. They gape as they find themselves confronted by a
text: Waterfall of Seas -- stretching on either side of them -- as
text: far as the eye can see -- water falling and plunging over
text: the lip of the world. And in front of them -- the blue sky
text: continues on down and down until it shades into blackness
text: strewn with stars beneath their feet...
text: Sven, Sven's dad and Keitel edge to the prow and gasp.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No! Don't look over the Edge!
text: Erik lets out a little more rope, until the ship is protruding
text: over the edge. Sven, his dad and Keitel peer over the side,
text: and stare down into the abyss. They gasp. From above we see
text: the prow of Golden Dragon and the backs of the Vikings' heads
text: in plain view against a backdrop of stars below them.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Let me see!
text: Aud holds him back.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No. Don't look... The abyss will
dialog: suck away your strength.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
text: Erik turns to see Sven and Keitel trembling... They hold
text: onto the sides of the ship but their legs can barely support
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: There is nothing we can do...
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Helpless...
text: Keitel start to laugh.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Ha ha... I believed Loki... I believed
dialog: I had a duty to blacksmiths! Ha ha
dialog: ha!
text: Keitel laughs a little hysterically. Aud turns urgently to
dialog: Erik.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Do you believe I love you?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I... but I...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: You don't have to love me. Just: do
dialog: you believe I love YOU?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Yes -- I believe you do.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Then let go!
text: Erik hesitates, then he decides to believe in Aud. He throws
text: the rope away. At once the ship shoots off over the Edge of
text: the World into space... Everything seems to slow down, as
text: the longship drops down and down... the ship twists slowly
text: as it drops.... round and round. The Vikings gaze about them
text: in wonder, as they find their ship if falling in silence
text: amongst the stars. Harald comes to once again.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: I'm still seeing stars.
text: Keitel looks round at him.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: We're ALL seeing stars.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: No! I was hit on the head.
text: The longship falls and falls through the star-strewn space
text: until it softly lands in a white wilderness.
text: On the deck the Vikings are huddles up, covered with rime-
text: frost. It seems as if they have been lying there half-frozen
dialog: for some time.
dialog: Perhaps the entire adventure has all been a dream, and they
dialog: have been stuck in the Arctic pack-ice the whole time. The
text: hallucinations of men near to death.
text: Aud tries to wake Erik.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Don't sleep... wake... Look!
text: Erik opens his eyes and, for an instant, he sees Helga. He
text: blinks and realizes it is Aud who is calling him back to
text: consciousness. Suddenly colored lights begin to play to his
text: face.
speaker_heading: ERIK
text: Bi-Frost... The Rainbow Bridge.
text: Above them the Aurora Borealis stretches up, magnificent and
text: awesome in the sky. Erik makes his way through the other
dialog: Vikings.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Wake up!
text: The others slowly begin to rouse themselves from their icy
text: slumber and sit up, awed by the sight.
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Are we dead?
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: The Rainbow Bridge.
text: They all peer up at the ever-changing colors of the Aurora
text: Borealis, hanging in the sky above them like organ-pipes.
text: But something is happening. The lights begin to fade to reveal
text: a magical city on a mountain. The Vikings realize that this
text: is journey's end... they have reached Asgaard... the City of
text: the Gods. The Vikings all catch their breaths and gaze in
dialog: awe.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Asgaard!
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Up there, you fathead.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: Up WHERE?
text: Harald look round quizzically at the others. It is clear
text: that he can see nothing.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Look! It's real.
text: Harald looks around at the others.
speaker_heading: HARALD
text: Hallucinations are real.
text: It's no use; Harald can see nothing. The Vikings, transfixed
text: by the sight of their fabled home of the Gods, rise to their
text: feet. Aud whispers to Erik.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: The second note.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: The second note to wake the Gods...
text: Erik kneels in front of the Horn.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Gently...
text: Erik blows... a soft gentle note... He takes his mouth away,
text: and smiles at Aud. Once again the Horn stars to vibrate and
text: the note gets louder... the ship starts to vibrate... louder
dialog: and louder...
text: The whole landscape starts to vibrate... louder and louder
text: grows the note until even the stars in the sky are vibrating
text: and then a magical thing starts to happen... The note fades
text: as one by one the shimmering stars start to fall out of the
text: night sky... they fall like silver snow... until the ship...
text: the Vikings... Asgaard... the whole landscape is covered in
text: sparkling dust... then in the ensuing silence the first light
text: begins to glow in the Halls of Asgaard... then another...
text: and another... Erik stares as is bewitched and slowly begins
text: to climb out of Golden Dragon.... but Aud tries to pull him
dialog: back.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Erik! You've done what you came to
dialog: do!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Not quite...
text: Aud looks at him.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Blow the third note! The note to
dialog: take us home!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: There is something I must ask the
dialog: Gods...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: No living man has ever set foot in
dialog: the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods
dialog: will never let you return.
text: Erik looks at her... for a moment... But he knows he has no
dialog: choice.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: I came to find my grandfather.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I have to go...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Then I shall come too.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (stares at her)
dialog: No... no...
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But, Aud... I... I came to find
dialog: someone...
text: Aud is about to say "Her?", but she bites the word back and
text: looks down at the ground.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I'm sorry, Aud... I really am.
text: Aud kisses Erik, who then turns and climbs out of Golden
text: Dragon and sets off across the ice. Sven follows.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Wait for me! I'll be dead soon
dialog: anyway...
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: You can't go without me!
text: They follow. Even Harald Missionary starts to follow.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Where are they all going?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Aren't you afraid?
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Oh... There's nothing for ME to be
dialog: afraid of.
text: Harald smiles and sets off after the others. Aud follows.
text: The stars have fallen to form a shining, winding pathway up
text: to the City of the Gods. This is what the Vikings head for.
text: Between them and the Citadel strange huge forms rise up. The
text: Vikings approach and find the vast skeletons of the slain
text: giants. The Vikings are but tiny gnat-sized figures wending
text: their way between the vast figures.
text: They climb the stairway-path of stars, up the winding road
text: and eventually fins themselves outside the massive doors of
dialog: Asgaard.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Valhalla...
text: Sven turns on Harald.
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: There! It's real! It's solid! Now do
dialog: you believe us?
text: He pats the wall of Valhalla -- the Great Hall. Harald reaches
text: out, but his hand goes right through the wall.
speaker_heading: HARALD
text: There isn't anything.
text: Harald Missionary walks straight through the wall and
text: disappears from sight. The Vikings gasp, and run up to feel
text: the point where he disappeared. The door is perfectly solid
text: to them, and they jump pout of their skins as Harald suddenly
text: reappears again.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: You're having me on, aren't you?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: It's Valhalla -- where the warriors
text: slain in battle go.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: It doesn't exist for him.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: He's just s cynic.
text: At this moment there is a creak and the great doors
text: mysteriously swing open. As if mesmerized, the Vikings enter
text: the Halls of Asgaard. The door slams behind them. They spin
text: round, but the doors have vanished... No man has ever entered
text: the Halls of Asgaard and left alive...
text: Erik slowly starts to cross the vast floor looking around
text: him as he does so. One by one the other Vikings follow. After
text: a while Erik stops.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Listen!
text: The Vikings listen. They hear the sound of children laughing
text: and shouting. Erik and his men follow through the columns
text: towards a pool of light. The scene that greets their eyes is
dialog: not at all what they had been prepared for.
text: Valhalla is not full of the warriors slain in battle, quaffing
text: mead on the ale-bench and reliving old battles -- it is,
text: instead full of children romping, laughing, shouting,
text: quarreling and playing games... chess, fencing... dice...
text: tag, etc., around a wide hearth fire. Women are cooking and
dialog: doing other housewifely things... weaving, making bread,
text: etc. It is a thoroughly domestic scene. Suddenly one of them
text: turns at Erik. It is Helga, whom Erik accidentally killed in
text: Scene One. She is once again kneading dough. She has a red
text: stain under her breast.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Oh good! It's Mr. Wonderful!
text: Erik leaps to her side.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I've come to take you back to the
dialog: land of the living.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: What a stupid idea.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (mortally hurt)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: What's the point of being dead in
dialog: the land of the living?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I'll ask the Gods to give you life
dialog: again!
text: Helga looks at Erik very skeptically. She obviously thinks
text: he doesn't know what he's talking about. Aud reacts. Erik
text: takes Helga's hand -- and gets covered in dough.
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Have you tried to ask the God for
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Well... no...
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: Who is he talking to?
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Sh!
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Odin!
text: One of the children, throwing pennies against the wall, looks
dialog: round.
speaker_heading: CHILD-ODIN
dialog: I'm busy.
text: The Vikings are recovering from their surprise.
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Odin?
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: (getting back to her
dialog: kneading)
text: He's busy.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Is THAT Odin?
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: You'll have to wait till he's finished
dialog: his game.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (shouting across)
dialog: Odin!
text: Odin leaves his game and saunters towards Erik.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: We have come from the world of
dialog: Midgard...
text: The child whom Odin is playing with points his hammer at the
text: ground near Erik and a lightning bolt zaps into it. Erik
dialog: jumps.
speaker_heading: CHILD-THOR
text: Clear off.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: No, wait, Thor.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You must help us.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: We don't HAVE to help anybody.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun --
text: men fight and kill each other the
dialog: whole time.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Why should WE care?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Because... you're... you're the
dialog: Gods....
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: So?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Bring the Age of Ragnarok to an end
dialog: and stop all this fighting and
text: bloodshed.
text: Harald looks around at the Vikings in increasing desperation.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: This is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Sh!
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Right!
text: The other Child-Gods have stopped playing around now and are
text: watching Erik and Odin.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Erik the Viking! The things you seek
dialog: are not in our power. We don't make
dialog: men love each other or hate each
dialog: other.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: But you're the Gods!
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Look... Erik...
text: Odin whistles. The other children look over their shoulders.
text: From out of the darkness of the perimeter of the Hall, shadows
text: emerge... shadows that, as they shuffle and stumble into the
text: light, reveal themselves to be the heroes that the Vikings
dialog: had expected to find in Valhalla. But they are not hale and
text: hearty giants quaffing mead and reliving their great
dialog: battles... they are, in fact, a sorry lot... the slain-in-
text: battle still bearing the hideous deformities of their fatal
text: wounds. Most have a sword or an axe buried in some part of
text: their anatomy. One has been cleft in twain...
text: The Vikings react to this grisly gathering as more and more
text: of them emerge from the shadows. They gasp as they notice
text: Snorri, Ivar, Thorfinn, Loki and Leif the Lucky.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: Snorri! Ivar!
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Here we are standing on a bare
text: mountain top talking to thin air.
text: We notice that Harald's cloak is being blown about as if he
text: were indeed on a bare mountain top. The other's cloaks are
text: still. Sven's dad is gazing across at one horribly mutilated
dialog: specimen.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: (disbelievingly)
dialog: How can you tell?
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: I'll never forget him! The BASTARD!
text: Sven reacts. Sven's dad starts to go berserk.
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: He drove me mad!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Easy, Dad!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: And his "you'll never be a Berserk
dialog: if you lose your temper"...
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: I hate you! I hate you!
text: Sven's dad collapses against Sven and Sven comforts him,
text: understandingly. A figure emerges from the throng of dead.
text: It is Thorfinn. Sven looks up at him.
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: You won, Sven.
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: What right have YOU to try and stop
dialog: men fighting, Erik the Viking? There
dialog: is glory in battle. There are riches
dialog: to be made and won...
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: Made by YOU, Loki!
speaker_heading: LOKI
dialog: By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't
dialog: you know, Erik, that is why he went
dialog: with you? Ragnarok was good for his
dialog: business...
speaker_heading: KEITEL
dialog: It's not my business any more!
text: Suddenly there is a howl... a bitter howl that echoes above
text: and around the Halls of Asgaard and that gets more distant
text: and more distant. Everyone (including the dead heroes and
text: the Gods) freezes and looks up, listening. Perhaps we cut
text: away to the boiling sky as it resolves itself into the shape
text: of a wolf that snarls and slinks away. Odin turns to Erik as
text: the howling recedes.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Fenrir the Wolf has gone, Erik. But
dialog: will men cease fighting each other?
dialog: THAT is not in our power...
text: Odin starts to laugh. All the other children start to laugh...
text: so do the dead heroes. Erik and his men look round uneasily.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I have one more request before we
dialog: return...
text: Erik turns towards Helga, who is still standing at her trough
text: of dough with her arms up to her elbows in flour. Aud watches
text: Erik with sadness in her heart.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Return? You have set your foot in
dialog: the Halls of Asgaard, Erik. You cannot
dialog: return.
text: Aud looks round to see how the others react. It is as she
text: had feared. Erik pales. The blood drains from the other's
text: faces. Aud whispers something to Harald. Harald looks at her
text: blankly.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: (whispering)
speaker_heading: PLEASE!
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: But you're all imagining this...
dialog: whatever it is.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: (earnestly)
dialog: You're the only one who can. PLEASE.
text: Harald look around at the dumbfounded Vikings. Then he shrugs
text: and wanders off, disappearing through the closed doors of
dialog: Valhalla.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You mean... we must stay here forever?
text: As he says this Erik's eyes turn again towards Helga. He is
text: clearly thinking at least there are compensations... Odin,
text: however, is laughing again.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: Stay HERE? Ha ha! This is Valhalla.
dialog: This is reserved for those slain-in-
dialog: battle.
scene_heading: HORRIBLY SLAIN WARRIOR
dialog: (grinning cheerfully)
dialog: Yeah! We're the LUCKY ones!
scene_heading: HORRIBLY SLAIN FRIEND OF HIS
dialog: Yeah. It's much better than dying of
dialog: old age.
text: The ghastly and dismembered dead warriors all chortle no end
text: at the dismay written on the face of Erik and his men. At
text: the same time there is a grinding, wincing sound. All those
text: around the hearth-place fall back as a vast grating is winced
text: up from out of the flames. The Vikings look at each other.
speaker_heading: ODIN
dialog: For YOU there is only the Pit of
dialog: Hel!
text: As Odin says this there is a roaring sound and the flames
text: and smoke are suddenly reversed and as the roaring increases
text: the flames are sucked down altogether to reveal the black
text: Pit of Hel itself. And now the Pit is sucking the Vikings
text: into it... their hair blows... they try to withstand the
text: force that is drawing them towards the abyss... The Gods
text: look on in some amusement. But some of the dead are concerned.
scene_heading: SVEN'S GRANDFATHER
dialog: Son! My son!
speaker_heading: SVEN'S DAD
dialog: Get lost!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: Dad! Grandfather!
text: Sven tries to reconcile his father and grandfather, but it's
text: no use. He is sucked towards the Pit.
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Help!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: (to Helga)
dialog: I tried to save you!
speaker_heading: HELGA
dialog: Why should you care?
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I don't know! I just did!
text: Erik can no longer withstand the force that is sucking him
text: down to the Pit of Hel. Suddenly, however, Snorri has leapt
text: from the ranks of the dead. He grabs Erik and tries to stop
text: him sliding towards the Pit of Hel. But it's no good.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: No! Let go, Snorri!
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: I've got you!
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: You'll be sucked down too!
speaker_heading: SNORRI
dialog: No! Arrgh!
text: Meanwhile, Ivar and Thorfinn and Leif the Lucky have also
text: leapt forward to save their comrades. They put up a fantastic
text: struggle but remorselessly they are all sucked down.
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Aagh!
text: The Vikings clutch at the stone floor, their fingers trace
text: blood as they try to cling on... but to no avail. The first
text: are already toppling into the Pit.
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Noooh!
speaker_heading: VIKINGS
dialog: Ah!
text: And the rest -- including Aud -- soon follow.
text: The mouth of the Pit of Hel, through which the Vikings are
text: now tumbling higgledy-piggledy, is a round white disc set in
text: the unutterable blackness of the pit. However, as the Vikings
text: free-fall slowly towards camera, they are lit up by a faint,
text: reddish glow from below. They are staring, wild-eyed and
text: screaming as they fall. As they fall, Erik manages to smash
text: his axe into the side of the Pit. Thorfinn grabs his leg and
text: holds onto Sven's foot. Leif clutches at Sven's belt. Sven's
text: dad hangs onto Sven's foot. Ivar clutches Thorfinn's foot.
text: Erik clutches Ivar's leg and Aud clutches Erik's. They dangle
text: like this for some seconds, and look fearfully beneath them.
text: Then they can see the Infernal Regions of flame and molten
text: lava... somehow suggesting the face of a huge and sinister
text: creature. No wonder they're scared out of their wits.
text: Meanwhile, Odin and Thor appear at the top of the Pit and
text: look down with mild amusement. Thor casually points his hammer
text: and a streak of lightning zaps Erik's axe. It instantly glows
text: red hot. Erik screams. Suddenly we hear a new sound -- a
text: long, high, sweet note.
speaker_heading: AUD
dialog: Listen! LISTEN! The third note!
text: But it's no good. Erik has to let go of the red-hot axe.
text: Everyone screams as they start to plunge down towards the
dialog: Pit of Hel.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
speaker_heading: GOLDEN DRAGON
text: Harald Missionary is blowing the Horn Resounding.
scene_heading: HARALD MISSIONARY
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: I want to go home... Oooh!
text: Suddenly Golden Dragon, the Horn Resounding and Harald
text: Missionary shoot up into the air and disappear from sight.
scene_heading: CUT BACK TO:
text: THE PIT OF HEL
text: The Vikings are looking down as they fall -- they are still
text: scared but gradually start laughing... laughing as they fall
text: down and down and down until they fall out of sight. We are
text: left with a blackness and just the white disc of the mouth
text: of the Pit of Hel above, until the disc changes magically
text: into the moon. There is a series of splashes.
text: The note begins to fade and the camera slowly pans down to
text: reveal the Vikings all fallen into the duck pond back at
text: Ravensfjord. They are laughing and whooping and splashing
dialog: each other.
speaker_heading: ERIK
dialog: I don't believe it... Ha ha ha! It
dialog: brought us HOME!
speaker_heading: LEIF
dialog: But who BLEW it?
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
speaker_heading: THORFINN
dialog: Mum! Dad!
speaker_heading: SVEN
dialog: We're back!
text: Sven embraces his father and dances him around with joy.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: Yo hoo! We're here! We're...
text: Suddenly the joy drains from their faces and they each gape
text: in horror. What is it they see?
text: We cut to see that out of the huts the women and children
text: and old men are emerging -- but they are anything but happy.
text: In fact they are all bound and gagged. Behind them emerge
text: the sinister figures of Halfdan the Black, Gisli and maybe
text: half a dozen armed men. Halfdan and his cronies no longer
text: look sleek and self-assured. They are haggard and desperate.
text: Their faces are streaked with dirt and sweat, and their
text: clothes are torn and soiled. They have clearly been going
dialog: through a lean time, since Ragnarok ended, and have descended
text: on the village for revenge and for whatever plunder they can
text: find. They have a few sackfuls of booty with them. They herd
text: the women, children and old men into a pathetic huddle in
text: the middle of the village. Halfdan is spitting evil and
dialog: hatred.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: Throw down your weapons -- or we
dialog: shoot the children first.
text: Erik hesitates... The others look at him. What choice have
text: they? Reluctantly, Erik throws his weapons into the pond.
text: The others follow suit. Halfdan watches. His men stand around
text: him in a tight group with their backs to each other.
speaker_heading: HALFDAN
dialog: Good... Good... Right, now we'll
dialog: just shoot the children anyway...
text: Erik is paralyzed. What can they do? Half Halfdan's men are
text: aiming their crossbows at Erik and his comrades, and half
text: are aiming at the women and children. They raise the crossbows
text: to shoot. Their fingers tighten on the triggers.
text: Suddenly there is a scream from above.
speaker_heading: HARALD
dialog: Look out below!
text: Everyone looks up and, amazingly, out of the sky falls Golden
text: Dragon and lands fair and square on top of Halfdan and his
text: gang, squashing them flat. Harald Missionary staggers blearily
text: from the wreckage.
scene_heading: GRIMHILD HOUSEWIFE
dialog: Harald!
text: She rushes to Harald, while the Vikings rush to release their
dialog: loved ones. Great celebrations all round.
speaker_heading: IVAR
dialog: Look!
text: They all turn and see the sun rising. The villagers gasp in
text: wonder. They've never seen the sun before. Erik looks around
text: and sees Thorfinn and Sven with their arms round each other.
text: Aud looks up as Erik smiles at he and holds her to him. Then
text: they all turn and gaze at the spectacle of the sun returning
dialog: to the world.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT:
speaker_heading: THE END
dialog:
