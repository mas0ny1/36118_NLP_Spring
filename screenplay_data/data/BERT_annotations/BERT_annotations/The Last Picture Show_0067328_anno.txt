scene_heading: EXT. ARCHER CITY SQUARE - DAWN 1
text: cold, windy morning in Texas. Except for one car -- an
text: old white Nash that belongs to ANDY FANNER, the night-
text: watchman, the square is deserted. Wind blows the curling
text: dust down the empty main street, past the picture show,
text: a laundry, a dinky beauty parlor, a grocery store. A
text: black Chevrolet pickup, vintage 1941, is coughing its way
text: up the long road toward the square.
scene_heading: ’S PI iP Cl CITY SQUAR: — DAWN 2
text: SONNY CRAWFORD riddles intently with the choke, trying to
text: keep the pickup running. The radio is on but the sound
text: of the motor all but drowms it out. In front of the
text: picture show, the pickup dies and the popular 1951 song
text: fills the cab. Sonny relaxes, yawns, peers at the movie
text: posters a moment. (He wears a Levi jacket and his hair
text: is neatly combed -- except for a cowlick at the back,
text: which sticks straight up; now and then, he tries to smooth
text: it down.) Before hitting the starter again, he blows into
text: his hands. The pickup grinds for a minute, then kicks off
text: -- Sonny races the engine before moving on. At the red
text: light he looks over at Fanner, who is asleep in the front
text: seat; his feet, in heavy brogans, are visible, propped on
text: the dashboard, A pickup with three horses in it goes
text: through the light. Sonny starts to turn toward the pool-
text: hall, but far down the street sees a figure sweeping, and
text: drives that way instead. BILLY is sweeping down the
text: white line, toward the city limits sign, ribbons of dust
text: around the broom. (He too wears a frayed Levi jacket --
dialog: also an old red baseball cap.)
text: Sonny pulls up beside him and taps his horn. Billy looks
text: up, grins happily, trots around and gets into the cab.
text: Sonny makes a sweeping U-turn, reaches over and turns
text: Billy’s cap around backwards. Billy grins. The song is
text: over and an announcer comes on:
speaker_heading: COTTONSEED CLARK (v.o.)
dialog: Folks, ol’ Cottonseed Clark talkin’

speaker_heading: 00: - DAWN 4
text: Sonny parks in front of the poolhall; he and Billy
text: hurry in -- the dust blowing.
speaker_heading: Lr POO: - DAWN 5
text: Near the front, there’s a counter, a small candy case,
text: and a green Dr. Pepper machine. SAM ("the lion") is
text: bent over the snooker table, brushing the felt care-
text: fully and slowly. (He wears an old mackinaw and a
text: pair of thoroughly run-down sheepskin house shoes. )
text: He winces at the inrush of cold wind, but gives the
text: boys no more than a glance. As he bends to brush again
text: he is seized with a coughing fit and has to stop brush-
text: ing until the fit subsides, going behind the counter
dialog: for his cough medicine.
text: During Sam’s seizure, Billy picks up a piece of pool-
text: chalk and ildy begins to lick it. Sonny gets himself
text: a Peanut Pattie and a Dr. Pepper; puts a nickel on
text: the counter and goes over to stand right in front of
text: the old, open-burner gas stove to warm himself. Sam
text: starts to roll a cigarette.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (fondly)
dialog: Well, you’ve already spent a
dialog: dime today an’ you ain’t even
dialog: had a decent breakfast.
text: Sam holds out his hand for the chalk Billy is licking.
text: Billy, his tongue quite green, hands it to him, and
text: comes to stand next to Sonny, who grabs his cap. Sam
text: watches as Billy lunges for it and Sonny feints and
text: throws it across the room. - Billy goes to get it.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: (lighting cigarette)
dialog: I’m surprised you had the nerve
dialog: to come in this mornin’, after
dialog: the stompin’ y’all took.
speaker_heading: SONNY
dialog: (munching candy)
dialog: Coulda been worse.

text: Abilene comes in, gives them a nod, unzips his cover-
text: alls and hangs them on a nail. (His flannel shirt
text: has pearl buttons, and his gabardine pants are well-
text: pressed.) Billy begins to sweep along one side of
text: the poolhall, restlessly.

dialog: Wouldn’t hurt if you had a better

text: Billy sweeps to the door, scared of Abilene; he goes
text: out as Abilene comes by Sonny, who holds the cue awk-
text: wardly, wishing he’d never picked it up. Abilene adds
text: the fifty dollar bill to a huge wad held together by
text: a money clip.
speaker_heading: ABILENE

dialog: | You’re a damn sight more dangerous
dialog: 1 in a poolhall than you are on a
dialog: foolball field. Ever heard of
dialog: tackling?
text: Sonny puts up his cue. Abilene breaks a rack of red-
text: balls, moves smoothly around the table. Sam starts to
text: cough again and Sonny goes out.
scene_heading: 8 T. POOLHALL - DAY 8
text: Billy is three doors away, sweeping at the swirling dust.
text: As Sonny catches up with him, a pickup stops in the mid-
text: ddle of the street. THREE YOUNG ROUGHNECKS huddle in
text: the back, their coat collars turned up. One is DUANE

dialog: Boy, I froze my ass last night.
text: He and Sonny grab Billy, each getting an arm. As they
text: hustle him back to the poolhall, the DRIVER of the pickup
text: honks his horn at them, and yells out his window.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Why the fuck can’t you kids learn
dialog: to tackle?!
text: At a loss for a reply, the boys look at each other, hustle
text: Billy back to the poolhall, and turn to go. Sam leans out
text: the door with a green change-sack in his hand, yells over
dialog: the wind.
speaker_heading: SAM
dialog: How about takin’ Genevieve some
dialog: change -- since you’re going?
text: He heaves the sack underhanded -- Duane leaps up and
text: catches it one-handed, trous along, fades, and throws a
text: short pass to Sonny, who catches it, stops, stoops, and
text: centers the sack back to Duane. They go on down the
text: street, spiritedly throwing the sack back and forth
text: between them. TWO MECHANICS are standing near the cafe,
text: one of them morosely kicking at the tire of his car. They
text: observe the boys without changing their poker-faced
dialog: expressions.
speaker_heading: 1ST MECHANIC
dialog: Look at that, Larry. They can

text: The boys stop and frown, but the two men sullenly stare
text: them down, so they g6 into the cafe, which is rundown on
text: the outside -- much of the paint peeling off, the sign
text: not hanging straight.
dialog: 
dialog: Rev. 10/2/70 : 6.
scene_heading: 9 INT. CAFE — DAY 9
dialog: 
text: Small, clean and cozy, with bright linoleum, four red
text: leatherette booths, several stools, and a shiny juke-
text: box, which is playing. TWO COWBOYS are sitting at the
text: counter, a DRILLER with a toothpick in his mouth is at
text: the cash register, and some ROUGHNECKS occupy two of
text: the booths. Duane tosses the sack one final time, but
text: in catching it Sonny almost runs into GENEVIEVE, carry-
text: ing several plates of sausage and eggs in her hands.
text: Stepping back, the swinging door to the kitchen hits her
text: on the behind; she fixes them with a fond but stern eye.
speaker_heading: GENEVIEVE
dialog: All right, you boys, knock it off
dialog: -- I got problems enough without
dialog: you playing the game over again.
text: A cowboy looks around at them with disgust. *

text: The boys laugh and stand in front of the jukebox as
