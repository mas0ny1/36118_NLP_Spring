dialog: E. Nicholas Mariani
dialog: September 13th, 2011
dialog: "One man with courage makes a majority."
dialog: --Andrew Jackson
speaker_heading: OVER BLACK;
text: The sound of HOWLING WIND builds with MUSIC, growing louder
text: and louder as the following words appear:
speaker_heading: AUTUMN, 1918.
text: The deadliest year in American history is drawing to a close.
dialog: At home, more than 675,000 people have died from Spanish
dialog: Influenza; a devastating plague that will ultimately claim
text: more than 50 million lives around the world.
text: These words fade. Replaced by:
text: In Europe, soldiers fighting in the brutal trenches of World
text: War I have perished at a rate unrivaled in modern warfare.
text: Those fortunate enough to see Armistice Day have started to
text: come home...only to discover their communities in ruin.
text: These words fade. Replaced by:
dialog: The nation is in mourning, more people have died in the past
dialog: twelve months than in all American wars combined. In many
text: parts of the country, schools and churches remain closed and
dialog: public gatherings, even funerals, are strictly prohibited.
text: These words fade. Replaced by:
dialog: It is a dark, terrible time...for everyone.
text: The wind and music continue to build. Finally, they crescendo
text: together, like the cries of ghosts in agony--
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- DAWN
text: And then -- suddenly -- everything is quiet and peaceful.
text: The sun rises over a distant ridge, revealing a lonely RANCH
text: nestled in the valley far below.
text: This place feels safe and remote; a tiny island in an ocean
text: of green, far away from the horrors of the world.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: FRANK SULLIVAN (45) wakes up and slowly climbs out of bed. He
text: struggles at first; stiff and sore. Once a rugged cowboy,
text: Frank is now approaching middle-age in the 20th century; a
text: Man used up and no longer relevant.
dialog: But there is power in him, yet. A lifetime of farming has
text: left his body in better shape than most men half his age.
text: Frank makes his way through the quiet house; sad and lonely--
text: PICTURES of his FAMILY (wife, daughter, & son) decorate every
text: room and line every hallway. But they are nowhere to be seen.
text: Frank Sullivan is all alone.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MORNING
dialog: 
text: Frank brews a pot of coffee and fixes some breakfast,
text: listening to the silence as it weighs heavy all around...
text: In a nearby window, a GOLD STAR BANNER shines brightly in the
text: morning sun; a timeless symbol of sacrifice and loss.
text: In addition, two BLACK SILK CREPES hang over the front door,
dialog: letting us know death has visited this house recently.
dialog: And on more than one occasion.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- LATE MORNING
dialog: 
text: Frank is hard at work, repairing a broken fence. Each hammer
text: strike echoes and fades, the only sound for miles...
text: Frank suddenly hears a distant rumbling. He slowly looks up--
text: A MODEL-T FORD appears over the hill, bouncing along at ten
text: miles an hour. Frank squints, recognizing the driver--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: For God's sake...
text: The car pulls over and comes to a stop. TOM DONOVAN (40s)
text: climbs out, wearing a sheriff's uniform--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Heya, Frank...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Finally bought one, huh?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nah, belongs to the city. Being
dialog: mayor has its perks. You should
dialog: come into town more often. They
text: outnumber horses, now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That’s not something I care to see.
dialog: (Then, noticing)
dialog: What’s with the uniform?
text: Tom glances at his shirt as he pops the trunk of his car...
dialog: Tom bends
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh, yeah...guess you wouldn’t have
dialog: heard. I took over for Bill Stevens
dialog: after he passed.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're the sheriff, now?
speaker_heading: TOM
text: Just until they find a replacement.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I didn’t realize it was legal to
dialog: hold two public offices.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It probably isn’t.
text: over and lifts out a large BIRTHDAY PRESENT--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What the hell is that?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Think I’d forget?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Think I need a reminder?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know, a simple ‘thank you’
dialog: would do. This isn’t the easiest
dialog: place to get to.
text: Frank nods and reluctantly takes the package--
dialog: Tom shuts
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s heavy...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah, it’s a nice gift, Frank.
text: the trunk and turns to face his friend. BEAT.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You drove all the way up here just
dialog: to give me this?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Seemed like a good time to stop by,
dialog: see how you’re doing...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: And how am I doing?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I don’t know. You tell me.
text: Frank hesitates, not sure what to say.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You wanna cup of coffee before
dialog: heading back?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: Sure, that’d be great.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank sets the birthday present down on the kitchen counter
text: and starts to brew another pot of COFFEE...
text: Tom stands nearby, his eyes quietly roaming--
text: He sees the GOLD STAR BANNER hanging in the window. And two
text: black SILK CREPES draped across the front door...
text: And then Tom notices a MILITARY SWORD mounted in a glass
dialog: case; sheathed and locked away...from an era long ago--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: ‘Get that in Cuba?
text: Frank looks up as he pours some coffee. Finally, he nods--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: ‘Thought so. You ever hear from any
dialog: of the old guys?
text: Frank shakes his head as he walks across the room...
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Me, neither. Too bad. I hear
dialog: Roosevelt’s not doing well.
dialog: (Takes the coffee)
dialog: Thanks...
text: Tom takes a sip and nearly spits it out--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: God, that’s awful...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know. I don’t make it as good as
dialog: Emily used to.
text: Tom hesitates, then takes another sip...this time without
text: complaint. He nods at the birthday present--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: C’mon, open it.
text: Frank takes a deep breath and tears away the wrapping paper
text: ...-revealing a brand new VICTROLA PHONOGRAPH--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You seen these things? Everyone's
dialog: got ‘em. Here, let me show you...
text: Tom places a RECORD on the wheel and lowers the needle...
text: Softly, suddenly-- MUSIC FILLS THE HOUSE
text: It floats down empty hallways and creeps into vacant rooms,
text: hanging gently in the air beside pictures and portraits of
dialog: people who have left, never to return.
text: Frank’s eyes well with emotion--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Emily and I used to dance to this.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I know. Thought you’d like it.
dialog: Got ya some others, too...
text: Tom hands over a collection of RECORDS. Frank shuffles
text: through the titles, stopping at one in particular--
dialog: AFTER YOU'VE GONE by Marion Harris
text: Frank stares at the record, suddenly overwhelmed. He looks up
text: at his friend and finally says--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Thank you, Tom.
text: Tom slowly nods as the song comes to an end. He carefully
text: lifts the needle and silence fills the room.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s new in town?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You mean besides the horseless
dialog: carriage? A lot, actually. Most of
dialog: the construction that was going on
dialog: before the flu hit started up
dialog: again. Think the car’s impressive?
dialog: You should see some of these
text: buildings that are going up. The
dialog: world’s changing before our very
dialog: eyes. I still can’t believe it...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ‘Quarantine lifted?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah, couple months ago. Stores are
text: back in business. Church is in
dialog: session. Even re-opened the school.
dialog: (Off Frank’s look)
dialog: Rosaleigh’s teaching class until
dialog: they find a replacement.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's always amazing to see how
dialog: quickly people move on...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nobody's forgotten Emily, Frank.
dialog: The kids tell Rosaleigh everyday
dialog: how much they miss her.
text: Frank slowly nods, then finds the courage to ask--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How’s the rest of your family?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Hesitates)
dialog: They're fine. Everyone's fine. I
dialog: was about scared to death when
dialog: Rosaleigh got sick, but...she
dialog: pulled through. ‘Seems to be
dialog: getting stronger everyday. And
dialog: Edward's due in on Sunday...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: That’s great, Tom. Really.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Eh, we got lucky. I’m just glad the
text: troubles are over.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s what we were all praying for.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah...
text: Tom glances at the GOLD STAR BANNER hanging in the window.
text: And the SILK CREPES draped across the front door...
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: ..-it’s just too bad it couldn't
dialog: have happened a little sooner.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- LATER
text: Frank walks Tom back to his Model-T Ford. A cold wind blows
text: through the valley. Tom winces, Frank does not.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You know...we’re having a little
dialog: celebration tonight. Dancing.
dialog: Fireworks. Should be a good time.
dialog: No flu masks allowed...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You should come.
text: Frank glances up at the cloud-riddled sky--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You may be in for some rough
dialog: weather...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah, well...rain or shine, folks
dialog: would still love to see ya.
dialog: (Off Frank’s look)
dialog: C'mon, no one should be alone on
dialog: their birthday.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m not much good around people
dialog: these days, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Disappointed)
dialog: Alright. It’s an open invitation,
dialog: in case you change your mind.
text: Frank watches his friend climb back into his car...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tell Rosaleigh I said thank you for
dialog: the thoughtful gift.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Tell her yourself. She'll be there
dialog: tonight. Just think about it, okay?
text: Frank hesitates, then finally nods. Tom starts the engine,
text: puts his car in gear...and slowly drives away.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- LATER
text: The wind blows, rattling branches like skeleton bones.
text: Frank is back at work, torquing a hammer to remove a set of
text: rusty nails...the hammer's shaft suddenly snaps!
text: Frank falls to the ground with a dull thud. He sits up, dusts
text: himself off...and stares down at his broken tool.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- STABLE -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank pulls open the door and steps inside. A torrent of
text: excited rustling erupts in the stall up ahead...
text: Frank grabs a SADDLE and walks over to his HORSE, its tail
text: swishes back and forth in hopeful anticipation...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hey, Fella...
text: Frank strokes the animal’s mane, wondering aloud--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you say? Should we go see
dialog: what’s new in town?
text: The horse’s dark milky eyes give him the answer--
scene_heading: EXT. OPEN RANGE -- LATER
text: Frank soars across the empty landscape, an expert rider
dialog: comfortable being a spec in God’s country...
text: But then, suddenly, he brings his horse to a stop--
text: The wind blows, carrying sounds of a modern town just beyond
text: the ridge. Frank hesitates, intimidated...
text: He slowly rides over the hill, revealing--
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS
text: A world transformed by asphalt and steel. Buildings are
text: reaching skyward, automobiles outnumber horses...
text: Frank takes it all in as he makes his way into town. His
text: horse sidesteps awkwardly, weaving between cars...
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- CONTINUOUS
text: PATRONS fill a modern bar, wearing faded jeans and cotton
text: shirts; as well as a few lingering FLU MASKS...
text: CHARLIE FOSTER and BEN SANDERFORD (40s, both “regulars”) look
text: up as Frank passes by their window...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: You see that?
text: Ben shrugs, dumbfounded. Couldn't be...could it?
scene_heading: EXT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: ELI PETERSON (60s) sits at his desk, quietly working.
text: Something outside suddenly catches his eye...
text: Eli sets down his pen and goes to the window. His eyes fill
text: with stoic pain as he watches Frank ride into town...
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: ROSALEIGH DONOVAN (40s, Tom’s wife) stands before THIRTY
text: STUDENTS, writing a lesson on the CHALKBOARD...
text: From the corner of her eye, Rosaliegh sees Frank’s reflection
text: in the window. The chalk in her hands suddenly breaks...
speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Mrs. Donovan? Are you alright?
text: Rosaleigh walks across the room, as if floating on eggshells.
text: She peers quietly out the window. And then--
speaker_heading: STUDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Look! It’s Mrs. Sullivan’s husband!
text: The entire class rushes to the window--
scene_heading: EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: NATHAN MILLER (18, town deputy) comes walking down the street
text: with a brand new BOOK tucked under his arm...
text: PATRICK BONNER (32, town deputy) waits outside the sheriff's
text: office. He sees his partner approaching and nods--
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What ya got there?
text: Nathan smiles and holds up the FRONT COVER-- ATTACK OF THE
scene_heading: RED BARON: THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES!
speaker_heading: PATRICK (CONT’D)
dialog: God, not another one. How many of
dialog: those stupid things ya gonna buy?
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I dunno. I was too young for the
dialog: draft. Sounds pretty exciting...
text: Nathan starts flipping through the pages. Suddenly, Patrick
text: gives him an urgent nudge. The young deputy looks up--
text: Frank Sullivan rides by on his horse. The two deputies stare,
text: dumbfounded. Then, suddenly, they hear a voice from behind--
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: TOM (0.S.)
dialog: What the hell’s going on out here?
text: Patrick and Nathan both turn to face Tom Donovan. BEAT.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Hey, Sheriff...or do you still want
dialog: us to call you ‘Mr. Mayor’?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hell, Nathan, I don’t know. You ask
dialog: me that every day. Just call me
dialog: Boss, alright?
dialog: (Confused)
dialog: What’s everyone looking at?
dialog: (Then, seeing Frank)
dialog: Well, shit. That didn’t take long.
scene_heading: INT. LEONARD DUSCHENE’S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME
text: LEONARD DUSCHENE (28) stands in the gloomy shadows of his
text: tiny bedroom, a haunted man living in exile--
text: He watches Frank stop just outside the SUNDRY STORE...
scene_heading: EXT. SUNDRY STORE -- SAME TIME
text: Frank glances briefly at a SILK CREPE hanging in the window,
text: then opens the door and steps cautiously inside--
scene_heading: INT. SUNDRY STORE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: PROPAGANDA POSTERS still hang on the wall, looming above
text: stacks of RED BARON NOVELS trumpeting the glory of war...
text: Frank ignores them as he heads down the aisle. He grabs a new
text: HAMMER off the shelf and walks over to the counter...
text: KAY ANDERSON (40s, store owner) watches Frank approach. She
text: smiles sadly through warm, gentle eyes--
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Will that be everything, Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hello, Kay...got a newspaper that’s
dialog: current?
text: Kay nods and slides one across the counter. Frank glances at
text: the BOLD HEADLINE-- ARMISTICE DECLARED; PEACE AT LAST!
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: ‘Guess I don’t have to ask if you
dialog: want to buy war bonds, huh?
dialog: 11.
text: Frank slowly shakes his head. Kay rings up his total--
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: That’1ll be sixty-seven cents.
text: Frank hands her a DOLLAR BILL and waits for change...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You running the store, now?
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Yeah, since Daniel passed. It’s
dialog: been hard. But Spencer’s coming
dialog: home soon. So at least I have that
dialog: to look forward to...
dialog: (Then, changing subjects)
dialog: ‘Coming to the celebration tonight?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No...don’t think so.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Oh, that’s a shame...
dialog: (As she bags his things)
dialog: May be best, though. They’re saying
dialog: a big storm’s heading our way...
text: Frank smiles politely and reaches for the bag. Kay suddenly
text: tightens her grip, refusing to let go--
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry about your boy. Your wife
dialog: and daughter, too. It just ain’t
dialog: fair...what happened to you.
text: Frank slowly nods, then backs away and reaches for the door.
text: He glances out the window and suddenly stops--
text: SUE FOWLER (40) is outside, walking down the street...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: She’s a vision of grace and loveliness, greeting everyone
text: with a smile as she makes her way through town...
text: Sue Fowler has no idea that she’s being followed.
text: Twenty yards back, across the street, Frank Sullivan walks --
text: his footsteps in line with hers -- watching her every move.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- LATER
text: Sue Fowler, now dressed in a WHITE DOCTOR’S COAT, comes out
text: of the examination room with REVEREND MORGAN FARLEY (50s) --
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I wouldn't worry about it, Morgan.
dialog: Should clear up in a week or two.
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: Thanks, Sue. I can always count on
dialog: you to put my mind at ease.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It’s not the flu.
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: God, what a relief...
text: They turn a corner and suddenly stop dead in their tracks;
text: shocked to see Frank Sullivan standing near the door--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank...I didn’t hear you come in.
dialog: Have you been here long?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not really.
dialog: (To Reverend Farley)
dialog: How are you, Morgan?
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: I’m well, Frank. And you?
text: Frank hesitates, then shrugs. Farley steps closer--
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t believe we've seen each
dialog: other since your wife and daughter
dialog: passed. Frank...I am so sorry. If
dialog: there’s anything I can do--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There isn’t...but thank you.
text: Reverend Farley hesitates, then turns back to Sue--
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: I’1l see you on Sunday, then?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Nods )
dialog: Bye, Morgan.
text: Reverend Farley tips his hat and leaves. The door closes
text: softly behind him. Frank and Sue are alone. BEAT.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was in town. Thought I’d stop by.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: It’s good to see you.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Reverend Farley comes outside and walks down the street. He
text: sees Tom Donovan up ahead and goes over to meet him--
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: You're never gonna believe who I
text: just saw in Sue Fowler’s office.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Frank Sullivan.
dialog: (Off Farley’s look)
dialog: ‘Saw him ride in.
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: I can’t even imagine...
text: (Looks up at Sue’s window)
dialog: ..-he lost everyone.
text: Tom slowly nods, then glances down the street where a LARGE
text: BANNER is being hung above the TOWN’S ENTRANCE...
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
dialog: How’s the new job treating you?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Eh, fair enough. I just hope things
dialog: stay quiet.
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: I’m sure they will, Tom. After
dialog: everything we’ve been through.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: What could possibly happen, now?
text: Tom turns and gives Farley a look: don’t tempt fate.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- EXAMINATION ROOM -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank sits on a table with his shirt unbuttoned. Sue warms
text: her STETHOSCOPE and places it over his chest...
text: This office, like everything else in town, reflects a world
text: in transition; the old giving way to the new.
scene_heading: X-RAYS and MICROSCOPES, VACCINES and ASPIRIN BOTTLES...all
text: mingle with crude instruments from an earlier time.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Take a deep breath...
dialog: (Frank inhales/exhales)
dialog: How have you been feeling?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fine, I guess.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Any symptoms I should be worried
dialog: about. Fever? Headaches?
text: Frank slowly shakes his head as Sue listens to his heartbeat,
text: their faces just inches apart. Sue suddenly pulls away--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Roll up your sleeve, please.
text: Frank tugs at the arm of his shirt. Sue wraps a BLOOD
text: PRESSURE CUFF around his bicep...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ‘Hear your nephew’s coming home...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: My sister tell you that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, just saw her.
text: Sue squeezes the pump, tightening around Frank’s arm...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You know, I was pretty heartbroken
dialog: when George and I realized we
dialog: couldn’t have children. But
dialog: watching all those mothers send
dialog: their boys off to war...I don’t
dialog: know...made me feel like maybe it
dialog: was a blessing in disguise...
dialog: (Then, off Frank’s look)
dialog: I’m happy for her. She could use a
dialog: little joy. We all could...
text: Sue checks the redial and unfastens the cuff--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Congratulations, you’re in better
dialog: shape than most teenagers.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I bet you say that to all your
dialog: patients.
dialog: 15.
text: Sue smiles and begins to put her things away...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Are you worried about anything in
dialog: particular, Frank?
text: Frank shrugs, something clearly on his mind. Sue glances at
text: the WEDDING BAND on his right ring finger--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: How long has it been?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: Almost a year.
text: Sue steps forward, choosing her words carefully--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I know it’s natural to worry when
dialog: people you've lived with get sick,
dialog: but if you’re not showing any
dialog: symptoms by now, then...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m in the clear?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: In a manner of speaking.
text: Frank slowly nods. BEAT.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Have there been any recent cases?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Not for awhile. Things are getting
text: back to normal. Sore throats.
dialog: Broken bones. That sort of thing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Think you'll stay on?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I honestly don’t know. We’ll see
dialog: what happens when the boys come
dialog: home. It’s one thing for a nurse to
dialog: take over when all the male doctors
dialog: have been drafted. Or killed. But
dialog: making it permanent is something
dialog: else entirely.
text: Frank glances across the room, where a portrait of the town’s
text: late PHYSICIAN (60s) still hangs on the wall. BEAT.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You should stay. People know you,
dialog: trust you...you’re good at it.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Thank you, Frank.
text: They sit together in silence and the tension quickly returns.
text: Suddenly, the sound of distant SINGING fills the air...
text: Frank and Sue stand up and go to the window--
text: A group of CIVIL WAR VETERANS (all 70s) are standing outside,
text: singing WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME;
text: Written by a different generation fighting a different war,
text: the lyrics seem as timely as ever. These dying veterans --
text: their voices old, but resolute -- bear witness to the most
dialog: universal of truths: Dwell on the past and you'll lose an
dialog: eye. Forget the past and you'll lose both.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: I remember when you left with
dialog: President Roosevelt all those years
dialog: ago. We sang the same song, then.
dialog: We've really been through a lot,
dialog: haven't we? An epidemic and a war
dialog: .--all in the same year.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s the way it’s always been...
text: Frank stares out the window and sees Eli Peterson on the
dialog: street. Once again, we sense the two men have history...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: When I was in the Philippines, we
dialog: lost six men to measles for every
dialog: one we lost in combat. Soldiers
text: sleep in close quarters. They board
dialog: trains. They travel all over the
dialog: world. If you want to spread a
dialog: disease...all you need is a war.
text: Frank notices the LARGE BANNER being hung at the edge of
text: town. Then he shifts his glance to a familiar building--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s Leonard doing?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He stays in his room most days. And
dialog: that seems to suit people just
dialog: fine. They’re still pretty angry.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It wasn’t his fault.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I know. But it’s always easier when
dialog: there’s someone to blame. I feel
dialog: sorry for him...he’s got nobody.
text: Frank glances at Sue, then stares back out the window. BEAT.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Is it lonesome living all by
dialog: yourself? I don’t mean to pry, it’s
dialog: just...I imagine the solitude would
dialog: be pretty hard to bear.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s not so bad...once you get used
dialog: to the feeling.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You don’t live so far away. I could
dialog: cook you a meal sometime, if you’re
dialog: inclined to accept an invitation...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: George okay with that?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Hesitates)
dialog: He’d love to have you.
text: Frank smiles, knowing that’s not true. He glances out the
text: window once more, then cautiously steps back--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I should go.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It was good to see you. Don’t wait
dialog: so long next time.
text: Frank smiles, then steps forward and gives Sue a gentle hug
text: goodbye. She suddenly winces in pain...
text: Frank hesitates, then pulls at her neckline...revealing a
text: mottling grey bruise just beneath her shoulder blade.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Goddamnit.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank, please.
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I thought he quit that.
text: Sue pulls away and covers herself...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He didn’t know he was hurting me,
dialog: alright? He started drinking again
dialog: when his brother died.
dialog: (then, off Frank’s look)
dialog: You’re not the only one who’s lost
dialog: someone, you know...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sue...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank, it’s none of your business.
dialog: Just let it be...
text: She steps back, folds her arms...and finally looks at him.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Will there be anything else?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No, I guess not.
text: Frank slowly turns and heads for the door. Sue watches him...
dialog: wishing he wouldn’t leave like this--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank?
text: Frank stops and looks back at her. Sue hesitates, then says--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Happy Birthday.
text: Frank smiles, softly. Then turns...and leaves.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank climbs back on his horse just as the LARGE BANNER is
text: unfurled above the town’s entrance--
text: It's a triumphant declaration heralding the end of war, as
text: well as the heroic return of the town's soldier sons.
text: Frank stares at it for a moment. And then, suddenly, he
text: realizes everyone is watching him...
text: Frank takes a final look at the singing veterans. Then Eli
text: Peterson. And then, finally, his friend Tom Donovan.
dialog: 19.
text: Frank kicks his horse swiftly and gallops away, passing
text: beneath the banner as he rides out of town...
scene_heading: EXT. CEMETERY -- LATER
text: Frank comes to a beautiful clearing and tethers his horse to
text: a nearby tree. The wind blows, cold and ominous--
text: Frank takes a deep breath, summoning his courage. He places a
text: handkerchief over his face...and enters the town cemetery--
dialog: And now we get a glimpse of the true horror of influenza;
text: freshly dug GRAVES and unburied CASKETS stacked row upon row.
text: HEADSTONES mark the remains of young and old, rich and poor
text: .--all dying in the dreaded plague year of 1918.
text: Frank makes his way through this awful place, finally
text: stopping at the graves of his wife and daughter.
text: He stares at his family -- helpless and alone.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW -- EVENING
text: Dozens of MODEL-T FORDS park along the meadow’s edge; their
text: bright headlights piercing the dusty haze of twilight.
text: TOWNSPEOPLE welcome each other as the BAND starts to play and
text: MUSIC fills the air. Everyone claps and cheers...
dialog: It’s going to be an eventful evening.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- SAME TIME
text: Frank sits in the dark shadows of his lonely house, listening
dialog: to Marion Harris sing AFTER YOU'VE GONE on the phonograph--
dialog: Now won't you listen honey, while I say / How could you tell
dialog: me that you're going away? / Don't say that we must part /
dialog: Don't break your baby's heart...
text: As the song continues, Frank takes a pair of SCISSORS and
text: clips the front page of the newspaper he bought earlier...
text: The flickering light of a nearby candle dances in his eyes.
text: Frank stares at a headline that seems to taunt him--
text: ARMISTICE DECLARED; PEACE AT LAST!
text: Frank glances at the GOLD STAR. And the song continues--
dialog: After you've gone...and left me crying / After you've gone,
dialog: there's no denying / You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad /
dialog: You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had--
dialog: 20.
text: Overwhelmed, Frank lifts the needle and the song abruptly
text: stops. The house grows deathly quiet. But then--
text: A crack of THUNDER suddenly rumbles overhead. And the autumn
text: wind carries the faint sound of distant celebration...
text: Frank Sullivan stands up and goes to the window. BEAT.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW -- EVENING
text: The party is in full swing. The band plays to the sunset as
text: rows of dancing couples welcome the night--
text: Nearby, a group of men prepare some FIREWORKS, waiting for
text: darkness so they can rocket them into the sky...
text: As the music pools with laughter and joy, a few TOWNSPEOPLE
text: notice the approaching sound of GALLOPING HORSE HOOVES...
text: Heads turn as they draw near. Then, suddenly--
text: Frank Sullivan appears over the ridge, riding towards them;
text: his reluctance visible even from a distance.
text: TOWNSPEOPLE gasp, a few nudge each other and point.
text: Frank tethers his horse to a tree at the end of a long line
text: of MODEL-T FORDS. The animal snorts with disgust--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t worry. I won’t be long.
text: Frank turns and approaches the crowd. TOWNSPEOPLE come over
text: to say ‘hello’. Frank smiles, shaking everybody's hand...
text: Sue Fowler watches from a distance--
text: She’s dressed for the occasion and looks even lovelier than
text: before. A little makeup has put a spotlight on her face.
text: Frank Sullivan notices her right away.
text: Sue's breathing grows heavy as he approaches; her body
text: language a curious mixture of excitement and fear.
text: She waits for him to reach her...and then finally says--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’m glad you came.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah, well...
dialog: (Looks around)
dialog: It is my birthday, after all.
dialog: 21.
text: Sue smiles as the world celebrates around them. The last
text: vestiges of twilight fade and the sky grows very dark...
text: But neither Sue nor Frank notice. They’re lost in each other.
text: ACROSS THE MEADOW
text: Rosaleigh grabs Tom by the arm, nodding at Frank and Sue--
speaker_heading: ROSALEIGH
dialog: Would you look at that...
dialog: (Tom follows her gaze)
dialog: I wonder how much shorter George’s
dialog: leash will get now that Emily
text: Sullivan is dead and buried.
text: Tom glances at his wife with mild disappoval. And then
text: Rosaleigh shifts her glance...and suddenly freezes--
text: Leonard Duschene is walking along the meadow's edge...
speaker_heading: ROSALEIGH (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t see how he can even show
dialog: his face...after all the misery he
dialog: brought on this town. Aren't they
dialog: supposed to hang traitors?
text: Tom stares at Leonard...and slowly nods.
text: ACROSS THE MEADOW
text: Frank and Sue continue to talk--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That's quite a dress.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Oh, I’ve had it for years.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Looks brand new.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don’t get to wear it that often
dialog: «--do you like it?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: Very much.
text: Frank glances at the dancing couples, then looks back at Sue.
dialog: We can see in his eyes what he’d like to ask her.
text: And we can tell by hers that she’s dying to say yes.
dialog: 22.
text: But Frank is torn both by loyalty and concern over what
text: people might think. He fidgets nervously with the wedding
text: ring on his finger...and hesitates a moment too long--
speaker_heading: GEORGE (0.S.)
dialog: Well, look who it is...
text: GEORGE FOWLER (40) steps forward, holding a beer in his hand.
text: Frank's eyes slant to stab wounds. Sue tenses, on edge.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: How are ya, Frank?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Fine, George. Yourself?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Pretty good.
text: Frank clenches his fist and glances at Sue. She stares at
text: him, begging with her eyes: Not here. Not now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ‘Sorry about Dave.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, he deserved better. Hell, I
dialog: suppose we all did.
dialog: (Glances up at the sky)
dialog: Wonder how much longer the
dialog: weather’s gonna hold...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Hopefully they’1ll be able to get
text: the fireworks off in time.
text: George slowly nods, then turns to Sue--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: C’mon...let’s go over and say ‘hi’
dialog: to the Ludlows.
dialog: (As they leave)
dialog: See ya around, Frank.
text: Frank watches George and Sue head back into the crowd, then
text: he slowly turns...and sees Tom Donovan standing nearby--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That new job of yours come with any
dialog: deputies?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah, two of ‘em. ‘Only men left in
dialog: this town under the age of forty.
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You need to take ‘em out and pay
dialog: George Fowler a visit...
dialog: (Off Tom’s look)
text: He’s drinking again.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Last I checked, that’s not against
dialog: the law. Not yet, anyway. His
text: brother died. Cut him a break.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ‘Problem is when George Fowler
text: drinks, he gets violent.
dialog: (Off Tom’s look)
dialog: Sue’s got bruises around her
text: shoulder and collar bone.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Who told you that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Saw it with my own eyes.
text: Tom glances across the meadow, letting out a deep sigh--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Shit. I was worried about that.
dialog: There have been rumors...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Why hasn’t anything been done?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What am I supposed to do?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t know, Sheriff. You tell me.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Hey, take it easy. I’11 look into
dialog: it, alright?
text: Frank stares at Tom as THUNDER erupts overhead...
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t look at me like that. I told
dialog: you I hate this goddamn job...
text: Tom suddenly turns and disappears back into the crowd. Frank
text: watches him go, then heads the other way...
text: As he walks, Frank overhears PARENTS asking each other when
text: their children are coming home from the war...
dialog: 24.
text: Frank looks away, saddened. He glances across the meadow...
text: and sees Leonard Duschene standing all by himself--
text: The two men stare at each other for a moment...and then the
text: sound of MICROPHONE FEEDBACK causes everyone to look up.
text: Tom Donovan and Reverend Farley are standing at the PODIUM--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Ladies and Gentlemen...could I have
dialog: everyone’s attention, please?
text: The music and dancing stop. All eyes turn to Tom--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: As most of you probably know by
dialog: now, I’m no good at making
dialog: speeches. But I wanted to welcome
dialog: you all out tonight...and just say
dialog: thank you for coming.
dialog: (Applause, then)
dialog: This is a time for celebration. But
dialog: we would be remiss if we did not
dialog: pause to remember those we’ve lost
dialog: this past year. So, on that note,
dialog: I'd like to turn it over to
dialog: Reverend Farley. Morgan?
text: Reverend Farley steps forward. The mood turns grim--
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: In memory of the fallen, I ask that
text: we observe a moment of silence...
text: Suddenly, CHILDREN and TEENAGERS begin roaming through the
text: crowd, holding trays filled with SMALL CANDLES...
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
dialog: Members of our Sunday school will
dialog: be passing by with candles. Please
dialog: take one for every family member
dialog: you lost this year, whether it was
dialog: from sickness...or war.
text: TOWNSPEOPLE start taking candles as the children pass by.
text: Every FAMILY takes at least one; some even take two.
text: A soft orange glow slowly spreads through the meadow...
text: Frank Sullivan looks up at a YOUNG GIRL standing before him.
text: He takes a deep breath and picks up a candle...
text: Then, with his other hand, he picks up two more.
dialog: 25.
text: IN THE CROWD
text: Eli Peterson watches Frank struggle to hold three candles on
text: his own. With trembling hands, Eli sets his candle down.
speaker_heading: AT THE PODIUM
text: Reverend Farley lifts a single flame high above his head...
text: The entire town follows his lead. Hundreds of flames rise in
text: the darkness, whispering gently in the faint autumn air.
text: Leonard stares at all the candles, haunted and guilt-ridden.
text: Everyone observes a moment of silence. And then Reverend
text: Farley takes a deep breath...and blows out his flame.
text: Everyone else does likewise. The meadow suddenly goes dark.
text: A devastating stillness hangs in the air...and then the sound
text: of SHRIEKING ROCKETS causes everyone to look up--
text: FIREWORKS explode overhead. TOWNSPEOPLE gasp and applaud,
text: their faces fading up and down with the flickering light...
text: Then, softly and suddenly--
text: Distant GUNSHOTS pop in the faraway woods...
dialog: 
text: They reverberate for a moment and quickly die away, absorbed
text: by the loud explosions booming overhead.
text: Frank is the only one who notices. He turns and looks out at
text: the thick dark trees, wondering if he heard right...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- SAME TIME
text: Frank Sullivan’s ranch sits peacefully in the night...
text: A gust of wind shakes the trees like a torrent of darkness;
text: followed by rumbling thunder and flashes of lightning.
text: The storm warnings subside and the silence returns. A calm,
text: soothing moment hangs in the air...and then--
text: A YOUNG WOMAN (20s) stumbles out of the woods; her clothes
text: soaking wet, her body drenched in blood.
text: The sight of her should take our breath away. She appears
text: suddenly out of nowhere, like a ghost in the darkness.
text: She limps towards Frank Sullivan's house...
dialog: 26.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: The young woman breaks a window and comes inside, leaving a
text: thick trail of blood with every painful step.
text: She searches frantically for medicine and supplies, but the
text: house is very dark. And her life is fading fast.
text: She collapses on the floor with a sickening thud; unconscious
text: and near death, her blood pooling around her.
text: Outside, a violent crack of thunder promises heavy rain...
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW -- SAME TIME
text: Just as the fireworks conclude, the DOWNPOUR begins...
text: Everybody runs to their cars, but the Model-Ts are trapped.
text: Engines start and wheels spin. Nobody is able to get away...
text: ...except for Frank, who walks calmly towards his horse --
text: kicking and snorting beneath an onslaught of rain...
text: Frank climbs into the saddle and gallops away, passing scores
text: of cars as they fishtail in vain.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER
text: Frank comes inside and takes off his wet coat. He lights a
text: candle and makes his way through the dark house...
text: Suddenly, Frank stops. He can hear the storm outside louder
text: than ever. He sees the broken window first...
text: .+-and then he steps in something wet.
text: Frank kneels, holding the candle close to the floor. His eyes
text: suddenly widen -- he’s standing in a pool of blood.
text: A burst of LIGHTNING reveals the young girl on the floor...
text: Frank springs to action, reacting on pure instinct--
text: He picks the girl up and sets her down on the kitchen table,
text: knocking everything to the ground in order to make room...
text: He tears off her clothes and finds three bullet wounds; two
text: in the arm, one in the thigh. Blood pours out of her body...
text: Frank wraps a tourniquet above each wound, then finds the
text: girl's pulse...so faint, it’s barely even there.
text: Frank stares at her, overwhelmed. This is as far as his
dialog: knowledge will take him. He needs help. He needs...a doctor.
dialog: 27.
scene_heading: EXT. MEADOW -- LATER
text: Frank gallops through the pouring rain, weaving between
text: trapped cars and foggy headlight beams--
text: He knocks on windows and waits for them to crack. Then he
text: peers inside, hoping to find Sue Fowler...
text: Finally, Frank reaches the right car. He knocks loudly and
text: waits. The window opens...George Fowler peers out--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Frank? What the hell...?
text: Frank rides around to the other side of the car. He knocks on
text: the window...it immediately rolls down--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What’s wrong?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I need your help...a woman’s hurt.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What? How?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Shot. Pretty bad. C’mon, I’1l1
dialog: explain on the way...please.
text: Sue nods and opens her door, stepping out into the rain...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Sue! What the hell are you doing?!
text: Frank pulls her up onto his horse and they gallop away...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER
text: Frank and Sue come inside, both soaking wet.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t know where she came from.
dialog: She was here when I got home...can
dialog: you help her?
text: Sue rushes to the girl’s side and quickly goes to work--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: She’s lost a lot of blood...
dialog: (then, horrified)
dialog: God, her pulse is racing...it has
dialog: to be in the 140s, at least. Is
dialog: there any alcohol in the house?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Off his look)
dialog: I need a disinfectant.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What kind?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Whatever’s strongest. And I need a
text: knife...like a scalpel.
text: Frank leaves to gather the items. Sue grabs a nearby candle
text: and moves it closer. It lights up the girl’s face...
text: Frank comes back just in time for her to say--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
text: She looks like Kathryn.
text: Frank hesitates, then sets two bottles of WHISKEY and a SMALL
text: KNIFE down on the table--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Anything else?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We need to make a splint for her
dialog: arm. And I need a hemostat...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: A what?
speaker_heading: SUE
text: A pair of pliers...
text: Frank glances around the room -- thinking fast. He turns a
text: TABLE on its side and breaks off one of the LEGS.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Will this work?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Looks up)
dialog: Yes, thank you.
text: Sue fashions a splint and wraps the girl’s arm. Frank leaves
text: the room and returns with a pair of PLIERS--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Sue soaks a towel and cleans the girl’s wounds...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know your blood type?
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hopefully someone in town does...
text: Sue picks up the pliers and douses them with whiskey--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is that clean enough?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It’s gonna have to be.
text: Sue digs into the girl’s thigh. Frank watches with steely
text: resolve as the pliers go deeper...and deeper--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Re: Bullet)
dialog: Can you get it?
speaker_heading: SUE
text: It’s up against the femoral artery.
dialog: If that gets severed, she’ll bleed
dialog: to death.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She's doing that already.
text: Sue nods...and pushes the pliers in just that much deeper.
text: She pulls out a thick BLACK SLUG; mangled and disgusting.
text: Frank grabs his rifle and stands guard near the window...
text: after all, the killers may still be out there.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- MORNING
text: The rain has stopped. The sun begins to rise, revealing a
text: beautiful landscape and a majestic morning.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank sits in a chair, holding his rifle in his arms. He
text: hears approaching footsteps...and slowly looks up.
text: Sue Fowler comes into the room, wiping her hands on a bloody
text: towel. She stares at Frank, exhausted. Then quietly says--
speaker_heading: SUE
text: She’s alive.
text: Frank slowly nods and gets to his feet...
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
text: Her clothes are ruined, though. Do
dialog: you have anything...she could use?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Hesitates)
text: Emily’s things are still upstairs.
text: Second bedroom closet.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Okay. What should I take?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: Doesn’t matter.
text: Sue slowly nods, then hands him a LIST--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT, 'D)
dialog: Think you could go into town? I
dialog: need some things from my clinic.
text: Frank nods, pocketing the list. He holds up his rifle--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You know how to use this?
text: Sue hesitates, then nods. Frank hands her the gun--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Safety’s off. All you gotta do is
text: aim...and pull the trigger.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Please hurry.
text: Frank turns and charges out the door...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- LATER

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM CLOSET -- SAME TIME
text: Sue Fowler stands in the quiet room, staring respectfully at

dialog: 31.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Frank fills a BLACK MEDICAL BAG with supplies...
text: He hears a pair of boots come thunking up the stairs,
text: followed by Tom Donovan’s voice at the door--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Saw your horse outside. You know,
dialog: for a guy who supposedly doesn’t
dialog: like coming into town, you sure are
dialog: doing it a lot, lately.
text: Frank glances at Tom, then continues filling the bag...
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You aimin’ to rob the place?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Taking some things out to Sue...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: My ranch.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Oh, good. That oughta make for some
dialog: nice Sunday gossip.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: There was a shooting last night,
dialog: Tom...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What? Where?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not sure. A girl showed up on my
text: doorstep covered in blood.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You're serious?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You think I'd make this up?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Is she from around here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t think so.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: But she’s alive?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Last I checked.
dialog: (Then, urgently)
dialog: I need you to come with me. Now.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Alright, let me get my horse.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do it quickly.

scene_heading: EXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: What’s going on, Boss?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I need you boys to start gathering
dialog: a search party...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: This early? It’s Saturday...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You get twelve able-bodied men as
dialog: fast as you can and head out to the
dialog: Sullivan Ranch. You hear?
text: Nathan looks dumbfounded. Patrick slowly nods--
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: Tom kicks his horse and meets Frank in the middle of the

scene_heading: INT. LEONARD DUSCHENE’S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
text: Leonard watches Frank and Tom disappear over the ridge. His

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER

text: She grabs Frank’s rifle and heads for the door...
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sue steps outside just as Frank and Tom appear over the

speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Did you get everything?

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How is she?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Not good...
text: Sue snaps the bag shut and hurries back to the house...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Tom stares at the blood stained floor as Sue inflates a BLOOD
text: PRESSURE CUFF around the girl’s arm and checks the redial--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Jesus, she’s 70 over 30.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: SUE
text: That she’s hanging by a thread.
dialog: (Checks the girl’s pulse)
text: Her heart can’t keep beating like
dialog: this. It’s gonna give out...
dialog: (Then, to Tom)
dialog: You don’t know your blood type by
dialog: any chance, do you?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: There are different kinds?
dialog: (Off her look)
dialog: What does it even matter?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: The wrong kind will kill her.
dialog: That's why it matters. And since
dialog: she’s unconscious, we have to find
dialog: someone who’s O-negative...
dialog: (Off Tom’s look)
dialog: They're called universal donors.
dialog: They’re very rare...and they can
dialog: give blood to anybody.
dialog: 34.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I’1l ask around town, but who would
dialog: even know such a thing?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Soldiers. Anyone who’s met with a
dialog: draft board knows if they’re able
dialog: to transfuse blood.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Transfuse blood? We never did
dialog: anything like that in Cuba.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: We did in the Philippines.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Grimly )
dialog: Yeah, I bet.
dialog: (Then, stepping closer)
dialog: I can’t hardly believe it...
dialog: somebody shot her?
speaker_heading: SUE
text: Twice in the arm. Once in the leg.
speaker_heading: TOM
text: All on the same side, too.
dialog: (To Frank)
dialog: What does that tell you?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She wasn’t running away...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Wasn’t facing ‘em either.
text: Tom suddenly notices the mangled slug sitting on the table.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Frank)
dialog: That look like any bullet you've
dialog: ever seen?
text: Frank hesitates, then slowly shakes his head. Tom turns and
text: crosses the room, staring at the broken window--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: How'd she get all the way out here?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t know, Tom. I didn’t have a
dialog: chance to ask her.
dialog: 35.
text: Tom peers out the window and sees Patrick and Nathan in the

speaker_heading: DUFFY
dialog: (Dramatic Beat)
dialog: Let’s find out.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS -- LATER
text: The search party charges through the woods; TWELVE MEN on

dialog: You’re late. The others left...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: That’s all you have to say to me?
dialog: Do you have any idea how worried I
dialog: was last night? I didn’t even know
dialog: what had happened until one of
dialog: Tom's deputies knocked on our door
text: organizing a search party.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Exhausted)
dialog: Please. Don’t start.
text: Sue turns and heads back upstairs. George quickly follows...
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS -- SAME TIME
text: Branches snap as the dogs carve through the trees. The men
text: follow close behind, hoping for some sign or clue...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- LATER
dialog: 
text: Sue resumes her place at the girl’s bedside. George comes to
text: the doorway and watches quietly...
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: So this is the mystery girl, huh?
dialog: Where’d she come from?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We don’t know.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Is she going to live?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: Probably not.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Yeah, well...you should be used to
dialog: that by now.
text: Sue shudders quietly, but doesn’t respond. George suddenly
text: notices an empty WHISKEY BOTTLE sitting on the table--
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: Any more of that in the house?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Hesitates)
dialog: I think we used it all...
text: George slowly nods, then turns and leaves the room...
scene_heading: EXT. LAKE -- SAME TIME
text: Frank and Tom emerge from the woods and find themselves at a
text: MAJESTIC LAKE, stretching for miles in every direction...
text: Tom watches their dog sniff along the shoreline--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Goddamnit...it’s as if she just
text: fell out of the sky.
text: Frank stares at the TALL CLIFFS towering above the lake...
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: C’mon, let’s go...
text: Tom turns to leave, but Frank doesn’t budge--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: (Confused)
dialog: Frank? She didn’t walk on water...
speaker_heading: FRANK
text: Maybe she came up out of it.
dialog: 37.
text: Frank spurs his horse forward, charging up the STEEP INCLINE;
text: so severe, they’re nearly vertical as they ascend...
scene_heading: EXT. SUMMIT -- CONTINUOUS
text: Frank and his horse reach the top and level out onto flat
text: terrain. Frank dismounts and takes in his surroundings--
text: He hears the sound of a HORSE struggling to climb. And then
text: Tom appears; his face ashen from the harrowing ascent.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Let’s not do that again.
text: Frank nods up ahead, where the road suddenly bends--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If you were waiting to ambush
dialog: someone, where would you be?
text: Tom looks around for a moment, then points--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: There.
text: Frank takes position in the grass. He stares at the road and
text: shifts his weight...something crunches beneath his feet--
text: Frank picks up a_handful of empty bullet shells.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus Christ.
text: Frank walks over to the cliff’s edge. He stares at the
text: ground, looking for something...and then he finds it--
text: Faint TIRE TRACKS, like a decaying fossil; nearly washed away
text: by the rain, leading right over the edge of the cliff...
text: Frank leans over and peers at the water below; the sun dances
text: across the surface like a fortune of golden coins.
text: Beneath the water, oscillating between glimmers of sunlight,
text: is a refracted image of a LARGE, BLACK OBJECT...
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: That what I think it is?
text: Frank hesitates, then slowly nods--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Yeah...
dialog: 38.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER
text: George sits at Frank’s desk, opening drawers. He searches
text: vigorously, but doesn’t find what he’s looking for.
text: Instead, he discovers a file of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS--
text: The article Frank saved earlier is at the top of the pile
text: .--along with a hand written LETTER, worn and well read--
dialog: “Dear Mr. & Mrs. Sullivan, I deeply regret to inform you that
dialog: your son, Private William Sullivan, died this afternoon..."
text: George skims the letter, then flips through the articles,
dialog: each one detailing the horrors of the past year...
text: George closes the file and puts it away. He goes to shut the
text: drawer, but stops when he sees something--
text: An old PHOTOGRAPH buried beneath a stack of papers...
text: It shows TWENTY YOUNG SOLDIERS standing at the top of a DUSTY
text: HILL with an AMERICAN FLAG billowing overhead.
text: A LEGENDARY FIGURE stands in the center--
text: His thick moustache and coke-bottle glasses identify him as
dialog: clearly as a caption would: President Theodore Roosevelt
text: And then George sees two familiar faces in the back row:
text: FRANK SULLIVAN and TOM DONOVAN; each twenty years old...
speaker_heading: SUE (0.S.)
dialog: What are you doing?!
text: George looks up and finds his wife standing at the door--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: You shouldn't be going through
dialog: Frank's things.
text: George hands her the photograph--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If you had a picture of yourself
dialog: with the President, would you hide
dialog: it away in a goddamn desk drawer?
text: Sue stares at the picture, suddenly overwhelmed.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: He left you for that war. Least he
dialog: could do is put it on display.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I wonder what else he’s hiding...
text: George stands up and leaves the room as Sue quietly winces
dialog: from the pain of old wounds...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. WOODS -- LATE AFTERNOON
text: WORK HORSES lurch forward, pulling tightly against long
text: CHAINS running beneath the surface of the lake...
text: Frank, Tom, Nathan, Patrick, and the other SEARCHERS watch as
text: the horses move forward, one laborous step at a time...
text: Nathan seems excited, the others concerned. Whatever these
text: horses are pulling, it appears to be quite heavy...
dialog: And then, suddenly--
text: A bullet-ridden MODEL-T FORD breaks through the surface...
text: The men slowly gather around as the car comes to shore. They
text: peer through the shattered windows, recoiling in horror--
text: Two DEAD MEN are slumped in the front seat; their bodies
text: destroyed by gunfire, their faces unrecognizable...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nathan, hand me their wallets.
text: Nathan glances at Tom, the excitement gone from his face. Do
text: I really have to? Tom’s dark eyes give him the answer...
text: Nathan takes a deep breath and reaches inside the car. His
text: hand reappears, clutching two leather WALLETS...
text: Tom steps forward and flips them both open. Each wallet
text: carries a BADGE. The dead men were federal agents.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: shit.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- LATER
text: TOWNSPEOPLE stand outside, watching with grave concern as two
text: PINEWOOD COFFINS get stacked outside the FUNERAL HOME...
scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Eli Peterson looks up as the DOORBELL chimes. Deputies
text: Patrick & Nathan step into the office--
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Gentlemen...
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: How are ya, Eli?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Oh, just waiting for the telephone
dialog: man to get here so I can retire...
dialog: (Glances out the window)
dialog: You've had a busy day.
text: Patrick nods and hands Eli a slip of paper--
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: We need to wire this information to
dialog: to Kansas City right away.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: What’s going on? Folks are talking
text: about some kind of shooting out at
dialog: the Sullivan Ranch...
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: We’re not sure, but it needs to
dialog: stay quiet. Let us know the instant
dialog: you get a response, alright?
text: Eli nods and watches the two deputies leave. He looks down
text: and reads the wire...his eyes suddenly go wide.
scene_heading: EXT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Eli steps into the street, completely dazed. He watches the
text: two coffins disappear inside the funeral home...
text: Then he turns and sees TOWNSPEOPLE standing outside;
text: whispering, pointing...the fear already taking hold.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- EVENING
dialog: 
text: Sue stands by the window, staring at the photograph. Frank's
text: young face is enough to knock the wind out of her...
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN RANCH -- SAME TIME
text: Frank and Tom sit beneath a jeweled sky, their horses kicking
text: and snorting in the cold evening air...
text: Frank stares at the wallets of the two dead men--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Reading their IDs)
dialog: Neither of ‘em made it to thirty.
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Too many young people dying these
dialog: days. That’s for sure.
text: Frank nods sadly and gives the wallets back to Tom. BEAT.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l1 come back tomorrow and help
dialog: you move the girl into town.
dialog: (Off Frank’s look)
dialog: She can’t stay here. This place is
text: the perfect spot for an ambush.
text: Frank looks around for a moment, then slowly nods.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Edward will be with me, so we can
dialog: get his help, as well.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don't forget to ask about his blood
dialog: type, alright?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sure. And I’1ll have Farley make an
dialog: announcement. Maybe someone in town
dialog: knows. Worth a shot.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I could have my deputies stay here
dialog: tonight. Incase whoever did this
text: decides to come back.
text: Frank stares at the dark forest, considering the offer--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If someone was going to show up,
dialog: they would've done it by now.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Alright...
text: Tom sees Sue Fowler standing in Frank’s window. He nods--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You should've seen her during the
dialog: crisis. It reminded me of you,
text: quiet honestly. Charging with
dialog: Roosevelt up San Juan Hill...
dialog: (Beat)
text: People were dying all around her.
dialog: One after another. But she just
text: kept going. Fearless.
text: Frank looks up at Sue. Tom stares at his friend--
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: You ever regret going to the
dialog: Philippines...after Cuba?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I did what my country asked...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: If you had come home, she might not
dialog: have married George...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t regret the years I had with
dialog: my wife, Tom.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No one’s saying you do. But you
dialog: deserve to be happy. So does she...
dialog: (Glances at Sue, then)
dialog: Nobody’d hold it against you.
dialog: Nobody who matters, anyway.
text: Tom kicks his horse and gallops away. Frank watches his
text: friend disappear in the darkness...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: George Fowler sits at the table, nervously rubbing his hands.
dialog: It’s been awhile since he’s had a drink...
text: .--and the shakes are starting to set in.
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: It’s getting pretty late. You gonna
dialog: head home?
text: George looks up at Frank with eyes darker than the room--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: If my wife’s staying, I’m staying.
text: Frank stares at George. His fist clenches again...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Sue leans against the wall, deep in thought. The sound of
text: faint moaning causes her to suddenly turn around...
text: The young girl is awake. Sue rushes to her bedside--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Hi...can you hear me? What’s your
dialog: name? Can you tell me? It’s alright
dialog: if you don’t remember...
dialog: 43.
text: The girl’s eyes flutter as she fights to stay conscious. Her
text: heart is racing and her nerves are on fire...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Here, let me give you something for
dialog: the pain...
text: Sue fills a SYRINGE with MORPHINE--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: This is going to sting a little...
text: She pierces the skin. The girl suddenly screams and pulls
text: away, causing the needle to break off in her arm...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Shit...
dialog: (Yelling)
dialog: Frank?! George?!
dialog: (Top of her lungs)
dialog: I NEED HELP UP HERE!
text: FOOTSTEPS come flying up the stairs and race down the hall.
text: Frank bursts into the room with George close behind...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Hold her down...
text: Frank steps forward and restrains the girl so that Sue can
text: dig the bloody needle out of her vein...
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL
dialog: No...shtfpfff...nasths...please...
dialog: no...ugh, humph...God, no...
text: George stares at the girl, trying to make sense of her words--
speaker_heading: YOUNG GIRL (CONT’D)
dialog: No, please...somebody...help!
dialog: (And then, screaming)
dialog: Getaway! You fuck! Help me! Shit!
dialog: Motherfucker! ! God...damnit!
text: The young girl suddenly grabs Frank by the hand, bracing
text: herself against him, holding on for dear life...
text: Sue pulls the needle out of the girl’s arm. Blood sprays
text: everywhere, soaking the bed sheets. The girl screams--
text: Sue fills another SYRINGE and sticks the exposed arm. The
text: girl moans as narcotic burns through her veins...
text: She slowly lets go of Frank’s hand...and falls asleep.
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Jesus, where did she come from?
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: Been awhile since I heard screaming
dialog: like that...almost forgot what it
dialog: sounded like.
text: Frank looks down at his empty hand as Sue goes to the window.
text: She suddenly steps back, her face frozen in fear--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank? There’s somebody outside.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: A SILHOUETTED MAN stands on the front porch...
text: Frank comes out the side door holding a rifle in his arms. He
text: swings around, about to pull the trigger--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Don’t move!
text: The man freezes, then turns slightly...it’s Eli Peterson.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus, Eli...
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Didn’t mean to scare.
text: Frank catches his breath and climbs the porch steps. The look
text: on his face says it all: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Folks in town are saying this girl
dialog: looks like my granddaughter...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Can I see her?
text: Frank stares at Eli...and finally nods.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank stands with Eli at the girl’s bedside, watching as the
text: old man stares down in quiet disbelief--
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Quite something, isn’t it?
dialog: (Off Frank’s look)
dialog: I know you’re not a religious man,
dialog: Frank...but it’s hard not see the
dialog: hand of providence in this.
dialog: Eli looks
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If you say so, Eli...
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: What are people saying in town?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: A lot of rumor and...speculation.
text: Folks see pinewood coffins stacked
text: outside the funeral home and...
dialog: (Chokes back emotion)
text: .--old feelings rise up.
text: at Frank as the fire crackles behind them--
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: I still haven't forgiven you.
dialog: (Off Frank’s look)
dialog: For not letting me see my daughter
dialog: before you put her in the ground.
text: Frank glances at Sue, standing quietly near the door. BEAT.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It was all pretty sudden, Eli.
dialog: There wasn’t much time.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: It’s almost worse imagining it. You
dialog: hear about people’s hair turning
text: white and falling out. Their lungs
text: filling with fluid, black like oil.
text: Drowning in open air...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s better you remember them the
dialog: way they were. I didn’t want you
dialog: seeing them...like that.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: What kind of disease spares the
dialog: elderly and attacks the young?
text: Frank stares at his father-in-law, unable to answer. Eli
text: looks right at Frank and points to the young girl--
speaker_heading: ELI (CONT'D)
dialog: Frank...save her.
text: And with that, Eli turns and leaves the room. BEAT.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER
text: Frank Sullivan slumps in a leather chair, fast asleep.
dialog: 46.
text: The house is dark and quiet, except for the soft whisper of a
text: tiny candle flame dancing on a nearby table...
text: Suddenly, the candle goes out...and a thin trail of smoke
text: floats to the ceiling as the room grows that much darker--
text: Frank Sullivan suddenly opens his eyes. He sees a STRANGE
text: SHAPE lurking just across the room...
text: A YOUNG WOMAN. Standing by the window.
text: Frank slowly gets up and walks towards her. The girl lingers
text: for a moment, then spins towards him...
text: It’s his DAUGHTER. She looks right at him through hollow
text: eyes, her face rotting with MAGGOTS and WORMS--
speaker_heading: KATHRYN SULLIVAN
dialog: Father...
text: Frank Sullivan suddenly bolts awake! He gasps and falls out
text: of his chair, struggling to catch his breath...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Sue Fowler sleeps peacefully; the fading light of a dying
text: fire dancing softly against her eyelids.
text: Frank covers her with a blanket, then crosses the room and
text: stokes the fire back to life...
text: He glances up at a FAMILY PORTRAIT hanging on the wall, then
text: looks down at the young girl, fighting for her life...
text: This is a line in the sand moment for Frank Sullivan--
text: He was powerless to save his wife and daughter. He had no
text: control over what happened to his son. But Frank can save
dialog: this girl...even if it means risking his life.
text: He takes a deep breath as the fire roars behind him. We can
text: almost see Eli’s command taking hold in his mind: Save her.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- MORNING
text: Reverend Farley stands behind the PULPIT, addressing his
text: CONGREGATION. Less than half the pews are filled...
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: Before we begin, I’ve been asked to
dialog: make an announcement. As I’m sure
dialog: many of you have heard...there’s a
text: young girl out at the Sullivan
dialog: Ranch who’s been badly hurt...
dialog: 47.
scene_heading: IN THE AUDIENCE
text: Tom sits beside Rosaleigh, watching as many CONGREGANTS
text: glance at each other suspiciously...
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY (CONT’D)
dialog: She was viciously attacked Friday
dialog: night...and is in desperate need of
dialog: a blood transfusion. Is anyone here
dialog: aware of their blood type?
text: People slowly shake their heads. Tom watches, disappointed.
scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Eli Peterson comes into the office and finds the telegraph
text: eerily quiet. No messages have come through...
text: Eli stares at empty tray, clearly alarmed.
scene_heading: EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER
text: Frank Sullivan stands outside, chopping firewood as the
text: morning sun breaks free of the horizon...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
text: George Fowler watches Frank from the window. He nervously
text: rubs his hands, which have started to tremble...
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: George walks to the girl’s bedroom and peers inside. Sue is
text: swapping out her bandages. George clears his throat--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: ‘Think I’m gonna head into town...
dialog: You need anything?
text: Sue glances at his trembling hands and shakes her head.
text: George turns and leaves without saying another word.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- LATER
text: Tom and Rosaleigh come outside and overhear Reverend Farley
text: talking to a FARMER and his WIFE (Both 50s)--
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: .»..Maybe you could ask Joey when he
dialog: gets in next week?
speaker_heading: FARMER
dialog: Our Joey’s been through enough. We
dialog: don’t want him mixed up in this...
dialog: 48.
text: The farmer and his wife turn and walk away. Farley watches
text: them go, then glances at Tom and Rosaleigh--
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: Seems to be the general feeling,
dialog: I'm afraid.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: They're just scared...
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: Bullet-ridden cars and bloody
dialog: corpses...not all fear is
dialog: irrational, you know?
text: Rosaleigh glances at her husband. BEAT.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah. I know.
text: A distant TRAIN WHISTLE suddenly shrieks and Rosaleigh pulls
text: Tom away. Farley watches them race towards the station...
scene_heading: INT. LEONARD DUSCHENE’S ROOM -- THAT MOMENT
text: Leonard watches Tom and Rosaleigh charge down the street as
text: another TRAIN WHISTLE blows, already getting closer...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS
text: Rosaleigh glances up at Leonard's window as the train whistle
text: fades. Her face darkens. She turns to Tom--
speaker_heading: ROSALEIGH
dialog: Farley has a point, you know?
dialog: (Nods at Leonard’s window)
dialog: A lot of people would still be
dialog: alive if we’d just shut our doors
dialog: and kept everyone out...
text: Tom glances at his wife, but doesn’t respond. He sees Eli
text: Peterson up ahead, waving for them to come over...
speaker_heading: ROSALEIGH (CONT'D)
dialog: You better know what you’re doing,
dialog: especially if you’re getting Edward
dialog: involved. We’re the only family in
dialog: this town who hasn’t lost anyone...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You think I’ve forgotten that?
speaker_heading: ROSALEIGH
dialog: Just make sure you don’t.
dialog: 49.
text: Tom nods “alright” as Eli steps forward to meet them--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What is it? We get a response?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No, that’s just it. There’s been
dialog: nothing. No word.
dialog: (Then, off Tom’s look)
dialog: We wired to say that we found two
dialog: dead federal agents...don’t you
dialog: think that’s the sort of thing that
dialog: would get an answer right away?
text: Tom glances at Rosaleigh as another train whistle shrieks--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: I’m sure we’ll hear something soon.
dialog: Keep me posted, okay?
text: Eli reluctantly nods as Tom and Rosaleigh walk away...
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN YARD -- SAME TIME
text: A TRAIN pulls into the station and TWO DOUGHBOYS step onto
text: the platform. A gathering CROWD bursts into APPLAUSE--
text: EDWARD DONOVAN (Tom’s son, 20) is one of the soldiers. He
text: walks with a faint limp, searching for his parents...
speaker_heading: TOM (0.S.)
dialog: Edward! Edward!
text: Tom and Rosaleigh are standing up ahead. They throw their
text: arms around their son and hold on for dear life.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s so good to see you...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: Tom takes a step back and stares at son, impressed by the
text: dapper looking kid wearing a man’s uniform--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: My word...welcome home.
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- SAME TIME
text: PATRONS stand at the window, watching the celebration...
text: George Fowler suddenly bursts into the saloon. Everyone
text: watches as the BARTENDER (50s) pours his usual drink--
dialog: 50.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Thanks, Sam. Leave the bottle.
text: Sam nods and steps aside. Charlie Foster and Ben Sanderford
text: (the two ‘regulars’) stand up and approach--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Heya, George. Didn’t see ya come in
dialog: yesterday. We were getting worried.
text: LAUGHTER ripples through the saloon as Charlie and Ben
text: surround George; two bad angels perched on his shoulder--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT’D)
dialog: ‘Been out at the Sullivan Ranch?
dialog: What’s the story?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: It’s nothing. No big deal...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: No big deal? I hear you guys pulled
text: a shot-up car out of the lake.
dialog: (Leans closer)
dialog: Who's in the coffins, George?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: To hell with the coffins, who’s the
dialog: girl? She sick?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: No, she ain’t sick. Just shot to
dialog: hell. Sue’s taking care of her...
text: George throws back his drink and pours himself another--
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know Frank’s got a picture of
dialog: himself with the president?
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: You mean Roosevelt? Sure. Frank
dialog: charged up San Juan Hill. He’s a
dialog: genuine piece of American history.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: That’s nothing. After Cuba, most of
dialog: the Rough Riders came home. But not
dialog: Frank. He went to the Philippines
dialog: and fought the insurgency there.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: I guess one war against Spain
dialog: wasn’t enough...
dialog: 51.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Can you imagine? Not even Hearst’s
dialog: papers could spin that war. I bet
dialog: Frank saw one or two things over
dialog: there. Yes, sir...
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: It all worked out though. Frank got
dialog: his war. And George got Sue.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
text: Except now Emily Sullivan is dead.
text: And Sue is back at Frank’s house...
text: George looks up at Charlie, his eyes wounded and foggy.
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Hey, George...you gonna tell us
dialog: what we want to know or what?
text: George hesitates, then pours another drink as more footsteps
text: approach. His eyes suddenly close...and surrender.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Sue comes downstairs and fills a PITCHER with water...
text: She notices the PHONOGRAPH on the counter and starts flipping
text: through records...suddenly stopping at one in particular--
dialog: AFTER YOU'VE GONE by Marion Harris
text: The sound of an opening door causes Sue to look up. Frank
text: comes inside, his arms filled with FIREWOOD. BEAT.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: George left?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yeah, he had to go into town...
dialog: (Holds up the record)
dialog: I remember this one.
text: Frank sets down the firewood and slowly approaches--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Me, too.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: They played it the night you left.
dialog: I don’t think I’ve heard it since.
text: Frank smiles, then takes the record from her hands and places
text: it on the wheel. He lowers the needle gently--
dialog: 52.
text: After a few bursts of static, the song begins to play--
text: Frank finally finds the courage to look at Sue. The lyrics
text: pull them together and they slowly start to dance...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: If I tell you something, will you
dialog: promise not to think less of me?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Okay...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: The other night...I wanted to dance
dialog: with you.
dialog: (then, off her silence)
dialog: Did you hear what I said, Sue?
text: They spin towards CAMERA. Sue’s eyes are closed--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Softly)
dialog: I heard you.
text: The song winds down and comes to an end, replaced once again
text: by the crisp static of the spinning wheel...
text: Frank and Sue slowly lean in, just about to kiss...when
text: they're suddenly interrupted by a knock at the door.
text: Frank forces himself to turn away and leave the room.
text: Sue stares at the record spinning on the wheel. She slowly
text: lifts the needle...and the house plunges to silence.
text: Sue takes a deep breath and goes to the window--
text: The Donovan family is standing outside.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- LATER
text: Frank stands with Tom, Rosaleigh, Edward, and Sue; a heavy
text: silence weighing between them...
text: Edward stares at PICTURES hanging on the wall, focusing on
dialog: Kathryn, beautiful in black & white--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: (To Frank)
dialog: I don’t know if you were ever
dialog: aware, but...I carried quite a
dialog: torch for your daughter when we
dialog: were in school.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: I used to tell William that when we
dialog: got back, I was gonna call on her.
dialog: He didn’t like that very much.
text: Frank smiles, but doesn’t respond. Edward turns and limps
text: across the room. Everyone watches. Nobody says a word.
text: Edward reaches the counter and opens his bag--
text: There’s newspaper lying on top of his things. Edward takes it
text: out and sets it aside, then reaches deeper into the bag--
text: He pulls out a WATCH and a few LETTERS, then gives them to
dialog: Frank as if they meant everything in the world--
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: These were his.
text: Frank takes a deep breath, clutching his son’s things.
speaker_heading: EDWARD (CONT'D)
dialog: He has a beautiful grave. Just
dialog: outside of Fromelles. It’s about
dialog: the nicest spot you could ask for.
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: He talked about you all the time.
dialog: Bragged about how his dad got to
text: the top of San Juan Hill before
dialog: Roosevelt did.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: All he wanted was make you proud.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I was already proud of him. He
dialog: didn’t have to go to war for that.
text: Edward slowly nods. Sue cautiously steps forward--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Edward, you don’t know your blood
dialog: type, by any chance...do you?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Dad said you were looking for a
dialog: donor...I’m AB-Positive. Sorry.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (To Tom)
dialog: Morgan make the announcement?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Yeah, but nobody’s coming forward.
dialog: And the next batch of soldiers
dialog: aren’t due in until next week...
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: O-negative blood is pretty rare.
dialog: There weren't many guys in my
dialog: regiment who had it.
text: Sue nods, clearly disappointed. Tom checks his watch--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We should probably get going.
text: Frank glances at Sue, then reluctantly nods.
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- LATER
dialog: 
text: The young girl lies in bed; her breathing weak and shallow.
text: Sue Fowler stands nearby, quietly packing her things...
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: Ready?
text: Sue looks up and sees Frank standing at the door. She nods,
text: then turns and gives the girl another shot of MORPHINE.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: How’s she doing?
speaker_heading: SUE
text: Blood pressure’s low. Pulse is
dialog: high. All we can do is keep her
dialog: sedated...and hope for the best.
text: Frank stares at Sue, reading between the lines--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She's not going to make it, is she?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: With the amount of blood she’s lost
dialog: and no donors coming forward...it’s
dialog: probably just a matter of time.
text: Frank stares at the girl and finally nods. BEAT.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: If it’s any consolation, I know how
dialog: you feel. I was looking forward to
dialog: saving a patient for a change.
text: Frank glances at the FAMILY PORTRAIT on the wall. Suddenly,
text: Sue realizes: it’s more than just some patient for him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 55.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- DUSK
text: The sun begins to disappear behind silhouetted mountains,

scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Eli continues to stare at the telegraph, unnerved. The day’s
text: almost over...and it hasn’t made a sound.
text: Suddenly, Eli hears squeaking wheels outside...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- SAME TIME
text: Frank Sullivan rides into town beside a HORSE-DRAWN WAGON--
text: Tom and Edward Donovan are upfront, holding the reins. Sue
text: and Rosaleigh are in back, caring for the girl...
text: TOWNSPEOPLE come outside as the wagon passes by. They turn
text: and glance at each other. Suspicious. Afraid.
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- SAME TIME
text: Charlie and Ben walk across the room and stand over George,
text: now passed out in a drunken stupor...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, George!
text: Charlie kicks the chair, George suddenly wakes up--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT’D)
dialog: Your wife’s outside. Incase you're
dialog: interested...
text: George rubs his tired eyes, then leans over and grabs the
text: bottle...and pours himself another drink.
scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Eli Peterson watches the wagon stop outside Sue’s clinic. He
text: opens the door and steps outside. The bell chimes loudly...
text: ...-but then the sound fades and Eli hears something else. He
text: slowly turns and peers through the window--
text: The telegraph ticker has started typing!
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- SAME TIME
text: Patrick and Nathan cross the street to help Frank, Tom, and
text: Edward lift the girl out of the wagon.
dialog: 56.
text: Together, they carry her toward Sue’s clinic...
text: TOWNSPEOPLE crowd the other side of the street, watching from
text: a distance, refusing to come any closer...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- LATER
text: Frank, Tom, Edward, Rosaleigh, Sue, Patrick, and Nathan carry
text: the girl into the clinic and set her down by the window...
text: Sue checks the girl’s pulse and gives her a shot of MORPHINE.
text: Frank and the others stand nearby, quietly watching...
text: They suddenly hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. The door
text: slowly opens...and Eli enters the room.
text: He looks at everyone, then hands Tom a slip of paper--
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: From Kansas City...
text: Tom grabs the wire and starts to read...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (To Eli)
dialog: What’s with everyone outside? Town
text: seems panicked...
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: You can thank George Fowler for
text: that. He’s been spouting off at the
dialog: saloon to anyone who'll listen.
text: Frank's eyes pulse with anger. Sue looks up, concerned--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: How long as he been there?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: (Hesitates)
dialog: Awhile.
text: Tom finishes reading and holds up the wire--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: ‘Feds are sending some agents out
text: on the morning train.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What took so long?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You can ask ‘em when they get here.
dialog: I’m sure everyone’s got questions.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: (To Sue)
dialog: Gonna have Patrick and Nathan stay
dialog: here tonight. Just to be safe.
text: Sue nods as the deputies take position at the window...
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: If you need anything else...I’1l be
dialog: in my office.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Which one?
speaker_heading: TOM
text: The one with guns in it.
text: Tom tips his hat and leaves with his family. Frank waits for
text: the door to shut, then goes to the window--
text: He watches the Donovan family climb back into their wagon.
text: Tom and Rosaleigh both have their arms around Edward...
text: Frank takes a deep breath, then looks down at the young girl.
text: Her eyes remain closed. She doesn’t even know he’s here.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: You should go home, Mr. Sullivan.
dialog: We'll take it from here...
text: Frank looks up at Patrick and Nathan, resolved to their duty.
text: Then he glances at Sue...and heads for the door.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The Donovan family rides out of town. Edward glances over his
text: shoulder and sees Frank come outside...alone.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I feel bad for him.
text: Tom glances back and slowly nods--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We all do.
speaker_heading: AT SUE’S CLINIC
text: Frank stares at the saloon as he un-tethers his horse. He
text: slowly turns...and sees Eli Peterson standing nearby.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: George still over there?
text: Eli hesitates, then nods. Frank charges across the street--
dialog: 58.
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Everyone looks up as Frank enters the saloon--
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Hey, Frank...what’ll it be?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Whiskey.
text: Frank looks around the room as the bartender pours. He sees
text: George passed out near the back...clutching an empty bottle.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, Frank...what’s going on?
dialog: Who's this girl?
text: Frank keeps staring at George. Finally, he answers--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Just someone who needs a little
dialog: help. That’s all.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I hope there isn’t going to be any
dialog: trouble. Cemetery’s crowded enough
dialog: as it is, wouldn’t you say?
text: Frank takes a deep breath as George continues to slump in his
text: chair; unconscious, pathetic...not worth the effort.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think this whole town’s a
dialog: cemetery, Charlie. Excuse me.
text: Frank turns and walks out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank climbs back on his horse and trots out into the street.
text: The light from Sue’s clinic burns like an oven...
text: Frank stares at her window for a moment, then tugs on his
text: reins in the moonlight...and gallops out of town.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Sue listens to Frank’s fading horse hooves as she checks the
text: girl's vitals. Suddenly, there’s a knock at the door...
text: Sue crosses the room and answers...surprised to see her
text: sister, Kay, standing in the hallway--
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Where is she?
text: Kay charges past Sue and goes to the girl’s bedside--
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Dear God. Just as our boys are
dialog: starting to come home...as if this
dialog: town hasn’t been through enough?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: There’s no cause for alarm...
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: That’s not what your husband says.
text: Sue looks up at at her sister as another KNOCK raps on the
text: door. Sue hesitates, then turns and crosses the room...
text: She discovers three BOYS (ages 12-14) standing in the
text: hallway, armed with their fathers’ RIFLES...
speaker_heading: ELDEST BOY
dialog: Mrs. Fowler...we were wondering if,
dialog: you could use any help tonight?
dialog: (Off Sue’s confused look)
dialog: We could stand guard--
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: Oh, no you could not!
text: Kay charges forward to confront the startled children--
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: Jimmy Rogers, Russell Thompson, and
dialog: Mitchell Stevens. What kind of
dialog: foolishness is this?! You all think
dialog: because you missed out on one war,
dialog: you need to rush out for a second?!
dialog: Do your fathers even know their
dialog: rifles have gone missing?
text: The boys look down at their shuffling feet...guilty. Kay
text: takes the youngest by the hand and turns to face Sue--
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope you and Frank know what
dialog: you're doing. I really do.
dialog: (To the young boys)
dialog: C’mon, you three...you can explain
dialog: this to your parents.
text: Sue watches her sister leave...then quietly shuts the door.
dialog: 60.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Kay guides the children down the hall. Suddenly, they stop.
text: A DARK FIGURE slips quietly past them--
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sue hears yet another knock and reluctantly crosses the room.
text: She opens the door and suddenly freezes...
text: Leonard Duschene is standing before her.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Leonard...what are you doing here?
text: Patrick and Nathan both step forward, alarmed. Leonard
text: hesitates...and finally finds his voice--
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: Does she need blood?
text: Sue stares at him, hoping she heard right--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You're O-negative?
text: Leonard nods. Sue grabs him by the arm--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Come inside right now.
text: She pulls him into the room and slams the door shut.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Are you sure about this, Dr.
dialog: Fowler?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Get him a chair.
text: Patrick hesitates, then nods to Nathan...who grabs a chair
text: and carries it over to the girl’s bedside.
text: Leonard stares at the young girl as he rolls up his sleeve...
text: Sue wraps a RUBBER BAND around his arm, then pierces his skin
text: with an 18-gauge needle. Leonard flinches, but stays quiet.
text: BLOOD starts to flow, turning the clear tubing red as it
text: falls into a COLLECTING BOTTLE resting on the floor...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell me if you get dizzy.
dialog: 61.
speaker_heading: LEONARD
dialog: I’m fine.
text: His blood continues to fill the bottle, mixing with
text: COAGULANT, rising every second-- 100cc...200cc...300cc...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You okay?
text: Leonard slowly nods -- pushing himself to the max...
text: 400cc...500cc...700cc...the glass is almost full. Sue siphons
text: off the tubing and removes the needle from Leonard's arm...
text: Leonard slumps in the chair, about to faint. Patrick and
text: Nathan step forward and catch him--
text: Sue then inserts a NEEDLE into the young girl’s arm and
text: raises the container. Blood flows into the girl’s body.
text: Patrick, Nathan, and Leonard watch, silently captivated...
text: The bottle finally empties. Sue removes the needle from the
text: girl’s arm as carefully as if she were defusing a bomb.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Did it work?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: We'll know in the morning.
text: The deputies both nod, then look back out the window--
text: Outside, the town sits beneath a blanket of indifferent stars
text: .--completely unaware of the wicked doom heading their way.

scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank stops outside his daughter’s bedroom and looks at the

text: And then, finally, at the PICTURES hanging on the wall.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Sunlight pours in through the open window, causing Sue Fowler
text: to suddenly wake. She gets up and checks on the girl...
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Something wrong?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (Smiles)
text: She’s warm.
text: A TRAIN WHISTLE suddenly shrieks far in the distance...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- SHERIFF’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
dialog: 
text: Tom smiles at Rosaleigh as she heads to school. Then he
text: slowly turns and stares out at the horizon--
text: Tiny puffs of smoke suddenly appear, signaling the imminent
text: arrival of FEDERAL AGENTS from Kansas City...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE -- SAME TIME
text: Frank is scrubbing the table where Sue operated on the girl,
text: desperately trying to get the blood off the wood...
text: Edward's newspaper is still lying on the counter. Frank wipes
text: his hands and picks it up-- THE KANSAS CITY GAZETTE
text: The top fold displays bold HEADLINES announcing the end of
text: war. Frank turns the newspaper over--
text: His eyes suddenly narrow. Buried in the bottom right hand
text: corner, a small HEADLINE ominously reads--
scene_heading: “MOBSTER TRIAL CONTINUES; WITNESS MISSING, FEARED MURDERED."
text: Frank sets the newspaper down...and quickly leaves the room.
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION -- SAME TIME
text: Tom steps onto the platform as a TRAIN pulls into the
text: station, releasing a thick cloud of piping hot steam..
text: Two FEDERAL AGENTS (Both 30s), dressed in dark suits, step
text: off the train and take in their surroundings...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You boys from Kansas City?
text: The two agents nod and quickly approach--
speaker_heading: AGENT #1
dialog: That’s right. I’m Agent Reynolds.
dialog: This is Agent Parker. You the one
dialog: who sent the wire?
dialog: 63.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sure am. Tom Donovan. I’m uh...
dialog: sheriff of this town.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Well, Sheriff, there really isn’t a
dialog: moment to lose...where’s the girl?

scene_heading: INT. SUNDRY STORE -- SAME TIME
text: Kay Anderson, busy stocking shelves, glances out the window
text: and sees Tom approaching with the two agents...
text: She looks at her husband’s crepe, trembling. Afraid.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- SAME TIME

speaker_heading: STUDENT
dialog: Mrs. Donovan...? Are we gonna grade

text: Rosaleigh doesn’t answer. She doesn’t even seem to hear.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- SAME TIME
text: Reverend Farley watches quietly as Tom leads the two agents

scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- SAME TIME

speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: «.+.a local rancher found her. We

text: The agents glance at each other as Tom reaches for the door.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Sue, Nathan, and Patrick look up as Tom enters with Reynolds
text: and Parker. Everyone stands quietly for a moment, then--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Sue, these men are from Kansas
dialog: City. They’re here for the girl...
dialog: 64.
text: Sue hesitates, then stands aside. The two agents walk across
text: the room and stare down at the young girl--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: That’s her, alright.
dialog: (Looks around, confused)
dialog: Where’s the doctor?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Standing right next to you.
text: Reynolds hesitates, then turns to face Sue--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: So, what’s her condition? She
dialog: obviously hasn’t died, yet...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No, she’s actually improving.
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: Improving? Your wire said she was
dialog: shot three times and wouldn’t
dialog: survive the week...you’re saying
dialog: she could live?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Yes, she very well could.
text: The two agents glance at each other. BEAT.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: I can’t tell you how relieved we
dialog: are to hear that...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Gentlemen, do you mind telling us
dialog: what’s going on?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Sheriff, I’m afraid the less you
dialog: know, the better. For your own
dialog: safety. As well as hers.
dialog: (Then, to Sue)
dialog: Is it safe for her to travel? Could
dialog: she board a train?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don’t think that’s a good idea.
dialog: Not for awhile, at least.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Why not? I thought you said her
dialog: condition was improving...
speaker_heading: PARKER
dialog: You moved her here, didn’t you?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: That was a few short miles at a
text: snail’s pace. And, even then, she
dialog: had muscle spasms the whole way...
text: Reynolds and Parker stare at Sue with guarded eyes..
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
text: She’s dehydrated. Her wounds are
text: still open. The slightest exposure
dialog: could cause infection to set in...
dialog: that could kill her.
dialog: Reynolds checks his watch--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: The next train’s at noon...and she
dialog: needs to be on it.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Sir, please...
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Listen, I understand your concern,
dialog: but it’s a risk we have to take.
dialog: This girl has enemies. You've seen
dialog: what they can do. As long as she’s
dialog: here, this town isn’t safe.
dialog: (To Tom)
dialog: Where’s the telegraph, Sheriff?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Down the street...I could take you
dialog: over there, if you like?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: I'd appreciate that.
dialog: (To Sue, an order)
dialog: Have her ready when we get back.
dialog: 65.

scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog:

dialog: Reynolds and Parker--
speaker_heading: TOM

dialog: 66.

scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Sue peers out the window as she packs for the girl’s trip.
text: Tom and the two agents are walking down the street...
text: Sue watches them approach. Suddenly, she hears something far

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- SAME TIME
text: Frank Sullivan comes riding into town. Tom and the two agents
text: stagger back as he dismounts and approaches--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Gentlemen, this is Frank Sullivan,
dialog: the rancher I was telling ya about.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Frank, these men are from Kansas
dialog: City. They’re here for the girl...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is that so?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Yes, sir. And we owe you a real
dialog: debt of gratitude. Because of your
dialog: bravery, that girl is still alive.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where ya taking her?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: (a moment, then)
text: Back where she belongs.
text: Frank slowly nods, then looks past Reynolds and Parker. He
text: sees TOWNSPEOPLE peering out of every window...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I read an article about a missing
dialog: witness in Kansas City...that’s
dialog: her, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Like we told your sheriff here...
dialog: it’s really best for everyone if
dialog: you know as little as possible.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I bet.
dialog: 67.
text: A distant TRAIN WHISTLE suddenly shrieks--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: We should probably be going...
text: Reynolds and Parker tip their hats and turn to leave...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Will you be taking the remains of
dialog: your dead colleagues, as well?
text: The agents suddenly stop and turn around. BEAT.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
text: They’re down at the funeral home.
dialog: I’m sorry pinewood coffins were the
dialog: best we could do. We had a tough
dialog: year...as I’m sure you both know.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: That’s alright, Mr. Sullivan. Their
dialog: families will understand...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What were their names?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: I'm sorry?
text: Frank steps forward and repeats himself firmly--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Their names. What were they?
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: David York and Mikey Smith. Good
dialog: agents. And dear friends.
text: Frank glances at Tom. He knows they’re lying.
text: Another train whistle suddenly shrieks--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
dialog: We really do need to get going...
text: Reynolds and Parker turn once again and head for the stairs.
text: Frank suddenly steps forward, blocking their path--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s the idea?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I'd like to see your credentials.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Our what?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ID, gentlemen.
text: Tom takes a step back, suddenly nervous--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: In case you haven’t noticed, we're
dialog: in a bit of a hurry here...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: ‘Better make it quick, then.
text: Reynolds scowls at Frank, suddenly aggressive--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Suppose I told you the answer is
dialog: yes. We do mind?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You'd be breaking the law. But that
dialog: won’t matter much...
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: And why’s that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You'll both be dead.
text: Tom stares at Frank in total disbelief. BEAT.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Is that a fact?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Not yet.
text: Reynolds glances at Parker, then turns back to Frank--
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: Alright. ID. Here you go...
text: Reynolds and Parker reach inside their jackets...and draw
text: their guns! But Frank is ready. And he’s lightning fast--
text: He puts a bullet in Parker’s head and fires two rounds into
text: Reynold’s chest. Their bodies snap backwards and hit the
text: ground, flooding the street with thick arterial spray.
text: Frank glances back at Tom, standing in a prison of shock and
text: fear; his gun still resting firmly in its holster--
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: My God. What have you done?
text: Frank stares at his friend as TOWNSPEOPLE come outside,
text: staring at the carnage in the middle of their street--
text: Then he glances at the school, where Rosaleigh Donovan is
text: struggling to keep her students away from the window...
text: A slight tremor of movement suddenly catches Frank's eye--
text: “Agent Reynolds” is still alive. He slithers along the ground
text: and reaches for his gun...
text: But Frank’s boot comes down hard, snapping his wrist--
text: Reynolds screams in agonizing pain. Frank kicks the gun away
text: and pulls the dying man up by his collar...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Their names were William Arthurton
dialog: and Robert Church...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: And they were no friends of yours.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS
dialog: You got me...
text: Reynolds suddenly smiles, dark and evil.
speaker_heading: REYNOLDS (CONT’D)
dialog: You people have no fucking idea
dialog: what’s coming your way...
text: Blood pours out of Reynold’s mouth as the life fades from his
text: eyes. His head rolls back and his body grows still...
text: Frank stares at the corpse for a moment, then lets it fall
text: back into the sticky redness covering the earth.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- LATER
text: George Fowler opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He glances
text: around the saloon, shocked to find it completely empty...
text: Confused, George goes to the window...and peers outside--
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- THAT MOMENT
text: The town’s entire POPULATION is standing in the street,

scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

text: the blinds. The room goes dark...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Alright, you tell me...what now?
text: Before Frank can respond, there’s a knock at the door--
speaker_heading: TOWNSPERSON #1 (0.S.)
dialog: Tom, I need a word with you!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Earl, I’m a little busy at the
dialog: moment! I’1l be out in a minute!
text: Tom takes a deep breath and looks back at Frank--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: We're in a lot of trouble.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Patrick and Nathan stare at the madness in the street--
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Should we go down there?
text: Patrick hesitates, then slowly shakes his head--
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Our orders are to protect Dr.
dialog: Fowler and the girl. We stay here
dialog: unless told different.
text: Nathan glances at Sue, then reluctantly nods. BEAT.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank and Tom come outside and walk quickly down the street.
text: Everyone watches them, some even shout--
speaker_heading: TOWNSPERSON #1
dialog: What’s happening, Tom! What are we
dialog: supposed to do?!
speaker_heading: TOWNSPERSON #2
dialog: You didn’t have to kill ‘em, Frank!
scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
dialog: 
text: Eli looks up as Tom enters with Frank--
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Eli, you got the wire those men
dialog: sent out? I’d like to see it...
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: ‘Figured you might.
text: Eli holds up a slip of paper. Tom takes it and reads. His
text: eyes suddenly darken. He hands the message to Frank...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (To Eli)
dialog: We need to wire all nearby towns
dialog: and ask for help. You ready?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Just tell me what to type.
text: Eli leads Tom across the room as Frank stares at the message
text: in his hands. The wire is two simple words-- “SHE'S ALIVE."
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The door bursts open and six TOWNSPEOPLE storm into the room--
speaker_heading: TOWNSPERSON #1
dialog: Where is she? Is this her?
text: Sue and Leonard block their path...
speaker_heading: TOWNSPERSON #2
dialog: Sue, get out of the way. We have a
dialog: right to know, goddamnit! What have
dialog: you and Frank gotten us into?!
text: Sue glances back at Patrick and Nathan. They step forward and
text: usher the TOWNSPEOPLE towards the door...
speaker_heading: TOWNSPERSON #3
dialog: This isn’t right, Sue! You know it!
dialog: Why are you protecting her?!
text: Sue turns the lock as the door slams shut.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The doorbell chimes as Tom steps outside. Through the window,
text: we can see Eli furiously sending out wires...
text: Tom glances down the street and sees Rosaleigh standing with
text: Kay. She gives him a look: What are you going to do?
text: Tom hesitates, then shrugs: I don't know.
dialog: 72.
text: Eli suddenly taps on the glass. Tom glances back, the urgency
text: in Eli’s eyes draws him to the window--
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: Message just came through.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: From which town? Dawson? Sparks?
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: No...Kansas City.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- LATER
text: The DOOR HANDLE suddenly jiggles against the LOCK--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: FRANK (0.S.)
dialog: Frank...
text: Sue opens the door just wide enough for him to slip through.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: This is madness...
text: Frank slowly nods, then notices Leonard Duschene standing
text: across the room. Sue follows his gaze--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: The good news is she’s improving...
dialog: a donor came forward last night and
dialog: offered quite a bit of blood.
dialog: (Nods, softly)
dialog: Looks healthier, doesn’t she?
text: Frank turns and looks down at the girl. She looks just like
dialog: his daughter...and she could wake up any moment now.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: She's beautiful.
text: Sue stares at Frank as a peaceful moment hangs in the air,
text: punctured suddenly a loud knock at the door--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Who is it?
speaker_heading: TOM (0.S.)
text: Tom Donovan, open up.
text: Sue opens the door. Tom bursts into the room--
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: ‘Got another wire from Kansas City.
text: Tom hands the message to Frank, who reads it out loud--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where are you?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Didn't take ‘em long to figure out
dialog: something was wrong.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Didn't take who long?
text: Sue’s question goes unanswered...until Frank takes the
text: newspaper out of his jacket, handing it to Tom--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Edward left this at the house
dialog: yesterday. ‘Must’ve gotten it
dialog: before boarding...
dialog: (Off Tom’s look)
text: Bottom right corner.
text: Tom takes the newspaper and slowly reads--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Jesus Christ...
text: Tom lets the paper fall to the floor. He goes to the window
text: as Patrick and Nathan rush forward to pick it up--
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: This is who we’re up against? No
dialog: wonder it took so long to respond.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I don’t understand. We wired the
dialog: federal authorities...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Just because we sent a wire doesn’t
dialog: mean they got it...
dialog: (Nodding at the newspaper)
dialog: People this powerful have
dialog: informants everywhere. Someone got
dialog: our message and tipped ‘em off...
dialog: (Then, realizing)
dialog: ...the feds don’t know what’s
dialog: happening here.
text: Patrick looks down, Nathan’s eyes flood with panic.
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Any word from the other towns?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Nothing yet...
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: We could wire back, pretending to
dialog: be those men. Say it was all a
dialog: mistake. ‘Got the wrong girl.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: They might believe it.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Would you?
text: Patrick hesitates, then shakes his head. BEAT.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Those men were just the beginning.
dialog: They know she’s here. They know
dialog: we're protecting her. Right now,
dialog: they’re summoning every resource at
dialog: their disposal...and heading
dialog: straight for us.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I think it’s time to start sending
dialog: out more wires...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Dramatic Beat)
dialog: ‘Goddamn right.
scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank and Tom come inside and find Eli standing over the
text: telegraph. His face appears ashen. Something is very wrong--
speaker_heading: ELI
text: Tom, signal just went dead.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What? How?
speaker_heading: ELI
text: ‘Dunno. The equipment’s working.
dialog: It’s not a problem on our end.
dialog: (Glances out the window)
dialog: The line’s been cut somewhere...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Could just be a coincidence...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Or maybe they’re taking the
dialog: necessary precautions...
text: Tom opens the door and disappears outside. Frank goes to the
text: window and stands beside Eli...
text: They stare out at the surrounding forest, wondering if
text: villains are lurking just beyond their view.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- SAME TIME
text: Tom charges down the street, stopping beneath Sue’s window--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Calling)
dialog: Patrick!
text: Patrick pokes his head outside--
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Yeah, Boss?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Get your horse saddled and meet me
dialog: outside. You’re riding oughta town.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Kansas City. As fast as you can.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Patrick steps away from the window and glances at Nathan, who
text: has a pale white look of envy spread across his face--
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Maybe I should go, instead. My
text: horse is younger, faster.
speaker_heading: PATRICK
dialog: Kansas City is more than a hundred
dialog: miles away. You ever ridden that
dialog: far through the night?
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You wanted an adventure? Looks like
dialog: you’re going to get one...
text: Patrick turns and walks out the door, leaving Nathan to
text: glance down at the TIN STAR pinned sharply to his vest.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 76.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Patrick kicks his HORSE and gallops out of town. Everyone
text: watches him disappear over the ridge...
text: .--and then they hear a distant TRAIN WHISTLE.
text: Frank and Tom walk towards the station, passing scores of
text: TOWNSPEOPLE frozen where they stand...
scene_heading: INT. TRAIN STATION -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank and Tom step onto the platform as a distant TRAIN chugs
text: towards them through blue-grey twilight...
text: Tom slowly exhales. His hands are trembling...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Cold?
text: Tom slowly shakes his head, then quietly says--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It isn’t fair...
dialog: (Off Frank’s look)
dialog: I've done everything I was supposed
dialog: to do. I didn’t ask to be sheriff
dialog: and I never went looking for
dialog: trouble. When you stepped forward
dialog: and volunteered for the
dialog: Philippines, I stood aside. My
dialog: hands are clean...
text: Frank hesitates, then steps closer--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tom...nobody from Kansas City is
dialog: going to be on this train.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: How do you know that?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (a moment, then)
text: They’1l wait for it to get dark.
text: Tom takes another deep breath, steadying his nerves--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Let’s just hope the conductor’s
dialog: willing to help us...
text: The train’s whistle shrieks as it nears the station. Frank
text: and Tom step forward. But then something terrible happens...
dialog: 77.
text: The train doesn't stop. It soars past them with devastating
text: speed, each car a bullet in the air...
text: Frank and Tom watch the train grow small in the distance...
dialog: this is worse than they could’ve possibly imagined.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- LATER
text: The TOWN has gathered for a meeting. People scream and shout,
text: fighting for seats. Before long, it’s standing room only--
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Sue, Leonard, and Nathan stare out the window -- watching as
text: the entire town shuffles into the church...
text: Sue sees her sister in the crowd, then Rosaleigh and Edward
text: Donovan. And, finally, Eli Peterson, not far behind...
text: And then Sue’s eyes suddenly narrow--
text: George is stumbling down the street. He glances up at Sue
text: briefly, then disappears inside the church...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: I wonder if my wife’s over there.
dialog: We have a little girl. Just turned
dialog: six months old...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You can leave if you want. Nobody's
dialog: forcing you to stay.
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: (Hesitates)
dialog: No, it’s my duty to protect you...
dialog: and that’s what I’m going to do.
text: The door suddenly opens and Frank enters with Tom; their
text: shoulders sagging under a heavy burden--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: No good?
text: Frank shakes his head as Tom goes to the window--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What’s going on at the church?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: They called a town meeting...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: My family over there?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Just saw ‘em go in...
text: Tom turns and quickly leaves. Frank glances at the girl--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: How’s she doing?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Fine, assuming she doesn’t get
text: handed over to a lynch mob.
text: Frank looks up at Sue and she begs him with her eyes to go
text: over and face his critics. He turns and leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- SAME TIME
text: The meeting is underway. A RANCHER (30s) has the floor--
speaker_heading: RANCHER
dialog: Could more of ‘em be coming?
speaker_heading: RANCHER #2
dialog: Oh, they’re coming, alright. Just
dialog: as sure as God’s vengeance. Frank
dialog: Sullivan killed two of their men.
dialog: That’s not the sort of thing you
dialog: get to just walk away from...
text: Ben Sanderford comes down the aisle, distributing BLACK &
text: WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS to different people--
speaker_heading: BEN
dialog: Went over to the Hall of Records
dialog: and got these pictures. This is
dialog: what we’re up against...
text: TOWNSPEOPLE gasp as they look at the pictures; each one a
text: grisly crime scene with blood-soaked corpses--
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT’D)
dialog: They have guns that fire thirty
dialog: rounds a second. And they’re
dialog: capable of this...
text: Ben holds up a particularly gruesome photograph. Many
text: TOWNSPEOPLE turn away, unable to stomach the macabre...
speaker_heading: BEN (CONT'D)
dialog: Now we don’t know who this girl is
dialog: or what she’s done. But one thing
dialog: is certain...she has a past. It’s
dialog: dark and it’s ugly. And it wants
dialog: her dead.
dialog: 79.
text: The photographs get passed up to Reverend Farley. He looks at
text: them quietly as Charlie Foster stands up to speak--
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t like this, folks. Not one
dialog: bit. Girl was supposed to testify
dialog: at some trial? Okay. She got
dialog: scared? Fine. I can understand
dialog: that. Hell, we all can. But then
text: she runs away and makes her
dialog: problems our own. And that’s not
dialog: okay. I don’t like people who run
dialog: away from responsibility. It never
dialog: ends good. Look at Leonard
text: Duschene. He deserted the army and
dialog: who paid the price? We did. Victims
dialog: of the plague he was carrying in
dialog: his veins. Innocent people always
dialog: pay the price when cowards abandon
dialog: their duty. It’s happened before.
dialog: And it’s happening now...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Earlier today, I watched two men
dialog: die less than a hundred yards from
dialog: where my children go to school. It
dialog: isn’t right. It isn’t fair. It’s
dialog: not our responsibility!
text: TOWNSPEOPLE voice their agreement as Charlie sits down...
text: IN A NEARBY PEW
text: George Fowler stares at one of the grisly photographs; a
text: terrible rage building inside of him...
scene_heading: BACK OF THE ROOM
text: The door softly opens and Tom Donovan comes inside. He sits
text: down by his family as a WOMAN (40s) stands up to speak--
speaker_heading: WOMAN
dialog: I don’t want my husband risking his
dialog: life for some stranger. For all we
dialog: know, this girl might even deserve
dialog: what’s coming to her. We’ve already
dialog: lost so many people. How much can
dialog: one town be expected to endure? Our
dialog: soldiers have already been through
dialog: so much terror overseas. The last
dialog: thing I want is for them to come
dialog: home orphans.
text: The woman sits down as soft murmurs begin to ripple through
text: the church. Reverend Farley suddenly looks up...
dialog: 80.
text: Frank Sullivan is standing at the door.
text: The room grows deathly quiet.
text: Frank looks around, about to speak when--
text: George Fowler suddenly stands up, drunk and loud. He stares
text: at Frank; his eyes flickering with the promise of violence.
text: Everyone waits anxiously for something to happen. And then--
text: George Fowler turns and storms out of the church...
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS
text: George charges across the street, each footstep angrier than
dialog: the last; his hatred gathering momentum...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Sue, Leonard, and Nathan look up as the door bursts open.
text: George Fowler comes inside, his eyes dark and angry...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I'd like to speak to my wife.
text: Nathan and Leonard look at Sue. She nods, it’s okay. George
text: waits for them to leave, then charges towards her...
speaker_heading: GEORGE (CONT'D)
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Don’t play dumb with me. You know
dialog: exactly what I mean.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I’m a doctor. This is my job.
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Your job?! She is not your patient.
dialog: The folks out there are. And you’re
dialog: about to get them all killed!
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT
text: Leonard and Nathan stand in the lobby, listening to the muted
text: sounds of George and Sue arguing upstairs...
speaker_heading: NATHAN
dialog: Should we go up?
dialog: 81.
text: Leonard hesitates, unsure. The fighting grows louder...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: George leans closer, getting right in Sue’s face--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Why are you doing this? Tell me!
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Stay away from me...
text: George grabs her by the arm and pulls her close...
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Tell me why! Why are you putting
dialog: this town at risk? For him?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: God, you’re drunk...
text: George slaps her face, hard. Sue screams--
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: Leonard hears Sue’s cry and sprints up the stairs...
text: Nathan remains frozen where he stands; his face torn apart by
text: anguish and shame. He suddenly looks down...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: George hits Sue again, this time with a closed fist--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: You want to help Frank save this
dialog: whore so that you can be his!?
dialog: That's it, isn’t it? It’s been your
dialog: reason all along...
text: George throws her to the ground, about to stomp her...
text: Leonard bursts into the room and grabs George from behind...
text: George stumbles back, then drives an elbow into Leonard's
text: solar plexus and hurls him across the room...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: Nathan hears a LOUD CRASH upstairs and suddenly looks away...
dialog: There’s no such thing as bravery. Only varying degrees of
text: fear. And Deputy Nathan is crumbling...
dialog: 82.
text: He slowly unfastens his TIN STAR and sets it down. Then he
text: goes to the door...and disappears into the night.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: George tears through the room, knocking everything to the
text: ground. Sue gets to her feet and charges towards him--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Get out of here!
text: George grabs her throat and slams her down on the desk--
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: Did you let his family die? So you
dialog: and he could be together just like
dialog: you wanted? To hell with this town!
dialog: To hell with these people! Just as
dialog: long Sue gets what she wanted!
text: He hits her again and again...each punch a sickening thud
text: against her skull; brutal and awful--
text: His knuckles split and start to bleed. George grimaces as he
text: steps away, letting his wife’s limp body fall to the floor.
text: He shakes his hand for a moment and catches his breath. Then
text: he steps forward...and approaches the young girl--
text: She continues to sleep, calm and peaceful; completely unaware
text: of the battle raging around her.
text: George stares at her with murder in his eyes...
text: And then, as if suddenly realizing the barbarity of what he’s
text: done, George Fowler backs away. And quietly leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- SAME TIME
text: Frank Sullivan stands in a sea of hostility, listening to
text: various TOWNSPEOPLE express their grievances--
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: I remember when our boys were
dialog: getting drafted, you said the war
dialog: was wrong, that it wasn’t our
dialog: fight. But now you’re asking us to
dialog: risk our lives? For someone we
dialog: don’t even know? Have you lost your
dialog: mind?! She may look like your
dialog: daughter, but that doesn’t mean
dialog: she’s worth saving...
dialog: (Beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 83.
speaker_heading: MAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You owe us an explanation. You've
dialog: wagered all our lives on this.
text: Everyone shouts in agreement as the man sits back down. Frank
text: takes a deep breath, gathering his thoughts--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m not sure what to say, except...
dialog: this is our home, not some battle-
text: field halfway across the world.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: It’s a fight we didn’t ask for!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe not...but it’s coming just
dialog: the same.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: (Emotional)
dialog: First, it was the sickness. Then
dialog: the war. Now this. It’s too much, I
dialog: tell you...too much.
text: Frank stares at the man, not sure what to say. And then he
text: sees Kay Anderson standing across the room--
speaker_heading: KAY
dialog: My husband died eight months ago
dialog: when the flu spread through town.
dialog: Two days later, I watched my only
dialog: son march off to war...
dialog: (Gathering herself)
dialog: And every night since then, I’ve
dialog: prayed for just one thing. That my
dialog: boy would come back to me...alive.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: He’s due in next Thursday.
text: Kay stares at Frank for moment, then--
speaker_heading: KAY (CONT'D)
dialog: You and my sister did right in
dialog: trying to help this girl. Nobody
dialog: faults you for that. It was
dialog: Christian charity, fine and decent.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: But when you killed those men
dialog: today, you invited the devil back
dialog: into our town. It’s your mistake,
dialog: not ours. And we shouldn’t have to
dialog: pay for it. I’m begging you...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Let this cup pass from us.
dialog: 84.
text: Kay slowly sits down. Frank turns to face everyone--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What would you have me do? Wheel
dialog: her out into the street so we can
dialog: all close our windows and pretend
dialog: we don’t hear the gunfire?
dialog: (Looks up at Farley)
dialog: Should we put the girl in God's
dialog: hands and call it a day?
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: There are worse hands to be in,
dialog: Frank. Much worse.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That may be. But it wasn’t so long
dialog: ago that you wouldn’t even set foot
dialog: in our cemetary to conduct a
dialog: funeral. You remember? Because I
dialog: do. Sometimes God’s hands are no
dialog: match against fear...
speaker_heading: REVEREND FARLEY
dialog: You think I’m a coward, Frank? Is
dialog: that it? You think we’re all
dialog: cowards? Well, maybe we are...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: But I will tell you this: our
dialog: community has been through the
dialog: darkest of nights. Look around you.
dialog: Maybe you'll be struck, as I am, by
dialog: all the people who aren’t here.
dialog: (Points to various people)
dialog: Ella-May lost her husband of fifty-
dialog: three years. Mary Richardson lost
text: her new baby boy. The Fuller’s son
dialog: died at Verdun; the Cooper’s boy at
dialog: Belleau Wood. The Stevenson’s
dialog: graciously adopted the three
dialog: Randall children after both their
dialog: parents were killed.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: There isn’t a single family here
dialog: who hasn’t been touched by the
dialog: tragedy of the past year. And now,
text: just when the sun is finally
dialog: starting to rise...
dialog: (Holds up one of the
dialog: gruesome photographs)
dialog: You want us to head back into the
dialog: shadows and face something we don’t
dialog: understand. It’s asking a lot.
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I know, but I’m not the one asking.
dialog: (Turns to face everyone)
dialog: I didn’t ask for any of this. Not
dialog: for my wife to perish or my
dialog: children to die. Not for sickness.
dialog: Not for war. And certainly not for
dialog: this girl...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: But I can’t just sit back and let
dialog: harm come to her. I’m surprised
dialog: anyone here can...considering
dialog: everything we’ve been through.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Don’t you understand? If we turn
dialog: away from this now...we’ll never
dialog: survive it.
text: Frank stares at a sea of blank faces...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Isn’t there someone here who wants
dialog: to stand up and say no more? When
dialog: did we become the sort of people
text: who peer out of windows and hide
dialog: behind locked doors? That’s not us.
dialog: That’s not who we are.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Who will stand up with me?
text: Frank glances around the room...and starts to call names--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Bob?...Thomas?...Ralph?...Earl?
text: Each man reluctantly shakes his head...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Charlie?...Ben?
text: Both men shake their heads. Frank turns to his father-in-law--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Eli?
text: Eli Peterson stares at Frank with blank eyes...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: We're family.
speaker_heading: ELI
dialog: We were.
text: Frank takes a deep breath, turning to one last person--
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Tom?
text: Tom glances at his wife and son, then looks down...ashamed.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: What if it was your daughter?
text: Tom slowly shakes his head with tears in his eyes--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: It’s not.
text: Edward stares at his father. Rosaleigh trembles in her seat.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: What’s wrong with you? All of you?!
dialog: This is basic right and wrong...
text: Rosaleigh can’t take it anymore. She suddenly erupts--
speaker_heading: ROSALEIGH
dialog: Damnit, Frank, it’s easy for you to
dialog: say...we have something to live
dialog: for. You don’t!
text: The room plunges to silence. It’s an awful thing say...but
dialog: Rosaleigh can’t take it back--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Is that what you think?
dialog: (Then, to everyone)
dialog: Is that what all of you think?
text: Nobody responds or even looks Frank in the eye. They just
text: stare at their hands...as if idly passing the time.
text: Frank slowly puts on his hat...and walks out of the church.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- LATER
text: Frank comes outside and stares at the empty street; imagining
dialog: what will be like to face gunmen all by himself...
text: A cold wind suddenly blows, dark and ominous; rattling the
text: window panes like a harbinger of doom.
text: Frank walks towards Sue’s clinic...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank comes inside and heads for the stairs. He sees Nathan’s
text: TIN STAR on the counter...and reluctantly picks it up. BEAT.
dialog: 87.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- LATER
text: Sue and Leonard move quietly through the dark room, picking
dialog: up the pieces after George’s terrible rampage...
text: The door softly opens and Frank Sullivan comes inside.
text: SHATTERED GLASS crunches beneath his feet...
text: Frank turns on the light--
text: The room is torn asunder; books and equipment scattered on
text: the floor, two wounded people standing in the shadows...
text: Frank crosses the room and grabs Sue gently by the arm. She
text: resists for a moment, then finally turns around--
text: Her face is bruised and bloody. Swollen eyes, split lip.
text: Frank has to bite his hand just to keep from screaming--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank, please...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Where is he?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don’t know. It doesn’t matter.
text: It’s over, he’s gone...
text: Frank glances at the girl, expecting the worst--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: She's fine. He didn’t hurt her.
dialog: Frank, please...don't.
text: Sue collapses into his arms and starts to cry. Frank
text: hesitates, then gently strokes her hair--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Alright...alright.
text: Leonard turns and quietly leaves the room. Frank waits for
text: the door to shut, then guides Sue over to the couch...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, sit down.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- SAME TIME
text: TOWNSPEOPLE sit in stunned silence, glancing at each other as
text: the weight of what happened starts to take hold--
text: A few people begin to stand up...and head for the door.
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 
text: Frank soaks a COTTON SWAB with ALCOHOL and begins to clean
text: Sue’s wounds. She winces in pain--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Sorry...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It’s okay. Just stings a little.
text: Frank slowly nods...and continues with care.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH -- THAT MOMENT
text: TOWNSPEOPLE come outside into the cold, grim night. Some
text: linger for a moment, others start to head home...
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: I don’t know about everyone else,
dialog: but I could sure use a drink...
text: A few TOWNSPEOPLE follow Charlie towards the saloon...
text: Tom, Rosaleigh, and Edward stand nearby. Edward watches the
text: departing citizens, torn by everything he’s just seen...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: We should probably stay in the
dialog: office tonight...
dialog: (Off their looks)
text: The walls are reinforced by steel.
text: Rosaleigh stares at her husband, then nods...terrified.
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- MOMENTS LATER
text: The bartender turns on the lights and discovers George Fowler
text: sitting at the counter, nervously rubbing his hands...
text: The bartender hesitates, then sets down a bottle of WHISKEY.
text: George pulls the cork and pours himself a drink...
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: George? Your hands are bleeding...
text: George looks up as the door opens behind him. Charlie Foster
text: and some other TOWNSPEOPLE begin to trickle inside...
text: George grabs the bottle and flees into the back room...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Sue stares at Frank as he quietly treats her wounds...
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: He wasn’t always like this. Incase
dialog: you were wondering...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Wondering what?
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: (a moment, then)
dialog: Why I married him.
text: A TRAIN WHISTLE suddenly shrieks far in the distance; so
text: faint that Frank and Sue barely seem to notice...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: You and Emily ever fight?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: On occasion.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Did it ever get...bad?
text: Frank looks at her...and suddenly grasps her meaning--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No. Never.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: It was always over little things.
dialog: Should we get indoor plumbing? Buy
dialog: a car? Was Kathryn old enough to
dialog: date? We argued about the future...
dialog: (Then, softly)
dialog: Guess it was pretty silly,
dialog: considering we didn’t have one.
text: Frank tapes a BANDAGE to Sue’s cheek. They stare at each
text: other for a moment, their faces just inches apart...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Why did you leave me?
text: Frank's eyes flicker, wounded and filled with regret--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I don’t know how to answer that,
dialog: Sue. I really don’t.
text: Sue takes out the Rough Rider photograph, which she’s kept
text: all this time. She slowly hands it to Frank--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Was it everything they said it was
dialog: going to be?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Roosevelt and his legendary Rough
dialog: Riders...the adventure of a
dialog: lifetime?
text: Frank stares at the photograph, ashamed.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: I read stories about massacres...
dialog: one newspaper called it genocide.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: That’s one way of putting it...
text: Frank stares at his past self, thinking of his son--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: All men fight in wars for the same
dialog: reason, Sue. It’s a matter of luck
dialog: whether you get to be on the right
dialog: side of history or not.
text: Sue points to the young man in the photograph--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: You know...every now and then, I
dialog: think about the boy who left all
dialog: those years ago...and what life
dialog: would’ve been like had he stayed.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I imagine he would’ve been kind.
text: The train whistle suddenly shrieks again; close enough now
text: that Frank and Sue can hear its engine chugging forward...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Is there going to be more
dialog: bloodshed?
text: Frank's dark eyes give her the answer--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re certain?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: As much as I am that the earth
dialog: turns.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Is Tom going to help you?
text: Frank hesitates, then slowly shakes his head...
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: What about the others?
dialog: gl.
text: Frank holds up the TIN STAR Nathan abandoned--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: I’m all alone on this.
text: Frank sets the badge down and stares at it for a moment.
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: I never wondered why you married
dialog: him. I always knew. The only thing
dialog: I never understood was...why you
dialog: didn't wait.
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank, when you left...I was angry.
dialog: I'm sorry...
text: Frank reaches out and touches her bruised face. Sue leans
text: into his hand as tears trickle down her cheek...
text: Then, in the depths of silence, Frank hears something--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Listen...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What? There’s nothing.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Dramatic Beat)
dialog: I know...the train stopped.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- THAT MOMENT
text: TOWNSPEOPLE stare at the distant station, where thick tufts
text: of smoke float into the dark evening sky--
scene_heading: EXT. TRAIN STATION -- THAT MOMENT
text: A LONG TRAIN sits on the tracks, lurking ominously in the
text: night like a dark trojan horse. Then, suddenly--
text: A CAR DOOR bursts open...
text: A MAN (40) steps onto the platform. All alone. Dressed in a
text: beautiful suit, wearing confidence like a bullet proof vest.
text: He looks around the empty station, smiling at the shadows.
text: Then he slowly turns...and walks straight into town--
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- CONTINUOUS
text: The man strolls down the street, whistling a familiar tune...
dialog: ("Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling")
dialog: 92.
text: The melody floats through the air; cheerful and creepy.
text: TOWNSPEOPLE flee into buildings as the stranger approaches...
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- THAT MOMENT
text: PATRONS take cover...
scene_heading: INT. SUNDRY STORE -- THAT MOMENT
text: Kay ducks out of view...
scene_heading: INT. TELEGRAPH OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT

scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: Tom, Rosaleigh, and Edward exchange nervous glances...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- THAT MOMENT
text: Farley watches a DARK FIGURE float past his window...
scene_heading: INT. LEONARD DUSCHENE’S ROOM -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: Leonard slowly turns and opens his bedroom closet. He stares
text: at his WWI UNIFORM...and then pulls out his RIFLE.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: The young girl squirms in fear as the whistling comes closer.
text: Sue checks her pulse. Frank goes to the window...
scene_heading: EXT. SALOON -- THAT MOMENT
text: The stranger looks up at the WWI BANNER and suddenly stops
text: whistling. Then he smiles...and enters the saloon.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: Frank steps away from the window and heads for the door. Sue
text: watches him leave, then glances back at the young girl...
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- THAT MOMENT
text: The stranger smiles as PATRONS stand up from behind their
text: tables...and reluctantly sit back down--
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: You folks expecting a tornado or
dialog: something?
text: Charlie glances at Ben from the corner of his eye. Everyone
text: else looks away, too frightened to answer...
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What’1ll it be, Mister?
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Shot of rye, if ya got it.
text: The bartender nods and starts to pour. The stranger glances
text: over his shoulder, drawing strength from everyone’s fear--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Nice town ya got here.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Passing through?
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Something like that.
text: The stranger picks up his drink and gulps it down--
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- THAT MOMENT
text: Frank Sullivan steps out into the empty street, making his
text: way towards the saloon...
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: Tom stares quietly out the window, watching his friend charge
text: through the night towards the unknown...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: You going to go over there?
text: Tom glances at his son, unsure. BEAT.
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- SAME TIME
text: The stranger sets down his empty glass...
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Another?
text: The stranger nods, why not? The bartender pours...
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Got a doctor around these parts?
text: PATRONS glance nervously at each other...
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Say you get shot, for example...
dialog: where would you go?
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I really don’t know. I’m the not
dialog: the person to talk to about that
dialog: sort of thing.
text: The stranger stares at the bartender and smiles--
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: What do I owe for the rye?
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Thirty cents...
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Tell you what...
text: The stranger throws a wad of MONEY on the counter--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’ll make it a hundred dollars...if
dialog: you tell me who is the person to
dialog: talk to about that sort of thing.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: I don’t understand...
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Oh, I think you do.
text: The bartender shakes his head as the stranger leans forward,
text: focused, unrelenting...refusing to take no for an answer...
text: And then, suddenly, they hear a door open--
text: Frank Sullivan comes into the bar. He stares at the stranger
text: for a moment, then sits down at a nearby table.
text: The stranger glances at the bartender, “Him?”
text: The bartender nods...and pockets the hundred dollars.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: Frank listens to the stranger's approaching footsteps and
text: then looks up as a dark shadow falls across his face--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: I’m wondering if you could help me?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You don’t look like the sort of man
dialog: who needs much help.
text: The stranger smiles and sits down--
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: We all need a little help,
dialog: especially in a strange town...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: I’m looking for a girl. Medium
text: build. Five and a half feet tall.
dialog: Fair complexion. Very beautiful.
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: Sound like anybody you know?
text: Frank shakes his head as the door opens again. Tom Donovan
text: quietly enters, followed by Reverend Farley...
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: I work for some people who are very
dialog: concerned about her. We have reason
dialog: to believe she was in the area.
text: Sent a couple men out looking for
dialog: her, but...they seem to have
dialog: disappeared.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Maybe they ran off together. Maybe
dialog: they don’t want to be found...
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: Well, if that’s the case, it’s even
dialog: more important that we find them.
dialog: The girl, at least.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: (Confused)
dialog: What about the men?
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: As long as we find the girl, we'd
dialog: be willing to forget about them.
dialog: Call it an even exchange.
dialog: (Dramatic Beat)
dialog: Our men...for your deputy.
text: The stranger sets a BLOOD-STAINED BADGE down on the table--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: You'll be happy to know he was very
dialog: brave. Didn’t even scream. Said to
dialog: tell his kids he loved ‘em.
text: Frank glances at Tom, frozen across the room.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Is it a matter of money? If not,
dialog: then what is it? I saw that
dialog: cemetery when I came in.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Pretty crowded. How many able-
dialog: bodied men could this town possibly
dialog: have left?
text: Frank slowly looks up, calm and defiant--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you have any idea who you’re
dialog: dealing with? Look what we did ina
dialog: few short hours. You wired for the
dialog: feds. Our men showed up, instead.
dialog: Your telegraph is cut. Your train
dialog: station is off the map. Don’t you
dialog: realize how alone you are?
text: Frank stares at the stranger...but doesn’t respond. BEAT.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: You know...I remember when the flu
dialog: spread last year, the government
dialog: sent a dispatch to towns like this.
dialog: You probably got it...
dialog: (Quoting)
dialog: ...”Round up your woodworkers and
dialog: set them to making coffins. Then
dialog: round up your street laborers...and
dialog: set them to digging graves."
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: That was all the help you got then.
dialog: And it’s all you’re getting now.
text: The stranger suddenly reaches into his coat. Everyone tenses,
text: fearing he’s about to draw a gun...
text: ..-but the stranger takes out a collection of PAPERS,
text: instead. He looks up at Frank, smiling like the devil...
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you know how easy it is to
text: intercept a telegraph? A few snips
dialog: and a little cut...and the signal
text: gets re-routed.
dialog: (Holds up first page)
dialog: From the town of Sparks...
text: Everyone leans forward as the stranger reads--—
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: ...Dear Sheriff, stop. We regret we
dialog: have no men to send at this time,
dialog: stop. Very sorry, stop.
dialog: (Turns the page)
dialog: From Dawson...Sheriff Donovan,
dialog: stop. Unable to provide help, stop.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Please keep us abreast as the
text: situation unfolds, stop.
dialog: (Turns the page)
dialog: From Ridgeview...
text: TOWNSPEOPLE start to look away, sensing the pattern...
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Have neither resources nor men to
dialog: Spare, stop. Deeply regret, stop.
dialog: (Looks up at Frank)
dialog: «Good luck, stop.
text: The stranger throws the papers down on the table--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: You can read the rest for yourself.
dialog: They all say the same thing.
dialog: Nobody's coming. Why would they?
text: Frank shuffles through the messages one at a time. The
text: stranger watches, genuinely puzzled--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Why are you doing this? What’s in
dialog: it for you? Do you even know who
dialog: you're risking your life for?
text: Frank's eyes flicker faintly with doubt--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: You think she’s worth saving? A
text: damsel in distress in need of a
dialog: white knight? You think by
dialog: defending her, you'll redeem this
dialog: town? Maybe even yourself? That
dialog: you've finally got a cause worth
dialog: fighting for? Boy...have I got a
dialog: few surprises for you.
dialog: (Raising his voice)
dialog: She's a hooker. Sorry to disappoint
dialog: you, but...that’s what she is. A
dialog: two-bit whore. Pay her enough,
dialog: she'll do anything you want. Fucked
dialog: the wrong guy, heard the wrong
dialog: things. And now she’s a nothing
dialog: witness in a nothing case...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: You're telling me you’re gonna risk
dialog: your life and lives of all these
dialog: people to save someone like her?
dialog: Have you thought this through?
dialog: Trains and telegraphs are the least
dialog: we can do.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: We'll wipe this town off the face
dialog: of the earth. You’ll see. We're
text: just getting warmed up.
text: The stranger looks around the room as his words take hold--
speaker_heading: STRANGER (CONT’D)
dialog: Now why don’t you do the sensible
dialog: thing and mind your own business?
dialog: This girl has no friends. No
dialog: family. When she’s gone, there will
dialog: be no newspaper headlines mourning
dialog: her death. She won’t have a funeral
dialog: or even an obituary. Because no one
dialog: will remember her long enough to
dialog: forget her. It’ll be as though she
dialog: never existed. All you have to do
dialog: is order another drink and try not
dialog: to worry about things that are
dialog: beyond your control. Alright?
text: Frank hesitates -- deep in thought. And then--
text: George Fowler comes out of the back room and takes a seat at
text: the bar, totally oblivious to what’s going on...
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Excuse me...
text: Frank stands up and charges across the room. The stranger
text: watches, confused by his sudden departure...
speaker_heading: AT THE COUNTER
text: Frank grabs Charlie’s empty BEER GLASS and hurls it right
text: into George’s face. He looks up, stunned--
text: Frank knocks two of his teeth out with the first blow. The
text: second bruises a kidney and the third cracks a rib...
text: TOWNSPEOPLE flee from the eye of the storm..
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: The stranger watches the attack with a faint smile; as if
text: suddenly recognizing a worthy opponent...
speaker_heading: NEAR THE DOOR
text: Tom steps forward, trying to restore order--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Frank! Frank! That’s enough! You’re
dialog: killing him!
dialog: 99.
text: Frank slams George's face into the counter, shards of glass
text: splinter his skin. George drops to the ground--
text: Frank bends over, about to lift him to his feet...
text: ..+.-when he suddenly hears the click of a gun--
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Goddamnit, Frank, I said enough!
text: Frank looks up and sees Tom pointing a SHOTGUN at him from
text: across the room. His eyes fill with betrayal...and rage.
speaker_heading: TOM (CONT'D)
dialog: Back away. Now.
text: Frank slowly approaches his friend--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You’re gonna shoot me, Tom? Or just
dialog: arrest me?
text: Tom peers over the shotgun as Frank takes a step closer; both
text: barrels now just inches from his chest. And then--
text: Frank snatches the gun out of Tom’s hands. Everyone gasps as
text: he opens the boxlock, letting the shells fall to the floor...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You're not doing either today...
dialog: (Quoting Tom from earlier)
dialog: Now, why don’t you do what you’re
dialog: good at, Sheriff...and stand aside.
text: Frank throws the gun down and charges back across the room...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
text: Sam, whiskey.
text: The bartender sets a BOTTLE down. Frank picks it up...
text: AT THE END OF THE BAR
text: George pulls himself to his feet. Blood pours down his face,
text: blinding his vision. He slowly turns around...
text: ...Frank smashes his face with the whiskey bottle!
text: Glass shatters, the alcohol stinging like acid. George
text: screams...and goes down for the count.
text: But Frank is on top of him, punching and wailing, kicking and
text: stomping, beating this man within an inch of his life.
dialog: 100.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE ROOM
text: The stranger glances around the saloon, assessing different
text: people's reactions. Some seem horrified. Others, inspired.
speaker_heading: AT THE BAR
text: Finally, Frank stops. Just short of murder. He grabs George
text: by the collar and gets right in his face...
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at me...this is what happens
dialog: when you hurt women.
text: Frank throws George back to the ground, then slowly turns
text: around to face the lingering stranger--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
dialog: You were saying?
text: The stranger smiles. And picks up right where he left off--
speaker_heading: STRANGER
dialog: There’s no need for you to go and
dialog: get the good people of this town
dialog: hurt. All we want is the girl.
text: Frank wipes the blood off his face, then--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You can’t have her.
text: The stranger stares at Frank with a faint smile. There it is.
text: The dye is cast. Frank Sullivan has crossed the Rubicon.
text: The stranger glances at George writhing on the ground, then
text: walks across the room...and disappears out the door.
scene_heading: EXT. SALOON -- CONTINUOUS
text: The stranger looks up once more at the WWI banner. Then he
text: turns and walks down the street...whistling the entire way.
scene_heading: INT. SALOON -- SAME TIME
text: Everyone stares at at Frank Sullivan--
text: He doesn’t ask for any help or offer any explanations. He
text: just puts one foot in front of the other...
text: .--and charges right out the front door. BEAT.
text: Tom watches the door shut, then walks across the room and
text: picks up his deputy’s TIN STAR. He wipes it with his thumb...
dialog: 101.
text: .-.the blood smears across the metal, leaving Tom Donovan to
text: stare at his own reflection in the brass-colored tin.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Sue looks up as Frank comes into the room. She sees the blood
text: on his shirt. Her eyes suddenly go wide--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: What did you do?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You have to leave now...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Why? Are they coming?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: No...they’re already here.
text: Frank grabs Sue by the arm and pulls her to the door...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank, wait a minute. Frank...
dialog: (Then, screaming)
dialog: ...take your hands off me!
text: Frank suddenly lets go. Sue looks at him, softly--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry.
text: Frank nods quietly, then glances at the girl; still asleep,
text: completely unaware of what this man is about to do for her.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Are you sure about this?
text: Frank hesitates, then slowly shakes his head--
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Then don’t. Please, just...don’t.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It’s too late. I’m sorry...
text: Frank turns and heads for the door. Sue follows him,
dialog: realizing she may never see him again--
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: I don’t understand...why is this
dialog: your responsibility? Frank, stop!
text: She grabs his arm, desperate to make him stay--
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: SUE (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell me why! Why do you have to go
dialog: out there and face this alone?
text: Frank suddenly erupts, frustrated and out of time--
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Goddamnit, because I don’t have a
dialog: choice. Because there’s a chance I
dialog: might be able to help someone
dialog: tonight. And I have to go. Do you
dialog: understand? I have to go.
text: Sue slowly lets go of his arm. Frank stares at her for a
text: moment, then nods at the young girl--
speaker_heading: FRANK (CONT'D)
text: Push her away from the window
text: before the fighting starts...
text: And then he turns and walks down the hall...
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: Frank?
text: (He stops, turns around)
dialog: When it’s all over, I'll be here...
dialog: (Softly)
dialog: .--waiting.
text: Frank slowly nods, then disappears down the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER
text: Frank comes outside into the cold night air, crunching gravel
text: beneath his boots as he walks down the empty street...
text: He takes position behind a building and waits; his rifle
text: trembling in his hands; his breathing deep and heavy...
text: Frank Sullivan is afraid -- we can see it in his eyes.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: Sue pushes the girl’s bed away from the window, then closes
text: the shutters and leans against the wall.
text: Her eyes close with dread. She slides down to the floor...
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH -- SAME TIME
text: Reverend Farley kneels in the third row of his empty church;
text: hands clasped together tightly in prayer...
dialog: 103.
scene_heading: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- SAME TIME
text: Tom comes inside, shaken and undone. He stares at his wife
text: for a moment, then hears a soft clicking sound...
text: Edward is standing across the room, loading a RIFLE--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Were you and Mom going to ask about
dialog: the limp in my step?
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: (Hesitates)
dialog: I hadn’t noticed...
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Sure you did. You both did. You
dialog: just pretended not to.
text: Tom steps forward, scared to know the answer--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Edward, I asked you a question...
dialog: why are you loading that rifle?
text: Edward slides a final round into the chamber and slams it
text: home. He turns to face his father--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
text: It was just outside Neuve Chapelle.
dialog: I took a bullet in the thigh...
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You never mentioned it in your
dialog: letters.
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: There were a lot of things I didn’t
dialog: mention in my letters...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: There was a french family who gave
dialog: me shelter. If the Germans had
dialog: found me, that family would’ve been
dialog: executed. I was a stranger to them
dialog: just like this girl is a stranger
dialog: to you ...and yet they risked their
dialog: lives in order to save mine.
text: Edward turns to leave, having made his point...
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: To do what I can...
text: Tom pulls Edward back from the door--
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: No, damnit, you’re staying here!
dialog: Your mother and I didn’t wait
dialog: through that blasted war just to
dialog: lose you in some street brawl!
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: Let go of me, I’m not a child--!
speaker_heading: TOM
dialog: You're my child!
text: Edward looks at his father, suddenly calm--
speaker_heading: EDWARD
dialog: I know you’re afraid...
dialog: (Beat)
dialog: But I’m only alive because of

scene_heading: EXT. / INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: The door hinges start to give way as GANGSTERS break down the

dialog: at Frank...but they don’t have time to say thank you--
text: Because FLAMES suddenly burst through the roof!
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: GANGSTER (CONT’D)

text: Frank raises his arms...but doesn't drop his rifle.
speaker_heading: GANGSTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Hey, Bright Boy...I meant drop the
dialog: gun, first!
text: Frank suddenly pulls the trigger and the chandelier explodes.
text: The room plunges to darkness as TOMMY GUNS erupt-—-
text: The brutal gunshots light up the room with ear-splitting
text: violence. Anguished screams of dying men quickly follow--
text: Anything that moves gets shot at. Bodies dance at the
text: bullets, torn apart in the deadly crossfire...
text: And then the guns fall with their owners, hitting the blood-
text: soaked ground as powdered smoke fills the room.
text: The stillness lingers for a moment...and then, suddenly,
text: there’s movement. A body shifting on the floor--
text: It’s Frank, still alive. Last man standing. But he’s wounded
text: .--bad enough that he’s unable to get back on his feet.
dialog: 117.
text: So he crawls, through fallen bodies and pools of blood. Hand

scene_heading: EXT. MAIN STREET -- THAT MOMENT

scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- UPSTAIRS -- THAT MOMENT

scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE -- MAIN FLOOR -- THAT MOMENT
dialog: 
text: The stranger lights a KEROSENE LAMP and stares at the bodies
text: on the floor. He sees a blood trail leading up the stairs...
text: And then the stranger hears Frank crawling...
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
text: Frank pushes the door open and crawls into the room as the
text: stranger's footsteps start to thunk up the stairs...
text: Frank looks around, desperate to find something he can use to
text: block the door. But there’s nothing. He’s stuck...
text: Frank turns and crawls over to the girl’s bedside...
text: He reaches up with his good arm and pulls her down to the
text: floor. Her limp body lands softly beside him...
text: Frank leans her against the bed as the stranger's footsteps
text: reach the top of the stairs and come down the hall...
dialog: Thunk...thunk...thunk...
text: Frank takes out his revolver and opens the cylinder. He
text: slides the last few rounds into the chamber...
dialog: Then, suddenly--
text: Frank feels a tremor of movement beside him.
text: He slowly turns...and sees--
text: The young girl is awake, staring right at him.
dialog: 
text: The life in Frank’s eyes is fading fast. And the stranger’s
text: boots have stopped just outside the door.
text: With his last ounce of strength, Frank puts the loaded gun
text: into the girl’s hands...and pulls back the hammer.
dialog: 118.
text: Frank stares at the girl for a dramatic moment, then falls
text: into her lap as the door softly opens...
text: The girl slowly looks up, horrified--
text: The stranger enters the room, each footstep slow and ominous.
text: He holds up his lantern and looks right at her...
text: The girl’s breathing quickens. She clearly recognizes him..
text: The stranger smiles and takes another step forward. And then
text: he shifts his glance to Frank Sullivan lying on the floor...
text: The girl’s eyes narrow with steely resolve. No longer afraid.
text: Sensing an opportunity. She raises Frank’s revolver...
text: .--and pulls the trigger.
text: The lantern shatters as the bullet explodes the stranger’s
text: skull. A mesh of brains, blood, and teeth splatter the wall--
text: The stranger drops to his knees...
text: And then his body falls forward like a giant tree, hitting
text: the wooden floor with a dull, sickening thud.
text: The girl’s breathing grows calm. She slowly lowers the
text: smoking gun...and looks down at Frank Sullivan--
text: His eyes appear vacant and his chest rises and falls with the
text: shallowest of breaths. We are watching him die...
text: ..-but then the young girl’s hand dips into frame, caressing
text: his neck. She leans down and wraps her arms around him...
text: And Frank seems to draw strength from her embrace...
text: More HANDS suddenly appear. The surviving TOWNSPEOPLE hoist
text: Frank into the air and carry him over to the table...
text: Sue Fowler immediately goes to work...
text: Tom and Edward help the girl walk across the room and sit
text: down in a chair. She turns and looks out the window--
text: Bodies litter the street. The girl's eyes go wide...
text: She glances back at Frank Sullivan, lying on the table,
text: surrounded by friends fighting to save his life.
text: Frank Sullivan, a man she’s never met, but who risked
