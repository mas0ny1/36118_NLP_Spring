speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY
text: An immaculate pool -- clean, clear and placid -- crowds
text: the back yard, bouncing light against the house.
scene_heading: INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - AT WINDOW - DAY
text: The pool can be seen THROUGH filigreed metallic blinds.
text: ROY ENTERS FRAME, suited, coffee cup in hand, and peers
text: out at it for a spell. A calming moment to start his
dialog: day. Then:
text: He raises the blinds, wincing at the floor of sunlight.
text: He checks the window's lock, re-locks it for good
text: measure, then closes the shade again.
text: AT NEXT WINDOW
text: The ritual repeated: blinds up, window's locked, he re-
dialog: locks it.
speaker_heading: AT THIRD
dialog: Repeated.
scene_heading: INT. ROY'S HALLWAY - MORNING
text: Three doors line the left wall; one divides the right;
text: all are shut. Roy emerges from the nearest door on the
text: left (a bedroom) and shuts it behind him. He crosses to
text: the single door on the right (a bathroom), opens it,
text: enters, and shuts it behind him. WATER RUNS and a TOILET
speaker_heading: FLUSHES.
text: He reappears, shuts the door behind him, and enters the
text: middle door on the left (another bedroom, unoccupied).
text: He re-emerges with a handkerchief in hand, then in
text: pocket, and a beeper on his belt, and again shuts the
text: door behind him.
text: He starts for the far door (to a living room) but manages
text: only a few steps before he stops, turns, and heads back
text: to the bathroom door. He opens it and peers inside. A
text: three-count and he shuts it again.
scene_heading: INT. ROY'S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Roy rinses out his mug of coffee, washes the sink basin
text: clean of it, wipes down the kitchen countertop, already
text: spotless, and lets the faucet run as --
text: -- he takes from a cupboard an unlabeled vial of pills.
text: Pulls off the cap, taps two capsules into his palm. And
text: just stares at it. Anxious and exhausted.
text: Then: He tosses the pills down his throat, chases them
text: with tap water, and gives the faucet a firm tug off.
scene_heading: INT. ROY'S CHEVY CAPRICE - DAY
text: Window cracked just enough to suck out his cigarette
text: smoke. AM-FM forecasts the natural weather, region-by-
dialog: region.
speaker_heading: RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
text: Elsewhere, temperatures in New
dialog: York in the high 80's, Chicago
dialog: reports rain, temperatures in the
dialog: high 70's...
scene_heading: EXT. STOPLIGHT - DAY
text: Roy slows to a halt behind a mini-van full of kids. They
text: laugh and scream and wave at Roy. His hands stay glued
dialog: at 2 and 10.
speaker_heading: FRANK (V.O.)
dialog: No, ma'am, it's confirmed --
scene_heading: INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY
text: FRANK MERCER, younger than Roy, works the phones. A sea
text: of papers floods his desk, while the adjoining desk
text: (Roy's) is pristine. In lieu of decor there are stacks
text: of cardboard boxes piled everywhere.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- the Chevy Blazer, the Paris
dialog: vacation, or the Tiffany necklace.
dialog: It's okay if you don't remember
dialog: entering the contest, ma'am,
dialog: you've won --

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- do you have a water filtration
dialog: system in your house? Do you read
dialog: the papers or watch TV, sir? Then
dialog: you've probably seen our
dialog: advertisements --
dialog: The next call --
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- we just have to wait for the
dialog: sponsor's rep to fly in for the
dialog: final drawing. That should be
dialog: next week sometime --

scene_heading: INT. ROY AND FRANK'S OFFICE - DAY 9
text: At his window, Frank watches Roy, frozen in his car.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: -- if you buy the Waterford II
dialog: water filtration system, the prize
dialog: gets recorded as a sales expense
dialog: and you don't pay any tax. Good
dialog: deal, huh?
text: Frank turns to one of the boxes marked "Waterford II" and
text: peels off a price sticker: $49.99.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: $398.00 even. You'd pay twice
dialog: that in stores.
scene_heading: SAME - MINUTES LATER 10

speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You want to what? When will he be
dialog: home?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Mrs. Fisk, my supervisor just
dialog: stepped into my office and he
dialog: would love to talk to you. Can
dialog: you hold just a sec?
dialog: (puts her on hold;
dialog: to Roy, overly sunny)
dialog: Good morning. Something on the
dialog: radio?
dialog: 
dialog: (he offers phone)
dialog: Irene Fisk. ‘Wants to talk to her
dialog: husband first.’
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Who doesn't?
text: Roy declines Frank's phone, moves to his own. He plucks
text: up the receiver, cleans its mouthpiece with his
text: handkerchief, then un-holds Mrs. Fisk. The moment he
dialog: does, his
dialog: whole personality transforms.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Mrs. Fisk? John Goodhew, regional
dialog: vice-president at Allied
dialog: Affiliates. Congratulations!
dialog: Which prize are you hoping for?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That would be my choice, too. Can
dialog: I ask you one question, Irene? Do
dialog: you have grandchildren?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Five! How old? Well, you're a
dialog: very lucky woman. Yes, I agree:
dialog: they are our most precious
dialog: resource. I've got a six and two-
dialog: year old at home and I'll tell
dialog: you: the day I installed a
dialog: filtrator... Absolutely you can
dialog: taste the difference. Now I
dialog: understand you'd like to talk to
dialog: your husband about this first, and
dialog: I understand why, but the thing
dialog: is, Irene --
dialog: (confidentially)
dialog: -- my secretary is having a baby
dialog: this afternoon and the whole
dialog: office here is about to bug out
dialog: and go over to the hospital. Yes,
dialog: it's very exciting. But today is

text: Listening, Roy nods to Frank: she's in. Frank goes to
text: work -- calling a courier service on Roy's line (his
text: mouth grazing the receiver, Roy notices) -- as Roy
text: finishes up. And though his voice may be grinning, his
text: eyes betray him: he doesn't enjoy this.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Irene, that's sweet of you to
dialog: offer, and I'm sure she'd love
dialog: that, but we're in Chicago. Uh-
dialog: huh, cooped up in our corporate
dialog: offices on State Street. I'll
dialog: tell you, though, I rather be out
dialog: in sunny California with you today
dialog: ‘cause it's just pouring up here.
dialog: Cats and dogs, exactly. Now let
dialog: me confirm your address for our
dialog: courier service...
scene_heading: INT. ROY'S CAPRICE (OFFICE PARKING LOT) - DAY 11
text: Roy behind the wheel; Frank knots his tie. Windows up
dialog: tight.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You got any thoughts on lunch?
text: Roy nods. A long-standing joke: the non-answer answer.
text: Frank angles his foot up on the dash, and Roy points it
dialog: off.
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 12
text: Roy moves briskly ahead of Frank along a sidewalk, his
text: hands thrust deep in his coat pockets, which he does
text: whenever he's outside.
scene_heading: EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS HOME 13
text: Door answered by a MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE. Roy and Frank
text: stand on her front porch. Roy presents identification.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Carolyn Schaffer?
dialog: (as she nods)
dialog: I'm Agent Kellaway, this is Agent

text: Roy and Frank sit at a breakfast table, across from the
dialog: Housewife

speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
dialog: He said there'd been a contest,
dialog: and I'd won a prize. He said
dialog: there'd be a drawing in a week,
dialog: and I'd either win a trip to, um,
dialog: France or Italy, I can't remember.
dialog: He said if I bought one of their
dialog: products, their filtration things,
dialog: I wouldn't have to pay tax of the
dialog: prize.
text: She indicates a Waterford II installed on her kitchen
text: faucet, then wilts under her husband's stare.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Jesus, Carolyn...
speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
dialog: (penitent, near tears)
dialog: I was going to surprise you...
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: I'm sorry to tell you this, ma'am,
dialog: but you won't be receiving any
dialog: prize. And I'm sorry to tell you
dialog: you've been the victim of fraud.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: (pissed, taking it out
dialog: on family dog who
dialog: scratches at door)
dialog: Otis! Knock it off!
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's not the newest swindle in the

speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Ah, Jesus, Carolyn...
dialog: (to Frank and Roy)
dialog: What's it worth?
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Any hardware store they're about
dialog: fifty bucks --
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: But we've met people who paid
dialog: twice what you did.
dialog: (to Housewife)
dialog: You wrote a check, ma'am?
dialog: (as she nods)
dialog: Did you mail it to them?
speaker_heading: HOUSEWIFE
text: A courier picked it up.
text: Roy and Frank exchange grimaces.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: If they use the postal system,
dialog: it's mail fraud and we can go
dialog: after them. Otherwise, there's
dialog: not a lot we can do.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Unless...
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Unless what?
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: A lot of these sons-of-bitches --
dialog: excuse me, ma'am -- they work in
dialog: syndicates. If they cashed your
dialog: check out of state, it's federal
dialog: and we can act. But we'd need a
dialog: signed clearance from you for your

speaker_heading: ROY

text: As the Husband's eyes glaze over the small print, the DOG
speaker_heading: SCRATCHES
text: at the door again.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: Let him out, will ya, Carolyn?
text: The Housewife slides open a glass door for the dog, then
text: returns to her seat -- without closing it behind her.
text: Roy's focus fixes on it. And every voice drifts into
dialog: the distance.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: All we need is the name of your
dialog: bank, your account number and your
dialog: signature at the bottom. Any
dialog: luck, these guys were amateurs,
dialog: cashed your check in Nevada.
speaker_heading: HUSBAND
dialog: See, darling? I told you: you're
dialog: too trusting. You gotta be more
dialog: careful of people.

text: the cause of his infirmity: the open door.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: Do you mind if I close this?
text: They don't. Frank rises and closes the glass door. Roy
text: snaps out of it. Sound within the room returns to normal.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Sorry. I'm fine, thanks.
dialog: (he takes L-47)
dialog: Thank you.
text: Frank smiles to allay the Husband's suspicions: What the
dialog: fuck was that about?
scene_heading: EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 15
text: Roy and Frank return to their car, Roy speedily.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You're not taking your pills, are you?
text: Roy faces him, testily, but he never pauses in his effort
text: to get inside his car as fast as he can. Frank,
text: admonished, takes his time getting in.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: It's just that... you looked like
dialog: you were gonna whoopsy-daisy all
dialog: over those people's Oriental.
text: A breath to compose himself and Roy STARTS the CAR.
speaker_heading: FRANK

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: If it's real money, it's long con.
dialog: I don't do long con.
speaker_heading: FRANK
dialog: You haven't done it lately.
text: Frank is looking for a glimmer of hope. Roy gives him none.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Without me, Frank.

speaker_heading: FRANK

scene_heading: INT. ROY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY 18
text: Roy, shoeless, skirts the living room rug to approach a
text: ceramic horse in the corner, next to a sofa. He slides
text: its head up and off its body and rests it on the floor,

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. ROY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY 22
text: Two leaves float atop the pool surface. Roy, with a

scene_heading: INT. ROY'S KITCHEN 23
text: Roy throws the leaves away in the trash below the sink,
text: then rinses out his coffee mug/washes down the
text: basin/cleans the countertop/lets the faucet run. Finds
text: his vial of pills and taps two capsules into his palm.
text: Sets the vial down beside the sink. Stares at the pills
dialog: again --
text: -- then throws them back in his throat and washes them
text: down with tap water (filtrated by a Waterford II). He
text: reaches to turn the faucet off --
text: -- and accidentally knocks the uncapped vial into the
text: sink, upending it and sending pills scattering.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Dammit!
text: He grabs for the vial, empty -- pills are swirling down

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: DR. KLEIN

speaker_heading: ROY

speaker_heading: DR. KLEIN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: Then let's get that prescription

speaker_heading: DR. KLEIN
dialog: Roy, usually I don't prescribe

speaker_heading: DR. KLEIN

speaker_heading: DR. KLEIN

speaker_heading: ROY
dialog: She left with a black eye, which I
text: gave her, and a bun in the oven,
dialog: which might have come from anyone.
dialog: So, no, I haven't. For all I know
dialog: she got hit by a bus. For all I

dialog: ‘cause she'd been down that path
dialog: before.
dialog: (a breath to cool

dialog: Doc: I spent last Tuesday on my
dialog: living room sofa. Watching my
dialog: carpet. Watching fibers on my
dialog: carpet. And the whole time I was
dialog: watching my carpet I was worrying
dialog: that I might vomit, and the whole
dialog: time I was worrying I might vomit,
dialog: I was thinking: I’m a grown man,

dialog: about it the more I realized I

speaker_heading: BISHOP
