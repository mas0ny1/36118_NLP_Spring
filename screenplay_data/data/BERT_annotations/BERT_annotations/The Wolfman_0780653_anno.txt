dialog: woman held, when adultery is no crime?
speaker_heading: STRICKLAND
dialog: Yes, well... I'm not surprised you'd

speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: What kind of man are you, to make
dialog: such accusations against my son?!
speaker_heading: STRICKLAND
dialog: These are facts, not accusations.
dialog: The crime is economic! Should this
dialog: forgiving husband be left unfairly
dialog: responsible for the financial burden
dialog: of the bastard child? I think not.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: That is the reason you pretend so you
dialog: may exert your puritanical will. You
dialog: wish to disgrace whoever dared to
dialog: have relations with a lowly Gypsy!
dialog: So you overstep the bounds of your
dialog: authority by jailing her, while you
dialog: slander my family's good name!
speaker_heading: STRICKLAND
dialog: If that is what you truly believe,

speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Some days, I expect to see him riding
dialog: up to Talbot Hall. Others, I know in
dialog: my heart some terrible fate must have
text: befallen him.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: More often now, I think Benjamin
dialog: simply... left. Moved on to start
dialog: some other life without me...
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Perhaps with someone else.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GWEN

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: I have something for you. Forgive me
dialog: for not giving it to you sooner...
text: Lawrence takes out an old, folded ENVELOPE from his jacket
text: pocket. He takes a LETTER from the envelope.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: You already know Ben and I wrote each
dialog: other when we could. This letter,
dialog: from last year... I've carried it
dialog: with me since. He wrote...
speaker_heading: (READING from LETTER)
dialog: "Her family, of Reeves Lane,

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: We should head back.
text: They walk INTO THE FOREST, leaving the beautiful WATERFALL.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: Why carry it? Why this letter?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: I realized, long ago... by running
dialog: away; by taking my freedom, I denied
dialog: Benjamin any chance at his own. I
dialog: shackled him to my father. And Ben,
dialog: in his goodness, stayed behind to be
dialog: my father's son all these years.
speaker_heading: GWEN
dialog: I don't believe he saw it that way.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: He knew nothing else... had no other
dialog: option, because of me. His whole
dialog: life, he barely even stepped foot :

speaker_heading: GWEN

scene_heading: FROM INSIDE THE RUINS -- SOMEONE'S POV...

speaker_heading: GWEN

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE

dialog: even in the midst of everything...
dialog: I'm glad to have made your
dialog: acquaintance.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Likewise, Doctor.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LLOYD

speaker_heading: DOCTOR LLOYD
dialog: One of your father's men!

scene_heading: ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE MOORS
text: Col. Montford rides, glances back, spurring his horse on.

speaker_heading: DOCTOR LLOYD
dialog: What Hell have we wandered into?
text: A GURGLING CRY is HEARD ahead. Lawrence and Dr. Lloyd look,

text: against a tree...
text: It's Fitzgerald, bloody and barely alive, clutching his
text: RUPTURED throat. Lawrence and Dr. Lloyd fall to their knees

scene_heading: EXT. THE MOORS -- NIGHT
text: One HUNTER SLAMS the ground, holding his BLOODY FACE as...
text: He's DRAGGED AWAY, his foot caught in his horse's stirrup.
speaker_heading: NEARBY
text: Strickland turns his horse, hearing the SOUND of that MAN'S
text: SCREAMS traveling out there in the fog. GUNSHOTS echo.
text: SOMEONE else is YELLING, followed by the WEREWOLF'S ROAR!
text: Strickland's unnerved, looking all directions...
text: Not far away, the grouping of STONE MONOLITHS is vaguely
text: silhouetted. Strickland rides there.
scene_heading: AMONGST THE MONOLITHS
text: Strickland rides to the center of the ancient, ceremonial
text: circle. The WEREWOLF'S ROAR nears. The FIGURE of the
text: WEREWOLF materializes, MOVING quickly, outside the circle.
text: Strickland SHOOTS between the monoliths, targeting the
text: elusive BEAST, till the revolver's EMPTY.
text: Strickland leaps down from his horse, pulls his RIFLE and
text: AMMO BAG from the saddle. He SLAPS his horse's flank, sends
text: the horse running. Strickland shoulders the rifle...
text: He turns, peering down the sight; keeps turning and aiming,
text: frantically trying to cover all possible entry points.
text: FROM BEHIND: the SHAPE of WEREWOLF appears, CHARGING
text: straight at the oblivious Strickland...
text: Strickland is THROWN, flailing -- SMASHING with bone-
dialog: crushing force against one of the immutable monoliths!
text: He crumples limply to the ground. Certainly dead.
scene_heading: ACROSS THE MOORS
text: IN THE QUAGMIRE: the more Col. Montford struggles, the
text: deeper he sinks. He's in nearly up to his waist in the
text: grasping muck, terror and exhaustion taking their toll.
speaker_heading: COLONEL MONTFORD
dialog: Help! Someone! Help me, please!
text: The only answer...the WEREWOLF'S HOWL. Montford gives a SOB.
scene_heading: INT. FOREST -- NIGHT
text: Dr. Lloyd places his jacket over Fitzgerald's corpse.
text: Lawrence notices something peculiar, kneeling.
text: He takes a PIECE of CLOTH from Fitzgerald's fist.

dialog: We DO NOT SEE yet what Lawrence is looking at, but Lawrence
text: is Shaken, Tooking at it in disbelief.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LLOYD
dialog: What is it? Lawrence?
text: Lawrence closes his hand on the cloth, his mind racing.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LLOYD
dialog: What's wrong?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: That night, Doctor... the night

speaker_heading: DOCTOR LLOYD
dialog: We did meet up again in the village,

dialog: this about?

text: He scrambles up onto his horse,. RIDING away.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR LLOYD
dialog: Where are you going?!
text: ON THE MOORS, AT THE BOG
text: Col. Montford struggles in the mire. It's hopeless.
text: The WEREWOLF is HEARD ROARING. Col. Montford pulls his
text: muddy PISTOL, trying to turn his body, trying to take aim.
text: FROM THE FOG: the SHAPE of the WEREWOLF materializes.
text: Col. Montford points his gun, blubbering. The WEREWOLF'S
text: guttural, O.S. BREATHING is HEARD growing CLOSER. Col.
text: Montford's hand is SHAKING badly. He tries to steady the
text: gun in both hands, tears streaking down his dirty cheeks.
speaker_heading: COLONEL MONTFORD
dialog: No...no...no...no...no...
text: The gun WOBBLES so wildly in his grip as to be useless.

speaker_heading: COLONEL MONTFORD
dialog: No, Goddamn you! NO!

scene_heading: EXT. CASTLE RUINS -- NIGHT

scene_heading: INSIDE THE CASTLE RUINS

scene_heading: IN THE CASTLE CATACOMBS
text: Lawrence exits the stairs into a TUNNEL PASSAGEWAY with

text: and peer from the chambers. He approaches an unlocked,
text: wrought IRON GATE across the passageway, pushes through.
text: Lawrence nears the tunnel's end, arriving at...
text: A massive, WOODEN DOOR, reinforced by a METAL SLATS.
text: He marvels at the door's SIX formidable LOCKS and huge
text: CROSSBAR which can be dropped and locked across to keep

text: It takes tremendous effort to swing the door OPEN.
speaker_heading: INSIDE THE DOOR

text: Straight ahead, a METAL CHAIR stands amongst a pile of many
text: heavy CHAINS and SHACKLES. The CHAINS and even the CHAIR

text: Lawrence lifts his lantern, looking up...
text: More SCRATCHES on the low, stone CEILING.
text: Lawrence turns, looking to the inside of the DOOR.
text: It's covered in METAL PLATING which is CLAWED and DENTED.
text: Lawrence crosses to a far wall, examining...
text: A SHRINE of sorts in a small ALCOVE. Melted WAX on the

text: The Werewolf rises to full height so we finally lay eyes
text: upon him: truly half-man/half-wolf, bipedal, covered in
text: dense, dark FUR with much GREY FUR on his face. He wears
text: Sir John's PANTS and tattered SHIRT. His CLAWED hands,

text: Sir John's features are recognizable in the Werewolf's
text: frightful visage, especially in the EYES; but there is no
text: humanity there. The Werewolf is an animal.
text: The Werewolf lets out a ear-splitting ROAR, fangs bared!

text: The Werewolf THROWS Lawrence...
text: -Lawrence lands, stunned, his CLOTHING further SHREDDED, with
text: deep, BLOODY LACERATIONS beneath.
text: Lawrence tries to rise, crawling, trying not to black out.
text: The Werewolf comes to STOMP one clawed foot down on
text: Lawrence's back, forcing him to the ground!
text: The Werewolf crouches over Lawrence, HOWLING victoriously,
text: raising one clawed hand, about to strike the killing blow...
text: A RIFLE SHOT is HEARD -- a BULLET EXPLODING into a TREE
text: behind! The Werewolf spins, his attention captured.
text: ACROSS THE FOREST, Doctor Lloyd walks forward, aiming his

scene_heading: INT. TALBOT HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT
text: With the STORM HEARD raging outside, Young Lawrence peers
text: out into the HALLWAY. An ANGUISHED HOWL is HEARD, but it's
text: lost in the SOUND of THUNDER. Was it imagined?
text: Young Lawrence starts tentatively down the long, dark hall.
text: LIGHTNING illuminates many big game, ANIMAL HEAD TROPHIES
text: mounted one-after-another: TIGER... ELEPHANT... LION...
text: Young Lawrence walks, trying to ignore the freakish tableau.
speaker_heading: DOWN THE HALL

text: Young Lawrence moves to push the DOOR OPEN...
scene_heading: IN THIS MASTER BEDROOM
text: A DARK SHAPE is hunched over, cradling the FIGURE of a WOMAN.
speaker_heading: YOUNG LAWRENCE
dialog: Father... ?
text: The DARK SHAPE turns. LIGHTNING FLASHES across the bloody
text: face of the WEREWOLF! It's Sir John, fully transformed into
dialog: the Werewolf [without any grey fur], ROARING!
text: The cradled WOMAN'S HEAD falls back limply. It's Lawrence's
text: MOTHER; her THROAT TORN OUT, BLOOD FLOWING to the floor.
text: The Werewolf drops her, turning towards Lawrence.
text: Young Lawrence stumbles back in horror...
text: Falling back against his brother, Benjamin, 12, arriving in
text: the doorway. Benjamin, likewise terrified, raises a PISTOL
text: to the room -- FIRES a BOOMING SHOT!
speaker_heading: CONTINUED

scene_heading: INT. CELL, INSANE ASYLUM -- NIGHT
text: Lawrence is in a small, filthy ASYLUM CELL, seated in a
text: WOODEN WHEELCHAIR. He's shirtless, with all the bruised,
text: raw, werewolf-inflicted WOUNDS across his ARMS, SHOULDERS
text: and CHEST sewn up in heavy twine STITCHES. Lawrence panics.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: What... what is this...?
text: He struggles, his ARMS and LEGS BOUND to the chair.
text: Bearded, bespectacled DOCTOR HENDRICK, in a dirty LAB COAT
text: watches. A CREEPY GUARD stands holding the WATER BUCKET.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: What the hell is this!?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HENDRICK
dialog: Calm yourself, Mister Talbot, or I'll
dialog: be forced to put you back under.
text: Lawrence realizes he's unable to break free, helpless.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HENDRICK
dialog: My name is Doctor Hendrick. You've
dialog: been committed to The Lambeth Asylum, |

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: No. That's... that's not possible...

scene_heading: IN THE ASYLUM CORRIDOR

speaker_heading: DOCTOR HENDRICK
dialog: You tried to kill yourself. Your
dialog: father brought you to us. You are
text: gravely injured, not just physically,
dialog: but mentally as well. We've had to
dialog: keep you heavily sedated, lest you
dialog: tear loose your stitches again.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: How long have I been here?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HENDRICK
text: A fortnight now. Spent ranting.
dialog: Raving. You are severely delusional.
text: Lawrence glimpses INMATES in their cells: filthy, half-naked
text: MEN, CRYING, spouting GIBBERISH and/or gesticulating wildly.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR HENDRICK
dialog: Your father is a werewolf, you say.
dialog: You believe your wounds were not self-
dialog: inflicted, but caused when he
dialog: attacked you in his... animalistic
dialog: state. You also claim your father
dialog: murdered your mother. Do you
dialog: remember any of this?
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: (grimly)
dialog: I remember. I remember everything.

speaker_heading: CREEPY GUARD

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Where's Gwen?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
text: Gone. Probably somewhere here in

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Doctor Lloyd?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Killed. Saving you, it seems. Dead
dialog: along with Strickland and Colonel
dialog: Montford.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: You killed them.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Apparently. Though, only you and I
dialog: know that. To everyone else, we and
dialog: some peasants were the few survivors.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: You... you killed mother.
text: This troubles Sir John. He nods, solemnly remembering.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Yes. Yes. So long ago...
dialog: (pause)
text: It's like a vague memory of a
text: nightmare. A nightmare that began on
dialog: a fateful African expedition. Kenya,
dialog: 1863. Where the hunter became the

speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: I barely fought the thing off, but

scene_heading: BACK TO SCENE -- ASYLUM OFFICE
text: Sir John is truly remorseful.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: At the time, I was fully prepared to
dialog: take my own life. How could I not,

dialog: was not me.
dialog: (looks to Lawrence)
dialog: When the transformation comes, I
dialog: cease to exist. I have no control
dialog: over the beast... nor recollection of
dialog: its actions, afterwards. I was as
dialog: much a witness to the tragedy of your
dialog: mother's death as you were.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Is that what you tell yourself?
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Believe what you want. I mourn her

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Ben knew, all this time.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Benjamin had always been the one
dialog: person in my life who remained
text: steadfast by my side. Together, we
dialog: were able to carve out a life for me,

text: Sir John looks to Lawrence.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: I saw the vault in the castle ruins.

speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Ben was not himself once Carmilla was
dialog: jailed, because he knew that you were
dialog: the adulterer. That's why he had
dialog: been seen arguing with her... why he
dialog: visited her. He knew Carmilla
dialog: carried your child.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: And look what the Philistines did to
text: her. Her vile husband beat her
text: bloody before bringing her to
dialog: Strickland, and yet she was the one
dialog: jailed. And for what Crime? Love.
dialog: For love! For that selfsame failing,
dialog: I was expected to be brought forth
dialog: and pilloried. Made a pariah! For
dialog: daring to know love yet one last time
dialog: in my life!
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Except you let this happen when you
dialog: refused to come forward.
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: Untrue! I did everything I could to
dialog: free Carmilla...
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Everything but accept responsibility!
speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: If I came forward, they never would
dialog: have let it end! She gave them a
dialog: name, as I told her to. The next
dialog: night would have passed without
dialog: incident. I would have made certain
dialog: of that. She should have been
dialog: released to leave with her tribe! I
dialog: was willing to lose her, if that's
dialog: what it took. Against every emotion
dialog: in my heart, I would've watched her
dialog: walk out of my life, even carrying my
dialog: own child! So long she was free!
dialog: (fury growing)
dialog: You saw. You saw how the good
dialog: villagers of Blackmoor held their
dialog: tongues while Strickland paraded
dialog: Carmilla before them! After so many
dialog: years of my protecting every man,
dialog: woman and child from the abomination
dialog: inside me! To what end? So I should

speaker_heading: SIR JOHN

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: Before you go, I want you to know...
dialog: I know now that you killed Ben.
text: Sir John stops, keeping his back to Lawrence.
speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: He never would have helped you

speaker_heading: SIR JOHN
dialog: I couldn't have, could I? Since he

speaker_heading: LAWRENCE
dialog: No. When Gwen said he was still at

dialog: everyone. But, she was in London.
dialog: Ben had sent her away. Because he
dialog: knew what you were about to do!

dialog: understand the spear, till Lawrence...
text: SLICES into Grey-Werewolf's arm! Grey-Werewolf backs off

dialog: keeping Grey-Werewolf at bay.
text: Lawrence maneuvers over to grab an unlit OIL LAMP from a
