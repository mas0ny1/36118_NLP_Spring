speaker_heading: JULIE

dialog: house, I go to their bathroom, run
dialog: the water and go into their
dialog: medicine cabinet. If they have

speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: What's happening? Did you have to
dialog: take a drug test, too?
text: Simon looks confused.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Oh, no, no, no. It's nothing
dialog: really. They just... the
dialog: producers saw the rushes last
dialog: night and had some rather
dialog: interesting notes.
text: Roger gives Suzanne one last spritz, sees that Simon
text: wants to talk to Suzanne privately and discreetly re-
text: moves himself. Suzanne tries to seem calm.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Well, what?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Now, don't take it the wrong way.
dialog: I saw them this morning and you
dialog: were fine.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: (gloomily)
dialog: It was my first day.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (emphatically)
dialog: It was your first day, absolutely.
dialog: I couldn't agree with you more.
dialog: The producers simply felt you
dialog: should have fun with it.

dialog: Simon, if I knew how to have fun

dialog: drug tests.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Now, now. I think they had some
dialog: very interesting comments. Maybe
dialog: I'm not saying it properly. What
dialog: I think they meant is that you
dialog: could own your performance. Make
dialog: it more your own. Just sort of
dialog: have fun.
text: Suzanne stares at her feet.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: (sarcastically)
dialog: Really? And here I thought
dialog: everything I did had to be fraught
dialog: with incredible torment. This is
dialog: amazing. Why didn't one of my
dialog: shrinks tell me this?
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: (patiently)
dialog: Now, Suzanne, you shouldn't be in
dialog: this business if you can't take
dialog: criticism.
text: Suzanne stares at her feet.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: But, Simon, please. Have fun with
dialog: it. Don't you think I would do
dialog: that with everything I did if it
dialog: was at all possible?
text: Simon puts his arm around Suzanne.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I know you can do this part. Just
dialog: relax into it. Be yourself and

text: of her pocket, taking the wrapper off and taking a big

speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: At least with me, there's an
dialog: honest level of contempt. They

speaker_heading: TED
dialog: You ought to be an assistant

text: Holding something back.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It felt like you weren't... that
dialog: you didn't make a choice. You
dialog: made a non-choice. Like you were
dialog: concentrating more on not doing
dialog: something than on doing something.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I've been in theatre. I've also
dialog: directed theatre. I'm producing
dialog: this basically to make money. I'm
dialog: actually a theatre director. From
dialog: what I was told, you spontaneously
text: hit Bobby during a rehearsal, and
dialog: Simon stopped you. I don't think
dialog: he should stop your impulses. The
dialog: other thing is that sometimes
dialog: certain line readings are
dialog: appropriate, like in comedy, it's
dialog: a rule that inflections go up at
dialog: the end.
text: Suzanne kneels down to look in Neil's eyes.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: There's a comedy rule?
text: Neil runs his hands through his hair.
speaker_heading: NEIL

dialog: area, because it's hard for me. Tf
dialog: wish I was someone who welcomed
dialog: criticism and immediately
dialog: understood its value, but I'm not
dialog: and if I look unhappy about this,
dialog: Iam. I've had one day of work on
dialog: this and this is my second
dialog: conversation about what's missing

speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (shaking his head)
dialog: We're talking about two minutes of

speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Is it correctable?
speaker_heading: NEIL

text: truck. As she approaches the back of it, she hears
text: what turns out to be Simon's voice. Suzanne slows,
text: eavesdropping on the ongoing conversation. She pulls a
text: bag of honey roasted cashews out of her pocket and eats
text: them quietly as she listens to the two voices.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: Can't you get her into a girdle or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: WARDROBE MISTRESS (0.S.)
dialog: Not with that dress, sir. We
dialog: might be able to use a pantyhose

dialog: sufficient.
speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: All right, all right -- anything.
dialog: Just try to do something. And

text: the script indicates, her tits

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: How unpleasant. Well, perhaps you
dialog: should purchase some sort of
dialog: camisole or something. JI had no
dialog: idea when I hired her that she was

dialog: her if she was still... in her
dialog: prime.
speaker_heading: WARDROBE MISTRESS (0.S.)
dialog: I€ you'll forgive me, Mr. Woodruff,
dialog: with her reputation she is lucky to

speaker_heading: SIMON
dialog: I suppose you're right. It's sad,
dialog: isn't it, really. She was so good
dialog: in “A Night Full Of Shoes." Well,

dialog: Well, look, I saw the rushes and
dialog: frankly, you're holding back.
dialog: See, I think of this piece as a

speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: I appreciate your comments, Mr.
dialog: Lazan. I'11 certainly give

dialog: To lead the kind of life you lead?
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: The trouble is I can't feel my
dialog: life. I can see it all around me
dialog: and I see that so much of it is
dialog: good and I just... take it the

speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Yeah, that's me. I don't want life

dialog: art.
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Look, look up on the screen. See
dialog: what you can do? And you weren't
dialog: even conscious then. Imagine what
dialog: you could do now.
speaker_heading: SUZANNE
dialog: Maybe I should just go back into
dialog: the clinic.
speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Speaking of art? Look, growing up
dialog: is a process, not an event. It's
dialog: not like in the movies, where you
dialog: have a realization and your life

dialog: realization and your life changes

speaker_heading: SUZANNE

speaker_heading: LOWELL
dialog: Well, it doesn't start for 4
