dialog: 17 June 2004
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
text: The gym is filled to the rafters with screaming students
text: cheering on their basketball team. One particularly good
text: looking player, who we’ll learn later is JOHN TUCKER, fakes
text: one way, spins in the other direction and dunks. The gym
text: goes nuts. We push in on a girl, KATE (17), sitting in the
text: stands. She’s high up and she’s there alone - she has a book
text: in her hand which she reads during time outs. She’s pretty,
text: but not made up too much, and she’s dressed comfortably, so
dialog: as not to draw too much attention to herself.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: I was in seventh grade when I realized I
dialog: was invisible.
scene_heading: INT. GRADE SCHOOL
text: A teacher arranges a group of seventh grade girls in line by
text: height. Kate is towards the middle.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Not really invisible - although, how
dialog: awesome would that have been? No, it’s
dialog: just that I didn’t make an impression of
dialog: any kind. If I disappeared, it wouldn't
text: even cause a ripple.
text: A teacher shifts a young Kate one space over, now exactly the
dialog: middle.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I wasn’t the tallest or the shortest, I
dialog: wasn’t the smartest or the dumbest, I
dialog: wasn’t the richest or the poorest... I was
dialog: just what’s-her-name, you know, the
dialog: brunette? Kate, I think?
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: A spelling bee is in progress, as a young Kate takes her turn
text: at the podium. She’s one of seven people left.
speaker_heading: YOUNG KATE
scene_heading: A-N-O-N-I-M-O-U-S. Anonymous.
speaker_heading: MODERATOR (0.S.)
dialog: I’m sorry, that’s wrong.
text: Kate walks away.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: It’s not that I didn’t try - I was a pretty
dialog: good speller, and a pretty good singer, and
dialog: a pretty good runner-
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK - DAY
text: A group of girls run past the finish line.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: And in fourth place, just out of the
dialog: medals, Kate Spencer.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
text: The auditorium is decorated for a dance and is filled with
text: freshman boys and girls. Freshman Kate sits against the
text: wall, trying to look like a great person to dance with.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Even in love... well, I usually ended up
text: out of medal contention there, too.
text: A good looking boy walks over and takes in Kate and the other
text: wallflowers. He looks to Kate’s left - at a rather
text: unfortunate looking girl. He shudders, looks at Kate. Not
text: bad. He smiles, starts over, when a hot girl to Kate’s right
text: suddenly pops into view - she’d been picking a button off the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: HOT GIRL
dialog: Found it!
text: She and the boy lock eyes - the boy veers off from Kate and
text: holds out his hand to the hot girl. They twirl off like Fred
dialog: and Ginger.
scene_heading: INT. GIRL’S LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: Kate stands at a locker by herself, getting dressed, as other
text: groups of girls around her talk.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: It didn’t help that my mom and I were
dialog: always moving. You can put up with just
dialog: about anything when you’ve got a bunch of
dialog: great friends to help you through, but,
dialog: well, let’s just say “openness to
dialog: outsiders” isn’t really what teens are
dialog: famous for.
text: One of the girls near Kate turns to her friends.
scene_heading: GIRL IN LOCKER ROOM
dialog: I don’t have anything for my hair. Do you
dialog: have a barrette or something?
text: Kate surreptitiously pulls the elastic band out of her hair,
text: turns to the girl.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hey, I’ve got one.
scene_heading: GIRL IN LOCKER ROOM
dialog: Do I know you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not really...
scene_heading: GIRL IN LOCKER ROOM
dialog: Pass.
text: The girls head out. The locker room is empty now; Kate’s
text: alone. She sighs, puts her hair back together.
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: We're in the living room of a house on moving day - boxes and
text: furniture scattered everywhere. A sweaty Kate staggers
text: through with a box.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: There was one last thing working against
dialog: me.
text: There’s a knock at the door. She turns and drops the box
text: when she sees who it is - it’s an older boy, a knockout. He
text: holds out a plate wrapped with aluminum foil.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: (too cool)
dialog: Hey. I’m Justin, I live next door, and my
dialog: mom sent me over with these brownies or
dialog: something...
text: Kate takes the plate while she tries to push her hair into
dialog: some arrangement that’s not too disgusting.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Hi. I’m Kate. I just moved in. Duh.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: So, Kate, you-
text: Something catches Justin’s eye.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy...
text: Kate turns to see what he’s looking at - a gorgeous woman in
text: her early thirties just walked into the room. She’s been
text: working, too, but instead of sweating, she’s glistening like
text: a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model on a beach in Fiji.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She’s dressed in shorts and a t-shirt that may have fit her
dialog: in grade school.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: That other thing working against me?
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: This is my Mom.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Lori. Hi.
text: Justin takes the plate out of Kate’s hand and holds it out to
dialog: Lori.
speaker_heading: JUSTIN
dialog: I made these for you.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I can pick up heavy things.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - DAY
text: Kate sits at her desk, taking notes as she reads a textbook.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
text: It’s not like she can help it. She’s just
text: incredibly beautiful and skimpily dressed.
dialog: Okay, maybe she can help that part.
text: Kate looks up from her book.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Did you get this on page fifty-one? Andy?
text: We see that Kate is studying with a boy, but he’s looking out
text: the window. Down by the pool, Kate’s mother is tanning face
text: down, with her top on the pool deck beside her.
speaker_heading: ANDY
dialog: Turn over turn over turn over turn over
dialog: turn over turn over...
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: It’s not like being beautiful has made her
dialog: life any easier. I mean, she’s never had
dialog: trouble landing great looking men, she’s
dialog: just had trouble keeping them. In the last
dialog: seventeen years, she’s been through four
dialog: marriages and I don’t know how many
dialog: boyfriends. That’s why we’re always
dialog: moving.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE:
text: A quick series of shots of different great looking men
text: staring into the camera.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAN #1
dialog: Hi
speaker_heading: MAN #2

speaker_heading: MAN #3

dialog: to
speaker_heading: MAN #6
dialog: be
speaker_heading: MAN #7
dialog: your
speaker_heading: MAN #8
dialog: new
speaker_heading: MAN #9
dialog: dad. Your mom and I are going to, uh, talk
dialog: in the bedroom, so you be a good girl and
dialog: watch TV. Actually, here’s twenty bucks.
dialog: You mind running down to the store and
dialog: getting me some smokes?
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
text: We're back at the game we started at, with Kate in the
dialog: stands.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: But enough about me. The real story here
dialog: is John Tucker.
speaker_heading: ON COURT
text: John, our star basketball player, has the ball again. He
text: passes it - no, he’s kept in the palm of his hand, he drives
text: and dumps off to a teammate who’s free under the basket for a
text: lay up. More cheers, high fives all around. John’s a stud:
text: tall, buff, best head of hair on campus.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s John Tucker. Captain of the
dialog: basketball team, family’s loaded, always
dialog: voted most likely to everything, lost his
text: virginity at 14. To the french teacher.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: IN THE CROWD
text: A pretty woman in her twenties, wearing a French flag
text: sweatshirt and waving a team flag, cheers John on.
speaker_heading: ON COURT
text: John hassles the passer, then jogs backwards on defense.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s the guy this school revolves around.
dialog: At least, he used to be until... You know
dialog: what? I’m getting ahead of myself. It all
dialog: started when my mom got divorced again, and
dialog: we moved to this town to “start over.” I
dialog: got a job as a waitress at what turned out
dialog: to be John’s favorite restaurant. I wasn’t
dialog: the best waitress ever, but I wasn’t the
dialog: worst...
scene_heading: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Kate comes out of the kitchen and crosses over to find John
text: Tucker (in suit and tie) sitting at a table with CARRIE,
dialog: editor of the school paper. Carrie’s a super-smart
dialog: overachiever with roughly a thousand commitments taking up
text: her time. She’s also (like everyone with John) very pretty.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Are you ready...?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (to Carrie)
dialog: I’m not sure... Are you ready?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Do you recommend anything?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Me? What do you recommend? You're the one
dialog: who speaks Italian.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I don't speak it, I know a little...
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That you picked up travelling around
dialog: Europe. You’re so lucky. I can only
dialog: imagine walking around the same streets
dialog: where all those artists and poets walked,
text: looking at the same sights Shakespeare
dialog: looked at when he wrote
dialog: (gazing into Carrie’s eyes)
dialog: “Her beauty makes this vault a feasting
dialog: presence full of light...”
speaker_heading: (MORE ) (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: (then)
dialog: Maybe I don’t need to go to Europe after
dialog: all.
text: Carrie blushes, gives a flustered laugh. John turns to Kate.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I guess we need a minute. Thanks.
text: Kate walks off - it’s clear she’s more than a little
text: impressed by John’s display.
scene_heading: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: It's a different night at Kate’s restaurant. Kate comes out
text: of the kitchen loaded down with plates. She hears a
text: snapping, glances towards the source, then does a double
text: take. John Tucker (in a letterman’s jacket) is there with a
text: different girl, HEATHER, who couldn’t look more like a
text: cheerleader because she is a cheerleader. She’s been popular
text: and beautiful for so long that she’s grown to believe that
dialog: her superiority is the natural order of things. John keeps
text: snapping at Kate without looking, finally Kate gets the
text: plates down and heads over to John’s table.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hi. Would you-
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: We’re ready to order.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh, okay.
dialog: (to Heather)
dialog: What would you like?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’ll order for her.
text: Heather puts down her menu, gets a huge smile on her face.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I love that.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (all charm)
dialog: I love taking care of you.
dialog: (to Kate, all business)
text: Two spinach salads, chicken piccata for
dialog: her, filet for me, medium. And don’t rush
dialog: us between courses. Got it?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh, yeah. Can I-
text: But John’s done with her, and has turned back to Heather.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That sweater is so hot on you. I bet it’s
dialog: even hotter off you.
text: Heather laughs; Kate walks away shaking her head - what
dialog: happened to the John that was here the other night?
scene_heading: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Yet another night. John Tucker (in slacker-wear) sits at a
text: table with BETH. She’s a hippie throwback, a young Drew
text: Barrymore type. She and John are looking at their menus.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’ve never been here, I hope they have good
dialog: vegetarian...
dialog: (off the menu)
dialog: Oh my Goddess.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Veal. lLet’s go.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Don’t worry, I’m sure I can find something.
text: ANGLE ON: Kate, standing over at a waitstation with another
text: waitress. She’s gestures at John.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What's the deal with-
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: John Tucker. Total operator. Brings all
dialog: his women here.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How does he get away with dating so many
dialog: women?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: (bitter laugh)
text: He says his father doesn’t want him dating
dialog: during the basketball season so he “keeps
dialog: his focus.” Total lie. It’s just another
dialog: one of his scams so they have to keep the
dialog: “relationship” secret.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Unbelievable. How’d you learn all this?
text: The waitress starts to cry and runs back into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. GYM - DAY
text: Kate is in gym class with the other girls, including John's
text: three current girlfriends (Heather, Carrie and Beth).
dialog: They’re picking teams for volleyball - about half the girls
text: are still waiting to be picked, including Kate. Heather (the
text: cheerleader) is one of the girls picking. She points at
dialog: Kate.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Uh... I’11 take her.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (too eager)
dialog: Kate. Hi. I didn’t catch your name?
text: Heather looks at Kate like she’s nuts.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Okay, moving on.
scene_heading: INT. GYM - LATER
text: The game’s in progress. A point is scored, and while a girl
text: runs after the ball to retrieve it, Carrie (the editor) is
text: gossiping with the girl standing next to her.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: You weren’t at the party. Where were you?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I’m not suppose to say, but...
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: John Tucker.
text: Behind Carrie, Heather is getting ready to serve. She
text: obviously heard this - her mouth drops wide open.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Get out!
text: COACH WILLIAMS, the gym teacher, blows her whistle.
speaker_heading: COACH WILLIAMS
dialog: Less talking, more playing. Serve it.
text: Heather tosses the ball in the air and serves it - right into
text: the back of Carrie’s head. Carrie is knocked on her face.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sorry. It slipped.
text: The girls around Carrie (including Kate) pick her up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I’m okay, I’m okay. Let’s just play.
text: Every gets back in position and Heather serves again - right
text: into the back of Carrie’s head, sending her down again.
text: Carrie jumps up and runs over to Heather, as the other girls
text: crowd around and the coach starts madly blowing her whistle.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: That wasn’t an accident!
text: Beth (the hippie) gets between Carrie and Heather, who ignore
text: her as they keep arguing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You better stay away from him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Violence isn’t going to solve anything.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: What’s it to you?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No man is worth us fighting over.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Listen, I don’t know what he told you, but
dialog: John Tucker is dating me.
text: Now Beth’s mouth drops - she turns and slugs Heather in the
text: jaw, dropping her to the floor.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: (from the floor)
dialog: What the hell is your problem?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’m dating John Tucker.
text: Coach Williams has finally made it over.
speaker_heading: COACH WILLIAMS
dialog: Enough.
text: She grabs Carrie, who grabs the coach’s clipboard and swings
text: it at Beth. Beth moves, and Kate gets hit instead. It’s an
text: all out melee now, with Kate accidentally caught in the
text: middle. People are falling, arms are swinging, and finally
dialog: Kate snaps:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Stop it! This guy is cheating on all of
dialog: you and instead of being mad at him, you’re
dialog: beating the crap out of each other?!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Silence as the girls look at each other, digesting the wisdom
text: of what Kate said. Finally, Beth turns to Heather:
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Who’s that?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don’t know. Pam, maybe?
scene_heading: INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Kate is at the mirror, trying to cover up the bruise on her
text: cheek from where she got hit. Carrie comes in.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Sorry about your face. Kate, right?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah. It only hurts when I smile. Or
dialog: talk. Or do this.
text: She makes a face in the mirror, winces. Carrie laughs.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: What you said out there-
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sorry, someone just sat on me and-
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yeah, that was me. But the thing is, you
dialog: were right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I was?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Look what he’s doing to us girls. I don’t
dialog: even know you, and I hit you in the head
text: with a clipboard.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That was you too, huh? Anyway, I’ve seen a
dialog: million John Tuckers, they all lie to get
dialog: what they want, and the girls always put up
dialog: with it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: You’re totally right. I never understood
dialog: it until now, but you’re right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, it helps that those are the only guys
dialog: my mom dates. Pretty soon, you figure out
dialog: they're all the same.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Come on. I’ve got some planning to do, and
dialog: then we've got to talk to Beth and Heather.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We? You want me to come?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Sure, in case we start fighting again, I’ve
dialog: got to have someone to hide behind.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What the heck. I think my head can absorb
dialog: three or four more good shots before I have
dialog: brain damage.
text: Carrie heads out of the bathroom; Kate in tow.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - LATER
text: Kate, Carrie, Beth and Heather sit at a table. Beth and
text: Heather don’t look too happy to be there.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Be honest. What are you going to do about
dialog: John?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’m totally breaking up with him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No you're not.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Like you are.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It’s up to him. If he dumps you two, I’1l
dialog: take him back.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: We’re going to end up right back where we
dialog: started. He’ll get back together with all
dialog: of us, lie about it until he decides he’s
dialog: done with us and then dump us for good.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Beth and Heather stare at Carrie, unconvinced. Kate clears
text: her throat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I bet I know what you’re thinking. “I’m
dialog: different. I’m the one he’s going to stay
dialog: with forever.”
text: Beth and Heather look at each other, look down.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Why not? I am the head cheerleader.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You say that like it makes you some kind of
dialog: god and we’re all losers.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No. I mean, a little, but no. I don’t
dialog: think that.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Let’s stay focused here. Everyone he’s
dialog: ever dated thinks they’re different. It’s
dialog: what he does.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So what are we supposed to do?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Kate had an idea.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I was just saying it’s always the women who
dialog: end up getting hurt...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
text: Exactly. Why is he getting off the hook?
dialog: We could all date anyone, and for some
dialog: reason we let him walk all over us.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It’s because he’s hot.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Hot? He’s the most gorgeous man I’ve ever
text: seen. He’s like a Greek god, sent to earth
dialog: to remind us mortals what beauty is.
text: Beth notices everyone staring at her. She snaps out of it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 14,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: But you’re right. That’s not enough.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So why not teach him a lesson?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: How? Break up with him? He’1l have
text: someone else in a second.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No, bigger. We're going to make him
dialog: undateable, make it so no one wants to go
dialog: out with him anymore.
text: Carrie pulls out a huge sheath of color-coded papers and
text: folders, hands a thick stack to each girl.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I had some time to go over some possible
dialog: approaches. I’11 bottom line it: he
dialog: doesn’t know we’re on to him. We can use
dialog: the fact that we’re his “girlfriends” to
dialog: set him up, humiliate him, and make him
dialog: look like a fool in front of the whole
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (smiles, imagining it)
dialog: That wouldn’t suck.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: And we won’t just be taking care of him.
dialog: We'll be sending a message to all the John
dialog: Tuckers that we’re not going to put up with
dialog: it anymore. They’re going to have to treat
dialog: us with respect.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: They’re going to have to stop lying to us.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: And cheating on us.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Exactly! I’ve got a whole section on that
text: starting on page three.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (paging through thick folder)
dialog: When do you sleep?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I take ten minute naps five times a day.
dialog: I’m like Thomas Edison.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (whispers to Beth)
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (whispers back)
dialog: He was a President.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Come on, what do you say?
dialog: A beat, then:
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Let’s get him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I’m in. But if I find out this is some
dialog: kind of trick, I’m back with him so fast...
text: Carrie pulls out a small leather notebook, writes in it.
dialog: Yes, this has some significance later.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wow, this is great. He doesn’t stand a
dialog: chance against you guys.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You’re not going to help us?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Me? Why me?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: It was your idea.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, I just pointed out that you all should
dialog: do something. He didn’t do anything to me.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Didn't he? He got all of us mad enough to
dialog: beat the crap out of you in gym.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Besides, can you honestly say that you
dialog: haven’t been screwed over by a John Tucker
dialog: somehow, somewhere?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Come on, it'll be fun. What else are you
dialog: doing?
text: Heather has a good point. Kate shrugs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Let’s get him.
scene_heading: EXT. STADIUM - DAY
text: Different groups are using the track: the female track team
text: (including Kate) is running sprints, and the cheerleaders,
text: led by Heather, are just finishing up practice as random
text: people jog by on the track. One of them is John Tucker, who
text: stops and waits for Heather to wander over and join him. He
text: glances around to make sure no one is within earshot.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Heard there was a thing in gym yesterday.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Some loser was saying she went out with
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You're kidding. That’s such a lie.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh, I totally know. Don’t worry. I mean,
dialog: you can’t date-
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (sadly)
dialog: The basketball.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But if you could, I know who it’d be.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know it, babe.
text: John looks around to makes sure no one’s watching, slaps
text: Heather on the ass.
text: ACROSS THE FIELD: Kate is standing at a drinking fountain,
dialog: watching.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Euch.
text: There's a guy standing behind her at the fountain, SCOTT.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Is that for her or him?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: That’s not usually the noise girls make
text: when they look at him. Usually it’s more
dialog: of a “ohhhhh...”
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Jerk isn’t really my type.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I guess he is kind of a jerk, isn’t he?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m surprised to hear a guy say that. I
dialog: thought he was your god.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh no. Seriously?
text: Scott holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Scott Tucker.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Kate. I’m so embarrassed-
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Don’t be. If anything, I’m embarrassed
dialog: about being his brother. I think my mom
dialog: was experimenting with drugs or living on a
text: toxic waste dump when she had him.
text: Kate laughs. They’re interrupted by a bell.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: Damn, I’ve got to run. Don’t worry, your
dialog: secret’s safe with me, Kate.
text: Scott winks and heads off.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Heather and Carrie are sitting in Kate’s living room as Kate
text: opens the door and lets Beth in. Carrie has a new Apple
text: Powerbook plugged into Kate’s television - on the screen is a
text: Keynote presentation, complete with an unflattering picture
text: of John and a list of bullet points next to him. Very slick.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Did you talk to him?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Heather
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, he just stopped by my house. He said
dialog: I’m the only one for him, you guys are
dialog: liars, meat is murder...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yeah, we all got the same story.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Your house? Did you hook up?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh my god. You did.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No. A little.
dialog: (then)
dialog: We can’t let him get suspicious! I always
dialog: fool around with him! It wasn’t for me, it
dialog: was for us! I mean, I enjoyed it, but...
dialog: It wasn’t for me!
text: and Carrie exchange a look.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Told you she couldn't keep it together.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Figures you two would gang up on me.
dialog: Little Miss Popular and Little Miss
dialog: Perfect.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Hey, don’t lump me with her.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What’s that supposed to mean?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Just that we’re very different.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Meaning you're better than me.
text: Kate laughs. Everyone looks at her.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don’t you see? This is exactly how he gets
dialog: away with it. He knows you wouldn't be
text: caught dead talking to each other, and
dialog: that’s why he’s so safe cheating.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 19.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Kate’s right. I’m sorry. We've got to
dialog: stick together, all right?
text: The girls nod.
dialog: There's
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, he’s back with all of us, he doesn’t
dialog: know anything's up, let’s keep it that way
dialog: until we get him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Speaking of which, does anyone have any
dialog: idea how we’re going to do this?
text: a pause. Heather holds up one of Carrie’s folders.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, I read Carrie’s term paper-
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No you didn’t.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Okay, but come on, it’s like the phone
text: book. I flipped through, and didn’t see
dialog: anything, um...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Concrete. Yeah. You’ve got some great
dialog: ideas, but what do we do?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, I mean, I don’t know him like you all
dialog: do, but I noticed something. He makes
dialog: every woman he’s with feel special, he
dialog: tells them exactly what they want to
dialog: hear... what if we showed people that it’s
dialog: just an act? Really show who he is, so no
dialog: one ever trusts him again? I mean, when I
dialog: saw him, I thought he was cute, but after I
dialog: saw how he was with all of you...
text: The girls take this in, nodding.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Excellent. Good. Throw those away.
text: Carrie grabs all the folders.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let’s get to work.
dialog: (ve: computer)
dialog: Beth, you mind starting the presentation?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Beth goes to the computer, reaches for a key.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not that. Just press the- no, not that.
dialog: Move the cursor to- You know what? I’11
dialog: work the computer.
text: Carrie pushes Beth out of the way, cradles her computer.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’m glad we're getting to know each other.
dialog: I'd always heard you were kind of a control
dialog: freak.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Kate, you get sodas.
scene_heading: CARRIE/BETH/HEATHER
dialog: Diet.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: And Heather, you...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Sit here and look good until you need me?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Are we a well oiled team or what?
text: Kate goes into the kitchen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Kate enters just as her mother comes in from outside,
text: carrying a bag of groceries. Lori’s dressed in her usual
text: young, hip, sexy way, looking more like a teen than a mom.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Hey, what’s up?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, nothing, just-
text: Laughter from the next room.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You have friends over?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, a few girls stopped by.
text: Lori hugs Kate.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I knew you'd like it here. This is great.
dialog: I can’t wait to meet them.
text: Lori heads out of the kitchen.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Actually, we’re-
text: Too late. Lori’s gone. Kate grabs sodas and follows.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kate enters the room right behind Lori.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Beth, Carrie, Heather, this is my mom.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Lori.
text: The girls all exchange looks - Lori doesn’t look like a mom.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: So what are you all up to?
speaker_heading: BETH
text: Destroying a man.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Who do I make my check out to?
text: The girls laugh. Lori crosses over and sits on the floor
text: with the girls.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: So, who is he and what did he do?
text: Beth presses a key on her computer; John zooms back onto the
text: screen, along with ominous sound effect music and booing.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: This is John Tucker.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Cute. Let me guess, heartbreaker?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Big time.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You’re lucky I got here. I’ve got some
dialog: experience in this field.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Kate can’t take any more. She pastes on a smile, trying very
dialog: hard not to let her true feelings out.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Mom, I really don’t know if we should be
dialog: taking advice about men from you.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Why not? I’ve dated a hundred of them. I
dialog: know all their tricks.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And yet, you still keep going falling for
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: What’s the matter? She’s an expert.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, then.
text: Kate shrugs, hands out the sodas, takes a seat. She’s nota
text: happy camper. Carrie takes her place at her computer - her
text: talk is illustrated by an impressive presentation, complete
text: with video, graphics, music, etc...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: All right, Kate’s right. We need to show
dialog: people the real John Tucker. And to do
dialog: that, we need a public platform - something
dialog: where the whole school is there. That much
dialog: I’ve already got figured out. Ladies
dialog: and... ladies, I give you: the school
dialog: election.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: The election?
speaker_heading: BETH
text: He’s not even running.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yes, the election, and he will run. Beth,
dialog: you’re going to convince him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: How do I do that?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: How do girls get boys to do anything?
dialog: 23.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER
text: The hall is empty. Suddenly, the door to the boys bathroom
text: crashes open, and Beth and John stumble into the hallway, in
text: an embrace. They break; Beth tucks in her shirt, John wipes
text: the lipstick off his face. Beth pauses under a political
text: poster - a slick one with a photo of a smiling guy running
dialog: for school president.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You know, I’m surprised you never ran for
dialog: any kind of office.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: It’s just something you do to get into
dialog: college, and I’ve got the basketball.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, I guess you’re right. Still, it’s a
dialog: big popularity contest, and there’s no way
dialog: he’s more popular than you.
text: Beth heads back towards her class, leaving John looking up at
text: the poster. He doesn’t look happy.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY
text: Carrie sits at a computer in the middle of a chaotic pile of
dialog: photos, old issues, submissions... There’s one other student
text: working there - he looks up as John enters. Unseen to
text: Carrie, John points at the door, and the student takes off.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, Carrie. What do you think about me
dialog: running for school president?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I didn’t think you got into that.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I never did, and all of a sudden I realized
dialog: I’m missing part of the high school
dialog: experience.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: It’s a little late to be getting involved-
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’ve got to win. You’ll help me. You're
dialog: the smartest girl I know, you run the
dialog: newspaper-
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: (pretending to soften)
dialog: You want my help? Well...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I knew you’d do it. I love you.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: What?
text: John acts surprised, like he didn’t mean to let that slip
text: out. He clearly did.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I mean, I love you for helping. I can’t
dialog: believe I said that.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: No, it’s okay...
text: He holds her hand, gazes into her eyes, then:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So, you'll do it?
scene_heading: INT. DIVE RESTAURANT - DAY
text: The four girls are sitting together at a table. Heather
text: takes a bite of her burger, grimaces.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Since when do we eat here?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Since we can’t be seen together. If he
dialog: hears we're friends, he’1l know something's
dialog: up. Come on, it’s not that bad.
text: Carrie samples her food, shudders, gingerly returns the bite
text: to her napkin.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Anyone have a napkin they’re not using so I
dialog: can blot the grease off my tongue?
text: Kate hands over a napkin. Carrie licks it. Beth begins
text: doing surgery on her sandwich - the other girls’ watch as she
text: removes the meat patty from her burger, removes the cheese,
text: replaces the tomato and lettuce, and squirts about a quart of
text: ketchup and mustard onto it. She takes a bite, notices that
text: she’s being watched.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Being a vegetarian sucks. I want a
dialog: personal thank you note from every stupid
dialog: cow and chicken I haven’t eaten.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Okay, here’s where we are. I’ve already
dialog: convinced John that we should show a video
dialog: for his campaign speech.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: A video that, let me guess, you'll be
dialog: editing?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Isn’t he going to want to see it before you
dialog: show it?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I’m going to make two. I make a real one
text: to show him, where he talks about all the
dialog: things that make him a good candidate -
dialog: loyalty, honesty...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And we make another one where we cut ina
dialog: bunch of stuff about what a sleazebag he
dialog: really is.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Gee, I hope there’s not some mix-up, and we
dialog: end up showing the wrong video to the whole
dialog: school. It would ruin him.
text: They laugh.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: To get the footage we need, we’re going to
dialog: need a lot of equipment - microphones,
dialog: hidden cameras...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Beth, that’s you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I don’t know anything about electronics.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, but you're rich.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Hey, I don’t like labels. My parents may
dialog: buy into the whole bourgeois lifestyle, but
dialog: that doesn’t mean I have to. It’s their
dialog: money, not mine.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: If we agree that you’re a poor repressed
dialog: member of the underclass, can we use one of
dialog: your fifty credit cards?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Sure.
text: Beth digs through her purse, pulls out credit cards, hands
dialog: one to each girl.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT’D)
dialog: AmEx Blue, Visa Platinum...
dialog: (sentimental)
dialog: Oh, my first Master Card. We’ve had some
dialog: fun, haven’t we?
text: She reluctantly hands it over.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)
dialog: Be careful with him. His little magnetic
text: strip’s almost worn off.
scene_heading: INT. HEATHER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Heather’s bedroom is covered with bags from electronics
text: stores and spy stores. Beth and Carrie are playing with
text: monitors, binoculars, etc. Heather’s in just a bra, as Kate
text: tries to attach a camera with fumbling hands.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: All right, almost there. Sorry, I’ve never
dialog: done this.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Put a camera on someone, or groped a girl?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, neither.
text: Kate gets the camera on.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: There, how does that feel?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Well, the camera kind of pinches, but
dialog: you've got soft hands.
text: Beth turns on a monitor - we see a huge distorted close up of
text: Kate’s face as shot through the camera.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Whoa.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How do I look?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Tres bad angle - straight up your nose.
text: Take two steps back from Heather’s breasts.
text: Kate does.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT’D)
text: Much better. The lighting still isn’t
dialog: great. Try turning to the left.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Oh, we're not doing this to get glamor
text: shots of Kate. Kate, speak into the
text: cleavage.
text: Carrie puts on a pair of headphones as Kate steps back up to
dialog: Heather.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Um, testing. One two. Testing.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Okay, it’s good. There’s kind of an echo,
dialog: but it’s good.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What do I want him to say?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Well, we want him to act like a sleazy
dialog: horndog, so...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Just let him be himself?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: That’11 work.
text: Carrie pulls out her notebook, starts writing.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sorry, do you mind if I ask... what are you
dialog: always writing in there?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Just my lists. You know, normal stuff,
dialog: same aS everyone.
dialog: (off their blank looks)
dialog: I've got my “to do” list, which is
dialog: subdivided into my “to do today,” “to do
dialog: one time,” “to do weekly,” you know.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Then there's my “goals” list, again, “high
dialog: school,” “college,” and “life;” my
dialog: “contingency” lists in case one of my goals
dialog: or to do items doesn’t work out the way I
dialog: expected, my “observations,” my “notions,”
dialog: which yes, are very different, and of
dialog: course a few ideas for the screenplay I
dialog: plan to write during my summer in Belize.
dialog: Or Toronto, depending on the political
dialog: climate. Don’t you all do this?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No. No one does that. Martha Stewart
dialog: would meet you and go “you know, she’s a
dialog: little anal for my taste.”
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Well, it works for me.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What happens if you lose the book?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: You’re not going to freak me out that
dialog: easily. I have a duplicate at home, and I
dialog: copy the changes in every night.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, but what about all the
dialog: “contingencies” and “notions” you come up
dialog: with during the day? They’d just be...
dialog: gone forever?
text: Carrie processes this. Her eyebrow twitches. The girls go
dialog: in for the kill.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, maybe you should carry a third book-
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Stored in a separate location from the main
dialog: book, of course-
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Right, and then you should immediately copy
dialog: everything that happens into both of those
dialog: books.
text: Carrie starts hyperventilating. The other girls laugh.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Come on, we're just messing with you.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, I think you’1l be okay with two
dialog: books.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Sure, you’re right. Good one.

scene_heading: EXT. PARK - NIGHT

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: He’s good.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You know, I was actually wondering about
dialog: that. Is he good? You know. In bed.
speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’ve never...
dialog: (what the hell)

dialog: (then)
dialog: Not that I have anything to compare him to.
dialog: I mean, he’s my only, of course.
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: Well, one of a few. Let’s just say I can

dialog: one foot. Hey, could we talk about one of
dialog: you now?
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 30.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: BETH

scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - DAY
text: Our four are gathered, going over one of Carrie’s large

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: This is going better than I thought. We’re

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 31.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wait a second, that’s not a bad idea. We

dialog: contrast.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Maybe this is crazy, but what if one of us
dialog: snuck in the locker room? I mean, it’s the
dialog: one place that they know girls aren’t

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: (immediately)
dialog: I’1l do it!

speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m just saying, I think I’d do a good job.
dialog: I am the journalist here, I’ve done

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: -I can’t wait to see a room full of wet
text: naked man flesh.
text: They laugh at Carrie again.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I do want to go, and not why you think. I
dialog: mean, this is an amazing opportunity to see
dialog: what guys really want. What they really
dialog: think. Come on, throughout history, no

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
text: The basketball team, including John, are gathered in front of

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: JOCK #2

speaker_heading: JOCK #1
dialog: Just use Greg’s - he’s out today.
text: He gestures at the locker directly behind him.
scene_heading: INT. LOCKER - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Jock #2 gets to the locker and is just about to open it when:
speaker_heading: JOCK #1
dialog: Look ma, no hands!
text: He makes the biggest farting noise of all - and has both his

text: make disgusted noises and move away, including the jock who

scene_heading: INT. LOCKER - CONTINUOUS

scene_heading: EXT. JOHN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
text: Beth and John are in his backyard, making out on a lounge
text: chair next to the pool. He stands up, picking Beth up in his

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: BETH (CONT’D)
dialog: Dizzy.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Do you think he bought the beeper story?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I have no idea. When I came to, he’d left

speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Always a gentleman.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Do we have enough stuff on tape?
speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: Well, you know, I came into the class late,
dialog: and everyone was already paired up, so-
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I’m not making fun of you, I’m asking if
dialog: you need a partner. Mine got burned pretty
dialog: bad in the last experiment, and he won’t be
dialog: back for awhile.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Before I say “yes,” how exactly did he get
dialog: burned?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Well, that’s open to interpretation. He
dialog: says it was my fault, but I clearly said
dialog: “Dear God! Run for your life!”
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sounds like his fault.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Thank you. So what are we doing?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Let’s stay away from fire, what do you say?
dialog: (hands him a vial)
dialog: Why don’t you measure five milliliters into
dialog: that beaker.
text: Scott does it, sloppily and quickly. Kate looks, frowns.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re not even close.
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: I’m not?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You've got to get down at eye level, and
text: wait until the bottom of the meniscus is at
dialog: the line.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Check you out. “Meniscus.” If I would
dialog: have known how smart you were, I would have
dialog: set my last partner on fire weeks ago.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Did I say “meniscus?” I meant wait until
text: the curvy part is at the doodad.
text: Scott laughs.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Much better. Okay, I’1l try.
text: Scott pours again, but carelessly splashes some on his pants.
text: He starts to freak, urgently whispering to Kate:
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: I spilled it! What do I do? What is it?
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It’s a sodium chloride suspension!
text: Scott starts struggling with his belt, in a panic.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Sodium chloride? It’s starting to burn!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, you know, saltwater!
text: Scott keeps struggling, then realizes.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
text: Saltwater.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You really need to crack a book.
text: Scott buckles his belt, pushes Kate, who laughs. He laughs
text: back. While they have been talking, an eager freshman girl
text: has been working the class, handing out something to all the
text: students. She gets to Scott and Kate.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN GIRL #1
dialog: John Tucker for president!
text: She moves off. Scott and Kate look down to find they’re both
text: holding campaign buttons. Scott puts his on. Kate gives him
text: a quizzical look.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: It’s ironic. And inevitable.
dialog: (in a trance)
dialog: Resistance is futile. Wear your button.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don’t know. He just might lose.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: There’s a first time for everything. Just
dialog: not that.
dialog: Kate shrugs - we’ll see.
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: A plain looking guy (NORMAN) stands at the podium, finishing
text: up his speech. Above him is a large screen - like a rock
text: concert, a camera projects him on the screen so that everyone
text: gets a good view.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: .+-So I would “treasure” the opportunity to
dialog: be your “Treasurer.” Thank you.
text: Norman walks offstage to a smattering of applause as a
text: teacher walks up to the podium.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: All right, that was Norman Trent, running
dialog: unopposed for Treasurer. Now we’ll hear
dialog: from John Tucker for President.
text: The crowd goes nuts as John Tucker walks up to the podium.
text: He smiles his winning smile and waves, finally motioning for
dialog: everyone to quiet down.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m a man of action, not words. Who wants
dialog: to listen to a long boring speech, anyway?
dialog: (calls offstage)
dialog: Seriously, Norman, it’s the same one every
dialog: year.
dialog: (back to crowd)
dialog: Anyway, I put together a little video to
dialog: show you why I should be your President.
dialog: Roll it.
text: The auditorium lights go down, and the video starts playing
text: on the large screen above John’s head.

scene_heading: BASKETBALL COURT
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: John stands in uniform, holding a ball and looking sincerely
text: into the camera.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m John Tucker. Some of you know me as
dialog: Tucker, or Tuck, or T-man or T-dog. I
dialog: thought you'd like to know a little more
dialog: about the man who’s going to be your next
dialog: president. What qualities make a good
dialog: president? Besides great hair, of course.
text: Even on video, John knows his audience: he pauses for the
text: laugh. Once it dies down:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, first, I’d have to say, loyalty.
scene_heading: JOHN WITH BETH
text: Shot surveillance camera style from a distance, so we can see
text: who he’s talking to.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know you’re the only one for me, babe.
scene_heading: JOHN WITH CARRIE
dialog: Same style shot, different location.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: The only one for me.
scene_heading: JOHN WITH HEATHER
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: You’re the only one for me.
scene_heading: JOHN WITH GUYS
text: John stands around with his friends in the locker room,
text: obviously unaware that they’re being recorded.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I ought to make them wear nametags, so I
dialog: can keep them straight.
text: The guys laugh.
speaker_heading: JOCK #1
dialog: Dude, you are funny. Not as funny as-
text: He gives another arm fart. The guys laugh again.
scene_heading: BACK TO AUDITORIUM:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: John looks up at the video, obviously confused. He looks
text: over to the control panel where the video is being run from,
text: runs his finger across his neck, signalling to cut.
text: Over at the control panel, we see the A/V guy running it
text: reach for the stop button. A hand grabs his; it’s Carrie.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Push that button and you’re going to eat
dialog: that tape deck.
scene_heading: BACK TO VIDEO:
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COURT
text: John continues his speech.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: After loyalty, I’d have to say honesty. If
dialog: you can’t trust politicians, who can you
dialog: trust?
speaker_heading: BETH'S POV
text: Shot from Beth’s bra-cam. In all theses POV shots, John’s in
text: different outfits, so we know he’s talking to different
dialog: women.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Friday? Yeah, I’m cool Friday night. How
dialog: about I pick you up at eleven.
speaker_heading: CARRIE’S POV
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Friday? Ooh, Friday’s not good. I’m...
dialog: doing some volunteer work at the animal
text: shelter. Poor little kitties.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (0.S.)
dialog: We can do it late. Like eleven?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, see, that’s when I’m going. They've
dialog: got plenty of people during the day, but
dialog: they need someone at night, just to snuggle
dialog: those little devils, and, you know, give
text: them some milk from eyedroppers.
text: He wipes away a fake tear.
speaker_heading: HEATHER’S POV
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Friday. Huh. Yeah, the thing is, I have a
dialog: game Saturday, so I promised myself I’d do
dialog: a thousand push-ups at home Friday night,
dialog: and then go to bed early. You wouldn’t
dialog: want me to...
text: His gaze wanders down into her cleavage, right into the
text: camera. He stares appreciatively.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (0.S.)
dialog: I wouldn’t want you to what?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, the hell with it. Friday’s cool. I’ve
dialog: got to make a call.
scene_heading: BASKETBALL COURT
text: John wraps up the speech.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: So, loyalty, honesty, and great hair.
text: He runs his hand through his hair.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Check, check and check. I hope you’ve
dialog: learned a little about the real John
dialog: Tucker. Vote for me - it’s a slam dunk.
text: John runs and jumps, but blows the slam, falling on his ass.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn it! All right, don’t use that one.
dialog: I’1l go again.
speaker_heading: END MONTAGE
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS
text: The video ends, and the lights come back up. The crowd, and
text: John, are stunned.
scene_heading: GIRL IN AUDIENCE
dialog: Bastard!
text: People boo and catcall. Our four girls, spread out around
text: the auditorium, catch each other’s eyes and nod to each
dialog: other. Mission accomplished.
scene_heading: GIRLS IN AUDIENCE
dialog: Jerk!/Get off the stage!/What a loser!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN'S POV
text: John looks into the audience, sees angry faces, sees people
text: laughing at him... his worst nightmare. Then he sees the
text: three girls who betrayed him, all beaming.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: John swallows, his eyes darting wildly, looking like he
text: actually might crack... then he takes a deep breath and steps
text: up to the mic. Showtime.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Could we get the camera on?
text: John appears on the large screen above his head.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I'd like to talk to the girls in the
dialog: audience.
dialog: (to camera operator)
dialog: Closer on my face, if you wouldn’t mind.
text: The camera zooms in. John gives that disarming smile that no
dialog: mortal can resist.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Ladies. I have a problem, and I guess you
dialog: all know about it now. I love too deeply.
dialog: When I’m with a girl, when I look into her
text: eyes, see who she really is... I fall in
dialog: love. I can’t help it. I guess I’ma
dialog: romantic.
text: Our girls look around - the other girls in the audience are
text: hypnotized by John’s big eyes staring into theirs.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: I know I look like a player, but the truth
dialog: is, I meant every word I said to every one
dialog: of those girls. The sad thing is, no
dialog: matter how much I want it, I haven’t had
dialog: that great love returned yet. I haven’t
dialog: found that one girl who is the only girl
dialog: for me. I haven’t found that one person
dialog: who I can give myself completely to, who I
dialog: can tell my secrets, who I can cry with,
dialog: share my pain, hold, hug...
text: Back in the audience, two female teachers are standing next
text: to each other. They’re as smitten as anyone. One leans over
text: and whispers to the other:
speaker_heading: FEMALE TEACHER
dialog: Is he eighteen yet?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So, as you can see, I keep looking. And I
dialog: promise you, I will find her. Maybe it’s
dialog: you. I don’t know. But if it is, I’m
dialog: going to find you, and I’m going to give
dialog: you my heart to do with as you will.
text: Girls are now crying. Everyone in the entire place - except
dialog: our girls - is convinced that they’re the one. Heather leans
text: over to Beth.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: He just seduced the entire school.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: He just seduced half the school. And Bill.
text: Angle on a boy who looks just as smitten as the girls.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, I guess you’re right. That speech
dialog: isn’t exactly going to work on the rest of
dialog: the guys.
text: On stage, John motions for the cameraman to pull back. Once
text: he does.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: And guys, I have one question for you. Who
dialog: made the winning basket that gave us the
dialog: state championship?!
text: The boys all erupt.
scene_heading: BOYS IN HALL
dialog: You did! John Tucker!
text: The girls join in, cheering.
speaker_heading: ALL
dialog: John Tucker for president! John Tucker for
dialog: God!

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (mouths to Carrie)
dialog: Thank you.

scene_heading: INT. LORI’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Lori is working out. Kate comes in and collapses on the bed
text: as her mom finishes up.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: So, how’s the big day go? Did you rid the
dialog: world of John Tucker once and for all?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Not even close. He’s stronger than ever.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: How'd that happen?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don’t know. He’s John Tucker. It
dialog: doesn’t matter what he does, it’s how he
dialog: looks doing it. I’m so depressed. Change
dialog: the subject to something good, will you?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I met someone.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (groans )
dialog: I said something good.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Well, this might be good. He’s... well,
dialog: he’s a little different from most of the
dialog: guys I’ve met.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Different how?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Don’t be scared. He’s a lawyer, and he’s
dialog: running for Mayor. I’m volunteering on his
dialog: campaign.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sincerely impressed)
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I know - he’s not a drummer, and as far as
dialog: I can tell, he’s not in rehab.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I love this guy!
text: Lori smiles, keeps working out.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hey, there you guys are. I tried to call
dialog: everyone, but I guess I missed you. How
dialog: you doing?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: How do you think? We blew it. We had one
dialog: shot at him, and we blew it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: He’s more popular than ever, and now none
dialog: of us get him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So now what?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
text: It’s over. We stop hanging out together,
dialog: we go back to our own little groups and
text: watch John date his way through the rest of
text: the cheerleaders.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: It was a compliment.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It didn’t sound like one.
speaker_heading: BETH (0.S.)
dialog: Heather! Carrie! Kate!
text: running across the parking lot.
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT’D)
dialog: Good. We’re all here. I figured it out.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: What, that video thing doesn’t look like
dialog: it’s going to work out after all?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: No, that we've been going about it wrong.
dialog: I was home last night, crying and stuffing
dialog: my face-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Tell me about it. I can’t eat again until
dialog: June.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: And I thought, “I can’t believe it. I let
dialog: this guy break my heart twice.” And that’s
dialog: when it hit me. We’ve been trying to
dialog: humiliate him, and maybe that’1l never
dialog: work. But we never did the most obvious
dialog: thing. We have to do to him what he does
dialog: to girls. We have to break his heart.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: That’s great in theory, but how?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I don’t think he has a heart to break.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Come on, we know everything about him. We
dialog: know his strengths and his weaknesses, we
dialog: know how he operates, we know what he
dialog: thinks... What if we used all of that to
dialog: make him fall in love, really fall in love,
dialog: and then break him? Maybe we can’t make it
dialog: so that other women won’t want to date him,
dialog: but we can make it so that he won’t want to
dialog: date anyone else.
text: The girls are taken in by her passion, but...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: How? He knows we all went after him with
dialog: the video. He’1ll never trust us again - he
dialog: hates all of us.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Not all of us.
text: Beth turns to Kate. Heather and Carrie also turn to Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You want me to... No. No way.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: This is really smart.
speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: Guys, hold on. It’s a great idea, but I’m

speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don't like him. I don’t like anyone like
text: him. He’s a shallow, manipulative jerk..
dialog: Let me ask you - would any of you want to
dialog: date him now, knowing everything you know?
text: The girls think it over.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Well...
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Probably not...
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Do you really think he’d go out with me?
dialog: (off their looks)
dialog: Definitely not.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So why should I?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Look, you won’t really be dating him.
dialog: You'll be pretending.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m not that good an actress. Sorry.
text: The girls’ passion fades.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Yeah, you’re right. It probably wouldn't

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I'll do it.
text: The girls stop, look back.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)

scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GYM - DAY
text: Heather stands in a cheerleader outfit, awkwardly holding her
dialog: pompoms .
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: A cheerleader. I always thought it was
dialog: pretty lame, but I’ve got to admit... I
dialog: look hot.
text: Kate is standing in front of all the other cheerleaders,
text: Heather by her side.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: This is Kate. She’ll be taking Nancy’s
dialog: spot.
text: A girl sitting in the stands with her leg in a cast looks up,

speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You've got that bum leg... Sorry.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: NANCY
dialog: It’s just a sprain... The doctor said I'll
dialog: be better in a week.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Maybe next year. Okay, pyramid.

text: Heather motions to Kate.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: All right, Kate, you’re on top.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: I’'ll pass. I get dizzy in high heels.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Trust me, this is an honor. Molly’s been

text: weight over her, a hand in her face.
speaker_heading: MOLLY
dialog: (forced smile)
dialog: Someday.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What if I pass out and fall?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That’s what the mats are for. Come on,
dialog: you're almost there...

text: to the top. She smiles - this is pretty cool.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: See, you're fine.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, I guess I am. Go gladiators!
text: Kate’s beaming, on top of the world. She throws her arms up
text: in the air, and immediately falls off the top of the pyramid.
text: Luckily, her landing is cushioned - by Molly’s head. Molly
text: collapses.

text: walks up to meet him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Heather. Hot as always. What do you say
dialog: we forget about the whole “I tried to
dialog: destroy you and failed thing” and give it
dialog: another go?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Let me get back to you on that.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Come on. I may have strayed, but you know
dialog: you’re the most beautiful girl I’ve ever-

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Who’s the new cheerleader?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Kate.
text: John looks her up and down with his expert eye.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Cute.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: We made her a cheerleader, didn’t we? But
dialog: I wouldn’t bother. I hear she’s still

speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY
text: The four girls are gathered.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Emergency meeting. I think we’re sending

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m totally ready.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You’re not exactly playing hard to get.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, come on. I don’t want anything to do
dialog: with him. I’m not hard to get, I’m
dialog: impossible to get.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Really. Tell them what John said about
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What, about me being cute? Oh, come on.
dialog: It was just a comment. I totally don’t
dialog: care. If anything, it’s an insult. I know
text: he’s just getting ready to use me.
text: The other girls look at each other - they’re not so sure.
speaker_heading: CARRIE

dialog: million and one of them.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Now, don’t take this the wrong way, but has
dialog: one of them ever hit on you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not really, no. Wait - one of my mom’s
dialog: boyfriends made a pass at me, but it never
dialog: worked out, with him going to jail and all.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: John’s an artist. He’s the best at what he
dialog: does. You just saw him seduce an
dialog: auditorium full of girls - how do you think
dialog: it’s going to be when he focuses all of
dialog: that charm on you?
text: This hits home. Kate’s eyes go wide - she starts to realize
text: she might not be as ready as she thought she was.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: You can do this, but you have to be
dialog: careful. Kate, John’s an athlete. He
dialog: likes competition. He wants to win, not
dialog: just have his victory handed to him. If
text: you blush and pass out when he winks at
dialog: you, he’s going to lose interest.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Exactly. So you’ve got to make him chase
dialog: you. If it’s too easy, he’1ll move on. Do
dialog: you understand?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Absolutely. I really do. I’ve got it
text: under control.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: He really called you cute?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, that’s what Heather-
dialog: (catching herself)
dialog: Damn it.
text: The girls laugh.
speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t show any interest in him. Don’t even
dialog: look at him too much. Don’t touch him, not
dialog: even his hand. Got it?
text: Kate doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: I said, do you have it?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I was counting to three.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Not that slowly. We don’t want him to
dialog: think you’re deaf.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: All right, he’s noticed me, now how do we
dialog: know he’1l take the bait?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: He will. I know John, I know cheerleaders,
dialog: I know John and cheerleaders.
text: Kate shrugs - they’ll see. Everyone heads out.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - LATER
text: We're outside a classroom. The bell rings and the door
text: opens; Heather and Kate come out to find John standing right
text: there, waiting.
speaker_heading: JOHN
text: We just keep bumping into each other. I
dialog: think it’s fate.
text: Heather winks at Kate, walks off. Kate counts to three,
dialog: then:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What's up?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: As the president of the school Welcome
dialog: Wagon, it’s my official responsibility to
dialog: invite you to dinner Friday night.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That’s mighty welcoming, but I’m going to
dialog: have to take a pass.
text: John looks stunned. This doesn’t happen.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You busy, or...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sure, I’m busy. Nice meeting you, John.
text: Kate walks off. Once John can’t see her, she breaks out into
text: a smile, obviously pleased with herself. A passing Beth
text: whacks her with a book and glares at her - Kate curses
text: herself silently and stops smiling.
scene_heading: INT. LAB - LATER
text: Scott's working at his station - flames suddenly shoot three
text: feet out of his Bunsen burner. He grabs at the gas, turns it
text: off. Kate enters the room in her cheer uniform and crosses
text: to join him. He looks up, surprised.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Huh.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Nothing, it’s just, you’re on the track
dialog: team... I thought you were an athlete, not
text: a cheerleader.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What, you don’t think cheering is athletic?
dialog: I had to kick my leg in the air four times
dialog: today.
text: She does half a kick to illustrate. Scott laughs.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Nice, but I don’t think it really qualifies
dialog: as a sport. If I can do it-
text: He kicks his leg in the air, promptly knocking over a row of
text: beakers, smashing them.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Impressive. We’re looking for a male
dialog: cheerleader, if you’re interested.
text: As Scott cleans up:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You know, I never see you out.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Out where?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: At parties, around... I know you’re new.
dialog: If you're interested, I could let you know
dialog: when something’s going on.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That'd be great.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Actually, there’s a party this weekend. I
dialog: could tell you where it is.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I'd love that.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Or I could, you know, pick you up.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wait, are you asking me out?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No, I’m just not good at directions.
dialog: Giving them or following them. So I just
dialog: thought it would be easier to pick you up.
text: There's a commotion at the door - Kate looks to see a boy
text: enter the room, carrying flowers. He goes up to the teacher.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: I mean, if you want me to ask you out, I
dialog: suppose it could be that, too. I don’t
dialog: want to compromise our great working
dialog: relationship as lab partners, but-
text: Kate didn’t hear, distracted by the scene at the door.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m sorry, what?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Oh, I was just saying-
text: The teacher points at the door.
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: No, you can’t interrupt my class. Where
dialog: are you supposed to be?
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN BOY #1
dialog: I’ve just got to drop these off.
text: The freshman walks over to Kate, hands her the flowers, heads
text: out. Everyone is staring at Kate, who’s blushing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 54.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: Okay, if we could get back to...
text: The door opens, another boy enters, with more flowers. He
text: crosses to Kate, hands them over.
speaker_heading: TEACHER (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s your name? You can’t just come in
dialog: here.
scene_heading: FRESHMAN BOY #2
dialog: Sorry.
text: He runs out. The door opens a second later, another boy,
text: more flowers. He crosses to Kate and drops them off. We
dialog: follow this boy out into:
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: At least a dozen boys are lined up in the hall, all holding
text: bouquets. At the end of the line is a kid in a gorilla suit,
text: also holding flowers.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - LATER
text: Kate is in the bathroom with her three friends. Despite
text: herself, Kate’s a little excited.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Did you see all the flowers?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Classic Tucker.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And the singing telegram? Not that I care,
dialog: but no one’s ever done anything like that
dialog: for me.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
text: Wait until the picnic on his family’s boat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Which I totally won’t be impressed by.
dialog: (then)
dialog: How big is it?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You could land a helicopter on it.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Yeah, it’s almost as big as his...
text: (the other girls looks at her)
dialog: Vacation house. What? I think about
dialog: things other than sex.
speaker_heading: (MORE ) (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BETH (CONT'D)

dialog: And the-
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, no matter how big anything of John’s
dialog: is, I promise not to be impressed.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: That‘11 throw him. He won’t know what to
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: This is actually working. We’re playing
dialog: his game, and we’re going to win.
dialog: (to Kate)
dialog: You're going to be the girl who makes John
dialog: Tucker fall in love. You’re going to be a
dialog: legend.
text: Kate looks at her friends, all looking to her with respect.
dialog: It’s
dialog: her,
text: EXT.
dialog: the first time something like this has ever happened to
dialog: and she likes it.
scene_heading: OUTSIDE SCHOOL - LATER
text: Students are heading out of the building at the end of the
dialog: day.
text: Scott, John and some of his jock friends are hanging
text: out by the door. John turns to Scott.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You know that new girl, Kate?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: She’s not your type.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Girl is my type. Well, except for the
dialog: uggos.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Well, then, you’re definitely not hers.
text: She listens to Elvis Costello, she reads
dialog: Salinger for fun, not for class... she'd
dialog: see through you in a second.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You're selling me short. I can pretend to
dialog: be deep when I need to.
text: Scott just shakes his head as Heather, Kate and a couple of
text: other cheerleaders exit the school. John raises his shades
text: and nods to Kate.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey, Kate, you get the flowers?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (without stopping)
dialog: I didn’t know what to do with them, so I
dialog: sent them over to the nursing home. My
text: grandma and her friends flipped, thanks.
text: Kate smiles and disappears towards the parking lot. John
dialog: scowls - why isn’t this working?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Maybe if we headed down to the nursing
dialog: home, you’d have a chance with her grandma.
text: John chuckles, which the other guys take as their cue that
dialog: it’s okay to laugh along.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m glad she’s playing hard to get. The
dialog: local girls have been so easy for so long,
dialog: I'd almost forgotten how to do this.
text: ANGLE ON: Two geeky freshman girls, taking in the scene.
text: Then they turn and watch Kate as she walks away.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN GIRL #1
dialog: (awed)
dialog: I can’t believe her. If John Tucker gave
dialog: me flowers, I'd go out with him ina
dialog: second.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN GIRL #2
dialog: If John Tucker gave me gum, I'd have his
dialog: baby.
scene_heading: INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT
text: Another basketball game -- we pan slowly across the crowd,

speaker_heading: CHEERLEADERS (0.S.)
dialog: Gla! Di! A! Tors! Gla! Di!

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Widen to reveal all the cheerleaders, clapping and kicking.
text: The referee blows the whistle and both teams head from the
text: sidelines back onto the floor. Kate edges over to Heather so
text: they can speak privately. Kate’s back is to the game.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t think our plan is working.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Relax.
speaker_heading: KATE
text: I screwed it up. He hasn’t looked at me
dialog: since I turned him down the other day.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Kate, I promise this will work.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How do you know?
text: Heather points over Kate’s shoulder. Kate turns to find John
text: standing next to her, dribbling the ball.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Kate Spencer. How ya doin’?
text: John’s near mid-court -- under the basket, the game is still
text: going on. All four of his teammates are shouting for the
text: ball, and the defenders are looking on, confused. Every
text: other eye in the gym is on Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Fine. How about you?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not so good. I like this girl, but I don’t
dialog: think she knows I exist.
text: The gym is going nuts. The shot clock is winding down.
text: 10... 9... 8...; John’s teammates are panicking, clapping
text: their hands to get his attention; and his coach is turning
text: red, he’s so furious.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: SHOOT THE BALL!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Excuse me.
text: John turns, shoots from thirty five feet away, swishes it.
text: He turns back to Kate.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: So, what do you say? There’s a party over
dialog: at Dan’s house, and I was thinking-
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh, John?
text: The other team inbounds the ball and starts sprinting up the
text: court. John sticks out his arm and clotheslines the player
text: with the ball -- he hits the ground hard. The ref blows the
text: whistle for a foul. The coach runs over to John, yelling the
dialog: whole way.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: What are you doing?! Why’d you foul him?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: To ask Kate out.
text: The coach takes a deep breath, tries to keep from strangling
text: John. He glares at Kate.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: Well?
text: The entire gym is hanging on her answer.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (casual, to coach)
dialog: If it’ll make him play, fine.
text: Everyone erupts in applause.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kate’s sitting in a chair wearing a robe, as the other three
text: girls all hover around her. Heather’s putting her hair in

dialog: from the school paper.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
text: What K.S. is taking the school by storm,
text: capturing the attention of the school’s
dialog: biggest prize, J.T.?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don’t know.

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: Sure thing. Play hard to get, count to
dialog: three, got it.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Um, that’s when you were playing hard to
dialog: get. He’s got you. You’re going out.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So I... count to... four? Oh my god! I
dialog: have no idea! I’m panicking! I’m going
dialog: out tonight and I have no idea what to do!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Should I slap her?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You’re with three girls who know how he
dialog: operates. You’re going to be fine. The
dialog: trick is to just keep him off balance.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yes, exactly. Once he figures you out,
dialog: you're toast. So keep him guessing.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Lie, evade, ignore.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Or... just be mysterious.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You got it?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (nods, then)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Let’s try this. I’m John, you be Kate.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Hey, I want to be John.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Look, it was my idea.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So now we’re fighting about which one of us

speaker_heading: BETH (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (mutters) .
dialog: Doesn’t sound anything like him.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Shh.
dialog: (as John)
dialog: I said, how you doin’?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oh, I don’t know.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How are you?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Don’t be interested in him. Who cares
dialog: about him? It’s all about you.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (as John)
dialog: Wanna catch a movie?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I could.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Nah. Still too interested.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (sarcastic)

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don’t know, you want to catch the new

text: The girls shake their head.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: He’s not in control. You're in control.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But don’t let him know what you really
dialog: want.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: But it was good that you mentioned someone
text: better looking at him.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Right. So better, but still lousy. Okay,
dialog: try again.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (as John)
dialog: So, what do you want to see?
text: Kate thinks, trying to come up with the perfect answer.
text: Finally, in a small voice:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What do you think I want to see? And don’t
dialog: be wrong.
text: The girls clap. Not bad. Kate collapses back on the bed,
dialog: relieved.
scene_heading: INT. BMW - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What do you want to know?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Everything. Who do you listen to, what’s
dialog: your favorite TV show, what’s your favorite
dialog: color... Who are you? What do you like?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You think I’m just going to spit it all out
dialog: like that? You’re going to have to work to
dialog: get to know me.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: You are impressive.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (too eager)
dialog: Really?
text: (catches herself, deadpan)
dialog: Really.
text: John reaches across Kate, opens his glove box, flips through
text: a stack of CDs. He takes his time choosing, finally finding
text: the perfect one. He slips it in - it’s Elvis Costello's
text: “Uncomplicated.” Not a hit that everyone would know, but not
text: so obscure that a fan wouldn’t love it. He starts singing
text: along. Surprisingly, he’s a great singer, and he’s obviously
dialog: been practicing this song.
text: Kate is surprised, after a few lines, she interrupts him.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: You like Elvis Costello?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: If you tell me you don’t, I’m kicking you
text: out of the car right now.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, I love him. I mean, he’s all right. I
dialog: guess.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know, you’re actually a really good
dialog: singer.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m all right.
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, so maybe the school’s not ready for
dialog: that.

scene_heading: EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT

speaker_heading: CARRIE

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Wow.
speaker_heading: FRESHMAN GIRL #2

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Who are you here with?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You don’t know?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Should I? Is it someone famous?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, of course not. That was stupid. It’s
dialog: just, uh-
text: John walks up, puts his arm around Kate. Scott raises an
text: eyebrow at Kate. This is a surprise.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, baby brother. Dad told me to make
dialog: sure you got home by midnight.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Hey, big brother. Dad told me you're
dialog: adopted.

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Let me just dump Howie in the bushes, and

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Do guys tell you you’re a good kisser?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (thinks, then)
dialog: Oh my god, I’m a bad kisser!
speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me walk you to the door.

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (rubbing her head)
dialog: Ow!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, I’m fine. My vision’s a little
text: blurry, but I’m fine. Okay, don’t move.
text: She goes in, slower this time, and kisses him. He’s caught

text: down her back. Finally he starts to creep his hand around to
dialog: the front - two inches before he gets us an R rating, she

speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you think you’re doing?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (flustered)
dialog: Sorry, it’s just, you-
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don’t worry about it. I had a great night.
text: She kisses him one more time, then opens her door and gets
text: out. He watches her go, his hair standing straight up from
text: Kate messing it up. He’s in a daze - what the hell just
dialog: happened?
text: Kate walks up to the house as John watches from the car. She
text: doesn’t look back as she enters her house.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kate comes in the front door, closes it, smiles a satisfied
text: smile. Her mom comes into the room.
speaker_heading: LORI
text: Here she is, back from her big date. How'd
dialog: it go?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It’s not really a date, mom. I don’t like
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Right.
text: Lori has something to say, but isn’t sure she should. She
text: starts, stops, starts again.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: Listen, honey, I’m not sure this is a good
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Pretending you like a guy... I don’t want
dialog: to see you get hurt.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m not going to get hurt. He is.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Look, I’m doing this for my friends. I’m
dialog: popular, I’m having fun, they’re being
dialog: great to me... This is important to them,
dialog: so it’s important to me. Okay?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Well, look, my advice is to not do this.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Mom, I don’t really need your advice.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: That’s what moms do.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, moms give advice about things that they
dialog: know about.
text: Lori’s hurt. Kate sees she’s gone too far.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Mom, what I meant to say was I love you,
dialog: and there are a ton of things I’d come to
dialog: you for advice about, just not this. You
dialog: have to admit that you’ve had your share of
dialog: troubles with guys like John Tucker, so you
dialog: might not be too objective, all right?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Fair enough. Okay.
text: Lori hugs Kate. She pastes a smile on her face, but it’s
text: clear she’s still wounded.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: The bell rings; classes empty into the hall. Kate walks out
text: of a room as John walks up, puts his arm around Kate.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So, I’m thinking that I’1l swing by your
text: house around eight.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ooh, I’d love to go out, but I have plans.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What's going on?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Just stuff.
text: John’s a little put-off - has he lost it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, if you finish your stuff, give me a
dialog: call.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’1l put you on my list.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Kate kisses John on the cheek, and walks over to her locker.
text: John watches her go, then laughs confidently, just in case
text: anyone’s watching. Beth is standing at a locker near Kate’s -
text: once John walks out of earshot, they talk.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You are getting so good at this. I’m going
dialog: to do this to the next guy I date.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No you’re not, you big slut.
speaker_heading: BETH

dialog: You're right.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: All the lights are out in Kate’s room - the only illumination
text: comes from a pair of flashlights that Kate and Carrie are
text: holding. The girls are on Kate’s bed, playing Monopoly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I never realized being popular could be so
dialog: boring.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: It could be worse, you could be driving
text: around the block all night staring at a
text: dark window.
text: She looks at her watch.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Time!
text: Kate and Carrie turn off their flashlights and crawl over to
text: the window. The shade is down; they pull it up a few inches
text: and peek out.
text: Down on the street, John’s car slowly drives by. John’s face
text: is visible in the window, staring up at Kate’s house.
text: The girls back away from the window. Carrie pulls out her
text: notebook, turns on her flashlight and starts writing.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
text: Like clockwork.
text: Carrie looks at her watch again.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Please tell me that’s not on your schedule.
text: Carrie looks embarrassed, closes her notebook. It clearly is
text: on her schedule.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Of course not. I’m not crazy.
text: Carrie tucks the notebook safely under a pillow, starts out
text: of the room, comes back, takes the notebook with her and
text: leaves. Kate laughs.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Kate and Carrie are asleep and the lights are out. There’s a
text: beeping - Carrie sits upright, presses a button on her watch,
text: turning off the alarm. She reaches over and turns on the
text: light, lies back down.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You think he’s still watching?
text: The phone rings. Kate reaches for it, Carrie catches her.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Remember, four rings.

speaker_heading: KATE

scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m doing fine. How about you? You have a
dialog: good night?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Sure, did you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Busy, but good.
text: John waits, but there’s no more information forthcoming.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, as long as I have you, did you figure

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Oooh... I think I’m booked.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: That’s cool.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Listen, it’s not a date, if you’re worried-
text: Now that he knows it’s not a date, John relaxes greatly.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, until I put a ring on your finger, I
dialog: can’t tell you what to do.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You think once a man gets married, he can
dialog: tell his wife what to do?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No, I was just saying, uh... So, what are
dialog: you doing?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m actually going to be helping my mom out
dialog: on that campaign I was telling you about.
dialog: You can stop by, if you want.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No no, you do your thing. I don’t want to

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sure thing.

dialog: Oh, crap.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What’s the matter?
speaker_heading: KATE

dialog: and I think I see him.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (trying to play it cool)
dialog: Want me to cruise by and check it out?

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Nah, I’1l just call the cops.
speaker_heading: KATE’S POV

scene_heading: INT. JOHN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS
text: John takes a corner, phone clutched against his shoulder.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: All right, then, I’1l-
text: The phone flies away, crashes onto the floor. He reaches
text: down to get it, the car swerving crazily. He hits a mailbox
text: before he manages to get the phone and the car under control:
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, talk to you later.
text: John hangs up, drives off, looking back nervously.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kate hangs up. She and Carrie burst out laughing.
scene_heading: INT. SCOTT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You up?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Scott doesn’t move, so John shakes him. Scott blinks out of

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What are you doing here?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, can’t a guy talk to his brother?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Not if the guy’s you, and not now.
text: John sits down, picks up a guitar, starts noodling on it as
text: he and Scott talk.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: Fine. How’s life, John?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Great, as always. How about you?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Trouble sleeping, aside from that, okay.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Cool. Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Please tell me you don’t want to go fishing
dialog: and bond or something. Wait a second - do
dialog: you have some incurable disease?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Dude, you’re so suspicious.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Hey, if you're not doing anything tomorrow,
dialog: you mind doing me a favor?
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: I'll do it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don’t you want to know what it is?
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: No, I want you to go away.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want you to help me with a girl.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: If I were going to help you with anything,

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: Wait a second, Kate Spencer?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, why?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What do you want me to do?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I want you to go to some political thing
dialog: that she’s supposed to be at, make sure
text: she’s there, keep an eye on her.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Fine, I’11 do it.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Okay... Why?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What is this, twenty questions? Do you
dialog: want my help or not?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, sure. I owe you one.
text: John leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY
text: The nerve center of the campaign is basically a sparsely
text: furnished office space with “Valetta for Mayor” banners and
text: posters with the candidate’s grinning face. Volunteers work
text: the phones and stuff envelopes. Kate is here - she’s
text: licking, folding and stamping with the best of them. Her mom
text: comes up with the candidate himself.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Kate, I’d like you to meet Sal Valetta.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It’s a pleasure to meet-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 76.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Kate looks up, smiling, then blinks in disbelief.
speaker_heading: KATE’S POV
text: Behind Sal’s shoulder is one of his posters. Kate stares at
text: it, then the real thing comes into focus - a perfect match,
text: except that in real life his ears stick out so far, they look
dialog: like they’re coming after you. It’s truly disturbing - Kate
text: looks back and forth between the photo and the man.
text: BACK TO SCENE
text: Sal turns around, sees the photo and chuckles.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: I know. I still can’t get used to having
text: big Sals staring at me, either.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (carefully choosing her words)
dialog: It’s a very good picture.
speaker_heading: SAL
dialog: Just between us? Good lighting and a lot
dialog: of makeup.
text: Kate laughs politely. Someone taps Sal on the shoulder; he
text: turns away from Kate to talk to them.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: So, what do you think?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: He seems great, mom, really...
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Handsome?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, not that.
text: Lori laughs.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: But that’s good. It’s different.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Very. Hey, that guy over there is waving

speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I’m here to volunteer.
text: Lori clears her throat.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sorry. Scott, this is my mom.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Nice to meet you.
text: Scott politely shakes her hand, turns back to Kate.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT'D)
dialog: So where’s the candidate?
text: Kate points - Scott sees Sal.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy crap!
dialog: (quickly recovering)
dialog: I’ve never seen a real candidate before!
text: Kate grabs Scott’s hand and pulls him away. They move as
text: fast as they can, trying not to look at each other, because
text: every time they do, they laugh. Finally, when they’re a safe
dialog: distance away:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So, what are you doing here?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: What are you doing here? I’m always
dialog: volunteering for political campaigns.
dialog: (off her look)
dialog: All right, John sent me. It’s his way of
dialog: keeping an eye on you without making it
dialog: look like he’s keeping an eye on you. I’m
dialog: supposed to play it cool, make sure you're
text: actually here, not give anything away.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Or am I the best spy in the world?
text: Kate shakes her head, pulls Scott through the crowd.
scene_heading: INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - LATER
text: Kate and Scott sit across from each other at a table, licking
text: envelopes. Scott nods at one of the posters.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I hope this guy doesn’t make any speeches
dialog: outside. You know, a gust of wind comes up
dialog: and suddenly...
text: Scott mimes Sal flying away as his ears catch the wind.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I saw him trip once - it took three minutes
text: to hit the ground.
text: Scott lowers his voice and points across the room.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I’d be careful. He’s only forty feet away -
dialog: I’m sure he can hear you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hear me? He can take my pulse.
text: Across the room, Sal sees Kate and Scott looking over, smiles
text: and gives a big thumbs-up. They wave back.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my god, I think you were right.
text: At least, Kate tries to say that, but all the glue from
text: licking the envelopes messes up her speech, and what she
dialog: really says is:
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my gob, I think you bere ribe.
speaker_heading: SCOTT

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Stob it ribe now?
text: Kate’s laughing so hard she almost falls out of her chair.
text: After she calms down a bit:
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: Listen, I’ve got to ask you something. Why
dialog: are you going out with my brother?
text: Kate stops laughing completely, takes a sip of a soda to
dialog: clean off her tongue.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (trying to be casual)
dialog: Why do you ask?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: The first time I saw you, you didn’t seem
text: too impressed by him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You know what they say about first
dialog: impressions.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: That they’re always right?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Is that what they say? I’ve been using
dialog: that saying wrong for a long time.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You just seemed like the kind of girl who
dialog: wouldn't go for him.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised.
dialog: Everyone dates my brother.
dialog: (quickly)
dialog: But I’m sure you’ll be the last. I’m sure

speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)

dialog: basketball?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (uncomfortable)
dialog: There’s a lot more to you than basketball.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, you’d say that, because you’re
dialog: different than most girls. Most girls want
dialog: to be with me because of what I am, not who
dialog: I am. Everyone thinks it’s one sided -
text: John Tucker only dates the hot chicks. But
dialog: a lot of those girls only date the stud
dialog: athlete, or the rich guy...
dialog: (then, light bulb)

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: JOHN

speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Go go!

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. KATE AND HEATHER’S HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: Carrie knocks on the bathroom door.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Come on, we’re on a schedule. What’s the
dialog: hold up?
speaker_heading: KATE (0.S.)
dialog: I’m almost ready...
text: Carrie opens the door and peeks in.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Wow.
text: Carrie holds open the door, and Kate comes out of the
text: bathroom wearing a short, sexy robe.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: How do I look?
text: Kate opens up her robe, showing off her lingerie. It’s black
text: and sexy, and Kate’s in great shape.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: I’m going on a diet.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (checking Kate out)
dialog: I think I might be gay.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Well, there’s your answer.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: You are really hot. I don’t mean this as
dialog: an insult, but why are do always dress like
dialog: a schlub and hide yourself? You should
dialog: take some lessons from your mom.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, I'll pass on that. I think the less
dialog: I take after my mom, the happier I’1l be.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Come on, if you’d work it a little more,
dialog: you'd be beating guys off with a stick.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I wouldn’t want the kind of guy who just
dialog: wants me to look like this.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: But that’s all of them.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No. Is it?
dialog: (thinks about it)
dialog: Oh my god.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Okay, no time for epiphanies. Let’s go.
text: Kate pulls her robe back on as Carrie leads Kate to the bed.
text: The laptop has been set up on the desk facing Kate, and
text: there’s a webcam on top of the computer. Heather, Beth and
text: Carrie take their positions across from Kate, behind the
text: computer. Carrie reaches over and presses a button.
scene_heading: INT. JOHN’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: John is on a laptop, while the other player in the room
text: watches TV. From John’s computer we hear:
speaker_heading: JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE (V.O.)
dialog: (on a loop)
dialog: Better have you naked by the end of this
dialog: song! Better have you naked by the end of
dialog: this song! Better have you naked by the
dialog: end of this song!
text: John chuckles.
speaker_heading: TEAMMATE
dialog: God, how many times can you watch Janet
text: Jackson's boob pop out of her dress?
text: There’s a CHIME from John’s computer: we see the screen, and
text: on it a window has popped up: “KATE S HAS REQUESTED A VIDEO
dialog: CHAT. DO YOU ACCEPT?”
text: John hits “OK” and a window pops up with Kate.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hello there.
scene_heading: INTERCUT WITH:
scene_heading: INT. KATE AND HEATHER’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kate looks into the camera. Just on the other side, the
text: other three girls are actively coaching her during the entire
text: conversation - holding up notes, mouthing words, pantomiming.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Whatcha doin’?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Homework, you know.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, I bet. You alone?
text: John snaps his fingers at his teammate, points to the
text: bathroom. The roommate glares, heads in, closes the door.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I am now. How about you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh, yeah.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Who'd they put you with?
text: Heather shakes her head violently.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not Heather.
text: The girls groan.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I mean, they wanted to put me with Heather,
dialog: but she didn’t want to be with me, because,
dialog: you know, I’m dating you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So you're there all by yourself?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know, isn’t that sad? I’m so lovely.
text: She’s looking at a sign that Carrie’s holding up. Carrie
text: glares, scribbles on it, holds it back up.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lonely. I’m so lonely.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Well, maybe you need some company.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That’s just what I was thinking.
dialog: 88.
dialog: But
dialog: there’s a problem - I just tried to go out
text: in the hall, and coach Williams is totally
dialog: watching. No way you could get here.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Damn it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I mean, unless you went out on the ledge
text: and came in through the window.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Yeah, right.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, that’s crazy. Too bad, I got all
text: dressed up. Or down.
text: Kate lets her robe slip off one shoulder, showing off one bra
dialog: strap.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I could try the ledge.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Awesome. I’m five windows down. I already
dialog: counted.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m on my way.
text: The girls high five and pump their fists -
text: Suddenly, Beth gets an idea - she holds up
text: gesturing madly.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hold on!
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What?
text: Beth pantomimes shaving her face.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Did you shave?
dialog: it’s working.
dialog: her hand,
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah, sure.
text: Beth gestures shaving her chest.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Your chest?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What? Of course not.
text: Beth pantomimes swimming. Kate smiles, getting it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: This is kind of crazy, but I have a thing
dialog: for swimmers.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Swimmers?
text: Beth and Heather get it now, fight to not laugh out loud.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: There’s something so sexy about a smooth
dialog: body. You know, like a swimmer.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don’t know...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It’s nuts, but when a guy isn’t shaved,
dialog: it’s like wrestling a bear. I just don’t
text: like hair rubbing all over my bare skin.
text: Kate lets the robe fall off, so she’s just wearing her bra.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: So, like, shave my chest?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: Everything. Legs, armpits, everything.
dialog: Totally smooth.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not my hair...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, of course not.
text: Heather waves her arms.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Hold on.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: Heather pantomimes cutting hair.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Um, yeah, your hair, too.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No way. My hair is one of the best three
dialog: things about me. Eyes, hair, ass. There
text: was a poll in the school paper.
text: Carrie scribbles on a piece of paper. Kate reads.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: If you love me, you'll do it.
dialog: (then)
dialog: I didn’t want you to, but when you said you
dialog: wouldn’t... I know if I loved someone,
dialog: there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for them.
text: John hesitates. This is a biggie.
text: Carrie yawns. Kate follows suit, gives a huge yawn for
text: John’s benefit, then pulls her robe back on.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what? Maybe you're right. I’11
dialog: just see you tomorrow.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No! Wait! Give me five minutes.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Be careful on the ledge. Oh, and I’m going
dialog: to turn the lights out, okay? I’ma little
dialog: shy. Just get comfortable and climb in.
text: Kate blows John a kiss. Carrie closes the computer. The
text: girls burst out laughing.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: The room is completely dark - the only light comes from
text: outside. And then through the window we see John inching
text: along the ledge. He’s in the shadows, but it’s clear he’s
text: just wearing boxers, and nothing else. No hair on his head
text: or his body. He pushes open the window and climbs in.
text: In the room, he spots the bed, sees the person sleeping in
text: it. He climbs into bed. (Now that he’s in the room, it’s
text: impossible to see anything but vague shapes.)
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oh, Kate.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: gl.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Oh, Darryl.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Darryl? Who’s Darryl?
speaker_heading: WOMAN'S VOICE
dialog: Who’s Kate?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You mean Coach?
text: The light beside the bed flips on. John’s got a big surprise
text: - he’s in bed with Coach Williams, the girls’ cheer coach.
text: She lets out a high pitched scream, John lets out a higher
dialog: pitched one.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: People are filing out of their rooms to see what all the
text: commotion is about. Carrie and Beth aren’t there, but
text: Heather and Kate are part of the growing crowd.
text: Coach Williams comes out of her room, John in tow. He’s
text: still wearing his boxers, and Coach Williams is using them as
text: a handle to pull him along. She’s got them hiked so far up
text: that there isn’t much breathing space left inside them.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: No... Dear god... Hurts so much...
dialog: Please... Not that... They mean so much
dialog: to me...
text: We get our first good look at John in the light: he is
text: completely, utterly, blindingly hairless.
text: The crowd in the hall have their mouths hanging open: what
text: the hell is going on? Finally, the people get over their
text: shock enough to begin laughing. Heartily.
text: A FLASH - Heather’s got a camera and just got a prime
text: picture. John looks at the camera in a daze, then notices
text: Kate. Kate looks sheepish.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Sorry. I guess it was six windows.
text: Finally John’s coach comes into the hall.
speaker_heading: COACH
dialog: What the hell is going on here?
speaker_heading: COACH WILLIAMS
dialog: Darryl, I think this Chihuahua belongs to
dialog: you. I found it in my bed.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Please make her let go.
text: Coach Williams lets go and pushes John towards his coach, who
text: grabs his arm and leads him away in shame. People are
text: falling over themselves laughing and pointing as he goes.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
text: John walks down the hall, shaved head on display. People
text: point and whisper as he walks, a few girls giggle.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: John’s aura was punctured. Don’t get me
dialog: wrong - he was still John Tucker, and he
dialog: managed to put a good spin on it almost
dialog: immediately.
text: John meets up with a bunch of other guys from his basketball
text: team - they now all have shaved heads. They high five,
dialog: admire each other.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK - DAY
text: Late afternoon, Kate trains alone, sprinting around the track
text: as fast as she can, really pushing.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: But he was in love, he was getting
text: desperate, he was almost ready for the big
dialog: fall. All I had to do was deliver. And
dialog: nothing was going to get in my way.
text: Kate stops in her tracks.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Scott!
text: Scott stands on the side of the track. He applauds.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I think you won.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I’m the only one running.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I know, how smart are you?
text: Kate laughs. As she talks, she steps up and down in place,
text: keeping her muscles warm. Scott notices, starts stepping
text: along with her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, you can stop making fun of me any
dialog: time. I’ve just got to keep moving so I
dialog: don’t cramp up.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: (looks at his legs)
dialog: Wow, I didn’t even notice I was doing it.
dialog: It’s like, when you talk to a guy with an
dialog: accent and you start doing the accent?
dialog: (Indian accent)
dialog: I am having much fun dancing with you.
dialog: Please try the papadums.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay, we’re stopping.
text: Kate stops, Scott follows suit.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: You sure you’re not going to cramp up? I
dialog: mean, you were jogging at a pretty torrid
dialog: pace.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: You want to race? Come on, I just did five
dialog: miles, I’1l still slaughter you.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No way. I’m just a big talker. Absolutely
dialog: nothing to back it up.
text: Kate laughs, then grabs at one leg, staggers forward.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Ow, Ow, OW...
text: She collapses into Scott’s arms. Scott picks her up, carries
text: her over to a bench and sets her down.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I guess you weren't kidding. I’m almost
dialog: feeling guilty for making fun of you.
text: He kneels down in front of her, works on the cramping calf,
text: massaging it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: “Almost?” What would it take to make you
dialog: feel guilty?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
text: Oh, something big. Like a leg falling off.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Nice.
text: Kate and Scott laugh. Scott looks up at Kate... Kate looks
text: down at Scott... his hands are on her leg... and all of a
text: sudden, things are weird. There’s a definite vibe in the
text: air. They both immediately get uncomfortable. Scott lets go
text: of her leg and stands up.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Feeling better?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Good.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thanks.
text: After a long pause:
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I should finish my workout before I-
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Yeah, absolutely. Okay, good running into
dialog: you.
text: Kate smiles, turns, sprints away. Scott watches her go.
scene_heading: INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY
text: Our four girls are gathered in the bathroom.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It smells in here. I’m getting tired of
text: meeting in bathrooms.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: We’re almost done, then we don’t have to
dialog: sneak around any more. I’ve figured it out
dialog: - I’ve got the perfect place to finish him
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, about that... maybe we’ve done
dialog: enough.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I mean, we made the guy look like an idiot
dialog: at the hotel...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: That? He’s bounced back from a lot worse
dialog: than that.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Yeah, we haven’t done nearly enough. This
dialog: is just part of the plan. We hook him,
dialog: then we crush him. All we’ve done is hook
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I know how much you love plans, I’m just
dialog: not sure how much more we need to do.
text: The girls stare at her. Not happily.
dialog: Finally
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s just feeling kind of, I don’t know,
dialog: weird.
text: Carrie snaps.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: What kind of crap is this?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Are you falling for John? Is that it? You
dialog: want him for yourself?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look at what this guy does! You’re as
dialog: obsessed with trying to destroy him as you
dialog: were with dating him. You’re still letting
dialog: him control you.
text: Beth holds up her hand to calm the other two. She goes over
text: to Kate, puts her arm around her, playing good cop.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Look, I know it’s tough, but we’re almost
dialog: done. Let’s just finish John off, then
dialog: you’re done. You never have to think about
text: him again.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I don’t know...
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Jeez, Kate, I thought we were friends.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: + F
dialog: 96.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
dialog: Heather
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: We are. Aren't we?
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: I thought so. But friends look out for
dialog: each other. Friends don’t say they’1l do
dialog: something and then...
text: searches for the right words. Carrie supplies them.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Completely screw everyone over!
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Come on, Kate. If you’re not going to do
dialog: it for your friends, then what about doing
dialog: it to send a message to the John Tuckers of
dialog: the world? If we don’t teach him a lesson,
dialog: he’s just going to go start ruining other
dialog: girls’ lives. You know it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: All right, all right. Momentary lapse.
dialog: I’m fine. What’s your idea?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Get ready, because this is great.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You know how the elections are next week?
dialog: Well, Kate is going to be the one to
dialog: announce the winners, and she’s going to
text: break up with John right there in front of
dialog: the whole school.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: What the hell?!
speaker_heading: CARRIE
text: It’s perfect. Everyone’s there, cameras
dialog: are rolling, he’s ready to be have the
dialog: whole school choose him as their leader...
dialog: and we destroy him.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No no no-
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: What’s your problem? This is a great idea.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It’s a horrible idea. Do you know who
dialog: announces the election results?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: A cheerleader, which is why-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: *
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: HEATHER
text: The head cheerleader. She’s the designated
dialog: spirit representative for the entire
dialog: school. Now, I know you think that’s a big
dialog: joke, but it’s not to me.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: So? We make Kate the head cheerleader.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Good, it’1l make it even more painful when
text: he’s dumped by the head cheerleader.
text: Heather loses it, screams:
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Hold on one freakin’ second!
text: She finally has everyone’s undivided attention.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m head cheerleader. Not her.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Heather, come on-
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No, no “Heather, come on.” This is a
dialog: popularity contest, and I’m the most
dialog: popular girl in school. Well, I’m sorry,
dialog: but it’s true. The girls in my family have
dialog: always been the head cheerleader since, I
dialog: don’t know, the pilgrims.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Look, we’ve got a plan, and we’re going to
dialog: follow it. We all have to make sacrifices.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: Oh, really?
dialog: (re: Beth)
dialog: What did she sacrifice? Her parents’
dialog: money?
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Hey, don’t attack me! It was Carrie’s
dialog: stupid idea!
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: You said it was great!
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (to Carrie)
dialog: And you, what did you sacrifice? Why don’t
dialog: you make Kate the editor of the newspaper?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: I would if I thought it would help.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: No you wouldn’t. If you gave up one of
dialog: your precious activities, you’d never get
dialog: into Hartford.
dialog: Silence. Then:
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Do you mean “Harvard?”
text: Heather screams in frustration, starts for Carrie. The other
text: girls grab her and hold her back. Heather takes a deep
text: breath, relaxes; when the other girls let her go, she

speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: You want to talk sacrifices? Fine.
text: Heather turns on the water and starts moving the notebook
text: towards it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER (CONT’D)
dialog: I hope you haven’t had any good notions
dialog: today.
text: Carrie wails.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Heather, stop! Everyone made sacrifices.
text: She turns to Beth for help.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: (reaching)
dialog: Sure. Um... Carrie, didn’t you say that
dialog: you got a “B” on a trig test because you
dialog: were putting so much work into this plan?
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: A minus.
text: Heather growls.
speaker_heading: CARRIE (CONT'D)
text: Wait wait wait. And Beth. She doesn’t get

speaker_heading: BETH

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Kate, say something.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Uh... okay... Listen, Heather, no one’s
dialog: going to deny that you’ve made the biggest
dialog: sacrifices. But come on, nothing could
dialog: make me more popular than you. The only
dialog: reason I’m popular at all is because you’ve
dialog: taken me under your wing. Just hanging out
dialog: with you makes everyone think I’m somebody.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Absolutely. You totally rule this school.
dialog: Everyone knows it.
speaker_heading: BETH
dialog: Carrie’s right. As much as I say I reject
dialog: the paternalistic power structure of high
dialog: school, the truth is I'd give my right arm
dialog: to be head cheerleader.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: (softening)
dialog: You wouldn’t be much of a cheerleader with
text: one arm.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: The only reason I never tried out for cheer
dialog: is that I was afraid I wouldn’t make it.
speaker_heading: HEATHER
dialog: It would help if you were a little taller.
dialog: But you probably could have made it.
speaker_heading: CARRIE
dialog: Are we okay?
speaker_heading: HEATHER

speaker_heading: KATE

speaker_heading: LORI

speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: It’s not just friends - can you imagine

dialog: I’ve done is watch you date jerks who ruin
dialog: our lives. I’ve started to think all guys

text: timing. Kate walks out of the room.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Kate joins John.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Listen, I was wondering if you want to get
dialog: together tonight - we haven’t really seen
dialog: each other since the trip.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, tonight’s not great. I’m just really
dialog: busy these days - it’s cheer season, and
dialog: I’ve got to keep my focus.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: But soon?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Absolutely. I/’11 call you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Hey, I hear everyone saying you’re the new
text: head cheerleader.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, crazy, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Not so crazy. You are dating John Tucker.
text: He flashes his million dollar smile, but it’s looking a
text: little less convincing than usual.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah. Okay, see you.
text: Kate heads back into the class. John just stands, watching
text: her go... He doesn’t look good. He kind of looks like a
text: desperate girl who’s being ignored by the guy she loves.
scene_heading: INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
text: Kate walks down the hall - it seems that everyone knows her,
text: talks to her, congratulates her...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: The week leading up to the election seemed
text: to last about a minute, it was so packed.
dialog: I sure wasn’t invisible any more - I
dialog: couldn't go anywhere without everyone
dialog: knowing who I was.
scene_heading: INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: Kate is waiting on an elderly couple.
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: So, Kate, what’s going on with you and John
dialog: Tucker?
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Kate’s asleep in bed; something wakes her.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: John got more and more desperate every day.
dialog: And night.
text: She looks out her window to find John standing down there,
text: guitar in hand, warbling Dashboard Confessional’s “Screaming
text: Infidelities.” His usually impressive voice is cracking,
text: interrupted by the tears running down his face. Kate closes
text: the curtains, lies back down, puts a pillow over her face.
scene_heading: INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
text: Kate walks through the cafeteria with another cheerleader,
text: talking.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: We didn’t want John to fall completely
dialog: apart before we had a chance to destroy him
dialog: publicly, so I did spend some time with
dialog: him...
text: Kate and the cheerleader sit down at a table, and we see that
text: John’s behind them, struggling with their books and trays
text: loaded down with food. He sets everything down for them;
text: when he’s done, Kate pats him on the arm to thank him, then
text: turns back to her friend. John waves weakly and walks away
text: from the table.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S KITCHEN - DAY
text: Kate is sitting across the table from her mother. They’re
text: both reading as they eat, not making eye contact, not
text: acknowledging each other’s presence.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 104.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: So the plan was rolling along. At home?
dialog: Not so much. My mom and I hadn’t talked
dialog: since our fight. Well, that’s not
dialog: precisely true - I asked her to pass me the
dialog: potatoes once, and she asked me if I'd
dialog: picked up toilet paper at the store. So,
dialog: you know, the lines of communication were
dialog: Open.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - DAY
text: Kate sits with the other three girls.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: And before I knew it, it was the day of the
text: election. The buzz around school - started
dialog: by Carrie - is that something was going to
dialog: happen. It was the first time politics
dialog: were ever popular. We got together that
dialog: morning to work on my speech. It was
dialog: tough, but we found five synonyms for the
dialog: word “womanizer” and seventeen for “dump.”
text: At last, it was finally going to be over,
dialog: we could get our lives back... I was
dialog: thinking nothing could possibly go wrong
dialog: now.
text: They finish; they all get up and head out of the cafe. Kate
text: is the last to leave - she goes over to the trash to throw
text: away her cup, and turns towards the door when she’s surprised
text: to find Scott standing there. Looking extremely confused.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: It never pays to think like that.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: (busted)
dialog: Scott. Hey. Good to see you.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Since when are you friends with those
dialog: three?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, Heather’s a cheerleader with me, you
dialog: know that. And... I just know the other
text: two. From around.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: And since when are they even friends? I
dialog: didn’t realize that little video they made
dialog: about John had brought them so close
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I didn’t know they didn’t get along...
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: No, they’ve always hated each other. And
text: yet here they are, still together, with
dialog: you. Pretty mindblowing. Pretty crazy
dialog: coincidence that the three girls who tried
dialog: to humiliate my brother are best friends
dialog: with his girlfriend. What’s going on?
text: Kate has no answer.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: God, I was so wrong about you. I thought
dialog: you were different than everyone else, then
dialog: you’re hanging with them, you end up
dialog: falling for my brother-
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I didn’t!
text: Scott waits for her to explain herself.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look, you said yourself that your brother
dialog: was a jerk. I mean, you've watched him
dialog: hurt all those girls, dating them, lying to
dialog: them, dumping them... We just thought we'd
dialog: give him a taste of his own medicine.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: So, it was just some game the three of you
dialog: cooked up, making him fall for you, and
dialog: then what? You’re going to dump him?
text: Kate nods.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (CONT’D)
dialog: At the assembly. Of course.
dialog: (then)
dialog: You want to hear something ironic? Do you
dialog: know why he fell for you? Because you were
text: the first person who was honest with him.
dialog: The first person who treated him like a
dialog: human being.
text: This lands hard on Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Are you going to tell him?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: No.
dialog: (then)
dialog: He probably does deserve it, in some way.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That’s what I thought, that’s why I agreed
dialog: to go along with this-
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: In some way he does deserve it, but in
dialog: another way... Look, do you really think
dialog: it’s all his fault? He is what he is. He
text: doesn’t really go out of his way to hide
dialog: it. So who’s to blame - him, or the girls
text: who keep lining up to date him, even
dialog: knowing everything they know about him?
dialog: (then)
dialog: And what’s his big sin, really? Lying to
dialog: women to get them to fall in love with him?
dialog: God, that’s horrible. I bet you can’t
dialog: imagine what kind of person would do that,
dialog: can you, Kate?
text: Scott turns and exits, leaving a shattered Kate.
scene_heading: INT. LORI’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER
text: Lori sits in a chair, reading, when Kate knocks softly on the
text: door and sticks her head in.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Why aren’t you in school? Everything okay?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I needed to talk to you.
text: Kate sits on the bed.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know I told you I don’t need your advice
dialog: about boys. Well, I need your advice about
dialog: boys.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You know I'll always try. I can’t promise
dialog: I won’t suck, but I'll try.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Okay. Do you think I’m doing the right
dialog: thing, you know, dumping John tonight?
text: Tough question right off the bat. Lori searches for words.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I know you didn’t think this was a good
text: idea from the beginning, but it’s too late.
dialog: I’m in, and I need to know what to do.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Okay. Well, John’s a real bastard, right?
speaker_heading: KATE
text: I don't know. Maybe there’s more to him.
dialog: Maybe there’s an actual person there.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: He did hurt all your friends.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Yeah, he did. And if I don’t go through
dialog: with it, they won’t be my friends anymore.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You don’t love him, do you?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: No, I don’t love him.
text: Kate shakes her head, trying to sort it out.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: So, I can ruin the life of a guy who’s
dialog: never done anything to me, and keep the
dialog: best friends I’ve ever made in my whole
dialog: life, or, I can not dump him and lose my
dialog: friends.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Okay, just give me a second.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Tough one, huh?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: And the thing that kills me is, it’s all my
dialog: fault.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Mom, it’s not your fault-
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: What you said the other day? You were
dialog: right. How were you supposed to know how
dialog: to act if I didn’t show you? How were you
dialog: supposed to learn about men when I was
dialog: always dating bums?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Well, you told me not to do this.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Yeah, one good idea after seventeen years
dialog: of screwing you up. Kate, you’re
dialog: beautiful, you’re smart, you’re fun - you
dialog: deserve to be popular, you deserve to date
dialog: whoever you want to. All you needed was a
dialog: chance. I’m sorry for being selfish.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So what do I do?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: (beat, then)
dialog: You want to know something sad? The first
dialog: thing that popped into my head is “let’s
dialog: move to a new town and start over.”
text: Kate laughs.
speaker_heading: LORI (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m really trying, but I just
dialog: don’t know.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Don’t worry. I’1l figure it out. This
dialog: helped.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Did it?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Not really, but I can tell you’re hanging
text: by a thread.
text: Lori laughs.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: You know, you don’t always date bums.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: I’m afraid I have.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What about Sal?
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: Well, he’s no John Tucker, I’1l1 grant you
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Maybe that’s a good thing.
speaker_heading: LORI
dialog: You've got to get to school. We don’t have
dialog: enough time to fix me.
text: They hug.
scene_heading: INT. GYM - DAY
text: The gym is draped with campaign paraphernalia, the stands are
text: packed with students. It’s go time. Around the audience, we
text: see Beth, Heather and Carrie, none of them standing together,
text: and John, standing at the front with the other candidates.
text: One of them, Norman, turns to John.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
text: Where’s Kate? She wasn’t in Biology.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: She'll be here.
speaker_heading: NORMAN
dialog: I saw her this morning, and then she
dialog: disappeared.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: You saw her this morning?
dialog: (starting to come unhinged)
dialog: How'd she look? Mad? Do you think she’s
dialog: coming? Have you heard anything? You
dialog: don’t think she just won't show, do you?
text: Finally, whispers run through the room and everyone turns and
text: looks at the door, as Kate comes into the room. She nods and
text: makes small talk with the people she passes as she moves into
dialog: the gym.
text: The PRINCIPAL glances at his watch, steps to the microphone.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL
dialog: Well, since our designated spirit
dialog: representative has shown up, let’s get this
dialog: started.
text: He covers the mic, turns to a teacher standing next to him.
speaker_heading: PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Is she dumping him?
speaker_heading: TEACHER
dialog: That’s what I hear.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Kate gets to the stage. The principal hands her an envelope.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Hi, everyone. Thanks. Before I announce
dialog: the winners, I’d like to say something
text: about one of the people up on this stage.
dialog: I know this is unusual, but bear with me.
dialog: As some of you know, I’m not completely
dialog: objective about this election; I’ve been
dialog: dating John Tucker for awhile now. I’ve
dialog: learned alot, and I think it’s time I share
dialog: it all with you.
text: A murmur from the crowd: here it comes.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: Sometimes you think you know a person.
dialog: Especially popular people - you think that
text: smiling, friendly face they put on is the
dialog: real person. Sometimes they even start to
dialog: believe it about themselves. If everyone
dialog: loves them, they couldn’t be so bad, could
dialog: they? But I’m afraid that sometimes that
dialog: person is rotten to the core, they’re a
dialog: liar and a cheat and they've gotten their
dialog: popularity by using people and then casting
dialog: them aside. They hurt people that they’re
dialog: supposed to care about, and that’s just
dialog: unforgivable. There are no excuses for
dialog: that kind of behavior, and anyone who does
dialog: that should be punished.
text: Heather, Carrie and Beth are practically gleeful: all their
text: work is about to pay off. Carrie holds a camcorder up, to
dialog: capture the moment.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: As you’ve probably guessed, the person I’m
dialog: talking about is me.
text: Gasps and shock all around.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I used John. I did everything I could to
dialog: get him to fall in love with me, because I
dialog: knew that if he did, I'd be popular. And
dialog: it worked. Here I am. But to do it, I was
dialog: lying to all of you about who I really was,
dialog: and I had to hurt John, who'd never done
dialog: anything to me. I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: I don't deserve to be standing up here, I
dialog: don’t deserve all the attention I’ve been
dialog: getting...
speaker_heading: MORE
speaker_heading: ( ) (CONTINUED)
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: (to John)
dialog: And I don’t deserve you. I think that
dialog: buried deep deep deep inside of you,
dialog: there’s a really sensitive, wonderful guy
dialog: that’s going to come out for the right
dialog: girl. I’m not her. I hope you find her.
dialog: (back to audience)
dialog: Thanks again for everything. I know I’m
dialog: giving up a lot by doing this, including
dialog: some really great friends, but I didn’t
dialog: really earn any of it. So, goodbye.
text: She starts to walk off, pauses, goes back to the mic.
speaker_heading: KATE (CONT'D)
dialog: One more thing. Why do we all make fools
text: of ourself chasing after the John Tuckers
dialog: of the world, anyway? Why are we so busy
dialog: defining ourselves by other people? I
dialog: don’t have an answer, I just thought it was
dialog: a good question.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Oh, and also, since I probably won't ever
dialog: have everyone’s attention like this
dialog: again... It wouldn’t kill you all to come
text: out to a girls’ track meet once in awhile.
text: And with that, Kate walks off the stage, leaving behind a
text: stunned crowd. John looks at the crowd, looks at Kate
text: disappearing, and runs after her.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GYM - CONTINUOUS
text: John catches up with Kate.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Wait-
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: John, don’t. I’m really not the right
dialog: person for you.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I kind of get that now.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Look, I’m sorry-
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Don’t be sorry. Actually, I just wanted to
dialog: thank you.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Thank me?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Yeah. You could have destroyed me out
dialog: there. All those things you were saying...
dialog: they’re true about me, too. We’re alike in
dialog: a lot of ways.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: That was kind of the twist. Tricky, huh?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m going to work on it.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I’m still not sure how you did what you did
dialog: to me, but it made me think about a lot of
dialog: things. Who I am. Why I do what I do.
dialog: Who I hurt. I guess I’m feeling...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: ..-Compassion?
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: I don’t know, but I don’t like it.
text: They laugh. John holds out his hand.
speaker_heading: JOHN (CONT'D)
dialog: Good luck, Kate.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: Good luck.
text: They shake hands; Kate goes in and kisses him on the cheek.
text: She then turns and exits the building.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And then, as I was walking out of there, I
dialog: realized that there was one person who
dialog: noticed me before John did. One person who
dialog: did seem to like me for who I was.
speaker_heading: FLASHBACKS:
text: Scott coming up to Kate at the water fountain and talking and
dialog: joking with her...
text: Scott asking Kate to be his lab partner...
text: Scot talking to Kate at the party...
text: Scott and Kate at the campaign, laughing with each other...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Scott helping her with the cramp in her leg...
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: And one person who amazingly didn’t forget
dialog: I existed the second he met my mom.
text: Scott meeting Lori at campaign headquarters, shaking her
text: hand, and immediately looking right back to Kate...
scene_heading: EXT. OUTSIDE GYM - CONTINUOUS
text: Kate exits the gym and walks out into the night.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: But I figured my chances with him were
dialog: slightly damaged by the fact that he hated
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: SCOTT (0.S.)
dialog: Kate!
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Luckily, I was wrong.
text: Kate turns to find Scott running to her. When he catches
dialog: her:
speaker_heading: scoTtT
dialog: Does this mean you’re not dating my brother
dialog: anymore?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Finally.
text: And he moves in to kiss her. It’s going to be the most
text: beautiful moment ever... and she stops him.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: What do you think you’re doing?
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: Kissing you? Romantically? Although every
dialog: second we talk about it, it’s becoming less
dialog: romantic and more uncomfortable. You’re
text: just looking at me. Time is passing. It’s
dialog: getting really bad now.
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: And just exactly long have you been
dialog: attracted to me?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I think I suspected it when I first saw
dialog: you, and I was sure when you glued your
dialog: tongue to your mouth...
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: So why didn’t you say anything? You know,
dialog: this is all kind of your fault. You should
dialog: have asked me out the second you met me,
dialog: not taken “no” for an answer, and saved me
dialog: from this whole mess.
speaker_heading: SCOTT
dialog: I’m... sorry?
speaker_heading: KATE
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: So am I.
text: And he kisses her. She returns the kiss and they embrace,
text: not letting go.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: So what happened to everyone?
scene_heading: INT. GYM - NIGHT
text: We're in the middle of a game - John’s standing on the
text: sideline as his coach yells at him.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Even though it didn’t happen quite how we
dialog: hoped, we still ended up teaching John
text: Tucker a lesson and changing him forever.
text: John finally snaps and yells back at his coach:
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: What’s the matter with me? What’s the
dialog: matter? I’11 tell you! I don’t want to
dialog: play basketball! I hate basketball! I
dialog: want to sing! I want to sing!
scene_heading: INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: John stands front and center, belting out a song to a packed
dialog: house.
speaker_heading: JOHN
dialog: Oklahoma! Where the wind comes sweeping
dialog: down the plains!
dialog: 115.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
text: A high school couple walks hand in hand towards a car. They
text: split up - the boy goes to the driver’s side, the girl to the
text: passenger side.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Amazingly, another John Tucker didn’t
text: spring up to take his place. From that
dialog: time on, the guys at our school treated the
dialog: women like princesses.
text: The girl makes no move to open her own door; glances over at
text: her boyfriend. He runs around the car, opens her door for
text: her, waits for her to get in, and closes the door.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: After seeing what women could do to even
dialog: the mighty John Tucker when we put our
dialog: minds to it, they were scared to death of
dialog: us.
scene_heading: INT. STARBUCKS - DAY
text: Kate sits alone.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: What about the other girls? Like I said,
dialog: we were just together to take care of John
dialog: Tucker, and once that was done, there was
dialog: no reason to hang out.
text: The other three join Kate at the table, setting down drinks
dialog: and muffins.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
dialog: No reason except that we were all pretty
dialog: amazing people who taught each other that
text: men come and go, but friends are forever.
dialog: We stayed close until the end of high
dialog: school, and we still meet once a year to
dialog: celebrate the day we saved the world from
dialog: John Tucker.
text: The girls all clink their coffee cups together in a toast.
scene_heading: INT. KATE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Lori walks to the front door.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Mom turned out to be more mature than she
dialog: thought... with a little help from me, of
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: She opens the door to find Sal at the door, holding a huge
text: bouquet of flowers. He’s got a new hairstyle - it’s long and
text: comes down over the ears. Lori and Sal embrace; we now see
text: that Kate is watching from the top of the stairs. Sal gives
text: her a thumbs-up; Kate points to his hair and flashes him an
dialog: okay sign.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s easily the ugliest new dad I ever had,
dialog: but he’s easily the best.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Who's left? Oh, right.
scene_heading: EXT. TRACK - NIGHT
text: Kate is running sprints while Scott times her. They’re the
text: only people at the track.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.)
dialog: Scott was the luckiest one of all - he got
dialog: me. And what about me? How did I turn
dialog: out?
text: Kate finishes running, catching her breath with her hands on
text: her hips. She walks along, then looks straight up into
text: camera.
speaker_heading: KATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m the girl who made John Tucker fall in
dialog: love. I’m a legend.
text: Kate smiles.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
speaker_heading: THE END
