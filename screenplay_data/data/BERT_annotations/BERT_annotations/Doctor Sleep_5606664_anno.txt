scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - AFTERNOON
text: A lush campsite, in the woods. A smattering of RV’s and
text: campers, a few TENTS, spaced out from each other for privacy.
dialog: Legend: 1980
text: VIOLET (7) steps out of a small CAMPER, heading away as her
text: MOTHER leans out of the door.
speaker_heading: VIOLET’S MOTHER
dialog: Where are you going, Violet?
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Just to pick some flowers!
speaker_heading: VIOLET’S MOTHER
dialog: Don’t wander too far!
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE, WOODED PATH - MOMENTS LATER
text: Violet moves down the path, stopping to look at some WILD
text: FLOWERS growing beside her. She glances up, seeing SEVERAL
text: RV’S and MOTOR HOMES in a cluster, just visible off the path.
dialog: We don’t know it yet, but these belong to the TRUE KNOT.
text: Unaware of their danger, Violet heads further down the path.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE, STREAM - LATER
text: Violet emerges into a clearing on the banks of a quiet,
text: pristine river. Sunlight reflecting off the water, lovely
text: wildflowers growing by the bank...
text: She's startled to see a WOMAN sitting by the water, almost
text: hidden by the overgrowth. Holding a fistful of FLOWERS,
text: throwing pedals into the stream as she sings...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: My wild Irish Rose / The sweetest
dialog: flower that grows / You may search
dialog: everywhere / But none can compare
dialog: with my wild Irish Rose...
text: She is beautiful, dressed in flowing, strange clothes and a
text: black TOP HAT. She is ROSE THE HAT (looks 30's, but is so, so
text: much older). She turns to Violet, smiling sweetly.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well hi there.
dialog: 2.
text: Violet stares at Rose’s flowers. BRIGHTER, more COLORFUL than
dialog: the wildflowers she’s found...
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Where did you find those?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh, these? I know all the secret
dialog: places. You want one?
text: Violet doesn’t answer. Studies Rose’s face. She has a sweet
text: demeanor, a KIND, EARNEST SMILE...
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh... you’re wondering why I’m
dialog: wearing such a funny hat. Well I'll
dialog: tell you. I always wear this hat.
dialog: So much it’s part of my name now.
dialog: My friends, my very best friends,
dialog: they just call me “Rose the Hat.”
dialog: You can call me that, now that
dialog: we're friends.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I like it. It looks like a
text: magician’s hat.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: It is! It’s a magic hat, wanna see?
text: Rose removes her hat. Violet watches, her wariness fading.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Take a look. Nothing in my hat,
dialog: nothing up my sleeves...
text: Violet STEPS FORWARD again, so that she can see inside the
text: hat. It’s EMPTY. Rose turns it over, shaking it for effect.
text: A SNAPPING BRANCH draws Violet’s attention. She turns, seeing
text: a MAN lurking at the edge of the woods. STARING AT HER. He is
text: CROW (40's, dressed in dirty clothes.) PERFECTLY STILL.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t worry, he’s my friend. You're
dialog: missing the trick! Reach inside.
text: Violet hesitates... and then reaches her hand out, into the
text: hat... pulling up a HANDFUL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Wow... they’re so pretty --
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Because they’re special. Speaking
dialog: of special... you’re a little magic
dialog: too, aren’t you.
text: Rose reaches into the hat, her hand disappearing from view.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: The flower in my hand. What color
dialog: is it?
dialog: (off Violet's hesitation)
dialog: It’s okay, honey. You won’t scare
dialog: me. I’m not like mom and dad.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: Purple.
text: Rose smiles, lifting up a GORGEOUS PURPLE FLOWER.
text: Another SNAPPING TWIG, and Violet looks. There are MORE
text: PEOPLE now, standing at the periphery of the woods.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Violet. Like you.
text: She turns. She doesn’t remember telling Rose her name...
text: Rose turns over the hat, and FLOWERS POUR OUT OF IT onto the
text: ground. Violet’s eyes light up. She stoops, picking up a few
text: of them. Rose does the same -- and EATS a flower, right off
dialog: the stem.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: You don’t eat flowers!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh, but you do.
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: But these are special.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: The special ones taste best.
text: More SNAPS, and Violet turns to see SIX PEOPLE, members of
text: the TRUE KNOT, watching from all around them. Flanking her.
text: They are Crow, BARRY THE CHUNK (40's, heavy), GRAMPA FLICK
text: (ancient), APRON ANNIE (30's) and SILENT SAREY (50's).
speaker_heading: VIOLET
dialog: I should get back to my mom...
text: She starts to pull away, but CAN’T. She looks down: ROSE’S
scene_heading: HAND GRIPS HER FOREARM. TIGHT.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Stay a while. See more magic.
text: Violet starts to PULL against Rose’s grip, but it is VICE-
text: LIKE. Behind her, THE TRUE KNOT ADVANCES ON HER. SILENT.
text: Their movement STRANGE, INHUMAN - closing in on all sides...
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You are a special little thing,
dialog: aren’t you.
text: She squeezes Violet’s arm as the pale faces speed up,
text: barreling toward her silently. Rose’s fingernails DRAW BLOOD
text: on the girl’s forearm. And Rose is STILL SMILING.
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - LATER
text: Violet's mother walks up the path, a little concerned.
speaker_heading: VIOLET’S MOTHER
dialog: Vi? Violet!
text: Silence. She glances down at the wildflowers growing by the
text: path, frowning to herself. Behind her, we see the TRUE KNOT’S
text: RV’S DRIVING AWAY. She barely glances at them.
speaker_heading: VIOLET’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
dialog: (panic growing)
dialog: Vil Violet! Violet!
text: As her panic grows, the small group of RV’s exit the
text: campground unnoticed as she heads deeper in the woods,
text: calling for a daughter that will not answer.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - NIGHT
text: Snow. Snow as far as we can see, so bright in the moonlight
text: it almost seems to be giving off its own light. The camera
text: floats above it, tilting up to reveal:
text: THE OVERLOOK HOTEL. Half-buried in the snowfall.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - NIGHT
text: The camera follows a boy on a tricycle. We recognize him
text: immediately... YOUNG DANNY TORRANCE (5) riding his tricycle
text: down the familiar hallways. Turning corners, moving fast.
dialog: 5.
text: He comes to a stop in front of a specific room. ROOM 217. We
text: gradually realize why he stopped, and why he stares... THE
scene_heading: DOORKNOB IS TURNING. SOOOOO SLOWLY...
text: As he watches, the door CREEPS OPEN, revealing ABYSSAL
text: DARKNESS WITHIN. And then, just as slowly, a FIGURE STARTS TO
text: MATERIALIZE IN THE INKY BLACKNESS...
text: A GROTESQUE WOMAN, NAKED, GREEN WITH ROT, DRIPPING WET, JUST
text: BARELY STEPPING OUT OF THE DARK WHEN --
scene_heading: INT. DANNY’S BEDROOM, FLORIDA - NIGHT
text: -- DANNY'S EYES FLY OPEN. He BOLTS UP in bed, gasping from
text: the nightmare. COVERED WITH SWEAT, his dream still fresh. He
text: catches his breath, and quietly climbs out of bed.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: A door, the name “DANNY” displayed in construction paper,
text: opens as Danny steps into the small condominium. He heads
text: toward the BATHROOM at the end of the hall.
text: The door is CLOSED as he approaches, and he slows down.
text: Surprised to see it closed... He steps toward the door,
text: cautious. Listening. And then, faintly...
text: WE HEAR A SOUND THROUGH THE DOOR. A QUIET SLOSHING OF
text: WATER... LIKE SOMEONE SHIFTING IN A BATHTUB.
text: Danny hesitates. Afraid to open the door, but telling himself
text: that he’s being silly -- it’s all in his head... He slowly
text: turns the knob, and OPENS THE DOOR, REVEALING:
text: A WOMAN, IN THE TUB, SITTING IN THE DARK. Lit only by
text: MOONLIGHT. Obscured by the shower curtain. She slowly reaches
text: up, pulling the curtain back. We know who she is:
text: MRS. MASSEY. The WOMAN IN THE TUB. Her skin green and
text: bloated, her hands purple with coagulated blood. Her eyes
text: dead and white, like a fish’s belly. We can almost SMELL the
text: putrid rot as she GRINS AT DANNY --
text: The filthy water SLOSHES as she slowly STANDS, naked, her
text: body waterlogged and rotting. A purple foot LIFTS from the
text: water, STEPPING ONTO THE BATHMAT.
text: Danny’s bladder LETS GO, a puddle forming at his feet.
text: She LUMBERS TOWARD HIM as Danny CLOSES THE DOOR, stepping
text: back into the hall.
dialog: 6.
text: He stares, wide-eyed and terrified as A SHADOW APPEARS UNDER
text: THE DOOR. FILTHY WATER LEAKING OUT AS THE DOORKNOB SLOWLY
scene_heading: TURNS. LEFT, THEN RIGHT.
text: Danny COVERS HIS EYES, trying to WILL IT AWAY, even as he
text: hears DEAD FINGERNAILS SCRATCHING ON THE DOOR --
text: A HAND FALLS ONTO HIS SHOULDER, AND HE SPINS, SCREAMING -—
text: Into the face of WENDY TORRANCE (30's, exhausted. )
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: Hey! Hey! It’s okay, it’s okay...
text: He RUNS into her arms, she holds him, alarmed and perplexed.
scene_heading: INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wendy PULLS a fresh pair of pajama bottoms onto Danny.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: There, all dry. What happened?
text: Danny doesn’t answer. Just stares ahead, CATATONIC.
speaker_heading: WENDY (CONT’D)
dialog: Danny, you have to talk to me. You
dialog: haven’t talked since we left
dialog: that... place. Please, Doc. Please.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wendy steps down the hall slowly, toward the bathroom door.
text: Steeling herself. Summoning a familiar courage -- a courage
dialog: she learned at the Overlook.
text: She reaches the doorknob, and only hesitates a moment before
text: opening the door and turning on the light.
text: The room is empty. Nothing in the tub, nothing out of the
text: ordinary. She exhales. She’s about to leave, hand on the
dialog: light switch, when she sees --
scene_heading: TWO SHAPES ON THE BATHMAT. WET DEPRESSIONS. FOOTPRINTS.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARINA, FLORIDA - DAY
text: Danny sits on a bench, looking out at the marina. Exhausted.
speaker_heading: DICK (0.S.)
dialog: So you ain’t talkin’, huh Doc?
text: Reveal DICK HALLORANN (late 50’s, black) sitting beside him.
speaker_heading: DICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Weren’t talking much first time I
dialog: met you, neither. Little boy, set
dialog: to spend a long winter at that
dialog: rotten old place, just him and his
dialog: mommy and daddy -- daddy’s dark as
dialog: that boy is bright and boy, is he
text: bright -- he’s Shining like fire in
dialog: the one place - the worst place -
dialog: for a boy who Shines.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You remember the first time we
dialog: really talked? When I spoke up
dialog: inside your head?
text: Danny nods. Dick smiles. And then, Dick keeps talking... but
text: his mouth doesn’t move. He speaks IN DANNY’S MIND.
speaker_heading: DICK (V.O.)
dialog: Made you feel good, right? Knowing
dialog: you weren’t alone?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Daddy tried to kill me.
text: Dick notices that Danny used his “outside” voice, and follows
text: suit. No longer talking in his head.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It wasn’t all him, you gotta know.
dialog: That place fed his dark, like it
dialog: fed on your light. And he had some
dialog: light in him, too. Just like you
dialog: got some dark. We all got both --
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: It’s not done with me.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: It ever strike you funny, how I
dialog: showed up when I did? When you
dialog: needed me? Someone did that for me
dialog: too. My gramma taught me and I
dialog: tried to teach you and some day,
dialog: Danny Torrance, you'll teach
dialog: someone else-
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I won't.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Oh you won’t, huh.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I won’t Shine, I mean. No more.
dialog: It’s dangerous.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Reckon it is, sometimes.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: She found me. She’1l come back and
dialog: come back until she gets me.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: You're right. Overlook’s condemned.
dialog: Boarded up. They’re starving old
text: ghosts and they’re reaching out for
dialog: you. Won’t stop with her, either.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Pictures in a book. You said they
dialog: were just pictures in a book, and
dialog: they couldn’t hurt me.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Thought they was.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: But they aren’t. They’re real.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Some things, dark things, the
dialog: Shining’s like food. They're
text: mosquitos, landing for blood.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: The Overlook, it was always just
dialog: pictures to me, but I didn’t Shine
dialog: like you. Nobody Shines like you.
dialog: So you, in that damn hotel... you
dialog: was like a million-watt battery,
text: all plugged in, and it ate it up.
dialog: You made it real, started soon as
dialog: you walked through the door.
speaker_heading: DICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Can't do nothin’ about that, I’m
dialog: sorry to tell you but you’re not a
dialog: child, you're older now, much older
dialog: in a way, and you gotta hear this.
dialog: World’s a hungry place and the
dialog: darkest things are the hungriest
dialog: and they'll eat what Shines. Swarm
text: it. Like mosquitos, or leeches.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: DICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Can’t do nothing ‘bout that. What
dialog: you can do is turn what they come
dialog: for against them.
text: Danny looks up at Dick. His old eyes are sad, weary.
speaker_heading: DICK (CONT'D)
dialog: My grandfather, he was a mean
dialog: sonofabitch. Dark inside, same type
dialog: of dark as your dad. Beat me
dialog: senseless, and my gramma too, and
dialog: when he died I danced but he kept
dialog: on comin’ back. Standing in my
text: room, suit all grey and stinking,
dialog: from whatever mold was growing on
dialog: him in that box. One day he grabbed
dialog: me and he was real. His nails were
text: overgrown, growing long in the
dialog: grave and they cut me, Doc. Cut me
dialog: deep. And Gramma... she taught me a
dialog: trick. Gave me a present.
text: He reaches into his coat, and removes A SMALL METAL LOCKBOX.
text: Very old, rusted. And, a KEY. On a chain.
speaker_heading: DICK (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to know this box. Inside
dialog: and out. Don’t just look at it;
dialog: touch it. Stick your nose inside
dialog: and see if there’s a smell. Know
dialog: every corner. Every single thing.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Because you’re gonna build one just
dialog: like it in your mind. One even more
dialog: special. So next time that bitch
dialog: comes ‘round, you’ll be ready.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Let’s get you back to momma.
dialog: Wendy’1l worry and she shouldn’t
dialog: have to worry another day in her
dialog: life; that woman’s paid that debt.
text: They stand from the bench, walking back toward the shops.
text: Further out, Wendy is looking wildly around as she SPOTS
text: Danny approaching. She rushes toward him, relieved...
text: We realize DANNY IS WALKING ALONE. DICK IS GONE.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: There you are! Where did you go???
dialog: 10.
text: She hugs him as we PAN OFF of them, resting on a TATTERED
text: MISSING POSTER ON A LIGHT POST... A POSTER OF VIOLET’S FACE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT
text: Danny and Wendy sit on the couch, snuggling as they watch a
text: BUGS BUNNY CARTOON. Wendy laughs at the show, Danny smiles.
text: Content. BETTER. And then, he looks up. Toward the hallway.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: I have to pee.
text: He hops up, and Wendy watches him go. A little concerned...
scene_heading: INT. CONDO HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Danny turns the corner. Looking at the BATHROOM DOOR. It’s
text: SLIGHTLY OPEN... and he sees what he knew he’d see.
text: MRS. MASSEY, in the tub, BARELY VISIBLE through the door.
text: He takes a breath, and walks toward the bathroom. As he
text: nears, she SITS UP, GRINNING WITH HER ROTTEN TEETH. Danny
text: steps into the door as she CLIMBS TO HER FEET, filth and
text: water dripping from her.
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Hi Mrs. Massey.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I brought you a present.
text: He CLOSES THE DOOR, we PULL BACK. SLOW. After a few beats...
scene_heading: MRS. MASSEY SCREAMS.
scene_heading: INT. CONDO, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Wendy looks up as Danny returns. Calm, casual.
speaker_heading: WENDY
dialog: You okay, Doc?
speaker_heading: DANNY
dialog: Yeah, mom. I’m okay.
text: He climbs onto the couch, resting his head on his mother’s
text: shoulder. She can tell... HE’S OKAY. TRULY OKAY. And for the
text: first time in a long time, Danny SMILES.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. DEENIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING
text: DAN TORRANCE (mid 20’s now) awakes with a start. Pale,
text: sweaty. His face BRUISED AND SWOLLEN, fighting through one of
dialog: the worst (and last) hangovers of his life.
dialog: Legend: 2000
text: He’s in a FILTHY APARTMENT, a dirty mattress on a dirty
text: floor. He COUGHS, dry-heaving as he holds his throbbing head.
text: He rolls over, and stops as he sees --
text: DEENIE (early 20's, frail and sickly) asleep next to him.
text: Also naked. He stares, trying to remember --
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
text: Blurry flashes. Hazy memories. Dan, downing a shot of
text: whiskey. And another. Deenie, holding onto him while he
dialog: shoots pool.
speaker_heading: DEENIE
dialog: (slurring)
dialog: What’s your name again, Cutey...
scene_heading: INT. DEENIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: Dan stares at her. There’s VOMIT next to her mouth, staining
text: her pillow. As the sight and smell hit him --
scene_heading: INT. DEENIE’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dan PUKES into the toilet, spitting out a vile mix of bile
text: and whiskey. Fumbles for the handle, barely manages a flush.
text: He THROWS water on his face, looking up in the mirror AND
text: SEEING THE CUTS AND BRUISES. One eye almost SWOLLEN SHUT. He
text: reaches up, perplexed. Touching the wounds...
scene_heading: INT. DIVE BAR - THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
text: -- More whiskey. A LARGE MAN trying to pull Deenie away from
text: him. Dan, getting in the man’s face. A PUNCH that lands Dan
text: on the ground. Spitting out BLOOD, getting to his feet - a
text: familiar DARKNESS in his eyes.
text: -- A hand, grabbing a BILLIARD BALL. Dan, SMASHING THE BALL
text: into the man’s head. Straddling him now, as others SCRAMBLE
text: TO BREAK UP THE FIGHT. Dan’s hand, smashing the ball into the
text: man’s head AGAIN. And AGAIN. And AGAIN.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (between blows)
dialog: You gonna take - your - medicine --
scene_heading: INT. DEENIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dan STUMBLES, catching himself on the dresser. Looks down at
text: his BLOODY, BRUISED KNUCKLES. HIS HANDS SWOLLEN.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Oh god...
text: He looks back at the sleeping girl, and then at THE WHITE
text: POWDER, STILL ARRANGED IN SLOPPY LINES, on the nightstand
text: beside her. NEXT TO THE EMPTY WHISKEY BOTTLE.
scene_heading: INT. DEENIE’S BEDROOM - THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
text: Dan PULLS HARD from the whiskey, WINCING as Deenie SNORTS A
text: LINE OF COKE from the nightstand.
speaker_heading: DEENIE
dialog: Holy shit, I think you killed him.
dialog: What if you killed him. I hope you
dialog: killed him. I hope you killed him,
dialog: you hear me?
text: Deenie, STRADDLING HIM NOW.
speaker_heading: DEENIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Lemme kiss it better.
text: She kisses him, hard, pushing him back onto the mattress.
scene_heading: INT. DEENIE’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dan STUMBLES out, pulling his clothes on. Looking at the
text: BLOOD ON HIS SHIRT. Not all of it his...
text: And then he realizes something. He pulls out his WALLET... NO
text: CASH. Digs through his pockets. NOTHING.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Fuck. Fuck...
text: He turns his pockets out, frantic now. All of his money,
text: gone, probably snorted by the naked girl in the other room --
text: HER PURSE. There, on the table. Open. Dan stares at it, and
text: after a long pause, he moves toward it.
dialog: 13.
text: He opens her wallet, looking through. There’s CASH there,
text: maybe $100. Tens and twenties, crumpled...
text: AND FOOD STAMPS. A pile of food stamps.
text: He slowly removes the cash, conflicted. Looking back through
text: the open bedroom door, where she snores softly. He POCKETS
text: THE CASH, heading toward the door when --
speaker_heading: TODDLER (0.S.)
dialog: Mommy?
text: He stops cold. Turns. Standing in the doorway to another
text: bedroom is a TODDLER, maybe 18 months. Staring at him. Dan
text: DEFLATES a little. Confused, concerned... humiliated.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: What’s your name, hero?
text: The kid just stares at him.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Please tell me you came from next
dialog: door. Or down the hall...
speaker_heading: TODDLER
dialog: Momma...
text: Dan sighs. Oh, shit. He goes to the kid. Picks him up --
text: AND SEES THE BRUISES on the boy’s arms. The kind you get from
text: being GRABBED. REALLY HARD. He carries the boy into the
text: bedroom, placing him next to Deenie.
speaker_heading: TODDLER (CONT'D)
dialog: Momma!
text: He cuddles against her, and even in her stupor, Deenie wraps
text: a hand around him. Dan watches, heart breaking a little.
text: He makes his way toward the door, stopping one last time by
text: her purse. Looking at the food stamps, the little boy cuddled
text: up next to Deenie... And at the CASH in his hand.
speaker_heading: DICK (0.S.)
dialog: You can put her money back, Doc.
dialog: You can do that much.
text: He looks up. Dick is standing in the shadows, HIDDEN.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: She took mine. Probably spent it on
dialog: the coke --
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: DICK
dialog: Doc.
text: Dan stares him down. After a moment, tucks the money in his
text: pocket. He turns back, looking at Deenie and the boy.
text: Squints, concentrating. For a moment, a FLASH of --
text: THE LOCK BOX, with the rusty lock.
speaker_heading: DICK (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh no, Doc. You can put things from
text: the Overlook away in boxes, but not
dialog: memories. Never those. They’re the
dialog: real ghosts, you take ‘em with you.
text: Dan stares at him defiantly, and walks out the door.

scene_heading: INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - EVENING
text: DAVID (30's) and LUCY (30’s) turn the corner, following the

dialog: Time for bed, Abra.
speaker_heading: YOUNG ABRA
dialog: A little more??

scene_heading: INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
text: David and Lucy are fast asleep. Slowly stirred by a sound...
text: PIANO MUSIC, echoing through the dark house.
scene_heading: INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: David and Lucy make their way down the stairs, the music
text: LOUDER NOW. It seems Abra’s snuck out of bed, and gone back
text: to the piano. As they turn the corner, they STOP COLD.
text: There is no one in the room. But THE PIANO IS PLAYING, the
dialog: same song Abra was struggling with earlier...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
text: ANDI STEINER (15, sharp and pretty) sits in the dark theater.

speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: Andi?
speaker_heading: ANDI

speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN

speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN
dialog: So are we staying here or going
dialog: somewhere?
speaker_heading: ANDI
dialog: Don’t you want to watch the movie?
text: He frowns. But soon softens as she SNUGGLES UP to him, laying
text: her head on his shoulder. His HAND finds her THIGH.
text: We pull back to reveal ROSE and CROW, sitting a few rows
text: back. Not watching the movie. Watching ANDI.
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I don’t see what the fuss is about.
dialog: Chat room romance. A little gross,
dialog: but not interesting.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Watch. It’s interesting, I promise.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: It better be. Because she’s not all
dialog: that steamy -
speaker_heading: CROW

speaker_heading: ANDI
dialog: Aren’t you tired? Sleep.

speaker_heading: ANDI

speaker_heading: CROW (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: ANDI

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: ANDI

text: mostly deserted. A small town, with character.
text: He stops at a sign: VISIT TEENEY TOWN! FRASIER’S SMALL
text: WONDER. He looks beyond it, smiling to himself as he beholds
text: Teeneytown. It’s a MINIATURE REPLICA of the very street he’s
text: on, a tiny representation of the town he’s in.
text: Around it, a SMALL TRAIN - designed for toddlers - resting

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: MRS. ROBERTSON
dialog: Last guy said the same. Math

speaker_heading: MRS. ROBERTSON (CONT’D)
dialog: (writing)
dialog: Wasn’t quiet, no sir. Didn’t even

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Why are you doing this? You don’t

speaker_heading: BILLY

text: and a PUFF of silver MIST escapes. But it doesn’t dissipate

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: This one’s special. Her name’s
dialog: Violet, and there’s not much of her

text: IT’S DEENIE. Eyes clouded over, BLOOD AND VOMIT coming from

speaker_heading: YOUNG ABRA

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Sorry, Azzie.
text: The cat moves down the hall, SCRATCHING at a patient’s door
text: before pushing it open and slipping inside. Dan moves along,
text: lost in his work, as he passes the room. Glances inside.
text: An elderly PATIENT (80’s) lays on the bed, and Azzie the cat
text: perches at the foot of the bed.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: C'mon, leave him be.
text: The cat doesn’t budge. Shrugging, Dan starts to walk away...
text: but STOPS. A feeling comes over him.
text: He turns back, opening the door further. The cat just stares,

text: looks at it for a long time... and then steps into the room.
scene_heading: INT. PATIENT’S ROOM, RIVINGTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: DAN

speaker_heading: PATIENT

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No, it’s just Azreel being a silly

speaker_heading: PATIENT

speaker_heading: DAN

text: Tendrils of red smoke, gently rising from his mouth and nose.
text: Dan watches the small cloud of mist HOVER above the bed...
text: AND DISSIPATES into the air with a sigh. Then, the patient is
text: perfectly still. IT’S OVER.
text: Dan watches as Azzie the cat GLIDES DOWN from the bed, calmly
text: leaving the room. Heading back into the hallway. Dan sits

speaker_heading: GROUP
dialog: Hi Dan.

speaker_heading: BILLY

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m not a speech guy, so I figured
dialog: I'd hold the chip and talk about
dialog: whatever popped up. So here I am,
dialog: and... I’m thinking about my dad. I
text: saw a chip like this in his hand,
dialog: couple of months before he died. 5-
dialog: month chip, I’m pretty sure. He
dialog: hurt me once, when he was drunk,
dialog: broke my arm, then he dried right
dialog: out.
text: He looks at the chip, and then at the group.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: He died when I was 5, so the only
dialog: way I ever got to know my dad,
dialog: really know him, was when I went
dialog: dark. When I drank, to dull the...
dialog: or every time I wanted to break
text: someone's face. The drinking and
dialog: the temper. Those things in me,
dialog: they were his and they were all I
dialog: could know of him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But now... now I get to know hima
dialog: little different. Cause he also
dialog: stood in a room like this once,

text: mom. He held a chip in his hand, a
dialog: chip that said 5 months and on that
dialog: day, anyway, before the hotel...
text: Dan collects himself.

speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: On that day, all he wanted in the

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: I might need it just to find him.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Used to be more steam in the world.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Don’t be daft. That’s like when

dialog: used to be more neighborly.”
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: But it’s true, Rose. There’s less
dialog: steam out there, and weaker, too. I
dialog: don’t know if it’s their cell

speaker_heading: CROW

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Take nourishment, and endure.

scene_heading: BASEBALL BOY.
scene_heading: EXT. ABANDONED ETHANOL PLANT - LATER

dialog: realize why she prefers the music -- SHE CAN HEAR THEIR

text: FLASHES OF: CORN FIELDS, rolling by. The RUMBLING of the VAN

speaker_heading: CROW

speaker_heading: ROSE

speaker_heading: ABRA

dialog: even a lie, not totally. In science
dialog: last year, Mr. Staley told us that

dialog: keys, she left them on Dad's
text: worktable in the garage -- but she

speaker_heading: ABRA

dialog: be. Maybe, just maybe...
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: What do you think?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I think maybe. Not 100%, but I’1l
dialog: take 50/50.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: If it’s actually her -
dialog: 69.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Richland Court -
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: - and she did that, shook a whole
dialog: street in New Hampshire -
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Having a place to focus on — not
dialog: just a town but a street — will
dialog: make things a hell of a lot easier
dialog: for me tonight. Good catch.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: How you comin’ at her?
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: She'll be asleep. I just want to
dialog: look around. See who she is. Pick
dialog: up information, plant suggestions
dialog: like worms. Let ‘em burrow. A
dialog: hundred worms, about her dear
dialog: friends the Knot. And when we roll
dialog: up she’ll be so glad to see us
dialog: she'll hop right in the van.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: If she did that... if she really
dialog: shook the whole street, you should
dialog: be careful.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I should be careful. She’s a little

speaker_heading: CROW

scene_heading: INT. ABRA’S HOUSE, ABRA’S ROOM - NIGHT
text: Abra sits on her bed, downtrodden. Headphones in her ears.
text: There’s a KNOCK at her door, and Lucy leans in.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Hey...
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Hey mom.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Are you okay? We missed you at

speaker_heading: ABRA

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Wanna talk about it?
speaker_heading: ABRA

speaker_heading: LUCY

text: Abra looks at her mother sadly.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I don’t know, mom. I hope so. Tell
dialog: her I love her.
text: Lucy nods, and closes the door behind her. Abra sighs, turns
text: off the light, and then lays down. Closes her eyes, ready to
dialog: sleep. And dream.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT
text: Rose sits atop her RV. Legs crossed in front of her, sitting
text: lotus. Hands resting gently on her knees, centering herself.
text: Getting ready. Above her, a sky full of stars.
text: She takes a deep breath. Concentrates...
dialog: 71.
text: She briefly OPENS HER EYES, and we realize she is FLOATING
text: FAR ABOVE THE GROUND. Stars above her, LIGHTS BELOW HER...
text: the scattered lights of small towns, houses. Cars.
text: ROSE IS TRAVELING.
scene_heading: EXT. RICHLAND COURT - NIGHT
text: A normal cul-de-sac, quiet. The lights out. Rose STANDS by
text: the street sign: RICHLAND COURT. As she steps forward, toward
dialog: the houses --
text: THE STREET REVOLVES, AS IF FOLDING TOWARD HER. FOLDING IN
text: HALF, so that she is looking straight ahead at THE ROOFTOPS
text: OF THE HOUSES. Staring at each one...
text: NOTICING BLUE LIGHT coming from one house. AS IF IT IS
text: GLOWING SOFTLY. Rose moves toward the roof, and again the
scene_heading: WORLD TURNS, REVOLVING --
text: The house AND THE GROUND BENEATH IT now UPSIDE DOWN as Rose
text: walks, stars beneath her feet -- TOWARD ONE BEDROOM WINDOW.
text: She holds her hands up, pressing against the glass. Peering
text: inside... it is ABRA’S ROOM. DARK, save a BLUE GLOW from
text: within... Rose CLOSES HER EYES, concentrating further --
text: PUSHING THE WINDOW FORWARD, the house TIPPING FORWARD AGAIN,
text: so that she is on top of the window, PUSHING DOWN ON IT like
text: she’s doing a push-up -—
text: And then it FALLS AWAY, the glass DROPPING FROM THE WINDOW,
text: DOWN INTO THE ROOM -- AND SILENTLY EVAPORATING INTO THIN AIR.
text: The house REVOLVES AGAIN, Rose STEPPING FORWARD through the
text: open window as if it is a small door, and standing now, in --
scene_heading: INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - NIGHT
text: -- Abra’s room. The room is dark, but above her THE CEILING
text: IS FULL OF STARS. Rose looks at the girl SLEEPING IN THE BED.
text: She can’t see her face, it’s buried in the pillow.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Keep sleeping, princess.
text: She steps quietly, looking at the WALLS of the room... and we
text: realize the walls aren’t walls at all. They’re FILE DRAWERS.
text: MEMORIES. Some labeled: “Mom.” “Dad.” “Dreams.” “School.”
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You rubes. Spend your whole lives
dialog: making little boxes, little
dialog: memories, and you think they make
dialog: you so rich... you should see mine,
dialog: kiddo. My mind’s a cathedral.
text: She runs her hands over the file drawers that make up the
text: walls, looking for something interesting. She sees one,
text: decorated in a child’s handwriting...
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Well hi there.
text: The drawer, larger than the others, is labeled “ME.”
text: Rose GLANCES BACK at the bed, where Abra’s still sleeping.
text: She smiles. She reaches up, pulling open the drawer. It
text: EXTENDS FROM THE WALL, coming out about a foot. Rose peers
text: inside, at the FILE FOLDERS packing the drawer...
text: She reaches her hand inside to pull one out.
scene_heading: SUDDENLY, A HORRIBLE NOISE PIERCES THE AIR. A BRIGHT
scene_heading: SPOTLIGHT SHINES DOWN RIGHT IN HER EYES -- THE DRAWER SLAMS
scene_heading: SHUT ON ROSE’S HAND - CRUSHING BONES, SNAPPING FINGERS -
text: Rose SCREAMS in SHOCK and surprise. YANKING AT HER HAND, but
text: it is CAUGHT, like in a BEAR TRAP. She turns, realizing that
text: ABRA IS SITTING UP...
text: BUT ABRA IS DIFFERENT. Her hair is SHOCK BLONDE, and she HAS
text: NO EYES. No identifying features... LIKE HER FACE HAS BEEN
text: CENSORED. The only thing we recognize of Abra IS HER SMILE.
speaker_heading: DREAM ABRA
dialog: He said you’d come back, and you
dialog: did...
text: THE SMILE BECOMES A GRIN.
speaker_heading: DREAM ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Good.
text: She STANDS from the bed, moving toward Rose. Rose FLAILS,
text: hand trapped, VULNERABLE AND STUNNED --
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Get back -- GET BACK!!
text: But “Abra” just GRINS at her. Advancing.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a fucking child!
dialog: 73.
text: “Abra's” grin FALTERS for just a moment, but she REACHES UP,
scene_heading: HER HAND HEADING FOR ROSE’S HEAD --
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: NO --
text: AND ROSE IS SUDDENLY ALONE IN THE ROOM.
text: ALL OF THE FURNITURE IS GONE, a strange SLUDGE on the ground,
text: oozing up around her and HOLDING HER ON THE SPOT. A TRAP --
text: Suddenly, Rose is aware of a NOISE. Like PAPERS being rifled
dialog: through, very fast --
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Where the hell did you...
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: NO.
text: She CLOSES her eyes, and for just a FLASH we see --
text: -- a CAVERNOUS SPACE, vast and dark, FULL OF FILE CABINET
scene_heading: DRAWERS -- ROSE’S MEMORIES, ROSE’S MIND -- AND A YOUNG GIRL
dialog: Is RIFLING THROUGH THEM --
text: -- Rose OPENS HER EYES, thrashing her head back and forth.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: GET OUT! GET OUT! GET...
text: The sounds of PAPERS is deafening as Abra DIGS through Rose’s
text: mind. Desperate, Rose begins to TEAR HER HAND out of the
text: drawer that holds it. Her fingers SNAP, the skin PEELS BACK --
text: But she RIPS HER HAND from the vice, and STUMBLES toward the
text: window, holding her hand.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: GET OUT!
text: The room ROTATES AGAIN, the window DROPPING DOWN, and Rose
text: stumbles, FALLING THROUGH THE OPENING --
scene_heading: EXT. RICHLAND COURT - CONTINUOUS
text: -- into the night, the world TURNING again, Rose FREE FALLING
text: TOWARD THE SKY, out of control --
text: THE WORLD TURNING BENEATH HER, AS THOUGH SHE’S SUDDENLY AT
text: 35,000 FEET, the wind KNOCKING HER BACK AND FORTH, as the
text: ground suddenly RUSHES UP TOWARD HER --
text: She PLUMMETS, down toward an RV parked in a campsite --
dialog: 74.
scene_heading: EXT. ROSE'S RV - CONTINUOUS
text: -- AND BACK INTO HER OWN BODY, laying flat on her back on top
text: of her camper -- as the world ROTATES VIOLENTLY TO THE SIDE,
text: sending her ROLLING toward the edge of the camper --
text: AND FALLING HARD ONTO THE GROUND BESIDE IT. She GASPS,
text: lifting her face from the DIRT. BLOOD running from her nose,
text: eyes wide. Crow RUSHES TOWARD HER, followed by Andi and
text: several other members of the True Knot.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Rose!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Trap...
text: She tries to stand up, putting weight on her hand --
text: And HOWLS with pain. She slumps down, pulling her hand up to
text: her face to look at the damage -- BROKEN FINGERS. NAILS
text: PULLED OUT. DEEP GASHES in her skin -- it’s like her hand was
text: put through a SHREDDER.
speaker_heading: ANDI
dialog: What the hell happened?!
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (gasping)
dialog: Little bitch set a trap for me.
speaker_heading: ANDI
dialog: Your hand --
text: Rose SHOVES HER BACK. Furious. She SCREAMS into the night.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Rose --
text: She SPINS toward him, and we see -- HER EYES ARE DIFFERENT.
text: INHUMAN. Small POINTS OF LIGHT SHINE from her PUPILS,
text: subtle... but her feigned humanity is SLIPPING in her anger.
speaker_heading: CROW (CONT'D)
dialog: Calm down. We know where she is
dialog: now, right? Now we know.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: She was in my head.
speaker_heading: CROW

dialog: What?
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Stealing! Stealing from me!
speaker_heading: CROW

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I don’t know!
speaker_heading: CROW

speaker_heading: ROSE

dialog: Are you there? Can you hear me?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Oh god, Abra. What did you do...
text: Dan stands, heading toward the wall. The word MURDER, cracked
text: into the plaster. He picks up a piece of chalk, and after a
text: beat... writes “OKAY. WHERE?” And he STOPS.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Just talk to the kid. If we’re
dialog: gonna do this, let’s do this.

speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi Abra.
scene_heading: INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: In her bed, Abra suddenly LIGHTS UP. Dan’s voice FILLING HER

speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I can hear you...

speaker_heading: ANDI
dialog: I don’t understand.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You will.
speaker_heading: ANDI
dialog: I thought we lived forever...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Did someone promise you that, Andi?
dialog: Someone say you’re immortal? I said

dialog: long, very long, and we do, most of

dialog: well, not for a long time now and
dialog: Grampa...

speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: He turned me, you know. A long,
dialog: long time ago.
text: Crow approaches them.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: He’s going.
text: They step over Grampa Flick. As Andi watches, we realize
text: something has been happening - HIS SKIN IS FLICKERING.
text: “CYCLING” between being visible, normal skin, and being
text: TRANSPARENT. We have FLASHES of his skeleton within...
text: We can see his LIVER, HIS LUNGS, HIS VEINS AND ARTERIES. THE
text: NERVES CONNECTING HIS EYES TO HIS BRAIN -- And then, he’s
text: BACK, and those eyes fix on Rose.
speaker_heading: GRAMPA FLICK
dialog: Rosie...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yes, love.

speaker_heading: GRAMPA FLICK
dialog: I’m scared...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: No. No you’re not. Not you, my
dialog: love. You watched empires rise and
text: fall, cheered the gladiators in
dialog: Rome. You sailed across oceans to
dialog: new worlds and you fed on Kings,
dialog: princes, and popes. They wrote
dialog: myths of you and made statues and
dialog: they trembled in their villages and
text: beds and skyscrapers and they
dialog: screamed, screamed at your coming.
dialog: They broke against you like waves
dialog: on rocks and they died by the
dialog: billions as you burned like a sun,
dialog: for eons. EONS. So no. You are not
dialog: scared. Not you. You are a god, and
dialog: you eat fear. You are not afraid.
text: He smiles. Tears fall down her cheeks.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Look at us. Look at the family you
dialog: made. We are your legacy, love, and
dialog: we are legion.
text: As he looks at them -- the CYCLING BEGINS AGAIN. Violent this

text: then back, then INTO SOMETHING ELSE --
text: SOMETHING UNDERNEATH IT ALL, UNDER THE SKIN AND THE BULGING
scene_heading: EYES AND THE VEINS AND THE BONES --
text: SOMETHING LIKE AN INSECT, ITS EYES GLOWING FIERY RED --
scene_heading: INHUMAN MOUTH OPEN IN A SCREAM -- CYCLING BETWEEN THESE THREE
scene_heading: VERSIONS OF HIMSELF, SCREAMING IN AGONY UNTIL --
text: HE BURSTS APART. Not an explosion... just as though he has

text: Billy stares at him. Confused.
speaker_heading: BILLY

scene_heading: INT. DAN’S CAR - SUNRISE

text: Dan smiles.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Shouldn't you be getting ready for

speaker_heading: ABRA

speaker_heading: ABRA

speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Well when we get the glove, we’ll

dialog: (beat)
dialog: That was a new trick. I’ve never
dialog: done that before.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I haven’t either. What was it like?
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Like a library. I guess we’re all
text: libraries, inside. It looked like a
text: cathedral of file cabinets, but
dialog: only because that’s how she thought
dialog: of them. If she was thinking of a
dialog: museum, or a computer, I would have
dialog: seen that, I think.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: How'd you do it?
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Like this, just a little push --

dialog: moment, a FLASH --
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LIBRARY - NIGHT
text: -- the LIBRARY of the OVERLOOK. A TYPEWRITER on a desk. File
text: cabinets, many, from the floor to the ceiling... Then a flash
dialog: into DARKNESS --

text: DOZENS OF THEM. LIKE COFFINS...
text: Abra STEPS toward the lock boxes, each the size of a PERSON.

speaker_heading: ABRA

speaker_heading: DAN

dialog: 86.
text: Billy keeps digging. Face pale.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Used to hunt. Did I ever tell you
dialog: that?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Deer. This one summer, I clipped
dialog: this buck, had been tracking him
dialog: two days, and I got the shot and I
dialog: clipped him. He ran off. I went
dialog: after, figured he wasn’t gonna last
text: long but he vanished, just up and
text: evaporated. Not a trace. Truly
text: baffling.
text: Dan and Billy keep digging.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: Five days later, I’m trying a
text: different spot. Miles away. Miles.
dialog: And I come round, looking for a
dialog: spot for the blind, and I smelled
dialog: him... smelled him. Found that
text: buck, huddled up to a hollow trunk.
dialog: Dead for days. The smell, the look
dialog: of him -- never hunted a day since.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This’s the same smell.
text: They dig more. Dirt piles a little higher. And then...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Billy.
text: Billy looks over. There, barely revealed in the dirt... is
text: the LEATHER OF A SHOE. Sticking out.
text: They lock eyes, and gently drop to their knees. Digging
text: higher with their gloved hands... HOLDING THEIR BREATH,
text: GASPING for air when they can. And finally they stand back.
text: Protruding from the dirt, is the SCREAMING, ROTTING FACE of
text: Bradley Trevor. STILL LOCKED IN HORROR, bugs and worms having
text: their day. The BASEBALL GLOVE, clutched in his hands.
text: Dan leans forward, CRYING NOW. He reaches out, GENTLY SLIDING
text: THE BASEBALL GLOVE through the white, broken fingers.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Jesus wept.
dialog: 87.
text: Billy STUMBLES out of the shallow grave, VOMITING onto the
text: ground. Dan follows, looking sadly down.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Fuck... fuck, Danno. How the
dialog: fuck... they didn’t even bury him
text: deep. They buried him shallow.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m sorry, Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What did you get us into --
text: He puts his hand on his shoulder.
speaker_heading: BILLY (CONT'D)
dialog: What do we do now --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We cover him back up. Call the
text: police from a payphone, on the way
dialog: out of town. Let his parents have
dialog: him, at least. And we get this
dialog: glove to the girl who needs it.
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S CAR —- MORNING
text: Dan drives, Billy sits in the passenger seat. Shell shocked.
text: Looking out at the sun over the empty fields.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: The people who did that...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: They aren’t people.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No. No they aren’t. Anyone who
dialog: would do that to a little boy...
dialog: they’re not people.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But they’re coming.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes.
text: Billy nods. Processing.
speaker_heading: ABRA (0.S.)
dialog: Did you get it?
text: Dan sighs. Abra is in the back seat.
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yeah, we got it.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: She's back?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We're heading to you. We’1ll be
dialog: there in the morning, we have a

dialog: show your parents what’s happening.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: No! They just -- they almost think
dialog: I’m normal! If I tell them -
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Rose’1ll go through them to get to
dialog: you. You know that, don’t you?
dialog: She'll cut them down without a
dialog: second thought and she is coming,
dialog: Abra. They need to know.
text: Abra GLARES at him. Tears in her eyes. And then... she’s
text: gone. Dan sighs. Looks over at Billy.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: What stop do we have to make?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Do you still have that old deer
dialog: rifle?
text: Billy looks at him. The color draining from his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ABRA’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Dan pulls into the driveway. He’s CLEANED UP, the dirt all
text: gone. Billy is with him. As Dan steps out of the car --
text: DAVID bursts through the front door. Abra TUGGING at him.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: (furious)
dialog: You're “Uncle Dan?”
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Dad!
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The fuck do you think you are --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Sir --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: She is thirteen years old --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to Abra)
dialog: I told you to show him --
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I told him!
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Not the same thing.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: I'm kicking your ass before I call
dialog: the police --
text: David GRABS Dan, SPINNING him around, SHOVING HIM ONTO THE
text: CAR. Billy RUSHES FORWARD.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Hey --
text: Dan HOLDS UP HIS HAND, waving Billy back.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Abra --
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don’t say her name you sick son of
dialog: a bitch --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Abra!
text: David WRAPS HIS ELBOW around Dan’s neck, HURLING HIM DOWN,
dialog: ready to POUND HIS FACE --
text: David suddenly SCREAMS as a LOUD NOISE fills his head. Like
text: an AIR HORN, CRUSHING HIS EARS. He STUMBLES BACK, hands to
text: his ears. Billy watches... HE CAN’T HEAR ANYTHING.
text: Finally the noise STOPS, and another noise fills his head:
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: ABRA (V.O.)
speaker_heading: DAD.
text: David STUMBLES, his hands coming up to his head. Abra’s voice
text: LOUD inside his mind. He spins back to her, STUNNED.
speaker_heading: ABRA (V.O.)
dialog: STOP.
text: Dan gets to his feet.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m sorry Mister Stone. I'ma
dialog: friend. And everything she told you
dialog: is true.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: The hell... is happening...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Abra needs to show you something.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
text: They sit at the table. David shakes his head. Still angry,
text: but mostly CONFUSED.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I saw him. I saw the body, it’s
dialog: true.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Probably your friend here put him
dialog: there. You think about that?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Not for long, I didn’t.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Your daughter is special, Mr.
dialog: Stone.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Don’t talk about her --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And you know that. Deep down.
text: David doesn’t answer.
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: She saw what happened to that
text: little boy, and she saw who did it.
dialog: (turning to Abra)
dialog: Show him.
text: Abra walks toward David. Reaches up, touching his head.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I’m sorry Daddy. I really didn’t
dialog: want to...
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Didn’t want to what --
text: She closes her eyes. And suddenly --
scene_heading: FLASHES. THE ETHANOL PLANT. BRADLEY’S SCREAMING FACE. ROSE,
text: LEANING OVER HIM...
text: Dan and Billy watch sadly as David CONVULSES in the chair,
text: the images playing through his head. A look of BEWILDERED
text: HORROR ON HIS FACE.
text: Tears fall as he relives Bradley’s final moments... and then
dialog: he SCREAMS --
scene_heading: INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER
text: A SHAKING HAND pours a glass of whiskey. We follow it up to
text: David's pale face, still processing what he just saw. Downing
text: the drink in a single gulp. He turns to Dan and Billy.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Drink?
text: They each manage a very small, sad smile. Waving him away.
speaker_heading: DAN AND BILLY
dialog: No thanks.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Those... people. They know about my
dialog: daughter?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: They do. And sooner or later,
dialog: they’re coming.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: We've gotta do something. Call the
dialog: police, the FBI --
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: They've been doing this a long,
dialog: long time sir. They are ancient,
dialog: rich, and connected. I don’t think
dialog: they're very worried about police.
speaker_heading: DAVID
dialog: Well where are they? When are they
dialog: coming? Where can we go --
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Abra can answer that. If she’s
dialog: ready.
text: Abra sits at the table. Steeling herself.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I’m ready.
text: Dan reaches into his bag, and slowly - reverently - removes
text: the BASEBALL GLOVE. She stares at it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Are you sure you want to do this?
dialog: I'm asking all of you. This is
dialog: dangerous. I mean truly, truly
dialog: dangerous.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I have to. They already know me.
dialog: They're already on their way. And
dialog: they can’t keep doing this, Uncle
dialog: Dan. We can’t let them.
text: He moves toward her. Holding it out. Abra takes a breath...
text: and TAKES THE GLOVE. CLOSING HER EYES.
text: We hold on her. Hearing the gentle sounds of a HIGHWAY fading
text: up. And when she opens her eyes, she’s in --
scene_heading: INT. CROW’S RV - DAY
text: -- Crow’s RV. STARING AT BARRY’S HAND... the same hand that
text: wore the glove. HER TRACKING POINT.
text: She looks up from Barry, who is asleep in his chair. Looking
text: toward the driver’s seat -- WHERE CROW IS DRIVING. She turns
text: back, toward the back of the RV, looking out the window --
text: AT ANOTHER VEHICLE. SNAKEBITE ANDI IS DRIVING. There’s a
text: small CARAVAN on the move...
dialog: 93.
scene_heading: INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Abra OPENS HER EYES.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I-95. Barry, the Crow, the Snake

text: Massachusetts but they’re close.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Rose?
speaker_heading: ABRA
text: Didn't see her. But they’re coming.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I don’t want them anywhere near my

scene_heading: INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dan steps into Abra’s bedroom, followed by Abra, David and
text: Billy. He looks around.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This is the only room she saw?
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: That’s right. And I made some
dialog: changes. Hid some things.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay... they’1l be trying to track
dialog: you. Trying to catch on.
text: His eyes go to the STUFFED BUNNY by her bed. The same one she
text: carried when she was a little girl. Dan stares. AN IDEA.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And you're going to let them.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Are you crazy?
dialog: 94,
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Probably. But you’re going to let
dialog: them, and then I need you to try to
dialog: do a little trick.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: A magic trick?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: More like ventriloquism.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S CAR - DAY
text: Dan drives. Beside him, Abra sits in the passenger seat.
text: Billy is in the back. No sign of David.
speaker_heading: ABRA

scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY
text: Rose steps out of her camper. Looks around the nearly
text: deserted campsite, sighing. She CLIMBS THE LADDER, getting

speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Okay, Crow Daddy. Go get her.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. STATE PARK, CAMPSITE - LATER
text: Dan’s car comes to a stop. He climbs out, looking around. A

speaker_heading: TRUNK.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This could work.
speaker_heading: BILLY
text: Good blinds, over there and there.
text: Dan walks to Abra’s door, opening it. Looking in at her.
text: She's sitting VERY STILL, concentrating hard.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Still close?
speaker_heading: ABRA

text: Andi points. Barry nods, and they start FANNING OUT. Heading
text: toward her.
dialog: 96.
text: BY THE TREE LINE: Dan and Billy CROUCH. HIDING. Watching them
text: through RIFLE SCOPES. THE CROSSHAIRS ON THE GROUP...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: I don’t know, Dan. Jesus, I don’t
dialog: know if I can do this -
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I know. I know...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I mean, they’re people. I don’t
dialog: know if I can just...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Look at their hands.

text: BY THE TREE LINE: Dan’s finger tightens on the trigger. Billy
text: watches through the scope as Andi LIFTS THE NEEDLE.
text: BY THE TABLES: Andi STICKS THE NEEDLE INTO ABRA’S ARM,

speaker_heading: ANDI (CONT'D)
dialog: Well shit, the way they talked you
dialog: up, I was expecting it to be little
dialog: harder than that...
text: Her smile fades. She STARES... Abra ISN'T THERE. She just
text: stuck a syringe into ABRA’S STUFFED BUNNY.
text: She BLINKS. The spell broken. Looks around wildly. As she
text: turns, her eyes BURN WITH LIGHT. LIKE FLAMES.
text: Billy GASPS when he sees her eyes --
speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: though. Think on that a minute.
dialog: Outcome didn’t change, so their
dialog: deaths... all of them... just a
dialog: waste. A waste, you brought on us
dialog: all. For what?
text: Abra closes her eyes. Tries to reach out to Dan.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Please... hear me...
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Ain’t no one hearing you, darling.
dialog: Might as well calm down, enjoy the
dialog: ride. Like I said. Outcome hasn’t
dialog: changed.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
text: Dan enters the room, a BROWN BAG in his hand. He frantically
text: pulls out its contents... A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Oh please, please please please.
dialog: (concentrates)
dialog: Abra... Abra! Abra!
dialog: Silence.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: (concentrating)
dialog: Dick... you there? I need help... I
dialog: need your help... Dick please...
text: He STARES AT IT. Tears on his cheeks. Closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t Doc. You don’t need it, you
dialog: don’t...
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Someone help me. Tony... please
dialog: help me, Tony.
text: Silence. He leans forward, PICKING UP THE BOTTLE. Holds it in
text: his hands. Stares at it. And after a few long, AGONIZING
speaker_heading: MOMENTS --
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIOTT STREET - MOMENTS LATER
text: The bottle flies out of Dan’s window, SMASHING on the
text: sidewalk below.
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Dan sits back down. Staring at the wall in front of him, the
text: word MURDER cracked into the wall.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay. Okay. He always said your
dialog: brain was like a radio...
text: He sits lotus, collecting himself.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: No one’s answering when you call.
dialog: So stop calling.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And just listen.
text: Dan concentrates. A haze of noise... and then VOICES. DOZENS.
text: HUNDREDS. THEN THOUSANDS... VOICES IN THE DARK. OVERWHELMING.
text: DAN WAITS. WAITS.
dialog: 106.
text: He tries to sort through them. Concentrating harder than he
text: ever has before. BLOOD BEGINS TO RUN FROM HIS NOSE.
text: And finally, there in the mess of noise, a TINY VOICE...
speaker_heading: ABRA (0.S.)
dialog: Dan...
text: He THROWS HIS ARMS out in front of him as the entire room
text: TIPS FORWARD. He SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR, BRACING HIMSELF UP
scene_heading: AGAINST THE WALL --
text: And OPENS HIS EYES. HIS WALL IS GONE. He’s in a VAN. ABRA is
text: on the seat in front of him, curled down. CRYING QUIETLY.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Hi.
text: She looks. Eyes wide, groggy. Tries to sit up.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t talk.
text: He looks past her, to where CROW is driving. Looks at the
text: SEAT BELTS tied around Abra, holding her down.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: He drugged you.
text: She nods.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: ABRA (V.O.)
dialog: Help...
text: He leans forward.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m going to try something. You're
dialog: weak, and he’s blocking you, I
dialog: could barely hear you... I need you
dialog: to trust me. Okay? Okay?
text: She nods. He reaches out his hand, toward hers. She
text: STRETCHES, trying to touch his fingertips with her own...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. VAN - MOMENTS LATER
dialog: 107.
text: Crow drives along. Behind him, Abra SITS UP in her seat.
text: Staring right at him. He glances in the mirror.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Awake again, huh? Might need to
dialog: dose you at the next rest stop.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: You know where.
text: Abra looks around.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Fuck. I feel... hung over.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Told you. It’s good shit.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Haven't felt hungover in years. And
dialog: you know I don’t miss it. Not even
dialog: a little.
text: Crow pauses. Looks at her in the mirror.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: (looking out the window)
dialog: West... staying off the major
dialog: roads, huh? Smart.
text: She sees a sign. CROWNVILLE, 10 MILES.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Crownville. New York.
text: Crow stares. Looks closely. Abra looks back at him in the
text: mirror, but her EYES ARE DIFFERENT. COLDER. ANGRY.
text: AND THEY’RE BROWN. NOT BLUE.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I’m the guy that killed your
dialog: friends.
dialog: 108.
text: Crow freezes. Isn’t sure what to do. Clenches up, like a man
text: walking through a mine field.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Well nice to meet you. Neat
dialog: trick... haven’t seen this one
dialog: before.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Wanna see one more?
text: Crow slowly REACHES for the gun at his hip.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t imagine Rose’1ll be happy if
dialog: you shoot the prize.
text: Crow’s hand stops.
speaker_heading: CROW
dialog: Don’t suppose Rose is gonna be
dialog: happy about any of this. And when
dialog: that woman gets mad... Well, seems
dialog: to me you know enough to know you
dialog: might wanna sit this one out. Count
dialog: your blessings, go on your way.
text: Abra reaches around, checking her SEAT BELT. She LAUGHS.
speaker_heading: CROW (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s so funny, friend.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Well, it’s just... arrogance.
dialog: Arrogance, really. But it makes
dialog: sense. If you think you’re gonna
dialog: live forever, stands to reason...
text: She grins at him.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course you wouldn’t wear your
text: seat belt.
text: Crow glances down. His belt UNBUCKLED --
text: Abra THROWS HER HANDS OUT, JERKING THEM TO THE RIGHT --
text: THE STEERING WHEEL JERKS TO THE RIGHT AS SHE DOES --—
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - CONTINUOUS
text: The Van SWERVES FROM THE ROAD, through the guard rail,
text: BARRELING TOWARD THE TREES -- AND CRASHES. HARD. CROW IS
text: EJECTED through the windshield --
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Dan JERKS AWAKE on his bedroom floor, the momentum of the
text: CRASH sending him FLYING BACKWARD against his bed --
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPSITE - CONTINUOUS
text: -- Rose DROPS TO HER KNEES, SCREAMING IN PAIN AND SHOCK...
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: NOOOOO! !!
scene_heading: EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - MOMENTS LATER
text: The van is SLAMMED against the trees. Inside, Abra is HELD
text: FAST by her seat belts. She looks around, DISORIENTED...
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: (weak)
dialog: Dan? Dan?
text: She gets out of the car. Walks toward the SMASHED HOOD -- And
text: sees CROW, CRUMPLED ON THE GROUND. CYCLING.
text: She crouches down next to him. He stares at her, SHOCKED AND
text: BEWILDERED, EYES BULGING BENEATH HIS TRANSLUCENT SKIN --
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: I hope that hurts. A lot.
text: He CYCLES, contorting one last time into the INHUMAN CREATURE
text: that resides underneath... And then VANISHES IN A RUSH OF
text: STEAM. Leaving Abra alone.
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S ROOM, ELLIOT STREET - CONTINUOUS
text: Dan SMILES. Gasping. Wiping the blood from his nose.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Hang tight, Abra. I’m coming.
text: He grabs his keys, and runs into the night.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SECLUDED ROAD - LATER
dialog: 110.
text: Abra WALKS up the street by herself, in the dark. Shaken by
text: the crash. As she does, she looks up and sees -—
text: ROSE. STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, IN THE MOONLIGHT.
text: Abra GASPS -- but then realizes. She can see the MOONLIGHT
scene_heading: THROUGH ROSE.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Well hi there.
text: Rose glares at her.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Guess there’s no point hiding
dialog: anymore, is there.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You killed them. You killed him.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: The Crow? I did. And I’m gonna kill
dialog: you, Rose the Hat.
text: Rose BRISTLES. Smiles at her... but we can see the RAGE
text: behind her eyes. The DISBELIEF.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Big words, dear. Big words from
dialog: such a small child --
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: A small child that just killed your
dialog: man.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: I’1ll come for you.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I know. I hope so. Because if you
dialog: don’t, if you chicken out, you
dialog: coward, and I really need you to
dialog: hear me when I say this...
text: She steps close.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1ll come for you.
text: Abra PUSHES HER WAY through Rose, and the projection BURSTS
text: AWAY like a puff of smoke.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
dialog: 111.
scene_heading: INT. ROSE'S RV - CONTINUOUS
text: Rose OPENS HER EYES. Fuming.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Alright, bitch-child. Alright.
text: Rose gets up, going to the CANISTERS OF STEAM. THE LAST OF
text: THEM. She TEARS THEM OPEN with her hands, GORGING HERSELF ON
text: THE STEAM that comes from them. Pulling it all in.
text: As we watch, her skin GLIMMERS. Her eyes GLOWING from the
text: pupils... she’s GETTING STRONGER. As the steam courses
text: through her, HER HAND BEGINS TO HEAL.
scene_heading: EXT. CROWN MOTEL - MORNING
text: Dan’s car pulls into the parking lot. He gets out, looking
text: around... and sees ABRA, crouched in the corner of the
text: parking lot. She runs to him, throwing her arms around him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. DAN’S CAR - AFTERNOON
text: Abra WAKES UP in the passenger seat. Dan is driving. She

speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I’m sorry, I dozed off.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You earned it.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Where are we?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Ohio.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Dan looks at the road. His face pale.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: Colorado.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Why Colorado?
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She's going to keep coming.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Always. This only ends if we end
dialog: it... and I don’t think we can beat
dialog: her. Not by ourselves.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There’s a place. It’s a dangerous
dialog: place, for people like us.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: The place you told me about. The
dialog: hungry place.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: If it’s so dangerous, why would we
dialog: go there?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Because if it’s dangerous for
dialog: people like us... and it is... I
dialog: expect it’s dangerous for people
text: like her. Maybe even more so.
text: They drive in silence.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Good. She’s following us, you know.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: That’s good. Let her.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I’m sorry. About your father.
text: Abra nods. Takes a beat... and STARTS TO CRY.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I’m sorry about your friend.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This won’t end. Not unless we end

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. I-80 WEST - EVENING

scene_heading: INT. DAN'S CAR -— CONTINUOUS
text: Abra looks out the window.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Iowa. Where this started.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Started before that, I’m afraid.
text: Abra’s PHONE RINGS. She looks at it...
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Oh no.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It’s my mom.
text: Dan nods.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Tell her you’re okay. But don’t
dialog: tell her where we're going... you
dialog: don’t want Rose within a hundred
dialog: miles of her.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I know. What do I say to her?
text: Dan reaches out, taking her hand. Abra answers the phone.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hi Mom...
scene_heading: EXT. ABRA'S HOUSE - INTERCUT
text: Lucy sits on the curb, surrounded by POLICE. They’re going
text: through her house. Tears on her face, devastated and shocked.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Oh thank god -- where are you? Are
dialog: you okay?
text: As she talks, several DETECTIVES stand beside her, listening.
dialog: 114.
scene_heading: INT. DAN'S CAR - INTERCUT
text: Abra tries to hold it together.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I’m okay, mom. I’m okay.
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Come home... my god, Abra, what’s
dialog: happening...
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I can’t tell you. Yet. But I’m
dialog: okay. I’m with a friend, and we’re
dialog: going to... we’re going to get the

speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Who did this?!
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I’m sorry mom. I’11 call when I

text: She hangs up. Looks over at Dan.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: When we’re safe, you’ll call her.
dialog: Tell her where to find us.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Okay.

speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. GAS STATION, SIDEWINDER CO. - NIGHT
text: Abra looks up at the IMPOSING MOUNTAINS as Dan finishes
text: gassing up the car. A LIGHT SNOWFALL on the ground around
text: them, more on the mountains above. He climbs back inside.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Not too much further. Up the
dialog: mountain.
dialog: 115.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Are we going to win, Uncle Dan?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We have to.
text: They start driving.
scene_heading: EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT
text: The familiar mountain pass, the camera FLOATING OVERHEAD as
text: Dan’s car treks up the snowy mountainside. Higher and higher,
text: and further and further away from civilization. Toward the
text: one place in the world he fears the most.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - LATE AT NIGHT
text: Dan’s car approaches, and comes to a stop. The headlights
text: shining on the old hotel.
text: IT IS CONDEMNED. Dark, boarded up. The decades of NEGLECT AND
text: DECAY evident in its crumbling form, the once grand hedge-
text: maze just overgrown.
text: A foot of snow on the ground, almost enough to make the road
text: impassable. But somehow, they’ve made it.
text: Dan climbs out of the car. Face pale.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: There it is.
text: Abra joins him.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This is what we’re going to do.
dialog: You're going to stay in the car,
dialog: keep the heater running. I don’t
dialog: want you spending a minute inside
dialog: there if you don’t have to.
text: He points down the road, following it as it snakes around the
text: adjacent mountain.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: She can only come this way. You'll
dialog: see her a mile out, easy. You see
text: lights on the mountain, over
dialog: there... you blast me, okay? And
dialog: I‘1l meet you in the lobby.
dialog: 116.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: You aren’t waiting with me?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I can’t, I’m afraid.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Because I’ve got to go wake it up.
text: She climbs back into the car, starting the engine. And Dan
text: Torrance walks through the snow, toward the Overlook Hotel.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: The camera FLOATS through the lobby. The hotel is TERRIBLY
text: DAMAGED, dark. Mold and water damage everywhere. Rotted
text: boards on the windows. This isn’t a hotel... it’s a carcass.
text: LOUD BANGS at the front doors. They get louder as we get
text: closer... and then we see the door GIVE WAY as Dan forces his
text: way inside. He walks in, looking around. The silence of the
dialog: place overwhelming.
text: He looks to his left, toward the ELEVATORS... long out of
dialog: order. Dark.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Wakey wakey.
text: He stands in the lobby, waiting. Waiting. And then...
text: A FEW OF THE LIGHTS START TO SHINE, VERY DIM. Almost
text: imperceptible. Just a FAINT CURRENT running through old
dialog: wires...
text: He nods. Good. He starts to walk further into the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BLUE HALLWAYS —- LATER
text: Dan walks the path his tricycle took so many years ago. PAST
text: THE KITCHEN WALLS, now grimy and rotted. Into the next
dialog: corridor, turning left --
text: REVEALING A HALL WITH FAMILIAR BLUE FLORAL WALLPAPER, some of
text: it peeling. He walks, looking up at the LIGHT FIXTURES,
text: watching as they continue to HUM WITH WEAK LIGHT... LIGHT
text: HE’S PROVIDING, as he continues to feed the hotel more power.
dialog: 117.
text: He reaches the corner, and HESITATES BEFORE HE TURNS. We
dialog: hesitate too... we know what once stood on the other side.
text: Dan turns the corner, revealing A DARK HALL. The familiar
text: window at the end... but no little girls in blue dresses. He
text: keeps walking. Around him, the lights CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE
text: BACK TO LIFE.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LIVING QUARTERS HALLWAY - LATER
text: He rounds another corner. Looking past the stairwell, at what
dialog: used to be the living quarters...
text: THE DOOR BROKEN APART. BY AN AXE. Hanging lazily open on its
text: hinge. He approaches the door, slowly PUSHING IT OPEN.
dialog: Stepping into:
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK, LIVING QUARTERS, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: The LIVING ROOM. He can see the BEDROOM beyond it, all rotten
text: by time. He moves slowly into the --
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK, LIVING QUARTERS, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
text: -- bedroom, and looks at the BATHROOM DOOR. The childish
scene_heading: SCRIBBLING, FADED, ON THE DOOR: REDRUM.
text: And above it, the GIANT HOLE created by his father’s axe. Dan
text: approaches it. Bringing his face CLOSE TO THE GAP, looking
text: through the broken door, just as his father once did...
text: To the little window, where he’d once crawled out into the
text: snow outside. He stares sadly at the room... And then turns,
text: walking back through the residence, into the dark hotel.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BOILER ROOM - LATER
text: Dan steps into the darkness of the boiler room. Dusty, cold.
text: Dark. He heads to the boiler, and starts TURNING VALVES.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, GOLD ROOM - LATER
text: Dan moves down the hallway outside the GOLD ROOM. Realizing
text: there is LIGHT COMING FROM INSIDE...
dialog: 118.
text: He steps into the double doors, looking past the TABLES AND
text: CHAIRS, toward the BROKEN STAGE at the front of the room. And
text: then seeing the source of the light...
text: THE BAR. At the far end of the room. LIT PERFECTLY from
text: below, an EMPTY GLASS on the bar. WAITING FOR HIM.
text: And after a long beat, he approaches the bar. Past the
text: formerly grand ball room, now dilapidated. He arrives,
text: sitting at one of the stools. Staring at the glass.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER (0.S.)
text: Slow night, Mister Torrance.
text: In front of him, his back to us, a BARTENDER wipes glasses.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Not for long, I imagine.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: You're a whiskey man, are you not?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I was. Most of the time.
text: The bartender turns to him. We don’t see his face, but we see
text: Dan’s expression as he’s poured a glass of JACK DANIELS. He
dialog: always knew this day would come, somehow.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
text: On the house.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Thanks, dad.
text: We PULL BACK. Revealing the bartender... it is JACK TORRANCE
text: (40's). Dressed sharply, the same red tuxedo, the same black
text: bowtie, that LLOYD wore. Part of the staff now.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm afraid you’ve confused me with
text: someone else. It’s Lloyd.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Lloyd.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I apologize, I’m not sure where
text: everyone is. But it’1l pick up.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I know where they are. And you're
dialog: right, it’ll pick up.
dialog: (beat)
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 119.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This was your brand, Jack Daniels.
dialog: I used to see the bottles at home -
dialog: our real home, before all this. Mom
dialog: would find them, hidden sometimes.
dialog: I smelled one once. Smelled like
dialog: something on fire. Which, I
dialog: suppose, it was.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Would you care for something else?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: What’s the old saying? “The ideal
dialog: man doesn't smoke, doesn't drink,
dialog: doesn't get angry --”
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: “Doesn't exist.”
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Very good. If you don’t mind my
dialog: saying, Mister Torrance, you
dialog: seem... Put upon.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Put upon.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Ain’t that the way. Man just living
dialog: his life, trying to do his work,
text: gets put upon. Pulled into other
dialog: people’s problems, I see it all the
dialog: time. If you don’t mind my saying.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So we lived in Florida.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I'm sorry?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Mom and I. We never wanted to see
dialog: snow again so we lived in Florida.
dialog: Tiny place, but comfortable and we
dialog: were happy. I mean we were
dialog: grieving, we were traumatized, but
dialog: there was happiness too.
text: He stares at the drink. Wanting it so bad.
dialog: 120.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I was twenty when she died. And not
dialog: my best self, not by a mile. She
dialog: saw it, saw you, in me, but she
dialog: loved me through it. Then she got
dialog: sick and back then I’d see - when
dialog: someone was gonna die - I'd see
dialog: flies. Black flies. Death flies, I
dialog: called them, circling people’s
text: faces, landing now and then and
dialog: those last weeks she was covered.
text: Her whole face. Could barely see
dialog: her eyes through them, and I’d try
dialog: to comfort her but I could hardly
text: look at her and she saw that. Laid
dialog: there dying while her son...
dialog: avoided looking...
text: Jack PUSHES the drink gently toward him.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Maybe something warm, to push away
dialog: such unpleasantries -
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Don’t you want to hear? I mean, she
dialog: was your wife. You loved her in
dialog: your way, I know that. Don’t you
dialog: want to hear about her last days?
dialog: What she said about you?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I think you’ve mistaken me for
dialog: someone else. I’m just a bartender.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Right. Lloyd the bartender: pouring
text: joy at the Overlook Hotel.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: I‘1l pour whatever you'd like,
dialog: Mister Torrance.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: This drink costs an awful lot.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your money’s no good here. Orders
dialog: from the house.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Won’t cost money. It’ll cost me
dialog: eight years. Eight behind me, and
dialog: who knows how many in front of me.
dialog: 121.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Your credit is fine, Mister
dialog: Torrance.
text: Dan turns the glass. Rolling the booze around within.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: When the others started coming back
dialog: - and they all did, over the years -
dialog: I expected you’d have your turn.
dialog: Thought I’d turn a corner and there
dialog: you'd be. Maybe with the axe. Maybe
dialog: typing away, hunched over your old
text: typewriter in the other room. Maybe
dialog: frozen in the snow... but you
dialog: didn’t come.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Perhaps a bourbon. We have an
dialog: extensive collection.
text: Dan picks up the glass. Turns it over in his hand. Wanting
dialog: it, more than he’s wanted a drink in a long time...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: “Man takes a drink... the drink
text: takes a drink... then the drink
dialog: takes the man.” Ain’t it so, dad? I
dialog: wonder, frankly, what our lives
dialog: would have been - what our family
dialog: would have been - without this --
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Medicine.
text: Jack stares him down. Something has CHANGED in his eyes.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Medicine, is what it is. A bonafide
dialog: cure-all. Depression, stress,
dialog: failure, remorse, it wipes it all
text: out. The mind is a blackboard and
dialog: that’s the eraser and it’s good,
dialog: good medicine, Dan.
text: Jack leans forward, takes the glass from him. KNOCKS IT BACK.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
text: A man tries, he provides, but he’s
text: surrounded by mouths. Mouths that
dialog: eat, cry, scream, nag - so he asks
dialog: for one thing.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: One thing, just for him, to warm
dialog: him up, take the sting out of days
dialog: of those mouths eating and eating
text: and eating everything he makes.
dialog: Everything he has. And a family, a
dialog: wife, a kid - those mouths eat
dialog: time. Eat your days on earth.
dialog: Gobble them up, chew them to paste
dialog: and even then, while they’re still
dialog: chewing they scream at you. Shout
dialog: for more, tell you you’re wrong,
dialog: don’t even bother to say “thank
dialog: you.” Just eat, and whine until
dialog: you’re empty and done.
text: He POURS ANOTHER. Pushes it to Dan.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: Enough to make a man sick. And this
dialog: is the medicine. So tell me, pup.
dialog: You gonna take your medicine?
text: He waits. Dan leans back. Afraid.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m not --
dialog: 122.
text: Jack SMASHES THE GLASS out of the way. The liquor FLIES OUT,
text: SPLASHING onto Dan’s shirt. Jack stares him down...
text: a warm smile appears, out of nowhere.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Oh! Look at that, I’m sorry, clumsy
dialog: old me, Mister Torrance. Forgive
dialog: me. Let’s get you cleaned up.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, RED BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Dan looks up, DISORIENTED. He’s in the RED BATHROOM
text: his father leaning over the SINK and wetting a hand
text: moves to Dan, starting to wipe up the spill.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Management is concerned.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: Concerned.
speaker_heading: JACK
text: About the girl. In the car.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’ll bet.
dialog: and then
dialog: suddenly,
dialog: towel. He
dialog: 123.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Horrible, what she’s done to you.
dialog: Pulled you into her mess. A smart
dialog: man, he’d let her handle it. Let
text: things unfold as they’re meant to,
dialog: sit it out.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Management would do well to
dialog: understand... the girl is
dialog: protected.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: Why should you pay her tab, Doc?
text: He looks into Dan’s eyes. The same darkness.
speaker_heading: JACK (CONT'D)
dialog: I did it wrong. With you. I was
dialog: just trying to make you tough. Make
dialog: you a man I could be proud of.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I believe I am.
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: You messed up, Danny. Got two men
dialog: killed. Good men. Men who took a
dialog: stand. Fought. And for what? For
dialog: this little girl, who started all
dialog: this trouble. Pulled you, and them,
text: into her mess.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: And what does management think I
dialog: should do about that?
speaker_heading: JACK
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Nothing. Easiest thing in the world
dialog: to do, son. Bring her inside. And
dialog: then... well, accept the things you
dialog: cannot change. And you and I can
text: sit at the bar, have a drink.
dialog: That’s what you’ve always wanted,
dialog: isn’t it?
text: Dan stares at him. About to answer when --
speaker_heading: ABRA (V.O.)
speaker_heading: DAN!
text: He SNAPS to attention. Looking toward the door.
dialog: 124.
speaker_heading: ABRA (V.O.)
dialog: Dan, she’s here!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Abra climbs out of the car. Around her, the snow is FALLING
text: HARDER. Across the mountain, she watches as HEADLIGHTS CLIMB
text: the precarious mountain path.
text: She stares at the approaching RV, still a few minutes away.
text: Dan steps out of the front doors, walking toward her. She
text: points to the lights.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Okay.
text: He looks back at the hotel. Inside, MORE AND MORE LIGHTS are
text: on. He looks from the dark building to the approaching lights
text: on the road... danger to either side of him.
text: He holds out his hand, and Abra takes it.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
text: Dan and Abra step inside. Abra looks around the lobby.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: This place is sick. The same way my
dialog: Momo was sick... it’s cancer. Only
dialog: worse.
text: He turns, crouching down to her.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You should call your mom. Tell her
dialog: where you are. By the time she gets
dialog: here...
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: It’ll be over.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: One way or the other.
text: Abra CLOSES HER EYES. Concentrates. As she does... Dan
text: notices the LIGHTS SWELL in the lobby. Coming up to FULL
text: POWER. FEEDING OFF HER SHINE.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Okay. Done. What do we do now?
dialog: 125.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: We head inside. She’ll find us.
text: They start walking toward the corridors. As Abra steps in,
text: Dan STOPS. Looking at something on the wall...
text: A FIRE AXE. IN A DIRTY GLASS CASE.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - MINUTES LATER
text: Rose steps through the snow, looking up at the hotel. The
text: lights FULLY BRIGHT inside, shining through the old boards
text: over the windows. THE HOTEL IS AWAKE.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Rose the Hat walks into the lobby of the Overlook Hotel. She
text: moves slowly, taking in her surroundings. Feeling the POWER
dialog: of the place.
text: She looks toward the elevators, and for just a moment -- sees
text: a FLASH of BLOOD, soaking the entire lobby. She smiles.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS
text: Rose walks the corridors, past the closed doors. She RUNS HER
text: FINGERS along the walls, glancing down at the familiar CROSS-
text: PATTERN CARPETING as she goes deeper into the hotel.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, COLORADO LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER
text: Rose steps into the iconic COLORADO LOUNGE. Looking at the
text: OLD PIANO... the LONG DESK just beyond it, in the center of
text: the room. The desk with the OLD TYPEWRITER, rusted and dusty.
text: And beyond it... to the STAIRCASE. Where DAN stands, Abra at
text: his side. Waiting for her. Dan holding THE FIRE AXE.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Well hi there.
text: Dan leans toward Abra.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (in Abra’s mind)
dialog: When this starts, you run.
dialog: 126.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Yes, you run, dear. Then I’1l find
dialog: you. And you’1ll scream for years
dialog: before you die.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: We'll see who does the screaming.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: We'll see indeed.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: She's right, you know. You should
dialog: be afraid.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Why is that?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You don’t know where you’re
dialog: standing.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Who are you, handsome?
text: Dan doesn’t answer.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I get it, you’re scared. You should
dialog: be... you’re the man who killed my
dialog: Crow, aren’t you.
text: Dan nods.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: The others too.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (to Abra)
dialog: Go.
text: In that moment, Rose GRABS HER EARS as a HIGH-PITCHED RINGING
text: erupts in her skull. The room GOES BLURRY, and she STUMBLES
text: to one knee. After a moment, she shouts --
speaker_heading: ROSE
speaker_heading: ENOUGH.
text: The sound of someone HITTING THE GROUND. Rose looks up, BLOOD
text: running from her nose. On the stairs, Dan is LYING ON HIS
text: SIDE, pushing himself back up. Abra is GONE, having run into
text: the hotel during his distraction.
dialog: 127.
text: Rose gets to her feet, walking toward Dan as he rises,
text: picking up the axe.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: How the hell did we miss you? You
dialog: and I should have met years ago,
dialog: Danny. That’s your name, isn’t it?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I was busy. So were you... busy
dialog: killing children.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: (shrugs )
dialog: Something happens to the steam,
dialog: when you rubes get older. It gets
dialog: dirty. Polluted. You know that, I
dialog: see the grease all over you. You
dialog: don’t “Shine” quite the same, do
dialog: you. Growing up spoils that, I
dialog: guess. But seriously, handsome,
dialog: where have you been hiding.
text: He raises the axe defensively as she STARTS CLIMBING THE
text: STAIRS. Slowly, STALKING him.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: I can make you an offer. An offer I
dialog: rarely make.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Can’t wait.
text: Dan starts slowly BACKING UP THE STAIRS. Rose follows, and
text: they slowly climb... just as Jack and Wendy did years ago.
speaker_heading: ROSE
text: Such a gifted boy. Hiding his light
dialog: under a bushel, for so long. You
dialog: could live a long, long time. Live
dialog: well, too. Indulge yourself. No
dialog: consequence. No hangovers. Live
dialog: long, eat well.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Must feel lonely. Being the last
dialog: one, I mean. Last one in the world.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Oh sweetie, I’m not the last. Far
dialog: from it. I’m just the prettiest.
text: Dan reaches the top step. Rose looks up at him, smiling.
dialog: 128.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I assume you know my answer.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Pity.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So are we doing this or not?
text: A long beat... and then a BLAST OF NOISE in Rose’s head. Dan
text: RUSHES toward her, RAISING THE AXE --
scene_heading: ANOTHER BLAST, THIS ONE IN DAN’S MIND --
text: HE FALTERS, SWINGING THE AXE DOWN TOWARD HER HEAD --
text: SHE CATCHES THE HANDLE, just below the blade, DEFLECTING IT --
text: INTO HER OWN SHOULDER.
text: She RIPS the blade out, RIPPING IT from Dan’s hands --
text: SWINGING IT DOWN, BURYING THE BLADE INTO HIS THIGH. She GRABS
text: HIM around the neck, HURLING HIM UP OFF HIS FEET, OVER HER
text: HEAD -- AND HURLS HIM DOWN THE STAIRS.
text: He lands HARD, bouncing from the stairs, landing at the
text: bottom with a THUD. His leg BLEEDING PROFUSELY.
text: Rose slowly descends the staircase, blood flowing from her
text: collarbone. Axe in hand. EYES BURNING WITH INHUMAN LIGHT. She
text: crouches over him. Looking at his wound.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, sweetie. I seem to have nicked
dialog: your femoral artery. You’re gonna
dialog: bleed to death.
text: He tries to sit up, she SMASHES the back of the axe into his
text: HEAD, knocking him back. GRABS his throat. PUSHING HIM BACK
text: with INHUMAN STRENGTH. He’s OUTMATCHED.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: My, my, what a temper you have. So
dialog: much fire. You sure I can’t tempt
dialog: you? Turn all that fire and steam
dialog: into a long, blessed life... or do
dialog: you want to die here on the floor?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: We don’t die. We go on.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: Fair enough. Such a waste... or
dialog: Maybe not.
dialog: 129.
text: She DIGS HER FINGERS into his leg wound, and he SCREAMS. She
text: tightens her grip on his throat, leaning close to him. Her
text: fingers DIG in the wound, and he SCREAMS LOUDER...
text: And then, a FAINT CLOUD OF GREY STEAM escapes his mouth.
text: Rising in the air. Rose greedily INHALES IT.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: Damn, even at your age... it’s so
dialog: good. You taste like whiskey.
text: She DIGS IN HARDER, and Dan SCREAMS LOUDER. As he does --
text: FLASHES BEFORE HIS EYES: HIMSELF AS A CHILD. RUNNING,
text: TERRIFIED THROUGH THE HALLS. HIS FATHER, LIMPING AFTER HIM.
text: AXE IN HAND. THE WOMAN IN THE TUB, RISING.
text: Rose INHALES another breath of Dan’s steam.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: So much terror, all your life.
dialog: Delicious. You do Shine - that’s
dialog: the word you like, isn’t it? And so
dialog: does the little bitch. But honey,
dialog: neither one of you can hold a
dialog: candle. To me.
text: She releases his neck, GRABBING HIS HEAD with fingers as
text: strong (and suddenly as sharp) as TALONS. She SQUEEZES HIS
text: SKULL as she DIGS MORE into his leg. Dan SCREAMS IN AGONY --
text: FLASHES: LITTLE DANNY, RUNNING THROUGH THE HEDGE MAZE. THE
text: WORD REDRUM, ON THE WALL. AND DARKNESS... A DARKNESS FULL OF
text: LOCKED BOXES, LIKE COFFINS.
text: Rose BREATHES IN MORE STEAM. Eyes blazing, ecstatic.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: You’re not alone in there. What are
dialog: you hiding?
text: She SQUEEZES HIS HEAD HARDER. Dan SCREAMS --
text: FLASHES: LOCK BOXES, LIDS BANGING. THINGS TRYING TO GET OUT.
speaker_heading: ROSE (CONT'D)
dialog: What’s in those? Something special?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You don’t know where you’re
dialog: standing.
dialog: 130.
speaker_heading: ROSE
dialog: You said that. What do you mean?
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I mean you’re right. I Shine, and
dialog: Abra Shines even more than me. But
dialog: neither of us Shine as much as
dialog: you... and you’re standing in the
dialog: one place -- the worst place -- for
dialog: someone who Shines.
text: Rose looks at him, her smile fading as --
text: FLASH: THE LIDS OF THE BOXES ARE THROWN OPEN, ALL AT ONCE
text: He GRINS, and for a moment, it’s HIS FATHER’S GRIN.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: The things in those boxes aren’t
dialog: just special... they’re starving.
text: Rose looks down at him, not understanding -- and over her
text: shoulder, we see the rotten, EMACIATED FACE OF MRS. MASSEY.
scene_heading: GAUNT, STARVING. STARING AT ROSE --
text: MRS. MASSEY POUNCES. She KNOCKS ROSE TO THE FLOOR, and we
dialog: realize she ISN'T ALONE --
text: DOZENS OF GHOSTS DESCEND ON THEM. All SCREAMING WITH HUNGER,
text: faces GAUNT AND STARVING. We recognize most of them - HORACE
scene_heading: DERWENT. DELBERT GRADY. THE INHABITANTS OF THE OVERLOOK.
text: Rose SCREAMS as they CLIMB ONTO HER, desperate for FOOD --
text: CLAWING, DIGGING. Their hands DISAPPEAR INTO HER BODY. They
text: desperately DIG INTO HER, LOOKING FOR ANYTHING TO QUENCH
scene_heading: THEIR DECADES OF HUNGER --
text: Rose STRUGGLES. Fighting with everything she has to keep them
text: back, SCREAMING IN SURPRISE AND PAIN --
text: But it’s no use. The hollow eyes and gaping mouths of the
text: ghosts surround her, descending on her just as the True Knot
dialog: did to Bradley Trevor.
text: Rose looks one last time at Dan, FURY AND RAGE in her ancient
text: eyes. Unable to believe that she is beaten... by HIM.
text: He STARES HER DOWN. Holds eye contact, even as the ghosts
text: PLUNGE THEIR HANDS into her chest. One last look of hatred
dialog: from Rose --
text: AND THEN SHE STARTS TO CYCLE. Her skin becoming TRANSLUCENT,
text: we can see their GHOSTLY FINGERS INSIDE OF HER, PULLING AT
scene_heading: HER HEART, HER BLOOD --—
dialog: 131.
text: She THRASHES BENEATH THEM, HER SKULL SHINING THROUGH HER
text: SKIN, TWISTING INTO THE INHUMAN MONSTER SHE TRULY IS --
text: She SCREAMS ONE LAST TIME, as STEAM BEGINS TO POUR OUT OF HER
text: MOUTH AND NOSE. The ghosts INHALING IT HUNGRILY --
text: And then she BURSTS APART in a cloud of silver STEAM. The
text: steam is ABSORBED by the inhabitants of the OVERLOOK, who
dialog: greedily GULP IT IN --
text: SOME OF IT ABSORBED BY THE VERY CARPET, being digested by the
text: hotel itself -- And then, she is gone.
text: The ghosts’ gaunt faces EXPAND, their features BECOMING
text: RESTORED, the years of starvation DISAPPEARING as they
dialog: inherit all of her strength.
text: Dan tries to SIT UP as they turn their attention to him. They
scene_heading: ADVANCE, GRINNING THEIR DEAD SMILES --
scene_heading: Dan CLOSES HIS EYES, CONCENTRATING --
text: A FLASH OF THE LOCK BOXES, he wants to LOCK THEM AWAY AGAIN --
text: But they are ON HIM before he can do anything. He STRUGGLES
text: in their grip, and as a DEAD HAND closes over his mouth --
text: WE SEE HIS EYES ROLL BACK WHITE as the Overlook POURS ITSELF
text: INTO HIS MIND.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER
text: Abra looks up as the LIGHT FIXTURES SWELL with new ENERGY.
text: From somewhere deep in the hotel, THE SOUND OF MUSIC. Old
text: music, ECHOING THROUGH THE HALLS. She slowly walks, SCARED.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Uncle Dan?
text: Just the sound of music. She moves slowly, afraid, and turns
text: the corner to see -- TWO GIRLS, IN BLUE DRESSES. HOLDING
text: HANDS. STARING AT HER.
text: She STARES AT THEM. Terrified. The girls stare back, their
dialog: expressions BLANK...
text: As SOMEONE STEPS INTO THE HALL BEHIND ABRA. She turns at the
text: SHUFFLING SOUND of their entrance...
text: It’s DAN, head down. THE AXE IN HIS HANDS.
dialog: 132.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Uncle Dan! Is it done? Is she
dialog: dead...
text: As Abra approaches, he LOOKS UP AT HER. She STOPS COLD.
text: It’s Dan... BUT IT ISN'T. His eyes are DARK. FULL OF
text: VIOLENCE. The same expression his FATHER wore, those years
text: ago, when he TRIED TO KILL HIS FAMILY.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What’s wrong?
text: He stares at her... AND LIMPS FORWARD. CLUTCHING THE AXE.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Bad girl. Bad little pup...
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Uncle Dan...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You’re gonna take your medicine.
text: As he picks up speed, AXE AT THE READY. HE MEANS TO KILL HER.
text: She backs up, the realization hitting her -- THEN ABRA RUNS.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS
text: Abra turns the corner, moving fast. Around her, the music
text: LOUDER NOW, the lights FLICKERING. Behind her, Dan LIMPS
text: FRANTICALLY along, Axe in his hand.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Abra!
text: She runs faster, rounding the corner. Makes it down a
text: familiar hallway... looking over her shoulder. She’s ahead of
dialog: him, but he’1l turn the corner any second --
text: She sees an open door. RUNS INSIDE. As she closes the door
text: behind her, we tilt up to the room number... ROOM 217.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, ROOM 217 - CONTINUOUS
text: Abra slowly backs away from the door, into the familiar room.
text: The green walls are FADED, MOLDY. OLD.
text: Keeping quiet, she BACKS INTO THE ROOM. Waiting. She watches
text: as a SHADOW PASSES BY UNDER THE DOOR. Hears Dan’s LABORED
text: BREATHS as he looks for her.
dialog: 133.
speaker_heading: DAN (0.S.)
dialog: Abra!!!
text: After a few moments, he passes, and she listens to him
text: walking away.
text: Barely aware THAT SOMEONE IS IN THE BATHTUB IN THE OTHER
text: ROOM. Just over her shoulder.
text: The sound of WATER SLOSHING GENTLY turns her head. She turns
dialog: to see --
text: THE SILHOUETTE of a WOMAN, SITTING IN THE TUB. Her hand
text: slowly REACHING UP to pull the curtain back.
text: Abra watches as MRS. MASSEY peels back the curtain, GRINNING.
text: Abra STEELS herself against the vision. Holds her ground.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Try it.
text: Mrs. Massey STANDS UP. Abra stands, waiting as --
text: THE DOOR IS SUDDENLY KICKED OPEN.
text: She spins back toward it as DAN STEPS INTO THE ROOM. AXE IN
scene_heading: HAND. GRINNING AT HER.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: There you are. We have to talk,
dialog: Abra. You’ve been very, very bad.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: You’re not Uncle Dan.
text: He stops. Smiling at her.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: You're a mask. A false face.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Who else would I be?
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: You’re not him. You’re the hotel.
dialog: (beat)
text: But he’s still in there.
text: He smirks, and after a beat... lets the mask slip. The face
text: staring at her is Dan’s, but also something else. SOMETHING
scene_heading: DARK. SOMETHING OLD. SOMETHING THAT WANTS HER DEAD.
dialog: 134.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: Masks off, then. Anything else to
dialog: say? Are you sure you wouldn’t like
dialog: to run? A game of tag, perhaps? All
dialog: we have is time, you know. An
dialog: eternity of time. Or shall we end
dialog: it? Might as well. After all...
dialog: we're missing the party.
text: Abra SMILES at him.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Why are you smiling?
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Because you don’t know where you’re
dialog: standing.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I know these halls like my own
text: face, child.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I mean the body you're standing
dialog: in... the face you’re wearing.
dialog: That’s Dan Torrance, and you don’t
dialog: know him. You think he’s still a
dialog: little boy, and man oh man, are you
dialog: in for a surprise.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (laughs )
dialog: Dan Torrance. You mean the same Dan
dialog: Torrance who was just laying broken
dialog: at the foot of the stairs?
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I mean the Dan Torrance who made
dialog: one stop, as soon as he got here.
dialog: (beat)
text: To the boiler room.
text: Dan’s smile disappears. He didn’t know that... and we can see
text: the implication SCARES HIM. He LIFTS THE AXE, SWINGING IT
scene_heading: DOWN AT HER HEAD --
text: Abra HOLDS HER GROUND, DOESN’T EVEN FLINCH AS --
text: THE AXE STOPS. INCHES FROM HER HEAD.
text: Dan holds it, staring at her with a PERPLEXED EXPRESSION. AN
text: INTERNAL STRUGGLE HAPPENING before our eyes, his hands
text: SHAKING...
dialog: 135.
text: She reaches up, GENTLY RESTING HER HAND ON HIS, just above
text: the axe blade. And then, after a long beat... Dan CLOSES HIS
text: EYES. Breathes in... and when he opens them, we see the
text: difference. IT’S DAN AGAIN. THE REAL DAN.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: There you are.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: You were supposed to run.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I didn’t want to leave you...
text: Dan smiles, gently.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'm right where I’m supposed to be.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I knew you wouldn’t let it hurt me.
dialog: I could feel it.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Abra... I can’t hold it back much
dialog: longer though. You have to run.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: No. I’m not going anywhere without
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I'll be right behind you. Have to
dialog: close the door behind us, right?
text: She stares at him, not sure if she believes it. He nods,
dialog: reassuring. And finally...
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Run.
text: Abra turns, RUNNING FROM THE ROOM. Dan holds his ground, his
text: gentle smile fading as the HOTEL REGAINS CONTROL.
text: His face is slowly overtaken by PANIC. “Dan” turns, DROPPING
dialog: THE AXE as he RUNS --
dialog: 136.
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: -- into the boiler room. Heads to the boiler, looking at the
text: GAGES -- THE STEAM PRESSURE IS ALREADY IN THE RED. Panicked,
text: he reaches up to grab the handles...
text: BUT HIS HANDS STOP. Inches from the wheel. His face contorts
text: in confusion. DAN, inside, trying to STOP HIS HANDS from
dialog: relieving the pressure...
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: (struggling)
dialog: Are you out?
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
text: Abra RUNS toward the door.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Almost...
scene_heading: INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL, BOILER ROOM —- CONTINUOUS
text: Dan’s hands SHAKE over the boiler. His face contorted with
text: RAGE and anger...
text: With great effort, Dan manages to STEP BACK, AWAY FROM THE
text: BOILER. LOWERING HIS HANDS. Sitting back, WATCHING THE BOILER
speaker_heading: OVERLOAD.
text: FLAMES ERUPT FROM THE PIPES.
text: He sighs, knowing it’s over... the fire can’t be stopped now.
text: He stands and watches, even as the flames SPREAD TOWARD HIM.
text: As they reach him, Dan CLOSES HIS EYES, EXHAUSTED BUT
text: VICTORIOUS. In the firelight, we see his weary SMILE as the
text: FIRE REACHES HIM.
scene_heading: EXT. OVERLOOK HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
text: Abra stands in the snow, watching as FLAMES begin to erupt
text: from the hotel. She stares, helpless as they SPREAD.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Come on Uncle Dan, get out of
dialog: there...
text: The FIRE SPREADS FAST... the old, rotten wood and plaster of
text: the hotel CATCHING QUICKLY. The flames BUILDING AND BUILDING
text: as the snow falls around her.
dialog: 137.
speaker_heading: ABRA (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on.
text: On the mountain pass, in the distance, she sees SIRENS from
text: the APPROACHING POLICE CARS. Her mother brought the cavalry.
text: She turns, looking as the FLAMES ENGULF THE HOTEL... GLOWING
text: IN THE SNOW. The fire so large now, bursting through windows.
text: Abra waits, and waits. A TEAR rolling down her cheek.
text: Desperate for him to be safe. For it to be over. She waits...
dialog: and waits...
text: As the police cars reach the top of the pass.
speaker_heading: ABRA (V.O.)
text: The fire spread fast. Destroying
text: the hotel... purifying it.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ABRA'S HOUSE, ABRA'S ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT, WEEKS LATER
text: Abra sits on the foot of her bed.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: Burning so bright I was warm, even
text: in the snow. I could almost hear it
text: screaming. I could hear it dying.
dialog: And I knew, somewhere deep
dialog: inside... I knew you were okay.
text: REVEAL DAN. Leaning against the wall. Smiling at her.
speaker_heading: DAN
dialog: I’m sorry I put you in danger. It
dialog: was the only way.
speaker_heading: ABRA
dialog: I know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you think she was right? When
dialog: she said she wasn’t the last one.
dialog: Do you think there are more,
dialog: somewhere out there?
text: Dan considers this, moving toward the window. Looking out the
text: mountains in the moonlight.
speaker_heading: DAN
text: The world is a hungry place. A dark
dialog: place.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 138.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: And maybe there’s more of them, or
dialog: things like them, or worse. But
dialog: there are more people like you too.
dialog: People who stand.
text: She smiles at him. He looks out at the mountain. The snow at
text: the peak, against the night sky.
speaker_heading: DAN (CONT'D)
dialog: You know what Rene Daumal said
dialog: about mountains? “What is above
dialog: knows what is below, but what is
dialog: below does not know what is above.
text: One climbs, one sees. One descends,
dialog: one sees no longer... but one has
