dialog: QUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.
text: The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.
dialog: CAPTAIN : Yes, sir?
dialog: QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.
dialog: CAPTAIN : Yes, sir.
text: The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade
text: viceroy, waits for a reply.
dialog: CAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the
dialog: Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
dialog: NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly
dialog: legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.

text: The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.
text: Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.
dialog: TC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

text: formal conference room by TC-14.
dialog: TC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master
dialog: will be with you shortly.
text: The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the
text: door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window
text: at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white
text: hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is
text: twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several
text: exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.
dialog: OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
dialog: QUI-GON : I don't sense anything.
dialog: OBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's
text: somethging...elsewhere...elusive.
dialog: QUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration
dialog: here and now where it belongs.
dialog: OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
dialog: QUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
dialog: living Force, my young Padawan.
dialog: OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
dialog: the chancellor's demands?
dialog: QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be

scene_heading: INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY
text: A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference
dialog: room hallway.
dialog: NUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.
text: The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the
text: door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their
text: weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the
text: tray of drinks.
dialog: TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.
text: The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords
text: fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they
dialog: can fire.
scene_heading: INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE
text: The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the
text: viewscreen.
dialog: OWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...
text: OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried
dialog: look.
dialog: NUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?
dialog: RUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
dialog: NUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.
dialog: RUNE : That won't be enough, sir.
text: The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.
dialog: NUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
dialog: RUNE : We will not survive this.
scene_heading: INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE
text: QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and
text: metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS
text: crashing into the wall.
text: QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.
scene_heading: INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE
text: The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
text: QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.
dialog: NUTE : Close the blast doors!!!
text: The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then
text: a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs
text: the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the
text: center of the blast door.
dialog: RUNE : ...They're still coming through!
text: On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.
dialog: NUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!
dialog: RUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!
scene_heading: INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE
text: Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just
text: before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their
text: battle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.
dialog: QUI-GON : Destroyer droids!
dialog: OBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.
text: The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,
text: blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a
text: semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be
dialog: seen.
dialog: P-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!
text: The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the
text: doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with
dialog: their laser swords.
dialog: OBI-WAN : They have shield generators!
dialog: QUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!
scene_heading: INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE
text: NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL
text: DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.
dialog: RUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer
dialog: droids.
text: TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.
scene_heading: INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY
text: QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are
text: careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing
dialog: craft.
dialog: QUI-GON : Battle droids.
dialog: OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.
dialog: QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the
dialog: Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate

scene_heading: COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.
dialog: NUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is
dialog: pleased.
dialog: AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,
dialog: Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.
text: NUTE smirks at RUNE.
dialog: NUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.
dialog: AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of
dialog: yours.
dialog: NUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
dialog: AMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's
dialog: Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a
dialog: settlement.
dialog: NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.
text: AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.
dialog: AMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
dialog: NUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of
dialog: the Senate. You assume too much.
dialog: AMIDALA : We will see.
text: The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.
dialog: RUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....
dialog: NUTE : It's too late now.

text: AMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?
text: CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT
dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...
dialog: BIBBLE : A malfunction?
dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
dialog: BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
dialog: AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not
dialog: dare go that far.
dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be
dialog: finished.
dialog: AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
dialog: BIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the
dialog: Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend
dialog: ourselves.
dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security

scene_heading: EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT
text: QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the

text: An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has
text: retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue
text: snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
text: JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the
text: wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a
text: charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam
text: shell in one hand.
dialog: JAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!
text: JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is
text: caught by surprise.
dialog: JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!
dialog: QUI-GON : Let go!
text: The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.
text: Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes
text: splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.
text: QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the
text: war machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.
dialog: JAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!
text: The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.
dialog: QUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!

dialog: OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.
text: OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR

dialog: JAR JAR : Wesa dude it!
scene_heading: EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY
text: Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD
text: RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.
text: The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast
text: moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.
text: QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.
dialog: JAR JAR : Wesa safe now.
dialog: QUI-GON : Get this thing started.
dialog: JAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN : What is it?
text: JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a
text: huge waterfall.
dialog: JAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!
text: OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly
text: begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the
text: waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop
text: drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In
text: the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs
text: and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.
dialog: JAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!
text: QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the
text: shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs
text: precariously over the edge of the waterfall.
dialog: QUI-GON : Come on...
text: OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON
text: starts in after him.
dialog: QUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.
dialog: JAR JAR : No! Too scary!
dialog: OBI-WAN : Get up here!
dialog: JAR JAR : No a mighty no!
text: JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.
dialog: JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!

text: pull QUI-GON out of the water.
speaker_heading: OBI-WAN : That was close.
scene_heading: BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!
text: The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.
text: JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.
dialog: BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons
text: QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut
text: down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks
text: lose, crashing down the waterfall.
text: The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.

dialog: BIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
dialog: NUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will
dialog: legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by
dialog: the Senate.
dialog: AMIDALA : I will not co-operate.
dialog: NUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in
dialog: store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see

text: CAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.
dialog: QUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the
dialog: circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
dialog: AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
dialog: QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.
dialog: BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.
dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of
dialog: theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
dialog: QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else
dialog: behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move
dialog: here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
dialog: BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate
dialog: to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.
dialog: Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
dialog: BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have
dialog: to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you
dialog: must leave...
text: The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.
dialog: AMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
dialog: PADME : We are brave, Your Highness.

dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??
dialog: OBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.
dialog: CAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are

dialog: QUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system

dialog: JIRA : The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
dialog: ANAKIN : Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
dialog: It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I
dialog: promise.
dialog: JIRA : You're a fine boy, Annie.
dialog: ANAKIN : I'll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You'll like these...
text: ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one.
text: QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.
dialog: ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not

text: The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA
dialog: gives them their pallies.
dialog: JIRA : Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd
dialog: better get home quick.
dialog: ANAKIN : (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
dialog: QUI-GON : We'll hed back to our ship.
dialog: ANAKIN : Is it far?
text: PADME : On the outskirts.
dialog: ANAKIN : You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very,

dialog: ANAKIN : These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know
dialog: any of your names.
text: QUI-GON : I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a

dialog: ANAKIN : I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
dialog: SHMI : Anakin! Why are they here?
dialog: ANAKIN : A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.

speaker_heading: SHMI.
dialog: QUI-GON : I have enough food for a meal.
dialog: SHMI : Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll

dialog: a secret.
dialog: SHMI : Yes, I know.
scene_heading: INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY
text: ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one

dialog: ANAKIN : Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
dialog: PADME : He's wonderful!
dialog: ANAKIN : You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!
text: ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs
text: an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.
dialog: THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How
dialog: might I serve you?
dialog: PADME : He's perfect.
dialog: ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a

dialog: DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will

scene_heading: INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY
text: QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift

text: JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a
text: little brighter red.
text: SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
dialog: ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no
dialog: luck.
dialog: SHMI : Any attempt to escape...
dialog: ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!
text: PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.
dialog: JAR JAR : How wude.
dialog: PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
dialog: Republic's anti-slavery laws...
dialog: SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.
text: An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.
dialog: ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?
text: PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches
text: some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.
text: QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.
text: QUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
dialog: ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.
text: SHMI looks askance at her son.
dialog: ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's
dialog: never heard of a human doing it.
dialog: QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.
text: ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl
text: with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and
text: forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.
dialog: QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.
text: JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of
text: the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.
dialog: ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...
speaker_heading: QUI-GON : What?
dialog: ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
dialog: QUI-GON : What makes you think that?
dialog: ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.
text: QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.
dialog: QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
dialog: ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
dialog: QUI-GON : I wish that were so...
dialog: ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the
dialog: slaves...have you come to free us?
dialog: QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...
dialog: ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?
text: QUI-GON thinks for a moment.
dialog: QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't
dialog: let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central
dialog: system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept
dialog: secret.
dialog: ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
dialog: PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair
dialog: it.
dialog: ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!
dialog: QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we
dialog: need...
dialog: JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
dialog: PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
dialog: SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful
dialog: races.
dialog: QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used
dialog: properly.
dialog: ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
dialog: tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
dialog: SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
dialog: ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
dialog: think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.
text: QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.
dialog: SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto
dialog: makes you do it.
dialog: ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The
dialog: prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina
dialog: pitty bad goo.
dialog: GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who
dialog: might be able to help us?
text: SHMI shakes her head no.
dialog: ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in
dialog: the universe is no one helps each other...
dialog: SHMI : Anakin, don't...
text: JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.
dialog: PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will
dialog: find another way...
dialog: SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but
dialog: he can help you...he was meant to help you.

dialog: QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.
text: QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and
text: a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of
text: WATTO. He studies it.
dialog: WATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
dialog: QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.
dialog: WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last
dialog: race. It will take some time to fix it.
text: ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.
dialog: ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his
dialog: vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
dialog: WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
dialog: QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever
dialog: built."
dialog: WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you
dialog: supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings
dialog: fifty-fifty, I think.
dialog: QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you
dialog: front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus
dialog: the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.
text: WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

dialog: reward.
dialog: SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...
dialog: QUI-GON : He has special powers.
dialog: SHMI : Yes...
dialog: QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to
dialog: have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
dialog: SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.
dialog: QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who
dialog: was his father?
dialog: SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him
dialog: birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
dialog: QUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have
dialog: identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the

dialog: WATTO : A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the
dialog: mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.

text: ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.
text: One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him
text: on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side

text: vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the
text: alien's engine.
text: The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly
text: veers away.
text: ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a
text: dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.
text: One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the
dialog: whole thing EXPLODES.
scene_heading: EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

text: The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in
text: Anakin's defeat.
text: The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
text: DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all

dialog: A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)

dialog: What gooie-on?
text: FANTA : Bug off.
text: Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands

dialog: A : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)
text: ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is
dialog: unbearable.
text: ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of
text: the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out
text: the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,
text: then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.
speaker_heading: FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
dialog: A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for
dialog: some attention.)
dialog: ODY : Droids!
text: TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off
text: his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,
text: and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod
dialog: to his engines.
text: ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.
text: As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.
text: Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.
text: SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer
text: crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of
text: dust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the
text: cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.
speaker_heading: FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
text: B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely
text: followed by Skywalker...
text: ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the
text: rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes
text: through the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third
text: and last lap. WATTO begins to worry.
text: SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.
text: ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off
dialog: course.
speaker_heading: FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
text: B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!
dialog: A : Oh noah!
text: On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.
speaker_heading: FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
dialog: B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!
text: SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and
text: pushing him through the turns.
text: SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time
text: keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake
text: loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is
text: trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.
text: ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,
text: SEBULBA is able to block.
text: Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries
text: to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final
text: stretch of the track.
speaker_heading: FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
dialog: B : He's catching Sebulba.
dialog: A : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)
text: SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN
text: over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering
text: rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.
speaker_heading: FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)
dialog: B : That little human being is out of his mind.
dialog: A : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)
dialog: B : They're side by side!
dialog: A : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)
text: As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering
text: rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is
text: tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts
dialog: spinning.
text: The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine
text: EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,
text: but unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws
text: what's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
text: are on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the
text: EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down
text: with excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle
text: hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line,
dialog: the winner.

dialog: you knew it! I lost everything.
text: WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI-GON's.
text: QUI-GON simply smiles.
dialog: QUI-GON : Whenever you gamble, my freind, eventually you'll lose. Bring the
dialog: parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release

dialog: WATTO : You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!

dialog: the ship.
text: The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES.

dialog: QUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about
dialog: gambling.
dialog: SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns
dialog: to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
dialog: QUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.
dialog: You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.
dialog: ANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your
dialog: starship and everything?!
text: QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.
dialog: QUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And
dialog: if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
dialog: ANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,
dialog: Mom?!
dialog: QUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it
dialog: is yours alone.
text: ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.
dialog: ANAKIN : I want to go.
dialog: QUI-GON : Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
dialog: ANAKIN : Yipee!!
text: ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and

dialog: ANAKIN : (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't
dialog: you, Mom
dialog: QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.

text: AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
dialog: PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real
text: power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A
text: manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
dialog: AMIDALA : What options do we have?
dialog: PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
text: Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces
dialog: the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence
dialog: in Chancellor Valorum.
dialog: AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
dialog: PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
dialog: courts...
dialog: AMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide
dialog: things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each
dialog: day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.

dialog: YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
dialog: MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
dialog: YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we

dialog: by the midi-chlorians.
dialog: MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring

text: A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with

dialog: LOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
dialog: VALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade
dialog: Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

dialog: PALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on

text: Valorum's strength will dissapear.
dialog: VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen
dialog: Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to
dialog: explore the validity of your accusations?
text: QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.
dialog: AMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve
dialog: this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people
dialog: suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body
dialog: is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a
dialog: "vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
dialog: VALORUM : What?...No!

dialog: QUI-GON : No??!!
text: OBI-WAN smiles.
text: MACE WINDU : He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
dialog: QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...you must see it.
text: YODA : Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
dialog: QUI-GON : I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.
text: OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.
dialog: YODA : An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
dialog: MACE WINDU : We forbid it.
dialog: QUI-GON : Obi-Wan is ready...
dialog: OBI-WAN : Iam ready to face the trials.
dialog: YODA : Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?
text: ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.
dialog: QUI-GON : Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force,
dialog: but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn from me.
dialog: YODA : Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he
dialog: has...
dialog: MACE WINDU : Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new
text: Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure
dialog: on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
dialog: YODA : And draw out the Queen's attacker.
dialog: KI-ADI : Events are moving fast...too fast.
dialog: MACE WINDU : Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the
dialog: dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.
text: YODA : Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
dialog: QUI-GON : I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere
dialog: else to go.
dialog: MACE WINDU : He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
dialog: YODA : Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
dialog: MACE WINDU : Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war

dialog: OBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
dialog: QUI-GON : From your point of view....
dialog: OBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it. Why can't you?
dialog: QUI-GON : His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will decide
dialog: Anakin's future...that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
text: OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON
text: goes over to ANAKIN.
dialog: ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
dialog: QUI-GON : You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
dialog: you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines
dialog: your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
dialog: ANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
text: QUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all
text: living cells and communicates with the Force.
dialog: ANAKIN : They live inside of me?
dialog: QUI-GON : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
dialog: ANAKIN : Symbionts?
dialog: QUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the
dialog: midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the
dialog: Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
dialog: ANAKIN : They do??
dialog: QUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to
dialog: you.
dialog: ANAKIN : I don't understand.
dialog: QUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.

dialog: stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
text: PADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away
dialog: from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the

dialog: the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication
dialog: and their droids will be helpless.
dialog: QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons
dialog: on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
dialog: OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your
