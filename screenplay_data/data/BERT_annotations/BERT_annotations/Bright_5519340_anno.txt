scene_heading: INT. WARD'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: SCOTT WARD can’t sleep. He scowls in defiance at the golden
text: midday sun scorching through the blinds. Plain but handsome,
dialog: with an ‘I’m in charge here’ buzzcut. A thoughtful man, but
text: no genius, he’s stymied by the daylight. We note the ANGRY
text: BRUISING on his 200-pushups-a-day chest.
text: Ward tries to fall back asleep. No dice. He shifts his
text: weight and peels his Glock off his sweaty back. Sighs and
text: starts counting the cracks in his bedroom ceiling...
speaker_heading: SMASH TO:
scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - WARD'S FLASHBACK -—- DAY
text: A GANGBANGER in a black hoodie bursts out the door with a
text: shotgun! WARD stands there in LAPD uniform. Reaches for his
text: holster -- Breaks leather. Steps into a textbook shooting
text: stance. Muzzle coming on target. Too Late...
text: The GANGBANGER spins aims fires -- KABOOM!
scene_heading: INT. WARD'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
text: Ward gasps awake. His fingertips skim the ugly green and
text: purple bruises on his chest. I’m still alive...
scene_heading: INT. WARD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Ward shuffles into the kitchen -- Sees SHERRI, his age,
text: inspecting dishes in the sink, looking for the easiest one to
text: wash. Pretty in a champagne room kind of way. She has an
dialog: air of entitlement, things should’ve been easier for her.
text: The tension between them is palpable. Ward grabs a huge box
text: of Cheerios, fills a plastic bowl. Without looking up:
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: There’s a fairy in the bird feeder
dialog: again.
text: Ward sighs. Gets the milk from the fridge. Smells it.
dialog: Expired. Pours it anyway.
speaker_heading: SHERRI (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s the same fuckin’ one, too.
dialog: Isn't it? Cause you didn’t kill it
dialog: last time.
text: Ward steels himself as he tamps cornflakes into sour milk.
dialog: He's been over her shit for a long time -- His tone
text: immediately counters her aggression, mellow, even...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I thought you were out looking for
dialog: a job.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: Oh. Right. Of course. Of course
dialog: you'd bring that up.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Yesterday you indicated you would
dialog: be actively looking for employment.
dialog: We had a plan, a timeline. And I’m
dialog: concerned-—
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: --Don’t. Don’t do that.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: Your Zen cop ‘I'm talking to a
dialog: crazy person’ voice you do.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: .--I'm trying to not escalate...
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: For your information, I had an
dialog: interview this morning.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Okay. That’s good.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: I don’t need you to tell me it’s
dialog: good. I won’t fuckin’ get it.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: Because I can tell. Okay? The
dialog: woman was a snotty bitch.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Keep at it. Your next interviewer
dialog: might be a man. You can shake your
text: six thousand dollar bolt-on-tits at
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: SHERRI
dialog: Way to de-escalate asshole. We all
dialog: know I can make more money than
dialog: your broke ass ever will dancing.
dialog: So fuck you. Sophie’s staying at
dialog: mom’s tonight. You gotta give her
dialog: a ride. And get the fuckin’ fairy.
dialog: Kill it this time. Pussy.
text: She grabs her keys and charges out of there.
scene_heading: EXT. WARD’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY
text: Ward peers through the bars of his shitty Craftsman in South
text: Central LA. Gangster THUMP emanates from the house next
text: door. Two Low Riders on the lawn, cabled together. HOMIES
text: solemnly gathered around open hoods.
text: Ward slides the Glock in his pocket. Grabs a broom. Steps
text: out into the sunlight -- His neighbor MIGUEL clocks him.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Good afternoon officer. We didn’t
dialog: wake you up?
text: He salutes. Ward salutes back, on a mission, not slowing
dialog: down...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: No, never. Because bass doesn’t
dialog: carry at all. You know that’s bad
text: for the grass. The cars.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Grass grows back. How’s your old
dialog: lady?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Save up your lunch money and ask
dialog: her yourself.
text: The Homies sense his venom and wince -- Damnnnn.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Yo, that fairy in your bird
dialog: feeder’s been up in my pad eating
dialog: my dog food. I’m a call the city.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I am the city. Motherfucker’s
text: about to go to Fairy Heaven.
text: Ward approaches the bird feeder slowly. A dead pigeon lays
text: beneath it -- Badly burnt. Ward stops and thinks. He
dialog: doesn’t need this shit. Raises the broom...
text: The Homies look on, expectant, as they slowly back up...
text: Ward gently pokes the bird feeder. Nothing.
text: THEN: The FAIRY bursts out SCREECHING at him! A sparrow-
text: sized hybrid of lemur and insect. It HISSES like vermin...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Aw shit. Ring the bell. It’s on.
text: Ward jabs it with the broom -- It flings a handful of sparks
dialog: at him!
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Ah! Fuck!
text: The Homies erupt into laughter. Ward ignores them, locked
text: onto his enemy. He fakes left, spins, swats it against the
text: house with a thud -- The Fairy drops to the ground, HISSING,
text: helpless, injured...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: That's it right there. LAPD style.
dialog: Now watch him finish off the little
dialog: homie.
text: Ward advancing slowly, clearly pitying the fairy -- It throws
text: sparks again -- Ward looks away and brings down the broom
text: with finality -- He's sprayed with purple blood.
text: This gets the expected eruption from the onlookers...
scene_heading: INT. WARD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: Ward returns and regards his forgotten bowl of soggy cereal.
text: His mind tumbles, something washes over his face. He's
dialog: suddenly somewhere else...
scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - WARD'S FLASHBACK - DAY
text: Ward is on his back next to the front tire of his black and
text: white. He’s stunned. The buckshot in his vest smoking. The
text: Gangbanger steps around the corner of the vehicle. Presses
text: the shotgun to Ward’s forehead -- His eyes locked onto the
dialog: face of holy motherfucking death itself. A face we don’t get
dialog: to_see yet...
text: CLICK. The shotgun is jammed. The Gangbanger takes off
text: running. ECU WARD -- Gritting his teeth in rage...
scene_heading: INT. WARD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
text: He shakes his head, wiping his face...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (0.S.)
dialog: Daddy!
scene_heading: INT. WARD'S HOUSE - SOPHIA’S BEDROOM - DAY
text: Ward's little daughter SOPHIA tries to cram a mound of
text: stuffed animals into her backpack. Ward sits on her bed,
text: eating a banana.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: They don’t fit.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: So just take a couple. You’re only
dialog: going to Grandma’s for one night.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: If I only take two the rest will
dialog: miss them.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You're very considerate. But what
dialog: about like clothes and toothbrushes
dialog: and socks and stuff?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Daddy I’m only going for one night.
text: Ward laughs. Then...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Are you in trouble?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Am I in trouble? Did mom say
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Mom said you and Nick are in
dialog: trouble because Nick did something
dialog: dumb.
dialog: Ward makes a mental note -- Total information lockdown time
text: with Sherry. Before he can craft a response...
speaker_heading: SOPHIA (CONT'D)
dialog: Kayla at school says orcs do dumb
dialog: stuff because they’re not as smart
dialog: as people. Did Nick get you in
dialog: trouble? I don’t want you be in
dialog: trouble.
text: Ward speaks carefully.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Orcs aren’t dumb. Okay? All the
dialog: races are different than us. And
dialog: being different doesn’t make them
dialog: smarter or dumber. They’re just
dialog: like us. Okay? Everyone just
dialog: wants to get along and be happy.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Can elves really talk to dragons?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Not unless they go to the zoo.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Kayla says--
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: --you gotta stop listening to
text: Kayla. Kayla sounds like trouble.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: No, Kayla never gets in trouble.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Not yet. Being so judgemental
dialog: won't do Kayla any favors in life.
dialog: Look. Don’t let anyone tell you
dialog: what to think. Treat everyone nice
dialog: and they'll treat you nice.
text: Suddenly a crash outside -- KATHUNK! -- Ward reacts, quickly
dialog: gets up...
scene_heading: EXT. WARD’S HOUSE - DAY
text: Ward exits and sees an LAPD Black and White on his lawn.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Aw come on. What the actual fuck?
text: NICK JAKOBY, early 30s, exits from the driver’s side with a
dialog: grin -- By the way -- JAKOBY'S AN ORC...
dialog: Like most
text: ores, he’s bald with green skin, orange eyes and
text: slightly animalistic facial features. He’s friendly and easy
text: going, but right now he’s gently on the defensive.
dialog: From next
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What? They put new shocks in. I
dialog: was testing them on your curb.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: On my curb? That makes no sense.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Your driveway’s full?
dialog: door...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Hey officer, that’s bad for the
dialog: grass.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Yes. Thank you. It grows back.
dialog: (to Jakoby)
dialog: Why are you here in our car?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I had that diversity training thing
dialog: up at Elysian. Thought you were
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I did it. You can’t run errands in
text: a city car.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Your house is on the way to the
dialog: barn. Hop in. Let’s go to work.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Hi Nick!
text: Sophia exits with a big smile for Jakoby...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Hey Sophia, what’s up rockstar?
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: We're packing for grandma’s.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: That’s cool.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Will you shut up, bro? I don’t
dialog: want you catching days over a
dialog: stupid mileage beef.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: Don’t tell Nick to shut up, he’s a
dialog: person too!
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
text: Enlightened kid there, Scott.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: Jakoby drives. Sophia in back listening to headphones. Ward
text: quietly seethes...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: This is stupid. I’m in soft
dialog: clothes with my kid in the car. If
dialog: we get popped.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Right. Because maybe Internal
dialog: Affairs is running integrity stings
dialog: on vehicle mileage this week.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You suck at sarcasm. You’re
dialog: supposed to use a sarcastic tone
dialog: when you're being sarcastic.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I put what, five extras miles on
dialog: the car? A buck of gas. That’s a
dialog: criminal violation. Bro we gotta
dialog: deny everything. Delete Facebook
dialog: and lawyer up.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Exactly like that. A sarcastic
dialog: tone.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Dude. Is it your man-period? Did
dialog: you sleep?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: No. Yes. Sort of. I keep seeing
dialog: that asshole who blasted me.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You gotta try melatonin. I gotta
dialog: bottle in my warbag I'll flip you.
dialog: Pop one an hour before bed and stay
text: off the laptop. The screen fucks
dialog: up your circadian rhythm.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Yeah, okay mom.
text: A beat of silence. What Ward really wants to talk about
text: bubbles agonizingly to the surface.
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Nick, did you let that asshole go?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Yeah I let him go. Because that’s
dialog: what I do. Dude’s who shoot my
dialog: partner get a pass.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: It’s me and you brother. Just me
dialog: and you talking.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: It’s fucked up you’d ask me that.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I saw his face, okay? He was an
dialog: orc. He was clan-blood.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I don’t give a shit about clan-
dialog: blood. I don’t. You’ve never came
dialog: at me racial. Not once. You think
dialog: I'd kick the dude who shot you
dialog: loose because he’s green? Scott?
text: Ward sighs checks his texts. Then...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I know you didn’t. But the guys on
dialog: our Watch are talking mad shit. So
dialog: it’s out there. Just know it’s out
dialog: there.
dialog: (then)
dialog: If you came out on front street
dialog: about it I totally wouldn’t care.
text: Jakoby looks at Ward, with that intense open honesty he has.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You would. Scott, you would.

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Honey. I’m not going to die. I
dialog: promise. Go with Grandma.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: But mommy said Nick is going to get
dialog: you killed.
text: Ward can barely contain his anger.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Mommy's kidding. She says silly
dialog: things sometime.
speaker_heading: SOPHIA
dialog: I don’t want you to be dead. I
dialog: hate you being a policeman.
dialog: Everybody hates policemen!
text: Sophia twists away. Runs crying towards the house. Ward
text: absorbs the blow for a moment. When he returns to the car,
dialog: Jakoby is gentle with this...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Remind me, partner, why Sherri’s
dialog: not watching her tonight?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: She’s got a date.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Bro. Why are you still letting her
dialog: live with you?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You know why.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Sophia’s not your daughter.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Funny. Cause it sure fucking feels
dialog: like she is, Nick.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I’m sorry. You know what I mean.
dialog: I don’t know how to be on your side

speaker_heading: MONTEHUGH
dialog: It’s, um, rustic here. I’m sure
dialog: the inhabitants of this outpost
dialog: have priceless knowledge to aid us

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Real quick, eh. Gang Intel guys
dialog: are sayin’ Fogteeth activity’s off
dialog: the chain. And Altamira’s

speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN
dialog: The army of 9 races fought shoulder

speaker_heading: WARD

text: The Man bores into Ward's eyes with his. Low and quiet:
speaker_heading: HOMELESS MAN

text: Ward looks at him entranced. Snaps out of it. Looks at
dialog: Jakoby -- Who's feeling the creepiness too...
scene_heading: INT. LAPD STATION - PARKING GARAGE - DAY
text: Ward hoses the vomit out of the back. Captain Perez and two
scene_heading: scary Internal Affairs Detectives -- ARKASHIAN and YAMAHARA
text: approach. All duly grim...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PEREZ
dialog: Where’s Jakoby?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Booking our body, sir.
text: The IA Detectives get in Ward's space. Eye him head to toe.
text: Pure intimidation. Perez looks around. Leans on the car.
dialog: He can be pretty scary himself. Quietly:
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PEREZ
dialog: The Department’s always been
text: cutting edge. First radio cars.
text: Helicopters. SWAT team. First to
dialog: hire Orcs. We’re committed to
dialog: diversity. As is Sacramento and
dialog: Washington. But the politicians
dialog: haven't worked the ghetto. They’re
dialog: not boots on the ground like we
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Where’s this going, sir?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PEREZ
dialog: The Orc who shot you is on the
dialog: street because of Jakoby.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Respectfully I disagree. Jakoby
dialog: did no wrong.
speaker_heading: ARKASHIAN
dialog: Do Orcs have mad hops? How many
dialog: Ores are ballers?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: YAMAHARA
dialog: You fucking heard the Detective.
dialog: How many Orcs play pro basketball?
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: ARKASHIAN
dialog: None. They’re slow. They’re
dialog: heavy. That’s why half the NFL
dialog: linebackers are Orcish. It’s
dialog: simple physics.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I’m sorry. Who are you?
speaker_heading: ARKASHIAN
dialog: Fuck you. That’s who we are.
speaker_heading: YAMAHARA
dialog: Okay, let’s review kids.
scene_heading: EXT. LIQUOR STORE - WARD'S FLASHBACK - DAY
text: Resuming the backstory here -- Ward, flat on his back, stares
text: into the angry orange eyes of the Orc Gangbanger -- CLICK!
text: The Orc tosses the jammed shotgun and runs into a crowded
text: SWAP MEET. Jakoby takes off after him...
speaker_heading: YAMAHARA (V.O.)
dialog: You respond to a silent ringer and
dialog: some Orc lays you out with
text: buckshot. Jakoby foot pursues and
text: corners shithead in a dead end
text: alley. Then it gets mysterious.
text: IN THE DEAD END ALLEY -- The Gangbanger charges. Knocks
text: Jakoby down. His Glock SKITTERS across piss-soaked
dialog: asphalt...
speaker_heading: ARKASHIAN (V.O.)
dialog: Jakoby stated dude tackles him.
text: Disarms him. Jumps up, grabs a
text: fire escape ladder. Evades arrest.
text: ON THE FIRE ESCAPE -- Gangbanger kicks in a window, dives in.
scene_heading: INT. LAPD STATION - PARKING GARAGE - DAY
text: Arkashian and Yamahara glaring at Ward...
speaker_heading: ARKASHIAN
dialog: Jakoby’s on record saying this.
text: Signed, sealed, witnessed.
speaker_heading: YAMAHARA
text: Ladder’s thirteen feet off the
dialog: ground. Thirteen. We measured it.
text: No Orc has a six foot vertical.
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Suspect was light on his feet, sir.
speaker_heading: ARKASHIAN
dialog: Your boy kicked loose the green
dialog: fuck who blasted you. Do the math.
dialog: Ward doing the math...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PEREZ
dialog: Jakoby was a social experiment
text: mandated by outsiders. Clan Blood
dialog: isn’t compatible with law
dialog: enforcement. Problem is we can’t
dialog: fire him without cause.
speaker_heading: YAMAHARA
dialog: You're going to tie the noose that
dialog: hangs him. Get him to admit it.
dialog: Record him on this.
text: Yamahara proffers a small digital recorder...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: This guy’s my brother. He’s the
dialog: best street cop I’ve worked with.
dialog: I can’t fuck him like that.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN PEREZ
dialog: Then you're fired. I want your
text: badge, gun and ID.
dialog: Ward REACTS...
speaker_heading: ARKASHIAN
dialog: You got a house in the hood you
dialog: can’t sell. Student loans up the
text: ass. Shacked up with a stripper
dialog: and her kid. Have fun looking for
text: work as a disgraced ex-cop.
text: Ward stares at the recorder. At his antagonists. If looks
dialog: could kill they'd all be dead...
scene_heading: EXT./INT. SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: Ward driving. Tense. He's palming the recorder.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Hey partner?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What’s up buddy?
dialog: 22.
text: Jakoby looks up from the logbook -- With that open, honest
text: energy he has. Ward is pole axed. He can't betray him.
text: Surreptitiously tosses the recorder out his window.
speaker_heading: WARD

scene_heading: EXT./INT. SOUTH LA - DEAD END STREET/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Spotter. There.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Hiii buddy. How old do you think
dialog: he is, fifteen?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: If that. This is it on the right.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY
text: They pull up to the house. It’s a 2 storey death trap. The

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: They should fire their landscaper.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: (into mic)

speaker_heading: JAKOBY

speaker_heading: WARD
text: Altamira jumps ‘em in at twelve.

text: Crossing to the house...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Sucks. Even Orc clans wait till

text: blooded.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Different strokes.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I don’t see it, man. Must be a
dialog: California thing.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: That’s so you. That’s your

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I don’t have a catchphrase.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Anything you don’t agree with, it’s
dialog: always like “must be a California

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Partner!
scene_heading: KABOOM! -- SHOTGUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW!
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Fuck me! Holy shit!

speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: JAKOBY

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Holy fuck! Holy shit!
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Okay. Be cool. On three we’re

scene_heading: BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM-BAM! -- Jakoby sprays. Ward

text: Breathing hard.
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: No holes. I’m good. You okay?
text: Ward's fine. They trade nods. Pop up again and SEE...
text: An arm hangs from the window. Blood drips off fingertips.
text: They got him. Now they hear a CHILD CRYING inside the house.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: There's a kid in there.
text: Ward doesn’t hesitate. Breaks cover, running...

speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait for the cavalry. Scott?

scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - DAY

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Police Officers! Stay where you
dialog: are, we'll find you!
text: No reponse. Ward and Jakoby ease further in.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I smell blood.
text: They ease forward. Tactical. Careful. Through a gloomy
text: darkness of ratty furniture and exposed walls...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Body.
text: Legs poke from a door frame leading into the kitchen. The
dialog: partners advance and REACT...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Wh...oh shit. What is that? What
dialog: is that bro?
text: The entire top half of the dead man has been BLASTED INTO
text: ASH, he's a blackened, charred, skeleton from the waist up.
text: A massive scorch mark on the wall...
text: Ward stares, blinking, trying to snap himself out of shock.
text: Jakoby isn’t doing as well.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Look. Shit dude, look.
text: Ward turns, SEES a hole blown in the wall, into the back
text: yard. Like a bomb went off...
text: An ORC dead in the yard, half of him turned to stone, his
text: other half gruesomely dead, a pistol next to him. Another
text: dead man, blown in half, is in the kitchen. The two cops
text: stare in awe.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Where’s the troops? Where is
dialog: everyone.
text: Then ... a noise. Both men startle. Then push further into
dialog: the dark house...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Door.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Got it.
text: Jakoby gently pushes the cracked door, it drifts open...
scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - SHOOTER’S ROOM - DAY
text: The SHOOTER is slumped against the window, breathing shallow,
text: shotgun on the floor. Bloody. His eyes follow the cops...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Do not move. Do not move.
text: Ward advances, kicks the gun away, eyes his wounds.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Is he staying or going dude?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Hey can you hear me? Can you hear

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Yeah, it’s Old Elvish.
text: Suddenly a FIGURE bursts out of hiding, scrambles out the
dialog: door!
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Shit. Grab em. Grab em.
text: Jakoby takes off...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY
text: The figure bursts out the front door at a full run with
text: Jakoby in hot pursuit -- Jakoby dives and tackles the figure,
text: knocking it to the ground...
text: WE SEE it’s a young ELF GIRL, screaming, frantic. Fighting
text: like a banshee. Clutching something to her chest -- She
text: snaps at Jakoby...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Fuck, she’s trying to bite me! Get
dialog: her hands she’s got something!
text: Ward rushes out to help restrain the kid. She’s clearly
text: trying to keep something away from them.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: What’s she got? What’s she
dialog: holding!?
text: Ward and Jakoby pin her down -- AN ARC OF PURPLE ELECTRICITY
text: BLASTS UP AND STRIKES THE POWER LINES -- IGNITING THEM!
text: Jakoby and Ward jump back, drawing their guns. The little
text: girl cowers, drops what she’s holding...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Shit! ... Shit!
text: Both cops stare in shock -- At the reedy white piece of wood,
text: with a black handle and gold detailing...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Is that...that’s not...is that a...
dialog: Yes...it's a WAND!

speaker_heading: SERGEANT CHING
text: There’s a blood trail leaving the
dialog: property. Smells weird like
dialog: gasoline.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Gasoline? Jesus Christ, what
dialog: bleeds gasoline, what's that mean?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: The blood trail belongs to our
dialog: bright. Whatever went down, he
text: gets shot and bailed out back
text: without his wand.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Why aren't we evacuating the
dialog: neighborhood? Remember how all
dialog: those people died when the kids in
dialog: Philly found a wand?
speaker_heading: SERGEANT CHING
dialog: That was before Twitter. We don’t
dialog: want to start a panic. You said
dialog: the elf kid used the wand?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: The kid’s not a bright. The wand
dialog: just went off or something.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT CHING
dialog: What’s the kid saying?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: The kid isn’t saying shit, she’s
dialog: freaked out. Plus she doesn’t
dialog: speak English, only Elvish.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Ever seen a wand in person?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: What? Sure ... yeah. That broken
dialog: one in the Smithsonian.
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: So what are we gonna do about this?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Secure the scene until the feds
dialog: show up. This is way above our
dialog: paygrades.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: I didn’t call the feds. Pollard,
dialog: you call the feds?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Nope.
text: Pollard, Sgt. Ching and Hicks exchange looks. Ward beginning
dialog: to clock something’s wrong.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: What are we talking about here,
dialog: guys. C’mon. Sarge?
text: Sgt. Ching just stares with her cold black eyes.
dialog: Then...
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Wands royally fuck up radio
dialog: reception. Dispatch never heard
dialog: you. We did ‘cause we were close
dialog: by. But the Department knows fuck
dialog: all about the wand. If they did
dialog: the whole world would be here. The
dialog: wand doesn’t exist. The wand was
dialog: never here.
dialog: (finally...)
dialog: We're taking the wand.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: What the fuck are you even saying?
dialog: You don’t know how to use a wand.
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Don’t worry. I know people who

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Come the fuck on, this isn’t

speaker_heading: POLLARD
text: That’s magic. On the table.

speaker_heading: POLLARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You got it. Wanna be taller?
dialog: Shorter? You want a bigger dick?
dialog: You want fame? Power? Eternal
dialog: health? That wand is anything you
dialog: want. Follow your heart, Ward.
text: A beat as Ward looks in his heart...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You're not stealing a wand.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: No one’s coming Ward.
speaker_heading: SERGEANT CHING
dialog: Hicks back off. Scott, you need
dialog: this just as much we do. Maybe
dialog: more. People depend on you.
dialog: People care about you. You want to
dialog: be there for them, right?
dialog: Fuck she's scary.
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: ...-what about Jakoby..?
dialog: Boom. There it is...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - DAY
text: Two more cop cars outside. The little elf girl sits on

speaker_heading: SERGEANT CHING
text: Pollard, he’s spinning.

text: Ward shoves Pollard. Sgt. Ching gets in between them...
speaker_heading: SERGEANT CHING
dialog: Whoa. Easy. Bring it down.
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Fuck this. Ward, lemme reframe
dialog: this. Want your little girl to not
dialog: have a father AND Jakoby dies? Or
dialog: just Jakoby dies? Because you’re
dialog: in fuckin fantasy land if you think
dialog: you're walking outta here with life
dialog: as you know it intact.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You threatening me motherfucker?
speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: I think he just caught up to it.
speaker_heading: POLLARD

dialog: go home tonight? The orc dies
dialog: either way. End of story.
text: There’s a brutal silence. We hear the flies buzzing. The

speaker_heading: HICKS
dialog: Use your gun. The kid got your gun
dialog: away from you. And shot Jakoby
text: with it. Right out front there.
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: POLLARD (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: JAKOBY

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I don’t give a shit about clan-
dialog: blood! I’m not blooded! My

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: So why the fuck was he running?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: History. Cops and Orcs? I’d run
dialog: too. I’m sorry the Orc who shot
dialog: you’s in the wind. I lost him in
dialog: the swap meet. I didn’t help him

speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Wha...what the fuck?
text: Jakoby blinks, looks at Ward thinking -- “I can’t believe you
text: did that you idiot.” Jakoby quickdraws. Aims at Ward...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Drop it. Drop it now. TI will kill
dialog: you. JI will fucking kill you.
text: Ward tosses his gun, slowly drops to his knees...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What the fuck? What the fuck?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Listen to me, Nick, I need you to-
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Shut up and show me your hands!
text: Ward does, Jakoby shoves him down, knee in his back. Cuffs

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Shut up!
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Stop telling me to shut up, just

speaker_heading: JAKOBY

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: JAKOBY

dialog: Stay here, don’t move.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Nick! Hear me out!
text: Jakoby crosses to the bodies -- Tikka turns to Ward. And
dialog: smiles -- Grateful. It means the World to Ward...
text: ON JAKOBY -- SEES Ching and Hicks are motionless. Pollard
text: crawling towards the house, leaving a wide swath of blood.
text: Jakoby turns him over -- Pollard looks at Jakoby in terror.
text: Tries to pulls his gun, but his hand slick with blood.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Hey Pollard, shit man, I’m getting
dialog: you medical. Gimme your hand.
dialog: Keep pressure on this, don’t let
dialog: go. I got you, brother.
text: Jakoby helps him staunch the wound. Next Jakoby checks Ching

speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)

text: Conscious and breathing. Two more
text: officer's down. Not conscious not

dialog: and a supervisor.
text: No reply from dispatch -- Just eerie distortion...
text: Now Jakoby notices the wand -- He grabs it. Returns to the
dialog: car. Tosses it on the dash...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Nick! Heads up! We got looky-
dialog: loos!
text: Jakoby turns and REACTS -- Seven yoked and tatted VETERANOS
text: from Altamira approach in a phalanx. Backlit by the setting
text: sun. The menace palpable...
text: Jakoby stares a beat -- “I don’t need this shit." Then grabs
text: the shotgun and racks it -- KERCHACK!
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Sir. Stay back.
text: POISON, the shotcaller, smiles, shows his hands. Ever so

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Sir. This is an active crime

speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: So why are all the cops blasting on

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Get the fuck back.
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: And sabes que, homie? Word on the
dialog: street’s there’s a wand in the
dialog: hood.
text: Jakoby REACTS. The Veteranos slowly encircling him...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Nick, unless you’re down to smoke
dialog: these dude and twenty more we have
dialog: to un-ass this place right now.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Shut up, just shut up.
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: When the little homie told me, I’m
dialog: like ‘hell no’. A wand? In this
dialog: motherfucker? Naw. Then I hear
text: all these cops are blasting each
dialog: other. Now that’s worthy of
dialog: exploration.
text: Jakoby, noting how close they are, gets behind the driver's
dialog: door...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Tikka, we’re gonna be fine, stay
dialog: calm.
text: Jakoby is now surrounded. SEES hands in pockets, hidden

text: wand on the dash...
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: That’s it, huh? That shit don’t
dialog: belong to the Government.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: It belongs to the Community. To
dialog: the people. We'll take it now.
text: Jakoby aims the shotgun at Poison...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Anyone makes a move, I’m shooting
dialog: you in the face. You. Not them.
text: Poison just smiles. Jakoby slowly sits in the driver's seat.
text: Still aiming at Poison. Jakoby keys his radio:
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)

dialog: Three-Adam-Nine. I’m Code Six

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Shut up, man. I got this.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: We have to go! Jakoby!
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I’m not leaving Pollard!
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Pollard wanted me to kill you!
dialog: He’s not the victim here!
text: WHAM! -- The windshield is hit with a CROWBAR! Veteranos
text: jump on the hood and trunk. Attacking from all sides...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: They're gonna kill us! Go! Go!
text: Jakoby starts the car and stomps the gas. Throws it in
text: reverse. Sending Veteranos tumbling. He does an E-brake
text: turn. Then guns it up the street, siren blaring...
scene_heading: EXT./INT. SOUTH LA/COP CAR (MOVING) - DAY
text: Jakoby barrels up the street. Tikka screaming in fear.
text: Jakoby breathing hard. It feels so good to get away...

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Slow down. Dude. Slow the fuck

text: The wand starts to GLOW...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Nick! Snap out of it! Slow d...
text: The wand floats into the air, vibrating with energy...
text: KA-WHAM! -- The car plows into ... nothing. The front end
text: crushes in like it just hit an invisible brick wall!
text: Then silence. The wand stops glowing. The smashed vehicle
text: steams, bleeding oil and water in the middle of the street.
text: Night has begun to fall over South LA...
scene_heading: INT. LAPD STATION - OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Kandomere, the Elf Fed we met earlier, flips through boxes of
text: arrest forms. His photographic memory drinking in the info
text: fast as he turns the page. Montehugh, his human partner,
text: enters in a rush...
speaker_heading: MONTEHUGH
dialog: Something’s going down.
text: Kandomere looks up and cocks an eyebrow: “Go on.”
speaker_heading: MONTEHUGH (CONT’D)
dialog: Tech services flagged some weird
text: ass cellphone intercepts. Bunch’a

speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: I've heard nothing on the scanner.
speaker_heading: MONTEHUGH
text: -and talking about a wand.

scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT
text: The sky is hesitant to release the day, its final soft blue
text: glow recedes from the darkness. It’s unnaturally quiet on
dialog: this evil isolated little street...
text: HIDDEN ON THE PORCH -- Pollard, in agony, trying to dial his
text: iPhone. It’s maddening to work a touch screen through so
text: much blood. He hears an SUV pull up. FOOTSTEPS approach.
text: He sets down his cell. Grabs his gun...
text: GIBSON crosses to the house. Stops to pick up WARD’S GUN.
text: She could be 20 or 40. Her age and gender are a mystery.
text: But she’s clearly an apex predator. Everything she does is
text: weighted with thought, meaning and intent, down to the
dialog: smallest movement.
text: She steps over the bodies of Sergeant Ching and Hicks.
text: Behind her are SLASHER and COWBOY, with carbines and body
dialog: armor. They have that Special Forces vibe, a couple hundred
text: confirmed kills between them.
text: Gibson stepping, Pollard slumps with relief...
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Gibson? Thank fuck.
text: She turns to her muscle...
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Get him inside.
scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT
text: Pollard sits at the kitchen table. Slasher and Cowboy regard
text: the hole blown in the wall. Pollard groans in pain. Gibson
text: studies him silently for a time. Then sits across from him.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: You going to be all right?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: What? Fuck no, I’m... help me.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
text: Of course. Help is coming.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where’s the wand?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: They took it ... they took it ...
dialog: fuckers shot me!
dialog: 42.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Describe it.
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: The wand. Describe it.
speaker_heading: POLLARD
text: S'white ... gold ... black handle.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: “They” who took it are...
dialog: (reading off her phone)
dialog: Scott Ward and Jakoby the Orc? Is
dialog: that correct?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: That’s...that’s right...Local
text: gangsters chased them off.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Humans?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Yeah. Hispanic gang.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Do they know about the wand?
text: Pollard just groans. Gibson turns to Slasher and Cowboy.
speaker_heading: GIBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Priority one is to secure that
text: wand. It might be with the gang.
dialog: It might be with the cops.
text: Gibson thinking as Pollard bleeds on the floor. Drip. Drip.
dialog: Drip...
speaker_heading: GIBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Are there GPS units in your patrol
dialog: vehicles?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: We'll find him that way.
dialog: (to Cowboy and Slasher)
dialog: Get on the bodies.
dialog: 43.
text: Cowboy and Slasher quickly exit. She shows Ward’s Glock to
dialog: Pollard...
speaker_heading: GIBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Is this the weapon Ward used?
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: Yeah.
text: BAM! -- Gibson shoots Pollard in the head.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT
text: Slasher rolls Ching’s body in a carpet. Another rolled up
text: carpet presumably contains Hicks. Cowboy uses a metal
text: detector to locate shell casings from Ward's gun...
text: Gibson exits. Looking around. Scanning for prey. Feels
text: someone watching her. Spins to SEE SOMEONE duck behind the
text: curtains of the little house across the street...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - OLD MAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Gibson KNOCKS -- Holds an LAPD badge to the window.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Police! LAPD!
text: The door opens. Still chained. An OLD MAN peers at her...
speaker_heading: GIBSON (SPANISH) (CONT’D)
dialog: I need to ask you some questions.
dialog: You can talk to me here, or talk to
dialog: me downtown.
text: The door closes. The chain is removed. It opens again.
scene_heading: INT. OLD MAN’S HOUSE - 5 MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
text: The OLD MAN and OLD WOMAN clearly want no part of this. But
text: are cooperating. Gibson takes notes...
speaker_heading: GIBSON (SPANISH)
text: The police were shooting at each
dialog: other?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (SPANISH)
dialog: We've lived here for thirty years,

dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: GIBSON (SPANISH)
dialog: Who shot the other police? The

speaker_heading: OLD MAN (SPANISH)
dialog: No the white man. The Orc took him
text: away in handcuffs.
speaker_heading: GIBSON (SPANISH)
dialog: The Orc handcuffed him?
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN (SPANISH)
dialog: Yes. The Orc was mad at the other
dialog: one for all the killing.

text: They have a wand.
speaker_heading: GIBSON (SPANISH)
dialog: Do they? Who have you told?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (SPANISH)
dialog: Nobody.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Good.
text: BLAM-BLAM! BLAM-BLAM! Gibson kills them. This person is

scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - INTERSECTION - NIGHT
text: The wrecked cop car still smoking. No movement inside -- Two

speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: Kick back, fool.
text: Poison pulls a Mac 10 from his back -- BRDDDDDDDDDT! Punches

speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: Alright, let’s do this.

speaker_heading: SHADOW
dialog: Poison, let’s jam outta here before
text: the rollers show up.
dialog: 45.
speaker_heading: POISON

speaker_heading: SHADOW
dialog: So what’s up then?
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: I want every homie in the Hood

scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - ALLEY BETWEEN APARTMENTS - NIGHT
text: BEHIND A DUMPSTER -- Jakoby holds Tikka, one hand over her
text: mouth, the other grips the shotgun. Ward next to them. A
text: bloody cut on his forehead from the crash. The wand is
text: tucked into Jakoby’s belt. Jakoby leans out. SEES Poison

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Don’t do anything.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Shut up, man.
speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Bet it’s a binding spell, stops it

speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - GARAGE HOUSE - NIGHT
text: Ward kicks off a padlock then leans on the garage door, using

scene_heading: INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: Ward closes it with his boot. Then it rolls back up.
dialog: Revealing Jakoby -- He had second thoughts. Jakoby closes

text: at Jakoby, yell whispers:
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You uncuff me right fuckin’ now
dialog: Nick. I swear to God I’m gonna
dialog: lose my shit.
dialog: 47.

text: forth in hushed tones...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: If you ever trusted me, I need you
dialog: to trust me right now.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You shot three cops. You whacked

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I'll explain. It’s me, partner.
dialog: It’s still me. I can explain but

speaker_heading: TIKKA

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Fuck, man, the lock.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: WARD
text: Lock’s on the ground out there.

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: ‘Real Orcs’ don’t give me any
dialog: respect, I ain’t blooded so they

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: That’s not true.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Stop. We know who likes us and who

speaker_heading: BROWN

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Except for the dating thing.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: That’s how you get blooded as an

dialog: you’re a blooded human now. You’re
dialog: who I want be.
speaker_heading: WARD

dialog: Why’d you to lie to me, man? I’m

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Dunno. I just lied. And then with

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: It’s complicated.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: I’m taking you into custody.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: We got a wand with us. It was ata

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: Show me the wand.

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Rodriguez. Don’t call it in man.

dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: I‘’1l call the Magic Taskforce,

speaker_heading: JAKOBY

text: gun. Searches Jakoby, tossing away his weapons, his keys.
speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
text: It doesn’t look good. A green cop

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ
dialog: I’m not being a dick. I’m being

speaker_heading: JAKOBY

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: RODRIGUEZ

scene_heading: INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

dialog: that may be...
text: Jarred loose, the wand lays in the street, next to Jakoby.
text: Ward rushes back to help his partner. Finds Jakoby is

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: You think it’s funny to trash our

speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: You know I’m not from here. I grew

speaker_heading: DORGHU (CONT'D)
text: An unblooded orc. And a cop. Grew

dialog: they have an “orc friend.” Here's
dialog: your opportunity to give back.
text: He switches to orkish, suddenly animalistic, he snarls:
speaker_heading: DORGHU (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Fuck! You!

speaker_heading: DORGHU

speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What wand?
text: Dorghu grins. Predatory. Stabs down into the top of

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You motherfucker! Stop it! Leave
dialog: him alone you piece of shit.
text: A Big Orc loops a chain around Ward’s neck. Hauls back

speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: The police think there’s a wand.
dialog: The feds think there’s a wand.
dialog: (roars)
dialog: I think there’s a wand!
text: WHACK! -- A Fogteeth Orc PUNCHES WARD in the jaw, knocking
text: him to the floor. Dorghu rips his dagger from Jakoby. And
text: grabs Tikka by her hair. Ward gets deliberate and quiet...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Please leave her alone. She’s just
text: a little girl. She’s going home.
dialog: Let her go home.
text: He’s WHIPPED WITH A CHAIN, screams in pain.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: We're police officers! You can't
dialog: do this!
text: An orc kicks Jakoby down, stomps his face into the floor.
text: Again and again. Breaking his nose...
text: Now both of the cops lay defeated, broken, rasping in pain.
text: Dorghu presses his dagger to Tikka’s throat...
speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: I'll cover you with her hot blood.
dialog: Where is the wand?
text: The cops just moan in pain. Dorghu wrenches Tikka’s tiny,
text: fragile arm. She cries out in pain...
text: Ward looks at her. She looks at him -- Telling him to STAY
dialog: 
text: STRONG with her eyes -- A flicker of respect and awe roll
text: across Ward's face -- This little girl is someone special.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I don't know! I don't know where
dialog: the wand is, I don't fucking know!
dialog: 70.
text: Dorghu senses he’s been bested but doesn’t understand how.
text: It’s over -- He nods to his subordinates. Ward, Jakoby and
text: Tikka are dragged down the hallway into...
scene_heading: INT. FOGTEETH SAFE HOUSE - PIT ROOM - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: THE FLOOR HAS BEEN RIPPED OUT -- Above an incredibly deep
text: pit, dug deep beneath the house, vanishing into darkness.
text: Ward and Jakoby are laid face down so their heads hang over
text: the edge. The Big Orcs stand over them, a boot on their
text: backs. Ward and Jakoby staring into the abyss. They trade
text: looks and sad little smiles -- Each saying to the other “I'm
dialog: with you my brother, I'm with you."
text: Dorghu’s huge paw clasping Tikka’s throat...
speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: Watch your friends.
text: Ward fights back tears...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I'm sorry, Sophia. I’m so sorry.
dialog: Please forgive me! I didn’t say
dialog: goodbye. I didn’t say I love you.
text: The Orcs are all business now. Ward and Jakoby are just
text: objects to be disposed of. Both men now stoic. Tikka
text: sobbing. Dorghu tries one last time...
speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: Where is the wand?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: There is no fucking wand, stupid.
text: Dorghu stares at them, and then:
speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: Kill them.
text: A Big Orc presses a shotgun to the back of Jakoby’s head. An
text: ORC GANGSTER steps up with a fucking big bolt action deer
text: rifle. CLACK-CLACKS a round in the chamber. Holds the
text: muzzle to the back of Ward’s head. The Gangster hesitates...
speaker_heading: ORC GANGSTER
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Wait.
text: All the Orcs look at him.
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Turn over.
text: Ward slowly turns over.
speaker_heading: ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
dialog: You too.
text: Jakoby turns over, his smashed nose bleeds into his eyes...
speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: What are you doing?
speaker_heading: ORC GANGSTER
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Father, I am sorry, I know these
dialog: men.
text: All of the Orcs wait expectantly.
speaker_heading: ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: I was in the swap meet going to
dialog: school when an Ore from another
text: Clan lit up a liquor store.
dialog: (re: Jakoby)
dialog: He saw me and chased me. I was
dialog: trapped. And he saw I was the
dialog: wrong Orc. He helped me escape the
text: police. The human police.
dialog: Dorghu processing this...
speaker_heading: ORC GANGSTER (CONT’D)
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: I owe him an honor debt. We cannot
dialog: kill them.
speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: They mock us.
speaker_heading: ORC GANGSTER
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: Maybe there is no wand.
text: Father and son stare at each other. The father nods,
text: releases Tikka. Kneels by Jakoby.
speaker_heading: DORGHU
dialog: What did you call me roundtooth?
dialog: “Stupid?”
dialog: 72.
text: Dorghu pulls him up by the shirt -- WHAM! Punches his face,
text: now he stomps his ribs, his legs. The Orc Gangster cringes.
speaker_heading: DORGHU (CONT'D)
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: False orc! Unblooded coward!
text: He stomps and stomps. Ward’s heart breaking as Nick’s blood
text: spatters his face...
scene_heading: INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - NIGHT
text: Montehugh’s laptop connected to the server rack...
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Any luck?
speaker_heading: MONTEHUGH
text: Drive’s fried. The wand cooked it.
dialog: If there’s video of our bright,
dialog: it’1ll take a forensic lab to
dialog: recover it.
text: Kandomere frowns.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Pull the drive and bag it.
text: Then Kandomere sees something...
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
dialog: Shit. We got company.
scene_heading: EXT. 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT
text: A couple cars of LAPD SWAT COPS has pulled up. Brown talking
text: to them excitedly. Kandomere and Montehugh rapidly approach
text: the knot of cops. Wearing body armor over civilian clothes.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Evening. Can I help you? Who are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Easy, sir. I called them. We’re a
text: little short handed.
text: Kandomere turns to the SWAT SERGEANT...
dialog: Kandomere
text: carbine.
dialog: Kandomere
dialog: 73.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Fine. Gimme a perimeter. Take the
dialog: corners of the block. And stay out
dialog: of sight.
speaker_heading: SWAT SERGEANT
dialog: You're not in charge here.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: What the fuck did you say to me?
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: I think you heard him. This is
dialog: LAPD's jurisdiction.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: I’m a federal agent. It’s your
dialog: jurisdiction but it’s my country.
dialog: Now all of you get the fuck off my
dialog: crime scene.
speaker_heading: SWAT SERGEANT
dialog: We're not debating this. Elf.
text: grinds his jaw in disbelief. Montehugh gripping is
text: Thumb on the safety. The tension is very real.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Don’t let them out of your sight.
dialog: When the Strike Team gets here,
dialog: we're arresting all these assholes.
text: turns and heads for the house. A SWAT COP blocks
text: him. Montehugh scanning the big men with scary faces.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
dialog: Step aside.
speaker_heading: SWAT COP
dialog: I will put you in handcuffs,
dialog: compadre.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Get the fuck out of my way.
text: The SWAT COP shoves him. Kandomere stares at him, intense.
text: The moment hangs pregnant in time. With eerie calm...
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
dialog: What’s your plan? You know I’m an
dialog: elf, right? I can hear your heart
dialog: speeding up. I can smell the
dialog: adrenaline in your sweat.
dialog: 74.
text: Brown is right there. Menacing...
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Can you dodge a bullet?
speaker_heading: MONTEHUGH
dialog: Kandomere. We’re going.
text: BRDDDDDDT! -- Brown and the SWAT Cops open fire. Montehugh
text: falls dead -- But Kandomere flips backwards. Repeatedly,
text: weaving and spinning as bullets hit all around him. Insanely
text: agile. Moving as only an Elf can. He dives in his SUV.
text: Punches the gas and tears out of there.
text: TICK-TICK-POCK! -- Bullets smashing into the back as he goes.
text: He disappears up the block. The SWAT Cops about to pursue.
text: Brown WHISTLES piercingly...
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: Hey! No, no! Stay on mission. We
text: grab the gold and find the wand.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - EMPTY LOT - NIGHT
text: The neighborhood illegal trash dump. Ward and Jakoby are
text: shoved out of a truck. Then Tikka is pushed out as well.
text: Both of them are virtually pulped at this point. But Jakoby
text: is in truly dire shape. Ward crawls to him...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Nick? Nick? Can you hear me?
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: «+. my leg’s broken ... my ribs ...
dialog: I can’t breathe ... I’m done ...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: No you’re not. Hold on. I’11 get
dialog: you help. Don’t leave me, brother.
dialog: Jakoby fading -- The beating broke something important
text: inside. Ward grabs his arm, tries to drag him to the street.
text: But Jakoby’s too big and Ward is too weak. Ward collapses,
text: screams at the dark houses, clutching Jakoby in his arms.
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Somebody help us! This is a good
dialog: man here! Help this man! He's a
dialog: good man. Help him!
text: Tikka slowly approaches. Ward notices her. She has a steely
text: look in her eye. The with a flick of her wrist -- THE WAND
text: APPEARS FROM NOWHERE RIGHT IN HER HAND! Ward stunned...
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Holy shit. You're a bright.
dialog: You're a fucking bright. You had
dialog: the wand the whole time.
text: Tikka speaks quietly, nervously...
speaker_heading: TIKKA
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: My job was to learn magic to keep a
dialog: wand safe. The Dark Lord will
dialog: return and I am meant to fight him.
dialog: But I have no wand of my own. A
dialog: witch came to kill me and the
dialog: Brothers of Light saved me. The
text: witch left her wand behind.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I don’t understand you. I have no
dialog: idea what you're saying. I’m
dialog: sorry.
speaker_heading: TIKKA
dialog: (subtitled)
dialog: I can’t fix him.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I don’t know what that means. I
dialog: don’t know what you’re saying.
speaker_heading: TIKKA
dialog: (broken English)
dialog: If I use this ... Witch find us.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Fuck the witch. If you can help
dialog: him, then help him. He was ready
dialog: to die for you.
text: Tikka sees the desperation in Ward’ face. She motions for
text: him to get back. Tikka centers herself. Rubs her hands.
text: Then points the wand at Jakoby and whispers:
speaker_heading: TIKKA
dialog: Mendovia.
text: A beautiful, rippling pulse of “energy” drifts off the wand
text: and passes over Jakoby’s limp form -- Instantaneously we hear
text: CLICKS and SNAPS as Jakoby’s body repairs itself!
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Oh holy shit. Oh wow.
dialog: 76.
text: Jakoby suddenly sits up, spitting out blood and sucking in
text: air. Ward rushes in to help him, but Jakoby pushes him away.
text: He’s not dying, but not a 100%. We can feel Ward’s relief.
text: Tikka passes out cold. Bleeding from her ear. Dangerously
dialog: drained...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: You okay? Tikka? You gonna be
dialog: okay?
text: Jakoby scoops her up like a ragdoll. Slides the wand back
text: into his belt. Helps Ward up.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: C’mon partner. I got you. We have
dialog: to keep moving.
text: They start walking -- An odd little family: A big Orc, a
text: broken man, a tiny Elf Girl. Tikka leads the way. A little
text: warrior, who has been called to fight much too soon.
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - DARK ALLEY - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: CAMERA FOLLOWS gloppy footprints of black, shiny blood. They
text: lead to bare feet which drag, shuffle and twitch ... WE TILT
text: UP and SEE a veiny woman’s body in a ratty dress. This is
text: THE WITCH. The wand's owner...
text: Tikka’s voice rolls in like a distant echo -- “Mendovia."
dialog: 
text: The Witch's face whips toward us -- Stringy black hair on a
text: patchy scalp framing her sunken pink eyes. Her face a well
text: of darkness as she sniffs the air...
speaker_heading: THE WITCH
dialog: .-.-Mine...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: GIBSON’S SUV parked in the shadows. Cowboy in back. He’s

speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: What’s so interesting?
speaker_heading: SLASHER
text: Bunch’a LAPD SWAT guys racing balls

speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: You sure? I haven’t heard anything
dialog: on their Tac Channels.
speaker_heading: SLASHER
dialog: They’re not on department Icoms.
dialog: They're running encrypted

dialog: SWAT operators working off the
dialog: books.
speaker_heading: COWBOY
dialog: Sounds like they’re bad pennies.
speaker_heading: SLASHER
dialog: Indeed. And let’s just say they
dialog: sound, um, excited.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Might be our wand. lLet’s go.
dialog: Maybe we can have a gunfight with

text: She takes off fast...
speaker_heading: SLASHER
dialog: What’s our limit here, Gibson?
text: Gibson just stares at him. Cowboy smirks as he pulls a

scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - USED CAR LOT - NIGHT
text: A bright oasis in the darkness. With lots of good deals.
text: Ward and Jakoby settle down behind a row of minivans. Tikka

text: Jakoby regards the giant blood red full moon rising...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: That kid, man. The Orc kid I let

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: The one who was gonna shoot me in

dialog: Great kid.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Listen to me. Listen. He was

dialog: What are the fucking odds?
dialog: 78.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Sure, it was a little unexpected.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: No. It was impossible, Scott.

speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: This is a prophecy. We’re living
dialog: prophecy right now. We’re just
dialog: little people man, people they
dialog: don't write about. But tonight’s
dialog: like the old days of the Heroes.
dialog: Like Jirak doing epic shit.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Just stay awake, keep talking.
text: A cop car with LIGHTS AND SIRENS blows blindly past the lot.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Jirak was unblooded. Like me. He
dialog: was just a farmer. But when he
dialog: found out the Dark Lord was going
dialog: to destroy the World. He raised a
text: sword against him and led an army.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Homeboy earned his baller status.
text: Tikka cocks her head SEES SHADOWS among the vehicles...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Before the deed is the word. A
dialog: farmer was called by prophesy and
dialog: united the Nine Races against the
dialog: Dark Lord. He turned the Orcs from
dialog: evil and they all raised their
text: blades to him. He was blooded
text: right there. Fulfilling the Great
dialog: Prophecy.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: That's what we’re in, a prophecy.
dialog: This all means something. It’s
dialog: important.
text: Ward is losing faith in the world. He looks at Jakoby.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: It’s not prophecy, bro. It’s just
dialog: one bad fuckin’ night and it’s

dialog: 79.
text: Tikka spins on them, scared, eyes like saucers...
speaker_heading: TIKKA

speaker_heading: WARD
text: Lunchbreak’s over. We're moving.

speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: Hey.
text: Ward and Jakoby look around -- Altamira Veteranos have taken

text: unarmed. It’s over.
speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: My pops bought lottery tickets
dialog: every week. Wanted to get us out
dialog: of the hood. To put us through
dialog: college. His number never hit.
dialog: Dude dropped dead mowing someone

dialog: you only bet on sure things. The

text: A long, empty beat. You can feel the sweat in the air.
speaker_heading: WARD

speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: Fuck you. Here’s what’s up. Elf

text: Jakoby stares at Ward, Ward stares at Jakoby. Tikka steps

speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Tikka! No!
text: Poison and his homies stare at the wand. Victory.
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: POISON
dialog: Is... Is that it?
text: THE LIGHTS FLICKER. Several go out. Tikka REACTS.
speaker_heading: TIKKA

speaker_heading: TIKKA

speaker_heading: POISON (CONT'D)
dialog: What the f--
text: --THWICK! -- A pallid veiny hand RIPS HIS THROAT OUT! Poison
text: falls facedown on the asphalt -- And there she is!
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What is that? What is that?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: .-.-it's a witch...
text: Yes it is. The owner of the wand has returned for her
text: property and she is TERRIFYING -- Greasy black hair falls
text: around a sickly white face, tremendously old and misshapen,
text: forced onto a young, lithe body. She bears a shotgun wound
text: from her initial fight at the house.
text: A weird, long beat. It’s not even clear if the witch is
text: aware of them. Her body sways gently in the night breeze.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Scott? Are we about to die, bro?
text: Ward exhales shakily.
dialog: 81.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: If that’s what it takes. You with
dialog: me?
text: SCHWACK! -- Snaps out his collapsible baton and grins. His
text: tired eyes burn with madness...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: We're arresting this bitch.
text: Jakoby stares at him. Then understands. It’s the only move.
text: They're still cops. And they’1l die with their boots on.
text: SCHWACK! -- Jakoby snaps out his baton. They trade
text: determined nods. Although barely able to stand, they square
dialog: off against the Witch...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: LAPD. Turn the fuck around and get
dialog: on your knees. Put your hands
dialog: behind your head and interlace your
dialog: fingers.
text: The Witch HISSES exposing black gums.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
text: She seems noncompliant.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: I’m getting that too.
text: The Witch HISSES AGAIN. The two brave cops raise their
dialog: batons to strike...
text: Tikka steps between them and raises the wand...
speaker_heading: TIKKA
dialog: (screaming)
speaker_heading: TALIOS!
text: BLUE FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE WAND TOWARDS THE WITCH! She swats
text: it away like a tennis ball and makes a yanking motion...
text: Pulling her wand towards her, jerking Tikka towards the
text: Witch. Jakoby and Ward grab Tikka...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: The wand! Get the wand!
text: Both men grab for the wand with frantic hands. Jakoby gets
text: his hands around it just as Tikka loses her grip and falls to
dialog: the side...
dialog: 82.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: I got it I got it!
text: Ward gets a hand on it too. Now the two of them go for a
text: ride, as if pulled by a tractor...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: She gets it we're dead!
text: They hold on for life. Their boots sliding over the
text: pavement. An insane game of tug of war. Blood drips down
text: Ward’s gunshot arm. Jakoby’s battered body creaks. He
text: GROANS in pain...
text: Their hands wrapped tightly around the wand -- The wand
text: cutting into their palms, blood leaks out over their
dialog: knuckles...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Bro, don’t let go. We go and we’re
dialog: dead!
text: Jakoby ROARS like a lion at the Witch, blood streaming down
dialog: his face...
text: The Witch laughs as she drags them closer and closer. FUCK!
text: THEY ARE FUCKED! Ward slides a hand towards his gunbelt.
text: Pivots his tazer in its holster...
text: BAM! -- Fires blind from the hip -- Tazer darts hit the witch
text: in the neck. Her body goes RIGID as the tazer pumps high
dialog: voltage into her...
text: She releases the wand from her spell -- Ward and Jakoby
text: tumble backwards to the ground in a jumble. Jakoby finds
text: himself staring at Poison’s dropped machine gun -- “Yes!”
text: Jakoby grabs the ugly black weapon and comes up firing...
text: BRDDDDDT! -- His shots go wide, shredding cars. CAR ALARMS
text: scream out in the night...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: KILL HER NICK KILL HER!
text: Jakoby aiming carefully -- BRDDDDDT! -- Slugs smash into the
text: Witch. Splattering black blood in all directions! The Witch
text: drops. Jakoby out of ammo...
text: Now the Witch slowly stands. HOLY SHIT SHE'S STILL ALIVE!
text: She SHRIEKS and summons her wand!
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: The wand, the wand!
dialog: 83.
text: Ward, on the ground, is brutally dragged across the pavement
text: towards her. Metal on his belt throwing sparks...
text: Jakoby thinks fast. He grabs a heavy steel truck rim from a
text: pile of tires. Hurls it with all his heart and might...
text: ON THE WITCH -- Grinning with evil delight -- Here comes her
text: prize, her wand. She's winning...
text: K-TANG! -- The rim crushes her head against an old truck with
text: a burst of black goo. She drops lifeless...
text: The wand instantly goes slack to Ward’s relief. Jakoby falls
text: against a car. Slumped there in a symphony of car alarms.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Good looking out, partner.
text: They reach out pathetically to bump fists and give up. Ward
text: flops over. His uniform torn, road-rash over half his body.
text: He lifts the wand in his hand, stares at it, then looks over
text: to the dead witch, then to Jakoby...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Where's Tikka?
text: Jakoby and Ward look around -- THEY REALIZE TIKKA IS GONE!
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Why would she run? Where would she
dialog: go?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: She's just a kid. Only one place
dialog: she’d go.
text: Ward pulls himself up against a car, wincing...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: She's going home, Nick.
text: The silence hangs. Jakoby speaks quietly.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: We could leave. The binding
dialog: spell’s off the wand right? ‘Cause
dialog: the witch is dead? We can’t run
dialog: and can’t hide. Consequences or
dialog: not, we gotta get to a hospital,
dialog: man. And get out of this fucking
dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Yeah. But we’re not gonna.
dialog: 84.
text: Ward spits blood, wipes his drawn, pallid face.
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: My dad ran out on me. And Sophia’s
dialog: dad ran out on her. Everywhere you
dialog: look it’s people giving up and
text: running away.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Someone’s gotta do it. Someone's
dialog: gotta be the good guy.
text: A long pause. Then Jakoby nods. He's in. Both men haul
text: themselves to their feet. One last time...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT
text: It’s quiet. Dead quiet...
text: CAMERA SLOWLY REVEALS -- A dead SWAT COP. Then another. And
text: another. And another. All the SWAT Cops are dead, shot to
text: pieces. All killed in a vicious gunfight.
text: CAMERA FINDS BROWN -- Crawling to his car, dying from
text: gunshots. He SEES two figures approaching. Ward and Jakoby
text: emerge from the night mist like zombies...
speaker_heading: BROWN
dialog: ...not you assholes...
text: He tries to draw his pistol. Ward easily takes it away. Now
text: Jakoby and Ward watch in total silence as Brown dies.
text: THEN A NOISE FROM THE HOUSE -- Ward nods for Jakoby to pick
text: up a SWAT shotgun. He does. Ward and Jakoby approach the
text: house. Limping up the porch stairs, Ward motions for Jakoby
dialog: to go around the side...
text: As Jakoby slips along the side, WE SEE something he doesn’t:
text: Slasher, holding a rifle, watching him from the shadows...
scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: Ward moves very slowly, clearing the house. Now in the
text: living room -- There's Cowboy dead in a pool of blood...
dialog: 
text: A NOISE from the kitchen. Ward heads toward it...
text: NEW ANGLE -- Gibson standing there breathing softly. Hidden
text: by a bookcase. She’s looking at Cowboy. Who looks back.
text: He's not dead. Despite heavy injuries, he rises to his feet.
dialog: 85.
text: Together they close in on Ward...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: Jakoby moves toward the back yard. Quiet deliberate steps.
text: Slasher starting to follow...
scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: FROM A LOW ANGLE -- We watch Ward enter the kitchen...
text: REVERSE -- Tikka’s curled up under the sink, hidden by soup
text: pots. She waves gently. Trying to get Ward’s attention. He
text: doesn’t see her...
text: ON GIBSON -- Moving almost spectrally as she glides forward.
text: Trying to get an angle on Ward...
text: CLOSE ON WARD -- He can’t see her. But he pauses. Biting
text: his lip. Maybe he feels a change in air pressure or
dialog: 
text: something. Ward suddenly spins around -- Cowboy is right
dialog: there!
text: POP-POP! -- Ward hits Cowboy in the face. Dropping him. Now
text: Ward spots Gibson! But she has the drop on him. Her carbine
text: aimed at his face...
text: But Ward has skills -- He jukes, spins and fires -- POP-POP!
text: BAM! -- GIBSON FIRES AT THE SAME TIME
text: Ward is hit in the chest. Gibson once in the face. Both of
text: them fall. Tikka SCREAMS and bursts from her hiding place
text: with a CLATTER of pots...
text: BAM! -- Gibson shoots Tikka in the back! -- Sending her
text: spinning into the cupboards...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Nooooo!
text: Tikka writhes in pain on the linoleum -- Ward raises his gun
text: at Gibson. And hesitates...
text: Because Gibson has her carbine trained on Tikka...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Don’t.
text: Jakoby appears in the big hole in the wall -- Shotgun aimed
dialog: at Gibson...
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Wait wait wait! Nick wait!
text: Jakoby SEES the jeopardy that Tikka is in. Sees the state of
text: Ward, he’s bad. Real bad. Gibson slowly pushing herself to
text: her feet, keeping her gun on Tikka...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: She just shot a kid Scott.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Yeah. And she’ll do it again.
text: Gibson SEES Slasher sneak past the kitchen window, moving to
text: flank Jakoby. Her eyes flick to Ward...
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Drop your weapon.
text: No way Ward will do that. Gibson looks at Tikka, finger on
dialog: the trigger...
speaker_heading: GIBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: This trigger has a four pound
dialog: break. Maybe you’ll destroy my
text: brain stem with a perfect shot.
dialog: But the girl will still die.
text: Ward glares at her -- She’s being covered by Jakoby -- So he
text: tosses his gun away...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Bro. Don’t. Shit.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Get up. Go to the table.
text: Ward, in excruciating pain, plants his feet and drives
text: himself slowly up the wall...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: You're crazy. You’re a fucking
dialog: animal.
text: Jakoby staring down his sights at Gibson. Hyper focused.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Please. Sit down. Take a moment
dialog: to think about what you’re doing.
text: Ward staggers to the table, slowly sinks into a chair.
speaker_heading: GIBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is the wand?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: What the fuck are you?
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: (after a long beat)
dialog: I represent a larger interest. One
dialog: that watches. And waits. For
dialog: opportunities and capitalizes on
dialog: them. The wand is an opportunity.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You're going to give me the wand.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: And then what?
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: I’m going to kill you and your orc
dialog: friend. I’m going to walk out of
dialog: this house. I’m going to work out
dialog: and train and wait for my next
dialog: assignment.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Right.
dialog: 87.
text: Suddenly they hear a storm of TRUCK ENGINES AND SCREECHING
text: TIRES out front...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: SIX BLACK SUVs swarm the property. Kandomere and Gordon
text: Vance pop out with a dozen hi-tech SPECIAL OPERATORS,
text: everyone armored and tooled up for a firefight...
text: Kandomere regards the house a beat. His eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
text: There’s a bright in the house.
speaker_heading: GORDON VANCE
dialog: You sure? How do you know?
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Have I been wrong yet?
text: Vance turns to his men as they form assault teams.
speaker_heading: GORDON VANCE
text: It’s confirmed a bright’s in there.
dialog: Kill everything that moves.
text: An Assault Team heads for the back of the house.
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
dialog: Ward heard them. Gibson heard them...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: So ... do you have a new plan?
text: Gibson doesn’t waver. Tikka moaning in pain on the floor.
text: Ward slides a hand towards the pocket on his thigh where the
text: wand is stashed...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
text: The second she lowers that gun even
dialog: an inch you kill her Nick.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Roger that, partner.
text: Gibson regards Jakoby. Looks back at Ward. SEES Ward now
dialog: holds the wand...
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Interesting. Now put it down.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: You're either born a bright or you
dialog: study for years. Are you a bright?
dialog: No. Do you know any spells? No.
dialog: Try to use that wand and it will
dialog: kill you.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Shut up.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: There’s no way out. Give me the
dialog: wand while this little creature is
text: still breathing.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Nick. Get Tikka out of here.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: No, Orc. You don’t move.
text: Jakoby, still aiming his gun at Gibson, slowly moves into the
text: kitchen, towards Tikka...
speaker_heading: GIBSON (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't move another fucking inch.
dialog: 89.
text: Jakoby stops. The shotgun shakes in his hands...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Nick. It’s okay. Get Tikka.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What are you doing, Scott?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: It’s gonna be okay.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: Listen to your Orc.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What are you doing?
text: Ward smiles at his friend. Quietly...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: It’s like you said. It’s a
dialog: prophecy. It’s all a prophecy.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You really believe that?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: No. So I need you to believe it
dialog: for me.
dialog: (then)
dialog: Get Tikka out of here.
speaker_heading: GIBSON
dialog: You'll do no such thing.
dialog: (to Ward)
dialog: Imagine sitting in front of a
dialog: candle day and night for years.
dialog: Learning the stillness of mind a
dialog: wand requires. Years of repeating
dialog: the same spells. Precise
dialog: articulations of ancient word
dialog: forms.
text: Tikka, looking at Gibson, realizes something. At the same
dialog: time Ward does...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: ..-you’re a bright...
text: NEW ANGLE -- Slasher steps through the hole into the kitchen.
text: Weapon trained on Jakoby. Softly whispers...
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: SLASHER
dialog: Easy friend. I got the drop on
dialog: you. Let’s not have any mistakes
dialog: here. I need you to slowly lower
dialog: your weapon.
dialog: Jakoby knows he fucked up...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: What do I do?
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: Don’t you dare lower that shotgun.
text: Gibson takes a step towards Ward...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: Stop.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: «--Scott..?
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - BACK YARD - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: Gibson's eyes bore in on Ward...
speaker_heading: GIBSON
text: It’s over. It’s hopeless.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: SHUT THE FUCK UP!
scene_heading: NOW. EVERYTHING. HAPPENS. AT. ONCE...
text: POP-POP! -- Slasher is shot in the back by the Assaulters...
text: Jakoby fires his shotgun at Gibson -- KABOOM!
text: .+.Just as Slasher falls onto him, knocking his aim askew...
text: «+.-so he only blows out a chunk of wall by Gibson’s head.
text: Who swings her carbine from Tikka to Ward...
text: WARD SPRINGS TO HIS FEET AND SCREAMS:
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: TALIOS!
dialog: gl.
text: THE FUCKING ROOM EXPLODES INTO LIGHT. The wand BLOWS APART
text: INTO A FOUNTAIN OF FIRE, VIOLENTLY LAUNCHING WARD BACKWARDS
text: INTO THE WALL...
text: A LIQUID INFERNO OF LIGHT splashing in all directions.
text: BLOWING APART GIBSON INTO A SCREAMING FLAMING SKELETON!
scene_heading: EXT. 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: LIGHT AND FIRE EXPLODE OUT THE WINDOWS -- Vance and the other
text: operators dive to the ground.
text: ON KANDOMERE -- He doesn’t flinch. Even as the shockwave
text: blows back his clothes...
scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - KITCHEN - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: THE KITCHEN LOOKS LIKE LITERAL HELL -- Everything engulfed in
dialog: fire...
text: Jakoby sees Slasher is still alive. Taking aim at him.
text: Jakoby fires -- Buckshot knocks Slasher into the flames.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Scott! Scott where are you!?
text: Nothing. He SEES Tikka unconscious on the floor. Jakoby
text: lifts her, he staggers to the front door...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: Jakoby stumbles out of the house with Tikka in his arms.
text: Towards a jittery firing squad of Special Operators!
speaker_heading: GORDON VANCE
dialog: ORC!
text: BRDDDDT! -- Gordon opens fire, Kandomere with his Elvin
text: reflexes shoves his gun down just in time...
text: Jakoby stumbles and drops to his knees...
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Help the child!
text: Jakoby is surrounded. Tikka is immediately taken away from
text: him, rushed to the PARAMEDICS. FIRE ENGINES arrive...
text: Jakoby is clearly dazed, barely able to stand, but he manages
text: to get up -- He’s headed back towards the house...
dialog: 92.
text: Across the street -- The intimidating Orcs of the Fogteeth
dialog: Gang have gathered to watch...
text: Kandomere blocks Jakoby’s path...
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
dialog: Stop. We got you. It’s safe now.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You don’t understand, there’s a
dialog: prophecy. This is part of
dialog: something bigger...
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: Calm down. I know it’s something
dialog: bigger. But you need to calm down.
text: The house is now a complete inferno -- And Jakoby is willing
dialog: to walk right back in. Kandomere won’t allow that...
text: Jakoby looks around, dazed. PEOPLE have finally come out of
text: their homes. Now liberated from the predations of the
dialog: Altamira Gang. Sensing something special has happened...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Please listen, listen to me. He
dialog: saved me and the girl, you can’t
dialog: just let him burn.
dialog: Gordon Vance helps out...
speaker_heading: GORDON VANCE
dialog: Sir, you need you need medical
dialog: help.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: He’s my best friend! My best
dialog: friend, let me in there! Scott!
dialog: Hey Scott! That’s my best friend!
text: Jakoby collapses. Kandomere and Vance trying to keep him
text: seated. Quietly now:
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: «+. my best friend. Please.
dialog: That's my best friend....
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: It’s over. You have to accept it.
text: It’s over.
text: Jakoby stares at the house and shudders in anguish.
text: Heartbroken. Tears roll down his face...
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE (CONT’D)
dialog: Breathe. You need to breathe.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You’re an elf you can hear in
dialog: there. Tell me he’s dead. Tell me
dialog: he’s really dead.
text: Kandomere turns and looks back at the house, focusing. Then
text: falters. And Jakoby sees it...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: What did you hear?
speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
text: He's dead.
text: Jakoby stares at him, searching his face. Then:
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You're lying!
text: Tapping into some reserve of incredible strength, Jakoby
text: shoves Kandomere off him! He's up and stumbling into the
text: burning house before anyone can stop him -- Kandomere can
dialog: only watch. So brave. So pointless...
scene_heading: INT. 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: Jakoby enters, coughing, choking on dense smoke. EVERYTHING
text: BURNS. The ceiling falling around him. Glass breaking...
text: He searches fruitlessly for Ward -- EVERYTHING IS JUST FIRE.
text: Too disorienting and bright. He’s being cooked alive!
text: A SECTION OF WALL COLLAPSES -- Revealing Ward curled up in a
text: corner. Jakoby staggers to him, throws an arm around, hefts
text: him over his shoulder...
scene_heading: EXT. SOUTH LA - 341 ABRAMS - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
text: Jakoby and Ward COME CRASHING out the window, slamming into
text: the ground as fire erupts from the doors and windows!
text: The CROWD GASPS -- Now yelling and cheering...
text: Jakoby drags Ward across the yard. Finally collapsing next
text: to him. Ward looks ... dead.
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: You’re out, you’re out of there, I
dialog: got you. I got you. You’re okay..
speaker_heading: (MORE )

speaker_heading: JAKOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Be okay. Just be okay. Breathe.
dialog: Please breathe! C’mon Scott say
dialog: something, say...
text: Ward’s eyes are fixed in the distance, past Jakoby. Ward
text: weakly points...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: «+. Nick ... look...
text: Jakoby does. And SEES the Fogteeth Orcs standing behind
text: police lines. He just stares at them, uncomprehending...
text: Then Dorghu steps forward and draws his ceremonial dagger.
text: He cuts his own paw and raises his clawed hand high. Then
text: all the Orcs behind him raise their hands too...
text: Jakoby watching this -- HE’S BEEN BLOODED -- Overcome with
text: emotion, he starts to cry...
speaker_heading: JAKOBY
dialog: Hey, Scott, we’re gonna be okay.
dialog: Everything's ... Scott?
text: Ward is done.
scene_heading: FADE TO WHITE

scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Ward is in a hospital bed with someone else’s hair next to
text: his face. It’s SOPHIA! She’s crawled into the hospital bed
text: with him. She’s asleep.
text: Ward is heavily bandaged, pale, hooked up to machines.
text: Everything's blurry and confusing. He looks down at Sophia
text: and buries his face in her hair, tears streaming down his
dialog: face. He didn't believe he'd get this moment...
text: Sophia hugs a piece of paper. Ward reaches for it. Slides
text: it out of her arms. Looks at it. Chokes with emotion...
text: It's her crayon drawing of Ward and Jakoby...
text: An ELVEN NURSE enters. Checks numbers on machines. SEES
text: He’s conscious. Checks his pulse. All business...
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: ...where’s my partner..?
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: ELVEN NURSE
dialog: Please don’t talk.
speaker_heading: WARD
dialog: .-.-where is he..?
text: She SNICKS back the curtain between the beds...
text: REVEALING JAKOBY in the adjacent bed -- Equally beat to hell.
text: Ward smiles...
text: Jakoby looks over at him. His broken face smiles back. They
text: try to bump fists -- CLACK-CLANG -- They’re handcuffed to
text: their beds! Now Ward SEES the FEDERAL MARSHALS in SWAT gear
dialog: guarding them...
speaker_heading: WARD (CONT'D)
dialog: How fucked are we?
text: Jakoby just shakes his head gravely -- It’s really bad...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: What value is thirty three seconds?
speaker_heading: TECHNICIAN
dialog: You'd be surprised.

text: from INSIDE THE KITCHEN AT 341 ABRAMS plays...
speaker_heading: POLLARD
dialog: ... the Department knows fuck all
dialog: about the wand. If they did the

dialog: never here. We’re taking the wand.
text: Kandomere listening to the rest. Amazed...
scene_heading: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
text: Kandomere enters. Looks at the Jakoby and Ward. At these

speaker_heading: KANDOMERE
dialog: No. They’re not. They’re the good
