dialog: 
text: A cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and

dialog: 
text: A counter that sets apart the kitchen area. A portable TV set
text: on the counter. The remains of dinner for one.
dialog: 
text: A row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on
text: the floor. Boxes are labeled in crayon: HATE MAIL.
dialog: 
text: A coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming

dialog: 
text: A Port-O-San toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred
text: and dented -- scavenged from a construction site.
dialog: 
text: A snapshot on the bedside table. It's a blurry picture of

text: falls across his face. Next to the picture is a clock radio,
text: which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine AM.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
text: Another day of traffic. Traffic

scene_heading: EXT. UNITED NATIONS PLAZA APTS - - MORNING

text: The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza

dialog: hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
text: Day in, day out. Red light, green

dialog: 
text: From his POV we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly
text: at a standstill.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
text: Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos,

scene_heading: EXT. STREET CORNER

scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY

text: The maid's room. The maid is smoking a cigarette and reading
text: New York magazine. The cover is partly obscured by her hand
text: but we can see a blurry black-and-white photo of a man
text: hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face,

dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Last night. Alan Albright called me
dialog: a handsome woman. Second time he's
dialog: done that. Son of a bitch.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I hear Alan's sick.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Alan's very sick. He has to go to

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You know about Adele.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA

speaker_heading: NICKY
text: She's dying.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: She died.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I talked to her two days ago.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Apparently it didn't help. You know
dialog: about Peter, of course.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Our Peter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Peter Redmond. They found out why
text: he can't remember his lines.
dialog: There's something living in his
text: brain. A parasite he picked up in
text: Borneo, doing the movie.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Can he get through it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
text: They're watching him closely.
text: There's a special rehearsal set for
dialog: this afternoon. To bolster his
dialog: confidence. And that's not all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I've got bigger problems, Joanna.
dialog: Personal problems.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: That's not all, Nicky. I've been
dialog: backing your plays for fifteen
dialog: years. And I've never been more
dialog: depressed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: About what?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
speaker_heading: S

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (hiding his concern)
dialog: Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm
dialog: not worried about this guy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Ever since he started reviewing the
dialog: Broadway theater, nobody in this
dialog: business has been worried about
dialog: anything else.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: They can send their heartless
dialog: brilliant boy-critic. There's a
dialog: much bigger thing going on than
text: tonight's opening.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: What?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: The Red Sox
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: You mean the World Series? I
dialog: thought the Red Sox were winning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Three games to two. But if you know
dialog: their history, you realize there's
dialog: a tragedy in the making. I've been
dialog: carrying this franchise on my back
dialog: since I was six years old.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: It can't be all that personal.
dialog: 
text: Joanna enters the walk-in closet to finish undressing and get
text: a nightdress.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: If you have a team you've followed
dialog: all your life, and they raise your
text: hopes and crush them, and lift them
dialog: and crush them, do you want me to
dialog: tell you what it's like? It's like
dialog: feeling your childhood die over and
dialog: over. J
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I mean Nicky, really, no.

dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and
dialog: boxer shorts.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I'm proud of this play. It's so
dialog: different from anything you've
dialog: done.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: This is how we've managed to last.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: We're able to surprise each other.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
text: In and out of bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: Because we're completely
dialog: mismatched.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: We don't even like each other, do
dialog: we?
dialog: 
text: Nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into
dialog: bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: I used to tell myself. Talent is
dialog: more erotic when it's wasted. Will
dialog: I see you tonight?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: The Red Sox blow a chance to win
dialog: their first World Series since
dialog: 1918. You expect me to miss that
dialog: for an opening night?
dialog: 
text: Joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets
text: into bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: It makes me so mad. Steven
text: Schwimmer ready to strike. The
text: exterminating angel.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: It's all worked out. They'll lose
dialog: tonight. Then they'll lose
dialog: tomorrow. I see it with stunning
dialog: clarity.
dialog: 
dialog: 8.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOANNA
dialog: It's your best play, Nicky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY

scene_heading: INT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT
dialog: 
text: Steven is just waking up. The radio plays soft music.
dialog: 
text: He reaches over and hits the off button, then activates the
text: cassette player. He struggles out of bed and Sufi music
text: begins to fill the room.
dialog: 
text: He stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid-twenties,
text: hollow-chested, slightly potbellied, wearing rumpled pajama
text: bottoms and a Mostly Mozart T-shirt.
dialog: 
text: He does not remove the sleep mask.
dialog: 
text: The music has a sensuous, driving beat. Voices begin to
dialog: chant.
dialog: 
text: Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. Slowly he begins
text: to turn, clockwise. The beat picks up and he whirls more
text: quickly, his mouth coming open.
dialog: 
text: Now he begins to whirl about the room. The chanting grows in
text: intensity. Although he is blindfolded, Steve deftly avoids
text: running into furniture and other objects.
dialog: 
text: Steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops

dialog: 
text: A taxi pulls up alongside. Nicky notices the young woman in

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Laurel, stay there.

speaker_heading: NICKY

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I'm seeing your play tonight,
dialog: remember?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Why do you need a radio?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: So at the intermission I can listen
dialog: to the ball game. Do you know that

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: That's completely crazy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Is it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Don't talk like that. How
dialog: prominent? What are you implying?

speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: She's doing like those Iranians. `I
dialog: divorce thee. I divorce thee. I
dialog: divorce thee'

dialog: 
speaker_heading: GEORGE
dialog: I saw your picture in the paper.
dialog: Two papers.

dialog: no turning back.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY

dialog: didn't say a word about this.
dialog: 
text: A young waiter recognizes Nicky and unobtrusively points him
text: out to another waiter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Because you refuse to believe she's
dialog: serious. You've always refused.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that

dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Oh please. Not now.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: She wants you to stop seeing What's-

dialog: Do you think that's too much to
dialog: ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You're too young to be studying
dialog: criminal behavior. It's making you
dialog: obsessive.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: She is kicking you out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Your mother and I have something
dialog: between us that's too strong to
dialog: damage permanently. Believe me, I
dialog: know this. That's right, nineteen

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Don't call her Mother all the time.

dialog: 09 109
text: Laurel is on her feet, backing away slightly. Steven removed
text: his shoes and stands in his stocking feet, noticeably shorter
dialog: than he'd been earlier.
dialog: 
text: He begins to unstrap the bulletproof vest, causing Laurel to
dialog: retreat further.

speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: These wives named Lillian. I used
dialog: to say to her, `You don't kick a
dialog: door once or twice and expect it to
dialog: open. It's only in the movies a man
dialog: can kick in a door with such
dialog: amazing ease. Because a real door
dialog: requires a tremendous and prolonged
text: pounding before it finally gives
dialog: way.' He's a great player...how
dialog: could that ball go through his
dialog: legs?
dialog: 
text: Nicky turns, steps back and kicks the door. It opens at once.
dialog: 
dialog: 78.

scene_heading: INT. THE LOFT
dialog: 111 111
text: Steven and Laurel are briefly immobilized by shock as the
text: door comes flying open.
dialog: 
text: Nicky moves toward the candle-lit couple.
dialog: 
text: Laurel realizes who he is and stands by the sofa. She zips
text: her skirt.
dialog: 
text: Nicky is trying to understand what he sees, then he gets it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (quiet)
dialog: Laurel.
dialog: 
text: Nicky holds his gun hand aloft, repeating the image of Bill
text: Buckner with the baseball in his glove -- Nicky's
text: hallucination.
dialog: 
text: Then Nicky issues a cry, a sound from the time before humans
text: acquired language. It is the audible anguish of his life,
text: from the fetus onward.
dialog: 
text: We hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we
text: realize he is crying out a name. We recognize the look on his
text: face and the formation of syllables on his lips as elements
dialog: we'd seen earlier -- on Buckner's face when he shouted
dialog: something as he made N
text: the "third out" of the tenth inning.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Ste-vennnn Schwim-merrrr!
dialog: 
text: Laurel reacts with horror to the revelation of Steven's
text: identity. She rearranges her bra.
dialog: 
text: Nicky stumbles, drops his gun. It goes off.
dialog: 
text: Steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft, his
text: hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster.
dialog: 
text: Nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him.
dialog: 
text: Steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp. The room is dark
text: now. Lit only by the blue glow of the TV.
dialog: 
text: The TV sports roundup, which has been showing football
dialog: highlights, has switched to baseball -- highlights of the Red
dialog: Sox-Mets.
dialog: 
text: Nicky reaches Laurel.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 79.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: (crying out)
dialog: This is my daughterrrrr!
dialog: 
text: Steven is wide-eyed at the news.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: I don't think he knew, Daddy.
dialog: 
text: Nicky sees the photo of Steven and his cat. He shoots twice,
text: blows it away.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Daddy, I'm sorry. But he was so
dialog: beautiful. I trusted him. When I
dialog: saw what he really looks like --
dialog: 
text: A voice from shadows:
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: (OS)
dialog: Am I really so deeply repugnant?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Yes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Go home, Laurel. Tell your mother I
dialog: will be late.
dialog: 
text: Nicky walks toward Steven's voice, toward the shadows.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You're going to die. You're a dead
dialog: man. You're dead.
dialog: 
text: He notices Laurel following behind him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Look. I'm sorry you keep running
dialog: into dishonest men. But you're only
dialog: eighteen. We can still turn it
dialog: around.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Except I won't have a father
dialog: anymore.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I'll see you all the time. I'll get
text: a place right nearby. One room. No
dialog: distractions. We'll talk.
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: He shouts into the darkness.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: YOU'RE DEAD!
dialog: 
text: Laurel puts her hand on his shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What will we talk about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Everything.
dialog: 
text: Nicky sees one of the New York Magazine ads, Steven
text: Schwimmer's face mounted on the cardboard. He fires three
text: times, wiping out Schwimmer's eyes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Will I believe you when you tell me
dialog: something?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: There's nothing left for me to lie
dialog: about.
dialog: 
text: Nicky starts into the darkness only to see Steven emerge from
text: the shadows, his gun lowered. Oddly, he seems distracted by
text: something on another part of the room. He is looking at the
text: TV set on the counter.
dialog: 
text: Nicky watches him approach the kitchen area. He follows, gun
dialog: raised.
dialog: 
text: Steven sits on a stool to watch TV.
dialog: 
text: Nicky approaches warily, his gun aimed at Steven's head,
text: which is blue-lit by the TV screen.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: You're dead. I see you on a morgue
text: slab drained of all fluids.
dialog: 
text: Laurel follows at a distance to see what they're so
dialog: interested in.
dialog: 
text: Nicky puts the gun muzzle flush against Steven's temple.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I see the outline of your body in
dialog: chalk on this very floor.
dialog: 
dialog: 81.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Daddy, wait.
dialog: 
text: Steven is watching slow-motion footage of Bill Buckner
text: missing the slow roller.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Then they lost?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Why does it matter?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: If they lost tonight, they'll lose
text: tomorrow. It's all over.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: Why do you care?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: They're my team.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: No. They're not your team. They're
dialog: my team.
dialog: 
text: Nicky cocks the hammer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: They're my team, too. I grew up on
text: Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway
dialog: Park. I went to fifty or sixty
dialog: games a year. All by myself. I was
dialog: one of those kids with scabby
dialog: elbows. I called out to the
dialog: players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm
dialog: Steven. My parents are divorced.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I went to college in Boston so I
dialog: could be near the Red Sox. I took
dialog: summer classes and the cut them to
dialog: go to the game. My wife is from
dialog: Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: The Red Sox were my world. I
dialog: surrendered my existence to a team
dialog: that couldn't win the big one.
dialog: 
dialog: 82.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: If you're such a devoted fan, why
dialog: were you at the play tonight
dialog: instead of the game? Answer
dialog: carefully. This is important. You
dialog: could have gone to the theater last
dialog: night. There was no game last
dialog: night.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: Because I can't bear to watch. When
dialog: they lose, I die inside. It's like
dialog: some little person named Steve just
text: crumples up and dies. I wait for
dialog: the scores. I still die, hearing
text: the scores, but it's over in a
dialog: second. I can't survive the game
text: pitch by pitch, inning by inning.
dialog: I've done it too many times. And I
dialog: can't do it anymore.
dialog: 
text: Nicky lowers the gun.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: I was six years old the day Pesky
dialog: hesitated throwing home and
text: Slaughter scored all the way from
dialog: first. That's when I knew the Red
dialog: Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: When I traveled through Asia this
dialog: summer, I went to tremendous
dialog: trouble and expense to rent a car
dialog: with a phone so I could call up
dialog: Sports Phone in New York and get
dialog: the scores. I drove through the war
dialog: in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone
dialog: like every hour on the hour, for
dialog: updates.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: What about my play?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: It's your best play, Nicky.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: See, Daddy.
dialog: 
dialog: 83.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I've seen it twice. I went back
dialog: tonight to be sure. It's a brave
dialog: and honest piece of work.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: What else?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: An artistry and sensitivity you've
dialog: never shown before.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: And you're not saying that because
dialog: of the gun in my hand?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: You're out of bullets.
dialog: 
text: Nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and
text: pulls the trigger. A click.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: See, Daddy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: And Peter Redmond helped immensely.
dialog: These pauses were exquisitely
dialog: timed. He made us wait and wait. He
dialog: built a gorgeous tension and
text: suspense.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICKY
dialog: We worked very hard on the pauses.
dialog: 
text: Nicky places it on the counter.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: STEVEN
dialog: I called Sports Phone from Lhasa,
dialog: Tibet. Freezing in my little rented
text: Fiat. Sheep on a hillside. Rocky
dialog: debris dating back millions and
dialog: millions of years, from the time
text: the Himalayas thrust up when the
text: plates of India and Asia collided.
text: Red Sox 3, White Sox 2. A moment in
dialog: the history of the world.
dialog: 
text: Nicky takes Steven's head and moves it tenderly against his
text: chest. When Nicky releases the head, he has Steven's toupee
text: in his hand. He looks at it briefly, then hands it to Laurel.
dialog: 
dialog: 84.

scene_heading: EXT. 48TH STREET NEAR ELEVENTH AVENUE
dialog: 112 112
text: A yellow taxi comes speeding past, moving eastward on 48th
text: Street. We see it from various perspectives and elevations.
text: It is a large checkered cab, the only thing moving in the
text: night. Steam comes billowing from funnel vents. The taxi
text: catches every light just before it turns red.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. TAXI
dialog: 113 113
text: Nicky is driving, his face showing intense satisfaction.
text: Laurel sits next to him.
dialog: 
dialog: Driver's name plate ---
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MEMLUK
speaker_heading: SULEYMAN
dialog: 
text: The driver sits in the middle of the rear seat, looking
text: somewhat nervous.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LAUREL
dialog: Faster, Daddy.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. 48TH STREET
dialog: 114 114
text: The taxi crosses Park Avenue, speeding past the bronze statue
text: of a man hailing a cab.
dialog: 
text: It approaches First Avenue, where a road divider bisects the
text: thoroughfare. Nicky swings into a sharp turns, barely
text: averting contact with the divider, and stops abruptly.
dialog: 
text: Three doors open. On the empty street, Nicky hands the driver
text: a wad of bills. Then he and Laurel step over the divider. He
text: puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue
text: to the glass tower where they live.
dialog: 
text: The sun begins to climb out of the East River.
