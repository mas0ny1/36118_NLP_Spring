scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: CLOSE ON A SIMPLE OVERNIGHT BAG. It rests on a mussed
text: bed in a hotel room. An unseen Packer is refilling it
dialog: for the trip home. A few shirts, socks, underwear..
speaker_heading: MACON'S V.O.
dialog: The Business. Traveler should bring
text: only what fits in a carry-on bag.
dialog: Checking your luggage is asking
dialog: for trouble.
text: The Packer carefully adds a clear plastic bag containing
text: a variety of travel-size packets of detergent, shoe
dialog: polish, antacid, shampoo, etc.
speaker_heading: MACON'S V.O.
dialog: Add several travel-size packets of
dialog: detergent so you won't fall into
text: the hands of unfamiliar laundries.
dialog: There are very few necessities in
dialog: this world which do not come in
dialog: travel-size packets.
text: The Packer lays in a shaving kit. And on top of it a
text: small format guidebook, well-thumbed and annotated, with
text: a cover illustration of an armchair with wines. Above
text: the drawing it reads THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST and below
text: IN_THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.
text: SOMETHING WIPES THE FRAME and we see that the Packer has
text: laid a gray suit on the bed next to the overnight bag.
text: Now, he reaches in and picks up the trousers.
speaker_heading: MACON'S V.O.
dialog: One suit is plenty...if you take
dialog: along travel-size packets of spot
dialog: remover. The suit should be
text: medium gray. Gray not only hides
dialog: the dirt, but is handy for sudden
dialog: funerals.
text: The Packer takes us back to the overnight bag as he lays
text: in a thick novel entitled MISS MACINTOSH, MY DARLING.

dialog: than one book. It is a common
dialog: mistake to overestimate one's
dialog: potential free time and
dialog: consequently overpack. In travel,
dialog: as in most of life, less is
dialog: invariably more.
text: Now the Packer pauses. He holds this last item a long
text: time in his hands. It is a small, framed snapshot of a
text: smiling young Boy.
speaker_heading: MACON'S V.O.
dialog: And most importantly, never take
dialog: along anything on your journey
dialog: so valuable or dear...that its
dialog: loss would devastate you.
text: For the first time, we are CLOSE ON the face of the
text: Packer. His name is MACON LEARY. As he looks at the
