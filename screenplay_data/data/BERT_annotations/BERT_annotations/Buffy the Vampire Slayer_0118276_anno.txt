scene_heading: EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET
text: We see an Italian village at the height of the plague. Funeral
text: processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up...
text: the stench of death all around.
scene_heading: TITLE: EUROPE. THE DARK AGES
text: Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse. He is weary but
text: not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts.
text: He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back.
text: He enters the inn.
scene_heading: INT. INN - SAME TIME
text: The inn is dark and almost empty. A couple of patrons drink
text: silently at tables. Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID,
text: dark-haired and lazy. She scratches at her shoulder, on which
text: we see a birthmark. The knight approaches the bar, throws
dialog: money down.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
text: A tankard of ale, wench.
text: The barmaid pours him a cup of ale. He drinks deep, stands a
dialog: moment.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Some plague we're having, huh?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his
text: room. The door opens inward. The knight stands in the doorway,
text: places a hand on the barmaid's hip. She pauses a moment, then

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
text: breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall. He laughs a
text: bit, resignedly, and closes the door.
text: A VAMPIRE stands behind it. Not two feet from the knight,
text: grinning at him. His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his
text: head, his bloody smile full with teeth. His skin is gray, and
text: peeling. The knight turns slowly and sees him.
speaker_heading: KNIGHT
dialog: Oh, my god...
text: The vampire licks his lips.
text: He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into
text: the middle of the small room. The knight struggles but is no
text: match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's
text: neck. The knight screams.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON DOOR
text: It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.
text: The vampire turns like a frightened animal. In the doorway
text: stands the barmaid, a SLAYER. In her hand is a wooden stake.
text: The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner.
text: The Slayer and the vampire come at each other. The Slayer
text: spins and kicks; the vampire flies back. Snarling, he comes
text: back at the slayer. They struggle; he slips free and is out
dialog: the door.
text: For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor.
text: The knight watches her. She seems to be making a decision --
dialog: perhaps even knows what is going to happen.
text: She runs at the window.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME
text: The vampire comes running out the front door. Before he is a
text: few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through
text: the upstairs window and lands on him. They both hit the ground,
text: and she plants the stake right in his heart.
text: After a moment, we hear a voice:

dialog: (continuing)
dialog: . All fall down
text: There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in
text: the otherwise deserted street. At the front, maybe ten feet
dialog: away, is AMILYN.
text: Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King.
text: His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery. He
text: ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.
text: Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King. His skin is deep white,
text: and smooth. He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any
text: era. He is practically upon her before he speaks.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: You must forgive Amilyn. He tends
text: to drool before supper.
text: She turns. He smiles, almost lovingly.
speaker_heading: SLAYER
dialog: Lothos...
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: You people will never learn.
text: She swings at him but he grabs her arm. Amilyn laughs
text: obnoxiously. Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings
text: her to him in a loving embrace.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: We can't be stopped. This is our

dialog: not a stake, but a pom-pom.
scene_heading: EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY
scene_heading: Opening CREDITS OVER:
text: A football game in progress. The stands are pretty full, the

text: On the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY.
dialog: She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very
text: gracefully athletic. She obviously enjoys what she is doing,
dialog: and she's good at it.
text: With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her best

dialog: If he can't do it

speaker_heading: MERRICK

speaker_heading: BUFFY

speaker_heading: MERRICK

speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Wait a minute.

scene_heading: EXT. GRAVEYARD - SAME TIME
text: Buffy sits fidgeting. Playing with her fingernails. Merrick

text: A low, almost inaudible MOAN come from under the ground. Buffy

text: A pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy.

text: from the crumbling earth.
text: Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free.
text: Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws

text: the ground, and his stake goes flying.
text: Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running

dialog: Where's the other one?
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: She --

text: Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.
text: A blasting kick in the head from Buffy. The vampire is flung

scene_heading: ANGLE - THE FIELD
text: Grueller hits Jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other

text: exultant crowd, snarling at people.
text: Buffy races for the crowd. She sees Jeffrey is all right.
text: Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands
text: even as everyone else is rushing onto the field.
text: Jeffrey is triumphant. He sees Buffy running for him and raises

speaker_heading: ANGLE - MERRICK
text: He tries to make his way through the crowd.
scene_heading: ANGLE - TOP OF THE STANDS
text: Grueller reaches them and leaps over the back. Buffy sees
text: him, runs up and without hesitation, dives off herself.
text: The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground. Buffy sails
text: down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down. She
text: swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps. Still holding the
text: broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and lands on her
dialog: feet.
text: The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her and
text: without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and
text: sinks the broken end in his heart.
text: She looks around for Grueller. He is booking out, already
text: several yards away..
text: Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see
text: Buffy take off after Grueller.
speaker_heading: MERRICK
dialog: Wait!
speaker_heading: BUFFY

text: Ground level, behind the bike, we see its engine revving, smoke
text: puffing from twin pipes.
speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: Hey, babe. You want to get some
dialog: real power between your legs?
text: Buffy looks at the biker a moment.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE BIKE
text: The same angle as before, ground level. Suddenly the biker's

dialog: the world!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE (MOMENTS LATER)
text: A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Grueller's flight. Seconds
text: late, Buffy roars into view behind him. She navigates the
text: streets with less ease than determination.
text: Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike ona
text: violently bumpy and erratic course through the site. She
text: finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the
text: bike. She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has
dialog: trouble getting up.
speaker_heading: BUFFY'S POV

speaker_heading: GRUELLER
dialog: Fall down go boom have to see the
dialog: nurse.
speaker_heading: BUFFY (0.S.)
dialog: Grueller, God, what did they do
dialog: you?
text: He brings his face right next to hers. His voice is no longer
text: passionless; it boils up from hell.
speaker_heading: GRUELLER
dialog: They killed me.
speaker_heading: RESUME SCENE
text: He grabs her and hauls her up.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: No kidding.
text: She head-butts him with enormous force, sending him staggering
text: back. Before he can recover, she dives for a pile of discarded
text: lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood.
text: She turns on Grueller, who is smiling again. There are two
text: more Vampires approaching her, surrounding her.
speaker_heading: GRUELLER
dialog: The Master walks tonight. This is
dialog: his kingdom, now.
text: They rush her. She takes one on as the second hits her,
text: knocking her over. They all three swarm over her, meeting her
text: kicks with raking claws. The two hold her in front of Grueller.
speaker_heading: GRUELLER
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You know, Buffy, I've always wanted
dialog: you.
text: He smiles again and leans toward her neck.
text: The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise
text: to him as it is to Buffy. He falls backward, shocked and dead.

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
text: Behind him stands Pike.
text: One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike, who runs
text: away. Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto Grueller,
text: impaling him as well.
text: Pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at
dialog: his heels.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: I didn't mean it! I didn't mean
dialog: it!
text: Wooden shard in hand, Buffy sprints toward them, jumps into a
text: series of flips. She lands with her legs around the vampire's
text: shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto
dialog: Pike.
text: For a moment, Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other, breathing
text: hard. Then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by their
text: touching, (and by their slight arousal).
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: I didn't expect to see you.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: I know.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Why'd you come back?
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: I don't know. I kind of thought I
dialog: ought to be here. You know, this
dialog: isn't exactly the kind of thing you
dialog: can run away from.
speaker_heading: BUFFY

scene_heading: ANGLE - KIMBERLY'S CAR

speaker_heading: BUFFY

speaker_heading: BIKER
dialog: You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?

speaker_heading: OF FRAME).
speaker_heading: MERRICK
dialog: Idiot girl. Can't watch over her.
dialog: How long ago did --
text: The CAMERA PAN back with Merrick as he turns to the biker, but
text: in his place stands Lothos. Not five feet from Merrick.
speaker_heading: MERRICK
dialog: Oh, my God.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - THE BIKER
text: On his knees, Lothos' hand firmly locked around his throat.
text: He cannot move or breathe.
text: Merrick and Lothos look at each other a moment.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: It's a beautiful night. I have
dialog: never understood the human tendency
dialog: to equate darkness with emptiness.
dialog: To me the black is so thick with
dialog: life, like soil... like blood.
text: Darkness writhes under my eye.
text: He looks at the night. Merrick slowly reaches for a gun stuck
text: in the back of his pants as Lothos continues.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS

speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: It doesn't really matter. The names,

dialog: After a time, there really is no
dialog: difference. One more pathetic bitch,
dialog: begging for me to suck on her clotted
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: MERRICK
dialog: This one may surprise you.
speaker_heading: CLOSEUP - THE GUN

speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Where is she? I can't wait to meet
dialog: her. Do you think she's ready to
dialog: face me? Or perhaps you can stop
dialog: me with that gun.
speaker_heading: MERRICK
dialog: Perhaps.
text: Merrick looks out at the trees nearby.
speaker_heading: MERRICK'S POV
text: Buffy appears, far away, between the trees.
text: Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - BUFFY
text: Approaching, stopping some twenty yards away. She looks about
dialog: her for a weapon.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: Look at you. You pathetic thing.
text: So small, so full of fury. After
dialog: you've served me for a hundred years,
dialog: I think you'll have a little more
dialog: perspective.
speaker_heading: MERRICK
dialog: I don't think so.
text: Lothos rushes suddenly at Merrick, hissing, his feet just off

text: Pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue. Over the

speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Don't go near the door.

text: Trains it on the others. They quiet down.

dialog: There's gotta be a back way out of

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
dialog: 'Lefty'?
speaker_heading: AMILYN
dialog: You're a fool, bloodbag. Die a
dialog: fool and go to hell!
text: He grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against
text: the wall in the corner. She reaches for the stake but it is
text: just out of reach. He is squeezing the life out of her, his
text: face inches from hers.
speaker_heading: AMILYN
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: The chosen one. You're just another
dialog: bloodbag -- not even fit to die for
dialog: the Master. When will you ever
dialog: learn?
text: Buffy looks about for succor.
scene_heading: ANGLE - THE WINDOW SHADE
text: Buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling aimlessly.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: (with difficulty)
dialog: I do know... one thing...
speaker_heading: AMILYN
dialog: what?
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: I know... what time sunrise is.
text: She pulls down hard on the shade pull and lets go.
speaker_heading: AMILYN
dialog: No!
text: He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the
text: shade. The instant he releases her, Buffy grabs the stake and
text: in one swift motion, buries it in Amilyn's back.
text: The shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins. It is still
text: pitch black out. Amilyn stare, wide-eyed and silent, at the
text: night as he dies.
speaker_heading: BUFFY

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
dialog: It's in about four hours, Dick.
text: Amilyn spins, dying rage in his eyes. He grabs her. His
text: strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke.
text: Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power
text: that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME
text: The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the
dialog: blood pool.
text: Amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk.
text: Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood, soaked and wounded.
text: She stays a moment, breathing hard. Suddenly her eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Oh, god, no... not yet...
text: Lothos rises from the pool, smiling. Buffy is clearly paralyzed
dialog: by fear.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: I knew you'd come.
text: He moves toward her.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You knew it, too, didn't you? All
dialog: your life, dreaming... waiting to
dialog: feed me.
text: Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action. She throws a few
text: punches at Lothos, but he takes them without flinching. She
text: grabs at the stake in what remains of Amilyn's chest. Lightning
text: quick, Lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the
text: stake splinters and she screams with pain. He knocks her back
text: on her ass.
text: She starts moving backward, away from him, but it is hard enough
text: for her to make her way through the thick gore. Lothos
text: contemplates Amilyn's corpse, and his face darkens.

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: Ah, my fool is dead. He was
dialog: careless, always. Still, I'll pull
dialog: out your tongue for that.
dialog: (coming toward her)
dialog: Don't you understand? I've killed
dialog: you a dozen times. Your life is
dialog: not a blink of my eye, not a single
dialog: breath. I have lived in the shadows,
text: in the pulsing filth behind men's
text: eyes. A thousand years, and more.
dialog: I have conversed with the worms
dialog: that fed on my corpse and I have
text: bathed in the blood of emperors.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: (breaking the spell)
dialog: Have you ever thrown up in the front
dialog: row of a Richard Marx concert?
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: what?
text: And she is up, turning to run. He is thrown momentarily by
dialog: her insolence.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - THE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME
text: But he is on her the moment she emerges from the chamber,
text: grabbing her by the hair and throwing her to the ground.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: You waste time. That is a sin.
text: He kneels over her prostrate body. She is reaching frantically
text: into her purse. He runs his hand along her body, a gesture
text: both lustful and disdainful.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You're even weaker than the others.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: I think you've forgotten something.
text: She pulls out a small cross, holds it in front of him. He

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
text: snarls at it, then grabs it, his hand around her. The cross
text: bursts into flame. He holds her hand onto it.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: This? This is you only weapon?
dialog: Your puny faith?
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: No...
text: With her other hand, Buffy holds up her hair spray.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: my keen fashion sense.
text: She squeezes it at him, the spray catching fire form the cross
text: and whooshes a jet of flame right into his face. He screams,
text: letting her go and backing up. Hey, his head is on fire!
text: Buffy turns and hobbles away.
scene_heading: INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - SAME TIME
text: Lothos stumbles about, head all aflame, till he finally pitches
text: into the pool.
scene_heading: INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME
text: Buffy comes out of the boiler room and hobbles along, moving
dialog: as fast as she can.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: This is the suckiest party I have
dialog: ever been to. It's not evena
dialog: contest.
text: She reaches a locked door that says "Gymnasium -- Authorized
text: Personnel Only". Puts her shoulder to it.

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
text: As he pulls himself out of the pool, we are treated to a good
text: look at his new head. It is charred and torn almost beyond
dialog: recognition. It is so inhuman looking, that we are almost
dialog: surprised when it screams!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - HALL - SAME TIME
text: The SCREAM fills the hall. Buffy is still working on the heavy
text: metal door. She turns, wide-eyed, at the SOUND.
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Oops.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. LOTHOS' CHAMBER - LOTHOS' POV - SAME TIME
text: We TRACK rapidly through the cave, through the boiler room,
text: the hall. We're moving much too fast to be running.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GYM - SAME TIME
text: Buffy pulls herself up through a trap door in the corner.
text: Everything stops. For a moment there is silence.
text: Buffy gets shakily up.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLY
dialog: Don't let her in! Don't let her
dialog: in!
text: Pike and the others see her. Pike and Andy run to her to help.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLY
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: They'11 kill us! Get her out!
text: Gary Murray stops in front of Kimberly, takes her face in his
text: hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall.
text: Cross-eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: Are you okay?
text: http://www dailyscript.com/scripts/buffy_the_vampire_slayer.html (130 of 135)21/06/2006 18:26:46
dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: Get away from me!
text: She pushes them away. Lothos crashes through the trap door
text: behind her, ugly and crazed. He picks her up, floating a good
text: two feet off the ground.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: You bitch!
text: He hurls her the length of the room. She hits a locker, which
text: opens, spilling out someone's notebook. The binder falls open,
text: inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within.
text: Buffy looks, by this time, like shit. She props herself up as
text: best she can, looks about her. There is nothing wooden, nothing
text: sharp, within reach.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: You would challenge me?
text: Andy charges Lothos from behind. Pike tries to stop him, but
text: is too late, as Lothos grabs him by the face without even
text: looking at him.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: (continuing; to Buffy)
dialog: I'll rip the flesh from your stinking
dialog: bones!
text: Squeeze Andy's head until we hear something crack. Lets him
text: drop. Looks around at the cowed students.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: (continuing)
dialog: I am a God! A God!
speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: I am so sure.
text: Lothos roars. Furious, he charges Buffy, his feet just skimming
text: the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon her...
text: She spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion. She
text: thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like Superman
text: stopping a train, palm at his chest.

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
text: Silence. Buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus
text: of his face.
text: Lothos stops, almost wide-eyed, as he looks down at his chest.
text: Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and
dialog: a #2.
text: He steps back, staring at Buffy. The expression on his horrible
text: face seems to have changed to one almost of respect. Her look
dialog: is unfathomable.
text: Lothos smiles, graciously.
speaker_heading: LOTHOS
dialog: It doesn't... hurt... as much as I
dialog: had imagined.
text: He falls gently to the ground. He's dust before he hits it.
text: Silence. One by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into the
dialog: night.
speaker_heading: ANGLE - PIKE
text: Kneeling by Andy's body. He gets up, and walks toward what's
text: left of Lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot. In the
text: background we see Gary Murray, running out after a vampire.
speaker_heading: GARY MURRAY
dialog: Just a minute, you! I'm not finished
dialog: with you!
text: Pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it.
text: Everybody is looking at Buffy. She stares back at the students
text: who cast her out. Turns and walks out. Pike follows her.

dialog: Buffy, the Vampire Slayer
dialog: High School. It was at the Senior
dialog: Prom five days ago that the school
text: was beset by a roving gang of crack-
text: crazed gunmen. Survivors say some
dialog: two hundred of the ruffians laid

speaker_heading: JENNIFER
dialog: She didn't even hardly talk to anyone

speaker_heading: JEFFREY
dialog: I heard she got straight A's.

dialog: That's what I heard.
speaker_heading: KIMBERLY
dialog: The worst is, her parents -- this
dialog: is true -- her parents were gonna
dialog: send her to the Bahamas for
dialog: graduation, and she refused. True

dialog: go. It is to vomit.
speaker_heading: BOY
dialog: Well, where is she now?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A COURTYARD - LATE EVENING
text: Buffy and Pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward
dialog: us. We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees,
text: hills in the background.
text: Buffy leads the way. She is confident, at ease. She wears a
text: large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward. Skirt
text: and sneakers. Casual, cool, but disarming. She carries a
text: knapsack.
speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: I didn't say it was a bad idea, I

speaker_heading: BUFFY
dialog: We've come all this way. We just

speaker_heading: PIKE
dialog: You're the boss, boss. I just
