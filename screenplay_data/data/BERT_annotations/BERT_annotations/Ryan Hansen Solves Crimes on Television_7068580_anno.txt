scene_heading: RYAN HANSEN SOLVES CRIMES ON TELEVISION*
dialog: “Jane D'Oh!"
dialog: Written by
dialog: Rawson Marshall Thurber
speaker_heading: EPISODE #102
dialog: February lst, 2017
dialog: *though you're probably watching this on stolen Chinese internet and that's cool too.
scene_heading: EXT. RUNYON CANYON - DAY
text: RYAN HANSEN, shirtless and lightly perspiring (never
text: sweating), huffs and puffs his way up this iconic "hiking"
text: trail in the Hollywood hills, all the while talking directly
text: into his iPhone's Periscope app.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What-what! We got straight up picked
dialog: up, ya'll! Pilot-to-series, suckas!
dialog: YouTube Red in da hiz-ouse! Brace
dialog: yourselves for five -- count ‘em --
dialog: FIVE more eps of this bad boy right
dialog: in your pie whole! Wah-DOOSH!
text: ON SCREEN we see a running commentary from IGS Live
dialog: watchers: Who are you? -- #WeirdAF -- Don't say hiz-ouse.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: YTR guys said there was a "less than
dialog: normal" viewership loss from this
text: crazy viral twerking grandma video
dialog: that they linked us to. Less than
dialog: normal! His words, not mine.
dialog: Crushing iiiit!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: BT-dubs, I just want to thank my co-
dialog: star, the honorable Detective Jessica
dialog: Mathers -- she made me better in
dialog: every scene. You know chemistry is a
dialog: two way street. And some times there
dialog: are stop lights and some times there
text: are unprotected left hand turns --
dialog: but you just keep going. Because...
dialog: traffic, right?
dialog: (faux reflective)
dialog: But I'm not gonna let this show go to
dialog: my head. It's all about finding my
dialog: center. Staying grounded. Staying
dialog: mindful. That's why I'm out here
text: reconnecting with nature.
text: Ryan pans his camera to show a literal PARADE of SHIRTLESS
text: MEN and HALF-NAKED WOMEN with insane bodies all walking up
text: Runyon, taking selfies and shooting videos as they "hike".
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: It's so real up here away from the
text: hustle and bustle of the "LA scene".
text: Behind Ryan, a VAMPY GIRL in crazy skimpy booty shorts,
text: holds her phone down below her ass then brings it up to her
text: face where she smiles and gives a peace sign while holding a
text: package of "Flat Tummy Tea" she's hawking.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
text: Awesome tea. Totes works.
text: At the top of Runyon, Ryan pans the hazy skyline, landing
dialog: back on himself...
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: Honestly though you guys, I don't
dialog: know how the writers are gonna
dialog: improve on the pilot. Such a barn
dialog: burner. I mean, seriously -- how do
dialog: you top opening on a dead body?
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
scene_heading: TWO DEAD BODIES
text: lying on the living room floor. We're...
scene_heading: INT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - DAY
text: Ryan, sporting a very strange 18TH CENTURY ARMY OFFICER'S
text: UNIFORM, kneels into frame.
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: Two dead bodies.
text: Ryan pulls a pair of sunglasses from his coat, inexplicably
text: putting them on for "dramatic effect".
text: The crime scene has been taped off. A couple of BEAT COPS
text: stand watching as a PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures and CORONERS
text: prepare two gurneys.
speaker_heading: MATHERS (0.S.)
dialog: What the fuck are you wearing?
text: Ryan spins to see JESSICA MATHERS snapping on a pair of
text: rubber gloves.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I've got an audition later.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Is it to be a talking hand-job?
dialog: Because you're nailing it.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No. It's for Hamilton, the musical?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Do they serve dinner during it?
text: Mathers pushes past Ryan to take in the dead bodies on the
dialog: floor.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Haw-haw. No -- it's for the movie
dialog: version. They're doing like an
dialog: action re-imagining of it without the
dialog: songs -- I'm going in for Aaron Burr
dialog: who's like the co-lead. He was
text: played by a black guy in the
dialog: original, but he was originally
dialog: originally a white guy, so like, I'm
dialog: kinda right for it? But not ina
dialog: racist way or anything. More like
dialog: returning to the source material or
dialog: whatever.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Look at me. Look at my eyes. I
dialog: literally do not give a fuck.
text: Ryan laughs it off.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hilarious. Great delivery. Anyhow,
dialog: I binge-watched that milk commercial
dialog: like a million times to get inside
text: his head as a character. Doing a
text: deep dive on this one. Pete Berg is
dialog: directing. I hear all the actors are
dialog: gonna go through Navy Seal training
dialog: for it. So cool, right? If I get
dialog: it, it could like totally change my
dialog: career. I'm just wearing this period
dialog: plumage to fully immerse myself in
dialog: the role. Streep says 80% of acting
dialog: is wardrobe.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Unfortunately, the other 20% is you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now if you wouldn't mind shutting the
dialog: fuck up so I can do my job.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Our job. For five more episodes.
dialog: Guaranteed. Partner.
dialog: 4.
text: Ryan smiles smugly. Mathers sighs, but turns her attention
text: back to the bodies and we get our first good look at them:
text: late twenties, MAN and WOMAN, both dressed like they're
text: going to a Renaissance Fair except, bizarrely, the man's
text: wearing the dress and the woman's wearing the pants and
dialog: puffy shirt (Seinfeld™).
text: The man has a KNIFE, buried to the hilt, sticking out of his
text: chest and the woman's face is nearly purple, a small VIAL
text: rests inches from her lifeless fingers.
text: Mathers looks to the BEAT COP standing nearby...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: You first on?
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: (to Ryan)
dialog: Hey, Ry.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey, Frank. What's good?
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
dialog: Same old.
text: They laugh like old pals. Mathers is confused.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: You know him?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Who? Frank? Course I do. Everyone
dialog: knows The Franken-ator. Frankenstein!
text: Ryan and Frank do a fun fist bump thing. Mathers doesn't
dialog: like it one bit.
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
dialog: You still owe me twenty bucks,
dialog: Hansen.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No way! You didn't eat the whole
dialog: thing -- that was the bet!
text: They yuck it up a bit. Clearly, Ryan's a people person and
text: Mathers is deeply annoyed by that.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Hey -- sorry to interrupt
dialog: international grab-ass hour, but you
dialog: two mind knocking it the fuck off?
text: Total killjoy. Frank and Ryan straighten up.
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
dialog: Sorry, Detective.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Run it for me.
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
text: Happened last night. No sign of
text: forced entry. Nothing missing from
dialog: the house as far as we can tell. No
dialog: witnesses. Neighbor found him this
text: morning. Pretty thin.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: We got names?
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
dialog: John Smith and Jane Dough.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: You haven't ID'd them yet?
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
dialog: No, those are their real names.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: God I hate this town.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: This his place?
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
dialog: Yeah. She lives off of Melrose.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Do we know what's in the vial?
speaker_heading: BEAT COP
text: Not yet. Lab boys are running it now.
text: Ryan nods, faking like he's giving this a lot of thought.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What's your read on this one?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Well...they're dead.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah. Same. Same.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: What do you make of their outfits?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Maybe they found out they were
dialog: auditioning for the same role as you
dialog: and they killed themselves out of
dialog: shame.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No chance. These aren't working
dialog: actors. I'd know.
text: Mathers shakes her head.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Okay, Little Lord Fauntleroy, what
dialog: you're looking at here is your garden
dialog: variety murder-suicide, with a
dialog: sprinkle of "Los Angeles normal"
text: cross-dressing thrown in for funsies.
dialog: Quick version: yada-yada motivation,
text: she stabs him...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: 3. A CSI-STYLE GRAINY FLASHBACK--
text: we watch as Jane stabs John in the chest, then slugs back
text: the vial, instantly frothing and clutching her throat.
speaker_heading: MATHERS (V.O.)
text: ...then tosses back whatever Hemlock-
dialog: light is in that vial there to off
dialog: herself. No forced entry, his blood
text: literally on her hands. Adds up
dialog: pretty clean.
speaker_heading: BACK TO:
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: But that's what bothers me about it.
dialog: It's too clean.
text: Ryan nearly jumps out of his blouse-pants.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh dude! That was sick! Great line.
dialog: Total trailer moment!
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: (mimicking her)
dialog: "It's too clean." So good. Can I
dialog: give you a note though? I think you
dialog: could carve it out a little more if
dialog: you add some space work to it. Check
dialog: it.
text: Ryan squats by the bodies, putting his sunglasses back on.
text: He rises, taking them off as he stares into the distance...
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: That's what bothers me about it: it's
dialog: too clean.
dialog: (breaking)
dialog: See? Better right? I think you
dialog: should maybe consider adding a
dialog: toothpick or a match to your mouth.
dialog: Like something you're always chewing
dialog: on? Could be your "thing", plus you
dialog: know, mouth props.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: You're a mouth prop.
dialog: (moving off)
dialog: Come on.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Where are we going?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Jane Dough's place to see if we can
dialog: get some answers.
text: Mathers exits. Ryan calls after her, following...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Ooh! Or a red coffee straw! Like
dialog: you're trying to quit caffeine, but
dialog: we never come out and say it -- it's
dialog: like a mystery! Baller backstory!
scene_heading: INT. MATHERS' CAR - DAY
text: Mathers drives, Ryan rides shotgun. He tugs at his collar,
dialog: sweating.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Why don't you take that thing off.
text: It's like 100 degrees out.
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: Art is suffering.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Especially when you do it.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Make fun, but I'm gonna nail this
dialog: audition tonight.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Your audition is tonight?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: 9pm.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: They hold auditions that late?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's kind of an after-hours thing.
dialog: The assistant associate casting
dialog: director asked me to come in after
dialog: they're closed. I guess she doesn't
dialog: want me to intimidate the other
dialog: actors. She's even keeping it off
text: the books. Very hush hush.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: So...it's a secret audition?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Exactly. I'm pretty much like the
dialog: Zero Dark Thirty of auditioning --
text: swoop in at night, kill Osama -- in
dialog: this case Osama would be the
dialog: audition, not like a real person --
dialog: and get out.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So we better solve this case before
dialog: 9pm tonight, or you're on your own.
dialog: Cuz nothing is keeping me from
dialog: landing this one.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Siri, set an alarm for 9pm tonight,
dialog: the moment my life will change
dialog: forever.
speaker_heading: SIRI
text: True change comes from within.
text: Ryan scratches his neck...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Seriously though, I think I might be
dialog: like legit allergic to wool. Are
dialog: these neck blisters?
scene_heading: EXT. DUPLEX - DAY
text: A modest duplex off of Melrose. Mathers and Ryan
text: the front door.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So what do we know about this place?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: We know she lived here.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Ah. Good. Strong clue.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Just shut up and let me do the
dialog: talking.
text: Mathers knocks on the door. They wait.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Hey -- you think I should have a
dialog: badge?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Yes.
text: Mathers knocks again, louder.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Because you're a moron and it would
dialog: be illegal. But mostly the first
dialog: part.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: How am I supposed to give an
dialog: authentic performance if you guys
dialog: won't let me have a gun or a badge?
dialog: approach
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I guess you'll just have to rely on
text: the suspension of disbelief.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Stay here. I'm gonna take a look
dialog: around back.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What do I do if someone comes to the
dialog: door?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Ask ‘em if they want to buy musket
dialog: insurance.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (90% sure)
dialog: Ha -- that's not a real thing.
text: With that, Mathers moves off around back leaving Ryan solo
text: on the doorstep. Unable to be alone with his thoughts for
text: more than three seconds, Ryan pulls out his phone.
text: He fucks around with some SnapChat face apps: waggy-tongued
text: dog, squeaky-voiced deer, crying baby. Totally normal.
text: Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, Ryan spots movement
text: inside the apartment. He cups his hand to the front window
dialog: and sees
scene_heading: A HOODIED KILLER
text: clutching a knife, slinking through the empty apartment.
text: Ryan's eyes go wide.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: Whaaaa?
text: Suddenly, the bathroom door opens and out steps a stunning
text: SIX-FOOT BLONDE wrapped in a towel having just gotten out of
dialog: the shower.
text: She puts in her ear buds and moves off, unwitting. The
text: Killer closes in on her. Ryan whisper-screams for Mathers...
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: Mathers! Mathers!
dialog: 11.
text: Nothing. No answer. The clock is ticking. No time to
text: lose, Ryan breaks into action!
text: Ryan kicks the door and falls backwards eating shit into
text: some ADJACENT SHRUBBERY. He pops up and throws his shoulder
text: into it. Once, twice, thrice -- BOOM -- the door opens and
dialog: in rushes our hero.
scene_heading: INT. DUPLEX - CONTINUOUS
text: We're hand-held behind the killer as he approaches the
text: girl's back. She unwraps her towel. The Killer raises his
dialog: knife...
text: ...when suddenly RYAN DIVES AT HIM THROUGH A SIDE DOOR,
text: yelling a warrior's cry...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Clooooooney!
text: ...and tackling the would-be assailant to the ground --
speaker_heading: THUD!
text: The girl SCREAMS -- spinning to see Ryan standing on top of
text: the intruder, clutching the knife.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: What the fuck man!? Who are you?!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm Ryan Hansen.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: The Nickelodeon Slime-Time nominated
dialog: actor? I just totally saved your
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: Saved my life? From who?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: From like the killer. Duh.
text: On cue, the Killer groans...
speaker_heading: KILLER
dialog: Ow! I think you broke my arm,
dialog: asshole!
dialog: 12.
text: Ryan looks down and spots the Killer who pulls off his
text: authentic "SCREAM" mask a GoPro strapped to his forehead.
speaker_heading: BLONDE
dialog: That's my scene partner, douche.
dialog: We're rehearsing!
text: Just then, Mathers rushes in, gun drawn.
speaker_heading: BLONDE (cont'd)
dialog: Whoa -- what the hell?!
text: Mathers takes in the situation, putting it together quickly.
text: Her shoulders slump. She sighs...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Dingbat -- what the fuck did you do?
text: Ryan looks down at the Killer...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: My bad, dawg.
scene_heading: MATCH CUT TO:
text: RYAN'S FACE ON SCREEN.
text: we're watching the GoPro footage. It freezes. We're...
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT / CAPTAIN JACKSON'S OFFICE - DAY
text: ...where we meet our new captain, SHARON JACKSON.
dialog: [Reader's Note: the precinct is shot in the same faux docu-
dialog: style aesthetic as THE OFFICE. ]
text: Lady Captain Jackson rewinds the tape in disbelief...
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JACKSON
dialog: Did you really yell "Clooney" before
dialog: attacking?
text: Mathers and Ryan sit in chairs, hang dog.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: George Clooney is my spirit animal.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JACKSON
dialog: Well, your spirit animal is about to
dialog: get the city in a serious god damn
dialog: lawsuit. That Spielberg Scorsese you
text: assaulted is threatening to sue.
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Captain, it was an honest mist--
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JACKSON
dialog: Nope. Detective. You don't get to
dialog: talk. You're on thin enough ice as
dialog: it is.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Honestly, none of this would've
dialog: happened if I had a badge.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JACKSON
dialog: You want a badge? Become a real cop
dialog: and stop dressing like you're in the
text: Nutcracker.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: This is for my Hamilton audition.
dialog: It's period authentic.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JACKSON
dialog: Well, I'm period authentic pissed
dialog: off.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: More genre authentic, but I totally
dialog: honor that feeling. And before we
dialog: dialogue further on this, can I just
dialog: say I think it's such a cool cosmic
dialog: coincidence that the old Captain
dialog: Jackson and you share the same last
dialog: name. Are you guys related?
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JACKSON
dialog: Why? Because we're both black?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (stunned)
dialog: You're black? I honestly didn't
dialog: notice. I don't see color -- just
text: people. And auras.
dialog: (to Mathers)
dialog: Did you know she's black? Crazy,
dialog: right?
text: Mathers looks like she's about to die.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Captain -- I let him out of my sight
dialog: for two seconds, it was a mistake and
dialog: it won't happen again.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: MATHERS (cont'd)
dialog: We've got a good lead on the case and
dialog: we'll close it. I promise.
speaker_heading: CAPTAIN JACKSON
dialog: Yeah -- you better close it. And
dialog: quickly or Vanilla Ice here won't be
dialog: the only one in this room without a
dialog: badge.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now get the hell out of my office.
text: Mathers and Ryan slink out. Ryan whispers...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: FYI, I think she meant you on the
dialog: badge thing.
text: Mathers shoots him a murderous glare.
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT / INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
text: PARKER STARR, formerly the blonde in the towel, sits
text: opposite Ryan and Mathers...
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: What do you mean she's dead?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Well I guess I mean it literally.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: I don't understand, I just saw Jane
dialog: yesterday. She was spending the
dialog: night at John's -- they were gonna
text: rehearse for the showcase tonight.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Showcase?
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Yeah -- it's where a bunch of actors
dialog: do scenes from other plays and movies
dialog: for casting directors.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I know what a showcase is. I'm an
dialog: actor.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: You keep saying that. Would I have
dialog: seen you on anything?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: This. This show that you're
dialog: literally on right now.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: This is a show? Who's it for?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: YouTube Red.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Never heard of ‘em.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No one has. That's the point. My
dialog: partner and I here are gonna put them
text: on the map. Big time. Kabloom.
dialog: Emmy. Kabloom Golden Globe. Kabloom
dialog: other TV award I can't think of right
text: now. Like a SAG or something.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah -- whatever to you.
text: Mathers steps in...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Okay ladies, calm down -- can we just
dialog: focus here. You said she was
dialog: preparing for a performance?
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Yeah -- they were doing the death
dialog: scene from Baz Lurhmann's Romeo &
dialog: Juliet.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That explains the outfits. And they
dialog: flipped gender roles to keep it
dialog: fresh. Clever. Makes perfect sense.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: None of this makes sense. First of
dialog: all Romeo & Juliet was written by
dialog: William Shakespeare.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Technically maybe, but Baz's was like
dialog: way better than the original. Kinda
dialog: like Ocean's Eleven.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: Pre-Titanic Leo. Post-Catalano, pre-
dialog: Homeland Danes. So good. Plus, not
dialog: to make this a history lesson or
dialog: anything, but that Roland Emmerich
dialog: movie totally disproved that
dialog: Shakespeare even ever existed. So...
text: Mathers clenches her jaw, trying to ward off a conniption.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Never mind.
dialog: (to Parker)
dialog: Please, continue.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Well, they were stressed out about
dialog: it. I know because we all are. I'm
dialog: in the class too. Jared and I were
dialog: rehearsing our scene from Scream
dialog: before Mr. Hero here "saved the day"
text: and broke Jared's arm.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Allegedly. FYI -- I'm not really
dialog: approaching my role as a "hero" per
dialog: se, but more of a troubled
dialog: protagonist.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: That's such an obvious choice. Look,
dialog: all I'm saying is tonight's gonna be
dialog: huge. Some big time agents'
dialog: assistants are gonna be in the crowd.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (intrigued)
dialog: Really? Like who?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: (cutting in)
dialog: What's the class called?
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: It's Alfonso Diaphano's exotic scene
dialog: study and review.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Alfonso Diaphano? That's an actual
dialog: human being's name?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: He's only like one of the best acting
text: teachers east of the 405.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: He was Taylor Lautner's on-set coach
dialog: for like all of the Twilight movies.
dialog: He teaches at this old school place
text: downtown. His class is impossible to
dialog: get in to.
dialog: (to Parker)
dialog: You must be good.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Better than you.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (aside to Mathers)
dialog: I don't like her. I think she did
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Relax.
dialog: (to Parker)
dialog: Well, it looks for all the world like
dialog: your roommate, Jane, stabbed her
text: acting partner in the chest and then
dialog: swallowed some poison to off herself
dialog: in the process. Quite the little
dialog: scene stealer, wouldn't you say?
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
text: That doesn't make any sense.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why would she kill John on the same
dialog: day he proposed?
text: Ryan and Mathers share a dumbfounded look.
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT / BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Ryan and Mathers exit the INTERVIEW ROOM and walk toward us
text: through the BULLPEN as we track with them. Ryan checks his
dialog: phone...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: She wasn't lying. Look, Jane updated
text: her Facebook page that morning.
text: JANE DOUGH's Facebook page: a picture of a modest ENGAGEMENT
text: RING on her hand with the tagline: He asked!!! #HappyWife.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: I didn't see an engagement ring on
text: her finger.
dialog: 10
dialog: 18.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: That's because there wasn't one.
text: Mathers mind races. They keep walking. We keep tracking.
speaker_heading: MATHERS (cont'd)
dialog: Still doesn't explain why his blood
text: was on her hands.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We're gonna need some answers.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Totally.
text: Ryan's smirking.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: We just did our first walk and talk
dialog: together.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: This whole thing was just a walk &
dialog: talk one-er. It's like a way to make
dialog: boring plot stuff less boring for the
dialog: audience. They did it all the time
dialog: on The West Wing (so good right?).
dialog: See how we just went in like a big
dialog: circle but nothing really happened--
text: WHACK -- Ryan walks balls-first into a BANISTER BEAM,
text: doubling over and dropping. Mathers doesn't break stride.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: That just did.
scene_heading: INT. PRECINCT / MEDICAL EXAMINER'S ROOM - DAY 10
text: The two DEAD BODIES lie on STAINLESS STEEL SLABS as Ryan and
text: Mathers get the lowdown from PRIYA DAS (30s) a sober Indian-
text: American Medical Examiner. She pulls down her exam mask,
text: revealing a strikingly beautiful face.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: We got the lab results back an hour
dialog: go.
dialog: 19.
text: Ryan is stunned...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Whoa -- time out -- you're crazy hot.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No, I mean that in a good way. Plus,
dialog: your face is like totally diverse.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: What the hell does that mean?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm just saying you could play a
dialog: doctor on TV or something.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: I'm a doctor in real life.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah -- but you could be one on TV.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: Why would I want to do that?
text: Ryan is utterly flummoxed by that response.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I'm gonna step in here. What did the
dialog: labs tell you?
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
text: She drank a concentrated form of a
dialog: chemical compound NaOH.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Sodium Hydroxide.
dialog: (off Mathers look)
dialog: I played a "cool" chemistry teacher
dialog: for a three ep arc on Heart of Dixie
dialog: season five. No biggie.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: He's right. Sodium Hydroxide is the
dialog: active ingredient in Drano. Highly
text: corrosive. She basically chugged
dialog: acid.
dialog: 20.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Ugly way to go. What about the blood
dialog: on her hands?
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: We tested it and it isn't his and
dialog: it's not hers either.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh shit -- is it alien blood?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Ignore him. I don't follow. You're
dialog: saying there was a third party?
speaker_heading: MEDICAL EXAMINER
dialog: No. I'm saying it's not anyone's
text: blood. Because it's not blood at all.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's stage blood.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
text: Corn syrup and red food coloring.
text: To prove her point, Priya runs her gloved finger along the
text: "blood" on Jane, licking it. Ryan gags.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS (cont'd)
dialog: Your partner's correct.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: We're not partners. He's a
text: sanctioned civilian observer.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I'm getting a badge.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: No he's not.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It's being discussed.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: (to Priya)
dialog: I don't understand, why would she
dialog: bother with stage blood if she was
dialog: gonna stab him anyway?
text: Priya picks up an EVIDENCE BAG holding the KNIFE.
dialog: Mathers just
dialog: 21.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
text: This is a prop knife. The blade is
dialog: suppose to retract on impact, but
text: someone blocked the mechanism inside
text: of it, locking it in place.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: So this wasn't a murder-suicide.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: This was a murder-murder sitch.
text: stares at Ryan.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Seriously? What's wrong with you?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What? I'm sorry I don't know the
dialog: fancy term, okay? It's only the
dialog: second episode. We need a technical
dialog: adviser on this show.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I swear to god I'm not gonna make it.
dialog: Look, Streisand, this means there's a
dialog: killer out there and we've gotta find
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (proudly correcting)
dialog: Or her. It could be a her -- women
dialog: can be murderers too. They're just
dialog: as good at killing as men are.
dialog: Equality, you know? I'm with her.
text: Ryan shoots the camera a little "you're welcome" glance.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Let's go.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Where to?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Whoever fixed the prop knife also
text: clearly replaced the fake poison in
dialog: her vial with the real stuff. And
dialog: whoever did that, had to know that
dialog: they were doing that particular scene
dialog: for the showcase -- which means the
dialog: killer is in that stupid acting
dialog: class.
dialog: 22.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Whoa -- that was awesome. You're like
dialog: the first half of A Beautiful Mind.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Come on, we don't have a lot of time.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: One sec...
text: Ryan turns to Priya...
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: Hey Doc Bollywood, I've got some
text: light smile lines coming in here and
dialog: here. Can you just hit ‘em real
dialog: quick before we go.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: Are you asking me for Botox?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Just a quick poke-er-roo with the ol'
dialog: freeze juice and we'll be on our way.
dialog: We're gonna be on the confessional
dialog: couch later and that lens can be like
dialog: super unforgiving.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Are you fucking serious right now?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh and she could use it too. Like a
dialog: lot. Like pretty much everywhere.
dialog: Hose her down.
dialog: (stage whisper)
dialog: She's from Cleveland.
speaker_heading: PRIYA DAS
dialog: Gross.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Right?

text: Mathers and Ryan talk with a scarf-wearing ALFONSO DIAPHANO
text: (60s) who flutters about the space getting things ready for
text: the big show tonight. Actors rehearse in the background.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Mr. Diaphano, thanks for the time, is
dialog: there anyone in the showcase tonight
dialog: that might've had a reason to dislike
dialog: Jane or John?
speaker_heading: ALFONSO DIAPHANO
dialog: Darling -- try everyone. Jane and
dialog: John were far and away the best
dialog: actors in the class and tonight they
dialog: would've shown it by blowing all the
dialog: other performers off the stage. I
dialog: bet half of them are secretly
dialog: thrilled those two won't be going on
dialog: tonight. The spotlight, after all,
dialog: is only so big.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: So true. So true.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO DIAPHANO
dialog: Do I know you from something?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Probably. I'm Ryan Hansen.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO DIAPHANO
dialog: (long beat)
dialog: Nope.
text: Alfonso moves on, Mathers and Ryan follow.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I'm sorry, you're telling me an actor
dialog: would kill another actor just for a
dialog: chance to get noticed?
text: Alfonso looks to Ryan confused. He explains...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: She's from Cleveland.
text: Alfonso makes a face like he caught a whiff of something.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I know, I know -- "gross".
dialog: 24.
text: Suddenly, Alfonso gets a text message. He checks it.
speaker_heading: ALFONSO DIAPHANO
dialog: I'm sorry. I must go. Ashton has an
dialog: on-set scene emergency. They want
dialog: him to keep his shirt on. The fools.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Good luck finding the "killer" -- so
dialog: dramatic!
text: With that, Alfonso sashays off. Ryan turns to Mathers.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Look -- there's only one way to solve
dialog: this crime and catch the killer. You
dialog: thinking what I'm thinking?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I can promise you I'm not.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (jazz hands)
dialog: It's a...
scene_heading: 13. INT. WELL-LIT SOFA - DAY 13
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: ...Showcase showdown!
text: On the Modern Family-style confessional couch, Ryan and
text: Mathers address the camera directly.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: We're going undercover at tonight's
dialog: to do. We find that engagement ring,
dialog: we find the killer. Right, partner?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: We're not partners.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You're right. We're not partners.
dialog: We're more important than that to
dialog: each other now. We're scene
dialog: partners.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: This is going to be unbearable.
dialog: 14
dialog: 15
dialog: 25.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (excited)
dialog: I know, right? And I have the
dialog: perfect scene for us to do together.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / STAGE - NIGHT 14
text: A HALF-FULL AUDIENCE watches Ryan and Mathers, both soaking
text: wet and dressed like McAdams & Gosling from The Notebook,
text: standing center stage. A makeshift "rain machine" offers up
text: a two-foot wide deluge directly over Ryan.
text: Mathers gives the stiffest reading imaginable, checking her
text: palm for cribbed lines as she goes.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Why didn't you write me? Why? It
dialog: wasn't over for me. I waited for you
dialog: for seven years. And now it is too
dialog: late.
text: Ryan chews the scenery...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you
dialog: every day for a year.
text: Mathers misses her cue. Ryan prompts her. She reluctantly
dialog: obliges...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: You wrote me?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yes. It wasn't over. It still isn't
dialog: over.
text: Ryan goes to pull Mathers in for the big movie star kiss
text: moment but she quickly pivots and hip-tosses Ryan to the
text: stage in a slick Judu move.
text: Ryan writhes. Mathers bows and gives a genuine smile,
text: pleased with herself. A confused crowd applauds lightly.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN LA THEATER / BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 15
text: Ryan and Mathers come off stage. Ryan is hot...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: What the hell was that?
dialog: 26.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I'm sorry okay? It was a reaction.
dialog: I thought you were attacking me.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Attacking you?! With my mouth?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: How was I supposed to know -- I've
dialog: never seen the movie, okay?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: You've never seen The Notebook???
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I don't like movies. I find them
dialog: hard to believe.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I can't even with you.
text: Ryan moves to a WALL OF HEADSHOTS and starts pulling them
text: down, one after the other.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: What the hell are you doing?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Our job. These are all the head
text: shots for the actors in the showcase
text: tonight. On the back are their
text: resumes. At the bottom of every
dialog: acting resume is a little section
dialog: called, "special skills" which no one
dialog: ever reads. Except me, right now,
dialog: because whoever our killer is...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: ...-has to have a background in
dialog: Chemistry.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I was gonna say probably studied
dialog: Meisner. But that could work too.
text: Mathers starts pulling off head shots too. They scan them
text: tossing them aside as they go. Ryan shakes his head...
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: Seriously -- rollerblading counts?
dialog: 27.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Hello there. Guess who minored in
dialog: Organic Chemistry at Baylor?
text: Mathers turns her phone to show Ryan...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Told ya...
speaker_heading: HARD CUT TO:
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR,
text: wrapped in a robe, putting on make-up in a BACKSTAGE MIRROR.
speaker_heading: RYAN (0.S.)
dialog: .++.women can be killers too.
text: Reveal Ryan and Mathers in the mirror. Parker spins.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Not a lot of six-foot blondes know
dialog: how to synthesize sodium hydroxide
text: from liquid plumber.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: And only one person in Alfonso's
dialog: class does.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: You're under arrest, gigantor.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Honestly -- this all feels a little
dialog: straight forward to me. I was hoping
dialog: for more of a twist ending.
text: On cue, a gun slides into frame pointed right at the back of
text: Ryan's head.
speaker_heading: JARED (0.S.)
dialog: How's this for a twist?
text: Reveal: JARED, Parker's scene partner from the GoPro shoot.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: More of a reveal, but I'll take it.
text: Jared, sporting a cast on his broken arm, shoves Ryan and
text: Mathers DEEPER BACK STAGE, away from everyone, as Parker
text: joins his side smiling smugly.
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: There was no way we were going to let
dialog: those two steal the show tonight.
dialog: I'm the one who got Jane into this
text: class in the first place.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: So you killed your friend just for a
dialog: performance?
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: She wasn't my friend, she was my
dialog: competition. But that's not why I
dialog: killed her.
text: Parker pulls on her necklace, revealing Jane's ENGAGEMENT
speaker_heading: RING.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR (cont'd)
dialog: I killed her because I was in love
dialog: with her. And if I couldn't have
dialog: her, no one could.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Oh shit -- lesbian stuff. This is so
dialog: HBO, I love it. Plus it really
dialog: connects with our LGBTQ demo.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Oh I get it. You're not "actor
dialog: crazy" you're just crazy-crazy.
dialog: What's your plan, sweetheart? Kill
dialog: us both? Make it look like another
dialog: murder-suicide?
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Why not? After the performance you
dialog: two gave, anyone would believe you
text: left the stage and immediately killed
dialog: yourselves.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: How dare you.
text: Ryan lunges forward -- Mathers steps in front of him,
text: holding him back.
dialog: Just then,
text: a CHUBBY DUDE dressed like Uma Thurman from Kill
text: Bill steps in...
scene_heading: KILL BILL DUDE
dialog: Parker, you guys are up next -- whoa.
dialog: 16
dialog: 29.
text: He stops short at the sight. Parker and Jared are
text: momentarily distracted. Mathers takes advantage -- knocking
text: the gun from Jared's hand.
text: Instantly, it's chaos -- Ryan grabs for Parker who slips out
text: of his grasp leaving him with a handful of terry cloth robe,
text: revealing herself to only be wearing skimpy black lace
text: undies and heels. Distracting to say the least.
text: Mathers pulls her gun but is flattened by the Kill Bill Dude
text: who Jared shoves at her, snatching up his own gun and
text: running toward the stage.
text: Parker takes off in the opposite direction, grabbing the
text: Kill Bill Dude's KATANA SWORD as she goes -- slamming
text: through a door that's marked ROOF ACCESS.
text: Ryan and Mathers pop up together...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: You go after him, I'll handle her.
text: Mathers rolls her eyes: typical.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: What? She's the one without a gun.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Just go!
text: The partners split up.
scene_heading: INT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / STAGE - MOMENTS LATER 16
text: Jared comes rushing out on stage interrupting a very
text: emotional scene from Fast and Furious (apparently Dominic
text: Torretto lives his life a quarter of a mile at a time).
text: Jared leaps from the stage and hurries down the center aisle
text: just as Mathers appears from behind the curtain.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Freeze! LAPD!
text: BANG!-BANG! Jared fires a couple of pot-shots before
text: exiting through a SIDE DOOR. Mathers dives out of the way.
text: The actors are confused, but crowd loves it, pulling out
text: their phones; filming and posing for "Peace Sign" selfies as
text: the action unfolds behind them.
dialog: 17
dialog: 18
dialog: 30.
text: Mathers shakes her heads in disgust as she sprints past
dialog: these Los Angeles idiots...
speaker_heading: MATHERS (cont'd)
dialog: Someone call 911!
text: She pounds through the side door in hot pursuit.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / ROOFTOP - NIGHT 17
text: Ryan pushes through the ACCESS DOOR onto the roof. Steam
text: vents and the downtown skyline give the whole thing a lush
dialog: LA Noire vibe.
text: Ryan scans the rooftop, no sign of Parker. He pivots back
text: and suddenly ducks, barely avoiding decapitation from the
text: leggy blonde's home run swing -- THWACK! Steam shoots out
text: of a freshly severed pipe as a wild-eyed Parker steps into
dialog: her light...
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: You thought I was a guest star on
dialog: your show?! Wrong! You're just a
dialog: day player on mine!
text: She attacks, unleashing a flurry of swings as Ryan scrambles
text: back narrowly dodging each one.
text: It's an odd, albeit kinda sexy, sight as a six foot model in
text: five inch heels, swings a four foot sword in her underwear.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (ducking)
dialog: Don't you think this is a little
dialog: gratuitous?
dialog: (ducking)
dialog: I mean, I can't really tell if this
dialog: is super misogynistic or like a
dialog: female empowerment thing? Can you?
text: Another swing sparks off of stone as Ryan jumps out of the
dialog: way.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / ALLEY - NIGHT 18
text: Jared hustles toward us just as Mathers pops into the alley
text: from the side door. He fires at her. She dives for cover.
dialog: 19
dialog: 31.
text: He's got her pinned, but Mathers spots something. She fires
text: two precise shots -- clipping a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER just
text: above Jared's head. The heavy iron ladder comes down like a
text: guillotine, clonking Jared on the head. Out cold.
text: Mathers rushes up to him, kicking his gun away and cuffing
text: him to the ladder. Then she hears a GIRL SHRIEK. She looks
text: up to see Ryan standing on the ledge of the roof, his back
text: to her.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Shit.
text: She takes off running.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER / ROOFTOP - NIGHT 19
text: His Jordan 6's on the edge of the coping, Ryan's out of real
text: estate. Parker smiles...
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Any last words?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Wait -- I'm sorry, featured extras
dialog: aren't allowed to speak.
text: She raises her sword when suddenly...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Wait! Wait -- okay?!
text: Something in Ryan's tone give Parker pause. Gone is his
dialog: glib charm, this is now something real for him...
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: I get it. I know why you killed her.
dialog: I know what it's like to love
dialog: something that doesn't love you back.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've been a working actor for over a
dialog: decade, but most people confuse me
dialog: with Ryan Phillippe. And I've
dialog: finally, after all these years, got
dialog: my own show and it's not even on
text: television. It's on a website that
text: most people think they jerk off to.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I know your pain, Parker. I'm the
dialog: same as you. We all hurt.
text: Moved by his words, all the fire goes out of Parker, she
text: lowers her sword...
dialog: 32.
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Thank you.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: No, thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Can I just ask you one thing?
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: Sure. What?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Who's your favorite Batman?
text: Huh? Parker doesn't follow. Then we hear the cry...
speaker_heading: MATHERS (0.S.)
dialog: Clooooney!
text: Parker spins just in time to take a crisp right cross to the
text: jaw from Mathers -- CLUNK. The spindly blonde goes down in
text: a heap of knees and elbows, one punch knock out.
text: Ryan looks to Mathers...
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Took you long enough.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I didn't want to interrupt your
dialog: monologue.
text: Mathers cuffs Parker, helping her to her wobbly feet.
speaker_heading: RYAN
text: Case closed. Cue the sirens.
text: Indeed, the sound of police sirens. Parker scowls at
dialog: Ryan...
speaker_heading: PARKER STARR
dialog: You tricked me!
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (big smile)
dialog: It's called acting, bitch. Look it
dialog: up.
text: Mathers drags her off. Ryan watches smugly, then...
speaker_heading: SIRI
dialog: Your Hamilton audition starts now.
dialog: 20
dialog: 33.
text: Ryan curses, he can't believe he forgot. Devastating.
scene_heading: EXT. DOWNTOWN LA BLACK BOX THEATER - NIGHT 20
text: Flashing lights and a lovely little crane shot let us know
dialog: that we've reached the aftermath.
text: Parker and Jared are shoved into the back of a waiting squad
text: car as Mathers and Ryan walk toward us...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I'm sorry you missed your big
dialog: audition.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: (glum)
dialog: Thanks.
text: Mathers tries to buck him up...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: Look -- it's an aftermath scene. You
text: love aftermath scenes.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Yeah. I guess so.
text: Just then, a 22 year-old AGENT'S ASSISTANT in a suit
text: approaches gushing over Mathers...
scene_heading: AGENT'S ASSISTANT
dialog: You were incredible! "Freeze LAPD!"
dialog: Amazing! So authentic!
text: He hands her his card.
speaker_heading: AGENT'S ASSISTANT (cont'd)
dialog: I work in Adam Venit's office at WME.
dialog: Call me, I can get you work tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I'm not an actress. I'ma cop.
scene_heading: AGENT'S ASSISTANT
dialog: Method! I love it! Don't change.
text: He moves off. Mathers just shakes her head...
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I think he still had his baby teeth.
dialog: You want this?
dialog: 21
dialog: 34.
text: She offers his card to Ryan who shakes his head, defeated.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: I just wanna go home.
text: Ryan moves off. We hold on Mathers feeling for him.
scene_heading: INT. RYAN'S SIT COM HOME SET - DAY 21
text: AMY and Ryan's THREE GIRLS sit at the kitchen table with JON
text: CRYER, each with multiple devices in front of them (laptops,
text: iPhones, iPads, etc.) tapping away feverishly. Ryan's
dialog: youngest complains...
scene_heading: YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
dialog: Mommy, my finger hurts.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I know, honey. Just a couple more
dialog: hours -- Daddy needs as many clicks
dialog: as possible for his show to stay on
dialog: the internet.
speaker_heading: JON CRYER
dialog: I love this -- it's like the cutest
dialog: little sweatshop ever.
text: The STUDIO AUDIENCE laughs.
scene_heading: OLDEST DAUGHTER
dialog: Mom -- how come I haven't seen a
dialog: single ad for stuff I don't want and
dialog: can't skip on YouTube?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: That's because you're not on
dialog: YouTube -- you're on YouTube Red.
dialog: YouTube's Premium Subscription
dialog: Service channel.
dialog: (to camera)
dialog: It's a bargain at only $9.99 a month.
scene_heading: MIDDLE DAUGHTER
dialog: Like NetFlix?
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, they both cost the same.
scene_heading: OLDEST DAUGHTER
dialog: I wanna watch The Crown.
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well all do, honey. Well all do.
dialog: Keep clicking.
speaker_heading: JON CRYER
dialog: Hang on -- you guys are on YouTube
dialog: Red?
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Well, that explains a lot.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: What site have you been on this whole
dialog: time?
text: Amy moves to look at Jon's laptop. He quickly closes it,
text: standing up.
speaker_heading: JON CRYER
dialog: A very different website with a very
dialog: similar name. But the categories
dialog: section make a lot more sense now.
text: The audience laughs knowingly. Cryer moves to the door just
text: as it opens and in walks Ryan. The audience cheers his
dialog: entrance.
scene_heading: YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
dialog: Daddy!
text: All three girls rush their father. He kneels down for a
text: hug. It makes him smile.
scene_heading: MIDDLE DAUGHTER
dialog: We've been clicking on your show to
dialog: help you stay internet famous, even
dialog: though we can't watch The Crown on
dialog: it.
scene_heading: OLDEST DAUGHTER
dialog: Or Stranger Things.
scene_heading: YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
dialog: Or Narcos.
scene_heading: MIDDLE DAUGHTER
dialog: Or House of Cards.
text: The effort melts Ryan.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Aw -- thanks, guys.
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why hello there, white Aaron Burr.
dialog: How'd the big audition go?
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: It didn't. I missed it.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: You missed it? Oh no -- why?
speaker_heading: MATHERS (0.S.)
dialog: Because he was helping me solve a
dialog: case.
text: Mathers enters. The audience cheers. She's still not used
dialog: to it.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: I couldn't have done it without him.
text: Ryan nods a thank you to Mathers.
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Well, there will be other auditions.
speaker_heading: JON CRYER
dialog: Not for Hamilton there won't.
dialog: Byeeee!
text: The crowd laughs as Jon Cryer scoots off waving to them.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: That's okay. I don't need Hamilton,
dialog: I've got you guys.
text: A big family hug. The crowd "Awwws". The hug ends. Ryan
text: turns to Mathers.
speaker_heading: RYAN (cont'd)
dialog: See ya tomorrow.
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: See ya tomorrow.
text: Mathers goes to the door, but stops and turns back.
speaker_heading: MATHERS (cont'd)
dialog: Hey Haircut --
text: Ryan turns.
speaker_heading: MATHERS (cont'd)
dialog: Catch.
dialog: 22
dialog: 37.
text: Mathers tosses him something. He catches it. Then looks to
text: see it's a SHINY GOLD BADGE.
speaker_heading: RYAN
dialog: Are you serious?
speaker_heading: MATHERS
dialog: It's a meter maid's badge, but I
dialog: don't think anyone will notice.
dialog: (then)
dialog: See you tomorrow...scene partner.
text: It's a warm moment. The crowd reacts appropriately. Ryan
text: smiles. Mathers nods back. Jon Cryer pops back in...
speaker_heading: JON CRYER
dialog: Does anyone know how to clear a
dialog: browser history? Asking for a friend.
text: The audience laughs. So does everyone on stage. FREEZE.
scene_heading: END OF EPISODE.
