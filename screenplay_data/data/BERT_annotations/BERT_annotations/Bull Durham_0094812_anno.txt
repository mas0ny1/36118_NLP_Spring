dialog: 
dialog: In baseball, you don't know nothing.
dialog: --Yogi Berra
dialog: 
dialog: Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better
dialog: learn baseball.
dialog: --Jacques Barzun
dialog: 
dialog: You could look it up.
dialog: --Casey Stengel
dialog: 
dialog: Titles over --
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
text: A series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient.
text: BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant
text: upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The
text: huge bat in an elegant follow-through...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: TY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them
text: all, a balletic whirling dervish.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: JACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag.
dialog: Too late.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking
text: down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five.
scene_heading: PULLBACK REVEALS:
text: A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table
text: covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old
text: baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar --
text: also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora
dialog: Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it
text: glows with the candles like some religious altar.
text: We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (V.O.)
dialog: I believe in the Church of Baseball.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've tried all the major religions
dialog: and most of the minor ones -- I've
dialog: worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma,
text: Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and
dialog: Isadora Duncan...
text: PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon
text: light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a
text: small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up.
text: ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty,
text: knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern
text: lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern,
dialog: National and International borders. She's cosmic.
speaker_heading: ANNIE (V.O.)
dialog: I know things. For instance --
dialog: (beat)
text: There are 108 beads in a Catholic
dialog: rosary. And --
dialog: (beat)
text: There are 108 stitches in a baseball.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: When I learned that, I gave Jesus a
dialog: chance.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: But it just didn't work out between
dialog: us. The Lord laid too much guilt on
dialog: me. I prefer metaphysics to theology.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You see, there's no guilt in
dialog: baseball... and it's never boring.
text: ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the
text: door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps.
text: She sits on a bench and
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Which makes it like sex.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: There's never been a ballplayer slept
dialog: with me who didn't have the best
dialog: year of his career.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Making love is like hitting a baseball --
dialog: you just got to relax and concentrate.
text: ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up
text: her calves as she does.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Besides, I'd never sleep with a player
dialog: hitting under .250 unless he had a
dialog: lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove
text: man up the middle.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A woman's got to have standards.
text: SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side.
text: Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: The young players start off full of
dialog: enthusiasm and energy but they don't
dialog: realize that come July and August
dialog: when the weather is hot it's hard to
dialog: perform at your peak level.
dialog: (beat)
text: The veterans pace themselves better.
dialog: They finish stronger. They're great
dialog: in September.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: While I don't believe a woman needs
dialog: a man to be fulfilled, I do confess
dialog: an interest in finding the ultimate
dialog: guy -- he'd have that youthful
dialog: exuberance but the veteran's sense
dialog: of timing...
text: ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official
text: scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Y'see there's a certain amount of
dialog: "life-wisdom" I give these boys.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I can expand their minds. Sometimes
dialog: when I've got a ballplayer alone
dialog: I'll just read Emily Dickinson or
text: Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so
dialog: sweet -- they always stay and listen.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Of course a guy will listen to
dialog: anything if he thinks it's foreplay.
text: ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly,
text: in her cleavage.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I make then feel confident. They
dialog: make me feel safe. And pretty.
text: ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress
text: along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses.
text: Stylish and slightly mad.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: What I give them lasts a life-time.
dialog: What they give me lasts 142 games.
dialog: Sometimes it seems like a bad trade.
dialog: (quickly rebounding)
dialog: But bad trades are part of baseball --
dialog: who can forget Frank Robinson or
dialog: Milt Pappas, for Godsakes!
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It's a long season and you got to
dialog: trust it.
text: ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK
text: A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe
text: house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway.
text: ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic,
dialog: old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other
text: people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM
text: BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I've tried them all -- I really have --

dialog: the Church of Baseball.

scene_heading: EXT. THE CHURCH -- DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK

text: People are arriving on foot from all around...
text: "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air.
text: CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate
text: doing his famous Bill Haley routine. A comic pitcher's windup
text: full of twists and goofy choreography.
scene_heading: RECORDING OVER P.A.

dialog: o'clock, rock... Four o'clock, five
dialog: o'clock, six o'clock rock...
text: ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped
text: off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to
text: her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and
dialog: friend.
text: A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women,
text: dressed in tight pants, tight everything.
text: Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE.

text: for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with
text: his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer
text: whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges.
text: LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink
text: bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly
text: together. Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the
text: giant chaw into his mouth.
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Where's Ebby?
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Ain't he warning up?
speaker_heading: SKIP

dialog: Oh, Millie, jeez, sorry -- I didn't
dialog: recognize ya. Don't take it personal

dialog: you're banned from the ballpark.
speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: You can't ban me from the ballpark
dialog: 'cause Daddy donated the scoreboard
dialog: and if you banned me he might take
text: the scoreboard away.
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Whatta we need a scoreboard for? We
dialog: haven't scored any runs all year
dialog: (tough, to Ebby)
dialog: Get your ass out there.
text: As Skip starts to leave.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Hey Boss, I got a question.
speaker_heading: SKIP

dialog: What?!
speaker_heading: EBBY

text: Skip stares at him. He can't believe this guy.
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Ya got three minutes.
text: SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS BACK OUT TO THE FIELD -- And Ebby

speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: I got lured.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You didn't get "lured". Women never

speaker_heading: MILLIE
dialog: "I didn't get lured and I will take

speaker_heading: JACKSON
dialog: What's it say?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: It says he's not bending his back on

text: THE DOOR OPENS -- A PLAYER ENTERS, in street clothes, carrying
text: his suitcases. CRASH DAVIS, 30, older than the other players.
text: And different. More than just opinions, he actually has a
text: point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever
dialog: he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the
dialog: world without baseball. Also unlike Ebby -- he loves baseball
dialog: desperately.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Who're you?
text: Crash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride,
text: like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: I am the player to be named later.

speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Crash Davis?
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: The Crash Davis.
dialog: (beat, then nonstop)
dialog: And you, Larry Hockett, should

dialog: in the Texas League when you were

dialog: Beats hell outta working at Sears.
speaker_heading: LARRY
dialog: Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.
dialog: Sold Lady Kenmores -- it's nasty,
dialog: nasty work.
speaker_heading: SKIP
dialog: Even if it's the Carolina League --
dialog: this is a chance to play everyday.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: You don't want a player, you want a
dialog: stable pony. My Triple A contract
dialog: gets bought out so I can hold the
dialog: Flavor o' the Month's dick in the
dialog: bus leagues?!
dialog: (angrily)
dialog: Fuck this fucking game... I fuckin'
dialog: quit.

dialog: When I die I'm gonna have my ashes

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: I don't dance.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I don't trust a man who don't dance.
dialog: It ain't natural.
text: SUDDENLY -- HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL on the juke box. Several

text: EBBY DANCES WITH A GROUPIE -- Spinning and whirling,

text: ANNIE, CRASH AND MAX WATCH the mad performance.
speaker_heading: MAX
dialog: Who's he dancing with?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: All of 'em, I think...
text: EBBY PUTS ON A ONE MAN SHOW ON THE DANCE FLOOR -- The whole
text: bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish.
text: A quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show. More naive, fun. He
text: climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Thanks for the note -- you're right,
dialog: I wasn't bending my back.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You got a live arm there.

speaker_heading: EBBY

text: The two men square off quickly. Annie mocks them.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You boys gonna fight over little me?
text: CRASH RISES, pulling Annie with him. But --
text: EBBY STANDS to challenge Crash.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Step outside, pal.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: Love to --
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: Take the first shot at me.
speaker_heading: EBBY

speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: Hit me in the chest with this...
text: CRASH PULLS A BASEBALL from his jacket pocket, tosses it to
dialog: Ebby.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: I'd kill ya.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: From what I hear you couldn't hit a

speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Don't try me.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause
dialog: you're starting to think about it
dialog: already, you're starting to think
dialog: how embarrassing it'll be to miss,
dialog: how all these people would laugh.
dialog: (teasing mercilessly)
dialog: C'mon, Rook -- show me that million
dialog: dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good
dialog: idea about the five cent head --
text: EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away,
text: right at Crash's chest. But, alas --
text: THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance.
text: Crash never blinks.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: Ball four.
text: EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Who the fuck are you?!
text: CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed,
text: effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there
text: stunned. He looks up.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher.

speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: We fight, she gets the clown -- how's
dialog: that happen?
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: Shut up -- I like this song...
dialog: (sings along)
dialog: April in Paris, this is a feeling,
dialog: No one can ever reprieve...
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: She's playing with my mind.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: It's a damn easy thing to play with.
text: ANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Well -- you boys stopped fighting
dialog: yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love
dialog: a little macho male bonding -- I
dialog: think it's sweet even if it's probably
dialog: latent homosexuality being "re-

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Shall we go to my place?
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Which one of us?
speaker_heading: ANNIE

text: THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles.
text: EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men

text: than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor
dialog: league career.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: These are the ground rules.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I hook up with one guy a season -- I

dialog: promising prospects of the season so
dialog: far.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So... I thought we should get to
dialog: know each other.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: Why do you get to choose? Why don't
dialog: I get to choose?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Actually none of us on this planet
dialog: ever really choose each other. It's
dialog: all Quantum Physics and molecular
dialog: attraction. There are laws we don't
dialog: understand that bring us together
dialog: and break us apart.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Is somebody gonna go to bed with
dialog: somebody or what?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: You're a regular nuclear meltdown,
dialog: honey -- slow down.
text: Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: After 12 years in the minor leagues,
dialog: I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't
dialog: believe in, Quantum Physics when it
dialog: comes to matters of the heart... or
dialog: loins.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (challenging him)
dialog: What do you believe in?
text: Crash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting.
text: He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: I believe in the soul, the cock, the
text: pussy, the small of a woman's back,
text: the hanging curve ball, high fiber,
dialog: good scotch, long foreplay, show
dialog: tunes, and that the novels of Thomas
dialog: Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated
dialog: crap.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald
dialog: acted alone, I believe that there
dialog: oughtta be a constitutional amendment
dialog: outlawing astro-turf and the
dialog: designated hitter, I believe in the
dialog: "sweet spot", voting every election,
dialog: soft core pornography, chocolate
dialog: chip cookies, opening your presents
dialog: on Christmas morning rather than
dialog: Christmas eve, and I believe in long,
text: slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that
dialog: last for 7 days.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (breathless)
dialog: Oh my...
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Don't leave...
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: G'night.

speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff?
text: ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I
dialog: want is a date. I'm not gonna fall
dialog: in love with you or nothin'.
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: I'm not interested in a woman who's
dialog: interested in that boy.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: I'm not interested yet.
text: Ebby appears in the door.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Who you calling a "boy"?
speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: See ya at the yard, Meat.
text: Crash walks out into the Durham night. Ebby and Annie stand
text: in the doorway. She speaks softly to Ebby.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No ballplayer ever said "no" to a
dialog: date with me.
speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Well shit, then, let's fuck.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Wait, honey, slow down -- I want to

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, no, no. Put it back on and take

speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: No, no, honey... first the shoes and

speaker_heading: EBBY
dialog: The socks? It's cold in here.
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: (sweetly, unthreatening)
dialog: You think Dwight Gooden leaves his

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: When you're hitting you shouldn't
dialog: think about anything but hitting.
dialog: (beat)

speaker_heading: ANNIE
text: Young men are uncomplicated.
dialog: (Crash mutters)
dialog: And he's not "dim". He's just

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: CRASH
dialog: 247 home runs in the minors would be
dialog: a dubious honor, if ya think about

dialog: guy like me 'cause it might be real
dialog: so you sabotage it with some bullshit
dialog: about commitment to a young boy you
dialog: can boss around --
dialog: (whack -- a line drive)
dialog: Great deal. You get to write self-
dialog: indulgent little poems all winter
dialog: about how hard it is to find a man
dialog: even though you just sent him packing --
dialog: (whack -- a line drive)
dialog: So what do you really want? You wanta

dialog: in the bullshit of magic?
dialog: (whack -- a line drive)

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: The right nostril. Good.
speaker_heading: NUKE
dialog: My right nostril?
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: There are two important psychic
dialog: conduits called the "pingala" and

dialog: nostril.
text: She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of

speaker_heading: NUKE
dialog: I'm really beat. I need some serious

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: NUKE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: A little better.
speaker_heading: NUKE

speaker_heading: NUKE

speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: NUKE

speaker_heading: ANNIE

dialog: lemonade!
text: Jackson runs over in full gear to join them.

speaker_heading: NUKE

speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: It's all the same thing.
text: SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.
speaker_heading: NUKE
dialog: What's that?!
scene_heading: -- P.O.V. A CARDBOARD BOX ON A TABLE NEARBY -- Scrawled in

speaker_heading: ANNIE

text: Nuke stares, unsettled.
speaker_heading: NUKE
dialog: God... I think I'm gonna be sick --
speaker_heading: ANNIE
dialog: Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing
dialog: to be scared of. It's just another

dialog: start -- kinda like spring training.
text: Nuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at
text: Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.
speaker_heading: NUKE
dialog: Death is like spring training?
speaker_heading: ANNIE

speaker_heading: NUKE
dialog: Annie says her panties will keep one
dialog: side of my brain occupied while I'm
dialog: on the mound, thus keeping my brain
text: slightly off center, which is where
dialog: it should be for artists and pitchers.
dialog: She also said I should throw whatever

speaker_heading: CRASH

speaker_heading: DEKE

text: SEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke
text: as the players are dressing into their uniforms.
speaker_heading: NUKE
dialog: Annie says there's no such thing as
dialog: straight and gay. We're all sexual
dialog: creatures to start with, and we get

speaker_heading: TOMMY
dialog: You believe that?
speaker_heading: NUKE

dialog: hair.
text: CRASH RESPONDS -- They kiss slowly, deeply. As --
text: HIS HAND ON HER HIP PULLS UP HER SKIRT -- By degrees, the
