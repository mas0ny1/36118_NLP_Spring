scene_heading: MUSIC IN: OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT
scene_heading: SUBTITLE: NEW YORK CITY, FALL 1981
text: It's raining. A cab speeds down a dark, bumpy side-street.
scene_heading: INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS
text: Looking in his rearview mirror, the cab driver checks out his
text: passenger: a sweaty young man in a gold blazer with a "P"
text: insignia over his breast pocket. Several paper bags on the
text: back seat hedge him in. The young man is immersed in the
text: scrawled list he clutches in his hand. A passing street
text: light momentarily illuminates the list and we glimpse a few
dialog: of the entries: double-coated waterproof fuse (500 feet);
dialog: .38 ammo (hollowpoint configuration); potato chips (Lays).
speaker_heading: GONG SHOW
text: An excerpt from The Gong Show (reenacted). The video image
text: fills the screen. We watch a fat man recite Hamlet,
text: punctuating his soliloquy with loud belching noises. The
text: audience is booing. Eventually the man gets gonged. Chuck
text: Barris, age 50, hat pulled over his eyes, dances out from the
text: wings to comfort the agitated performer.
speaker_heading: PERFORMER
dialog: Why'd they do that? I wasn't done.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (AGE 50)
dialog: I don't understand. Juice, why'd you
dialog: gong this nice man?
scene_heading: JAYE P. MORGAN
dialog: Not to be. That is the answer.
text: The studio audience laughs.
dialog: 2.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT
text: The cab sloshes to a stop in front of a liquor store. The
text: young man gets out, jogs through the rain toward the
text: fluorescent storefront. The cab driver waits, listens to
text: staticky reports in a foreign language on his radio. The
text: meter is running. The back seat is piled high with bags.
speaker_heading: GONG SHOW
text: Chuck Barris spastically dances on the screen along with Gene
text: Gene the Dancing Machine. Barris turns to the camera, points
text: at it.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: We'll be right back with more stuff.
scene_heading: INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT
text: The back of the cab is filled with even more bags and boxes.
text: The cab stops. The young man gets out and confers with a
text: shady looking guy on the corner. The young man pulls out a
text: big wad of cash. Money and a small package change hands.
text: The meter in the cab is at thirty-five dollars and change.
text: THE GONG SHOW
text: Chuck Barris is being sniffed in the crotch by a large dog.
text: The audience howls with glee. Suddenly the video image
text: explodes. Slow motion sparks and shards of glass shoot
text: toward the camera. We pull back to reveal we're in a
text: darkened, messy hotel room. We pan across the walls, past
text: taped-up, yellowed newspaper clippings with headlines like
dialog: "Gong Show a New Low in Television", "The Dumbing of
dialog: America", and "Chuck Barris is the Decline of Western
text: Civilization." We come to rest on a naked middle-aged man
text: crouching in the shadows in the corner, holding a gun. This
text: is Chuck Barris. The television continues to sputter, spark,
text: and smoke. There is a knock at the door.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: (mumbly)
dialog: Fuck. Shit. Piss.
text: Naked Barris, still holding the gun, seems panicked. He
text: hesitates, trying to determine his options. Should he answer
text: the door? Should he climb out onto the window ledge?
text: Finally, he creeps to the door and peeks out the peephole for
text: a long moment. He unlocks the door, opens it. The sweaty,
text: young man, a bellhop, stands there with his many bags.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 3.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He tries to appear casual as takes in the sight: a naked
text: Chuck Barris holding a gun, an exploded, smoking tv set in
dialog: the background.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: More stuff?
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Yes sir, Mr. Barris. Everything you
dialog: requested. Except I couldn't find a...
dialog: (consults list)
dialog: ... DH-10 directional fragmentation mine.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Well, it's late.
dialog: (mumbling and bowing)
dialog: But thank you. Thank you for trying.
dialog: You are a scholar and a...
text: Barris trails off, gives a quick glance both ways down the
text: hall, then motions for the bellhop to enter. The bellhop
text: places the bags on a table, fishes in his pocket and pulls
text: out some bills.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Keep it. It's okay. Keep it. You are a
dialog: scholar and a...
text: Barris trails off.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: (eyes averted)
dialog: Thank you, sir.
text: Suddenly Barris becomes agitated.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Why are you not looking at me like that?
dialog: Do I look ugly to you?
dialog: (runs to the mirror)
dialog: It's the not sleeping. I'm not sleeping,
dialog: see. I have a lot on my...
text: Barris trails off. There is a pause. The bellhop attempts
text: to make conversation.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: (re: exploded tv)
dialog: Um, another Gong Show rerun, sir?
text: The naked Barris approaches the bellhop, drapes his arm over
text: the young man's shoulder and walks with him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: (conspiratorially)
dialog: You know what I'd do? -- And don't tell
dialog: anybody -- I'd rub... I'd rub Alpo brand
dialog: dog food on my dick so the dogs would
dialog: stick their noses into my... dick.
dialog: Guaranteed big laugh, right? That was my
dialog: trick, my great contribution to the
dialog: world. How wouldn't I degrade myself, I
dialog: ask you.
text: There is a silence.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: I ask you!
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: I... I... I don't know, sir.
text: Suddenly Barris punches himself in the head, flops down on
text: the unmade bed. The bellhop glances at Barris's bare ass,
text: looks away.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP (CONT'D)
dialog: Mr. Barris, maybe if you just don't watch
dialog: the show every night, you wouldn't have
dialog: to --
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: I always pay for the damn tv's, don't I?
dialog: (turning to face him)
dialog: Don't I?!
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: It's -- Yes, you do, sir, and we
dialog: appreciate that -- It's just that
dialog: there've been complaints from some of the
dialog: other guests, and Mr. Andrews, the
dialog: assistant manager, requested that I --
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Still? Complaints? I specifically used
dialog: the silencer this time! Specifically!
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Well, the people in 917 found a bullet
dialog: lodged in their wall. And while we want
dialog: to accommodate you -- we certainly value
dialog: your patronage -- there is an issue of
dialog: customer safety.
text: Barris lets this sink in.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 5.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Yes, of course.
text: Barris finds his pants draped over a chair, pulls out his
text: wallet, holds some more money out to the bellhop.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: My apologies. Buy -- 917, is it? -- buy
dialog: them a magnum of your finest champagne.
dialog: And... and your finest spackle. Oh, and
dialog: get me a bag of plastic army men while
dialog: you're out. I forgot to tell you before.
text: The bellhop sighs, takes the money.
speaker_heading: BELLHOP
dialog: Thank you for your understanding, sir.
text: The bellhop exists.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: (calling after)
dialog: And some black socks! Seven black socks,
dialog: you rascule!
text: Barris locks the door, dumps the contents of the bags onto
text: the floor, fishes through the mess for a cigar, puts the
text: cigar in his mouth, studies himself in a full length mirror.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
text: Bellhop Johnson was clearly repulsed by
dialog: the sight of me. And why not? I'm
dialog: wrinkled...
dialog: (searches for simile, then
dialog: proudly)
text: ... like a prune. Covered in liver
dialog: spots...
dialog: (searches for simile)
text: ... like an old guy. My hair is falling
text: out in clumps, leaving exposed patches of
text: white, sickly scalp. A flabby inner-tube
text: of fat hangs from my waist, practically
text: obscuring my bedraggled prick -- dark and
text: shriveled and dead. Still leaking urine
dialog: even though I left the toilet ages ago.
text: My asshole itches. Hemorrhoids abound.
dialog: George Orwell said every man has the face
dialog: he deserves by fifty. Does every man
dialog: have the asshole he deserves by fifty, as
dialog: well? Does every fifty year old asshole
dialog: have the asshole he deserves?
dialog: 6.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE - DAY
text: This feels real, verite. The actual Chuck Barris, smoking a
text: cigar, is being interviewed. He stands outside his villa in
text: St. Tropez, older than the middle-aged Barris depicted in the
text: hotel room, and talks to someone off-camera.
speaker_heading: ACTUAL BARRIS
dialog: It was 1981. I had holed myself up in
dialog: this New York hotel. Parker Hotel.
dialog: Terrified of everything. Ashamed of my
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: INTERVIEWER (O.C.)
dialog: Ashamed? What do you mean?
text: Barris walks through a small vegetable garden as he talks,
text: occasionally adjusting a stake or pulling out a weed.
speaker_heading: ACTUAL BARRIS
dialog: When you're young, your potential is
dialog: infinite. You might do anything, really.
dialog: You might be great. You might be
dialog: Einstein. You might be Goethe. Then you
dialog: get to an age where what you might be
dialog: gives way to what you have been. You
dialog: weren't Einstein. You weren't anything.
dialog: That's a bad moment. But I remembered
dialog: something Carlyle wrote: "... there is no
text: life of a man, faithfully recorded, but
text: is a heroic poem of its sort, rhymed or
dialog: unrhymed." I realized my salvation might
dialog: be in recording my wasted life,
text: unflinchingly. Maybe it would serve as a
dialog: cautionary tale. Maybe it would help me
dialog: understand why.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Barris, now in a hotel terrycloth bathrobe and a porkpie hat,
text: sits at a desk and types manically.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)
dialog: My name is Charles Prescott Barris. I
dialog: have written pop songs, I have been a
dialog: television producer. I am responsible
dialog: for polluting the airwaves with mind-
text: numbing, puerile entertainment. In
dialog: addition, I have murdered thirty-three
dialog: human beings. I am damned to hell.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:

scene_heading: EXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - DAY
text: It's sepia. Three year old Chuck, dressed somewhat girlishly
text: and sporting a blonde pageboy haircut is being posed on a
text: pony by a photographer. His mother stands by anxiously as
text: the boy totters on the animal.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)
dialog: Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in
dialog: 1931, my early childhood remains
dialog: accessible to me only as a series of
text: elliptical, enigmatic memories.
scene_heading: INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
text: A smiling butcher hands a slice of bologna to young Barris,

scene_heading: EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)
dialog: I remember fear.
scene_heading: INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Toddler Barris watches his mother change clothes. He studies
text: her pendulous breasts. She looks down, smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)
dialog: Love.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: You like the way mommy looks, Chuckie?
speaker_heading: BARRIS (AGE 4)
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MOTHER

scene_heading: INT. NURSERY - DAY
text: Young Chuck peeks in as his mother sits in a rocking chair
text: and holds Barris's infant sister. She fusses with the bows

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: A sixteen year old Barris lies on his back on a couch lazily
text: tossing a football in the air. Tuvia, a thirteen year old
text: girl, sits on the floor playing with a puppy. In the
text: background, throughout the scene, we hear the inept playing
text: of scales on a bass violin.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)
dialog: When I was sixteen I had an experience
dialog: with my little sister's friend Tuvia that
dialog: left an indelible impression.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Phoebe's no Walter Page, huh, Tuvia?
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: I don't know who that is.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Of course you don't.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Why are you waiting around anyway,
text: listening to this cacophonous cacophony,
dialog: when you could be in your own abode
dialog: disrupting the lives of your own
dialog: siblings?
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: I don't know what anything you say means.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: No. You wouldn't, would you.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Barris watches Tuvia playing with the dog. She gets on all
text: fours and yelps, imitating the dog. This excites the dog,
text: who bounces around her. Barris studies Tuvia's exposed white
text: underwear for a while. This excites Barris. Finally he
text: pulls an afghan off the back of the couch and drapes it over
text: his pants. We hear him unzip his fly.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hey.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: (not looking)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Hey, Tuvia.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: (turning)
dialog: Wha-at?!
text: Tuvia sees Barris fiddling with something under the afghan.
text: She gets quiet.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: You wanna lick it?
text: Tuvia snorts, goes back to playing with the dog.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: No. Why should I?
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Well, for one thing it tastes like
dialog: strawberry. My sister tells me you love
text: strawberries.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: Yeah, well... I hate strawberries.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Honestly, a man's penis tastes exactly
text: like a strawberry lollipop.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: Look, I know that's not true, so --
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: It is true. It's weird but it's true. I
text: just read a research paper on it.
text: Tuvia looks at the afghan.
dialog: 11.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Middle-aged Chuck Barris turns from the typewriter and stares

scene_heading: INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
text: Tuvia's face jerks up into frame. She spits.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: Uchh. Yech. It doesn't taste anything
dialog: like strawberry, you creep.
text: The dog sticks his head under the afghan. Barris shoos him
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: (curious)
dialog: Well, what does it taste like?
text: Tuvia gets up.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: Y'know, I'm gonna tell your mother what
dialog: you just did.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: If you do, I'll tell your mother you made
dialog: our dog lick your crack.
speaker_heading: TUVIA
dialog: I did not!
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: (shrugging)
dialog: So what?
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Middle-aged Barris types as the camera glides over some of
text: the acquired detritus in his room: skin magazines, a gun and
text: silencer, liquor, a copy of Beyond Good and Evil, a disguise
text: kit, a kid's sprouted lima bean science fair project.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)
dialog: Perhaps my whole life turned at that
dialog: point. The repulsiveness of my sex
text: confirmed by the tastebuds of a ripening
text: pubescent girl.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: MONTAGE
text: Sequence of young Barris unsuccessfully attempting to pick up
text: girls at bars, unsuccessfully attempting to cop a feel on a

text: outside of a movie theater in the rain, holding an umbrella
text: over his head and checking his watch.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: And so I found myself in a downward
text: spiral of debauchery. Endlessly chasing
dialog: pussy. My only focus in life: to get
dialog: laid, to get blown, trying to fool myself
dialog: into believing that given the right
dialog: combination of circumstances and
dialog: deception, maybe the Tuvias of the world
dialog: could desire me the way I desired them.
dialog: I only wanted to be loved.

dialog: That fella Raymond in payroll is kinda
dialog: cute, huh?

speaker_heading: BYRD
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Hola, Chuckito. Que pasa?
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARRIS
dialog: So what'd this guy Renda do anyway?
speaker_heading: BYRD
dialog: It's your job to follow directives, not

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: It's just...
speaker_heading: BYRD
dialog: He's a bad guy, Chuck. He's one of the
dialog: bad guys. Okay?
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Bad for the U.S., right, Jim? Not bad in
dialog: an absolute sense, just bad for the U.S.
speaker_heading: BYRD
dialog: Don't fuckin' dance with me, Barris.
dialog: Renda's bad for the Tea and Biscuit Co.
dialog: He's bad for me personally. You work for
dialog: me, and Renda's bad for me. You're now
dialog: officially a patriotic citizen of the
dialog: United States of Jim Byrd.
speaker_heading: YOUNG BARRIS
dialog: Look, this is --

speaker_heading: BYRD

speaker_heading: BYRD

scene_heading: INT. MEXICAN HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: It's hot. There are two twin beds in the room. Byrd sleeps
text: soundly in one. Barris lies in the other, eyes wide open.
scene_heading: EXT. MEXICO CITY STREET - DAY
text: Renda is buying a newspaper at the kiosk. He completes the
text: transaction and takes a few steps with his paper. Barris
text: blocks his way, holding a phrase book and shaking.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Excusa me, por favor, Senor.
text: Renda stops.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BENITEZ
dialog: May I be of some assistance here?
text: Renda appears relieved, until he feels the gun in his back.
dialog: 37.
scene_heading: INT. CAR - DAY
text: Renda's in the back between Barris and Benitez. Brazioni
text: drives. Renda seems pale and nervous, as does Barris in his
text: gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses. The car drives slowly
text: through the crowded Mexico City streets. They arrive at a
text: jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big
text: parade. It's Day of the Dead; the streets are filled with
text: dancing skeletons. It's wild and frightening. Brazioni
text: glances at Renda in the reaview mirror.
speaker_heading: BRAZIONI
dialog: Day of the dead.
scene_heading: EXT. FIELD - DAY
text: The car stops in a deserted field. Barris gets out first.
text: His shirt is soaked through with sweat. Suddenly there's a
text: commotion inside the car. Renda has gotten hold of a gun.
text: He shoots Brazioni and Benitez. Barris panics and dives
text: behind the car. Renda steps cautiously outside of the car,
text: looking for Barris. Barris grabs Renda's foot. Renda falls,
text: the gun flies from his hand. Barris kicks the gun under the
text: car, his own gun drawn. He points the gun at Renda, who is
text: on his stomach. Barris doesn't shoot. He's scared, shaking
text: wildly. Renda looks up at Barris, trying to figure him out.
text: He slowly rises to his feet, turns to Barris with a pleading
text: look in his eyes.
speaker_heading: RENDA
dialog: Por favor. No me mates, senor. Tengo

speaker_heading: RENDA

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Repitolo.
dialog: Again.
speaker_heading: RENDA

text: Barris flips through the dictionary. A church bell chimes,
text: startling Barris. His gun goes off accidentally and the
text: bullet hits Renda in the face, tearing most of it away.
text: Renda falls, but is still alive. He screams out of where his
text: mouth was. A wedding party emerges from the distant church.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Oh Christ. Oh crap.

text: hand and looks at the still screaming Renda. The churchgoers
text: are starting to squint in Barris's direction. Barris shoots
text: Renda again. And again and again and again and again. More

speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)

speaker_heading: PENNY (O.C.)
dialog: (groggily)
dialog: Chuck, is that you throwing up?
text: In the dim light from the hallway, Barris spots Penny lying

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Jesus Christ, Penny. You scared the shit

speaker_heading: PENNY

speaker_heading: PENNY

speaker_heading: PENNY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: PENNY
dialog: Oh! You gotta hear this song!
text: Penny shrieks excitedly as she runs to the record player.
text: She turns it on, plugs in a strobe light. "Sunshine Superman"
text: starts up. Penny sings and dances along, directing the
text: lyrics at Barris. Barris looks around at his strobing
text: apartment. He sees Penny's mess: pot paraphenalia, anti-war
text: posters, a gold dove painted on the wall with a phone number
dialog: underneath.
speaker_heading: PENNY (CONT'D)

text: look quite grim.
speaker_heading: GOLDBERG
dialog: Chuck, quite frankly these episodes are

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Look, Len, the show's spontaneous, it's

speaker_heading: EXECUTIVE
dialog: Be that as it may, Mr. Barris, we can't

speaker_heading: GOLDBERG

dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well, I know that. That's not what I

speaker_heading: INSTRUCTOR #1
dialog: (increasingly psychotic)
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Barris. I don't know if
dialog: any of you are aware of this, but it's a
dialog: federal offense to make licentious
text: remarks on a network television
dialog: broadcoast. The penalty for this
dialog: disgusting, un-American behavior is one
dialog: year in prison or a ten thousand dollar
dialog: fine or both. Anyone making a sick,
dialog: subversive remark tonight will be
dialog: arrested immediately. I will then
dialog: personally escort the offender to federal
dialog: prison for booking under edict number 364
dialog: of the Broadcast Act of 1963. And it's a

dialog: me. No other witnesses --
speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: (into phone)

speaker_heading: LORETTA

speaker_heading: BARRIS

scene_heading: INT. DATING GAME SET - LATER
text: Barris paces on the darkened set. He is trying to think. A

text: down the aisle. Barris is deep in thought and doesn't hear.
text: The man appears behind Barris and locks his arm around
text: Barris's neck. Barris is startled, choking and flailing
text: trying to remove the arm. He can't. Finally the man

speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: What, now you're a television producer?
speaker_heading: BYRD
dialog: Hey, I'm CIA operative John Q. Public
dialog: when it comes to tv and that should make

speaker_heading: BYRD

speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: BYRD
dialog: Up the stakes, Chuckles. Send 'em to

dialog: Asia, for example.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: The network's not going to let me send

dialog: we have a job for you in Austria. You, a
dialog: successful tv producer, above suspicion,
text: chaperones the young couple, and while
dialog: you're there, blam! you take care of some
dialog: Company business. It's the perfect

speaker_heading: BARRIS

dialog: for money anymore.
speaker_heading: BYRD
dialog: Chuck, when I said you fit our profile,

scene_heading: EXT. PICCADILLY CIRCUS - DAY
scene_heading: SUBTITLE: LONDON, 1967
text: It's all mod and colorful. Chuck Barris shuffles along,
text: taking in the sights with the Dating Game couple. The blonde
dialog: bachelorette did indeed pick the fat guy. But it's clear she
text: thinks she made a mistake and pays him no attention

text: Barris. Barris seems bored.
scene_heading: INT. PUB - DAY
text: Barris enters the pub alone. He's dressed in a blonde wig
text: and moustache and glasses. It's crowded and he searches the
text: room for someone. He spots a pretty young woman by herself

speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: PATRICIA
dialog: Yes, I gathered.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: And you are?

scene_heading: EXT. WESTMINISTER ABBEY - DAY

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Do you have it?
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN
dialog: Do you have it?
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Sorry. Yeah.
text: Barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an

speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.
speaker_heading: ENGLISHMAN

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Thank you. Oh, one more thing.
text: Barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and
text: jams it into the Englishman's mouth. The silencer breaks the
text: man's front teeth. The man makes a muffled grunt.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Sorry about your teeth.
text: The Englishman's eyes are wide with terror. Barris pulls the
text: trigger three times. The back of the Englishman's head
text: explodes. Blood and hair and brain are spattered against the
text: church wall. The Englishman slumps to the ground. Barris
text: reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of
text: money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard
text: gate. There stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused.
text: After the initial shock, Barris smiles warmly.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It's Ronnie, isn't it?
text: The fat bachelor nods.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)

text: The fat bachelor enters the courtyard.
scene_heading: EXT. TERRACE - DAY
speaker_heading: ACTUAL BARRIS
dialog: I felt bad about Ronnie. But really I

scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Sounds fun. So tell me, Patricia, why'd

speaker_heading: PATRICIA

speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: PATRICIA

scene_heading: EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
text: Barris steps out of the terminal. A black limo pulls up.
text: The back door opens and Barris gets in.
scene_heading: INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: No fucking way.
speaker_heading: PICARD
dialog: It's quite reliable and easy to operate.
dialog: It will get you over the wall. Or you
dialog: can stay here. In the German Democratic
dialog: Republic. I will arrange for you to get

speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Am I in danger still?
speaker_heading: BYRD

speaker_heading: BARRIS

text: He thinks. Under "Pros" he writes "Become National
dialog: Celebrity", "Get More Attention from Stewardesses", "Even
dialog: more women will want to have sex with me". Under "Cons" he
text: writes: "Easier target for KGB." He gets up, paces.
text: Suddenly, a shot rings out. It comes through the window and
text: shatters the mirror. Barris dives to the floor. More
text: shots, crazy relentless shooting. Barris crawls on his belly
text: to the window, carefully reaches up and lowers the venetian
text: blinds just as another shot whizzes through. The blinds

text: Big Nose leaps onto stage. He is skinny, wearing a flowered

text: his sarong, revealing polka-dotted boxer shorts and a yellow
text: leotard. He rushes to a steamer trunk, opens it, and begins
text: crazily pulling out endless amounts of old newspapers.
text: Barris watches from the wings, mesmerized. Big Nose is

speaker_heading: BIG NOSE
dialog: Why? Why? Why?
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: I don't know. I don't understand.

text: watches the commotion around him with eagle eyes: technicians
text: and stagehands running around, the audience chanting "Chuckie
text: Baby", the celebrity panel joking with each other, the guys
text: in the booth smoking, the guys in the band laughing. Barris
text: turns around and around on his mark, trying to catch every
text: movement, looking for a gun, a suspicious character. The
text: chanting continues, louder and more distorted. The faces in

speaker_heading: KEELER
dialog: I read in a book recently that killing

speaker_heading: PRETTY WOMAN
dialog: What is it then? To mock some poor,

scene_heading: EXT. SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT

speaker_heading: BARRIS (V.O.)
dialog: She was right. What the hell had I done

text: Suddenly confetti and balloons pour down on him out of the

scene_heading: MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
text: Barris turns to face the woman, who's very close now. She
text: starts to dance around, sort of ballet-like, very badly.
text: Barris watches. She pirouettes, arms above her head.
speaker_heading: BARRIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Very nice.
text: Something in her hand glints in the light. Barris
text: reflexively grabs her arm. It's an ice pick. The two
text: wrestle for it. The woman is extremely strong. Barris jams
text: the palm of his hand up into the woman's nose. She staggers
text: back, but doesn't drop the ice pick. Barris leaps at her.
text: The two roll on the ground. The woman pins Barris. She
text: straddles him and is about to stab him through the air.
text: Barris reaches under her skirt and grabs her crotch. The
text: middle-aged woman is a man. He screams in a distinctly male
text: voice. Barris takes the moment of distraction to grab the
text: ice pick and jam it up through the assailant's chin and into
text: his brain. The assailant slumps over.

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: BARRIS

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: OLIVER

speaker_heading: OLIVER (CONT'D)

dialog: cord. Your first hit, Chuck. Your
dialog: mother always wanted a daughter. She
dialog: blamed you for your sister's death. And,
dialog: so, until your sister Phoebe was born,
dialog: she raised you as a girl.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: That's not true.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Oh, and your father the dentist? Not
dialog: really your father. Your biological
dialog: father was a man named Edmund James
dialog: Windsor. A serial killer. A fact your
dialog: mother didn't know when she had an affair
dialog: with him in 1930. If you want to look
dialog: him up, he was also known as the
dialog: Tarrytown Troll, because he had been
text: described by witnesses as short and ugly.
text: Windsor died in the electrical chair at
dialog: Ossining in 1939. We believed your self-
dialog: loathing tendencies coupled with that
dialog: extra Y chromosome and whatever else you
dialog: inherited from your father would serve us
dialog: well.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: You're lying.
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: I'm trying to think what more I can tell
dialog: you. I'm sure there's more. But you have
dialog: me at a disadvantage here, Barris. I
dialog: don't have your files in front of me.
speaker_heading: BARRIS
dialog: Just leave me the hell alone!
speaker_heading: OLIVER
dialog: Your mother always loved the game shows,
dialog: and you so wanted to please her. We
dialog: never expected the game show business to
