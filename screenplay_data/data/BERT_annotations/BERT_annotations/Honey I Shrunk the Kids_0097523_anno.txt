speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Wrong, Quark. It's an amazing electromag

dialog: correctly, its computer scanners will hone

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Nifty, huh?

text: a pencil and flops down on his favorite couch. Wayne sits

text: The twins are now playing ball. Don pitches a ball to Ron

speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS
dialog: Knock it off, Ron.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: But I'm Don.
speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Better watch out. You might hit that

dialog: 
text: He points to a hive in a tree that straddles both yards.
text: Ron isn't impressed.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: What do you know about baseball, baby-
dialog: brain? You can't play.
text: Ron swings at the next pitch and connects. The ball misses
text: the bee-hive by inches, rebounding off the tree and
text: bouncing back down into the yard. Don flashes his brother a
text: smug smile. Ron gulps. He faces Nick.
speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Lucky guess.
text: For his next turn at bat, however, he changes the angle of
text: his batting position, Nick, not wanting to take any

speaker_heading: NICK

text: Little Russ moves towards them. One of his giant feet
text: smashes the trunk to a pulp. The kids scurry about, trying
dialog: to stay out of the way of Russ' tennis shoes.
text: Don slips down into a crack between two floor boards as one
text: of the shoes hurties down towards the floor. Ron hits the
text: deck as the shoe comes down atop him. He's so small,
text: however, that he fits inbetween one of the grooves on the

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Amy!
text: Russ sees what's going on and gets to his feet. In the best

speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Fine, thank you.

text: of horrible goo. He sinks up to his waist. The puddle is
text: covered with THE BODIES OF LARGE, DEAD FLIES.
speaker_heading: RON

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: That can't be quicksand.

dialog: Hurry. Please hurry.

text: needles are titanic, He comes across a small, portable sewing
dialog: kit: the kind you buy in a five and dime store or get for free
text: in a hotel. It consists of a small envelope, a few tiny but-
dialog: 
scene_heading: THE TEENY~WEENIES 87
dialog: Ld tons and needles 1/4 the size of your everyday, household

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: Not a bad idea.
speaker_heading: DON
dialog: This genius stuff is spreading.
dialog: 
text: Russ takes a small spool of thread and places a strand of
text: thread through the needle. He hooks one end of the thread
text: to a splinter in the table-top, anchoring it. He then makes
text: sure that the spool holding the rest of the thread is
text: jammed tightly down on a large needle stuck into a pin
text: cushion in the sewing kit.

dialog: This ought to hold. Maybe we can shoot

dialog: Suppose we miss?

speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS
dialog: It's like a harpoon. If we miss, we pull
dialog: it back and try again....I hope.

text: to stretch it between the points of a scissor. It pops off,
text: DON (looking at a nearby spool)
dialog: We can make a spool cannon.
dialog: 
text: He takes a small spool of thread and rolls it on its side in

dialog: 
scene_heading: THE TEENY-WEENIES 88

text: The kids hold the side of the spool. Russ grabs the end of

text: the spool and, slowly, pulls the needle back. Further.
text: Further. Finally, it's 75% out of the cannon muzzle.

dialog: Ever gone tightrope walking?
speaker_heading: NICK (nervously)
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS
dialog: The only we're going to get onto

speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS
dialog: I'll go first, The trick is to

text: thread with his hands and sliding his feet onto the bottom
dialog: strand.
speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS
dialog: We won't be climbing as much as pulling
dialog: ourselves across. Understand?
text: The kids nod. They're scared stiff.
speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS

speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS
dialog: Easy. Don't be afraid. Just hold
dialog: on tight with your hands. That's it.
text: The twins are next on. Ron gulps, looks down at the dizzy

dialog: inches or so...
scene_heading: EXT. TABLE, DAY

speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS

scene_heading: EXT. TABLE, DAY

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, DAY

speaker_heading: RON
dialog: I don't like this!
speaker_heading: DON

scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN, DAY
text: Russ holds desperately onto the edge of the table as the

text: the thread as it drops down like an elevator sans shaft.
text: The needle zips along the table top, coming to an abrupt halt

text: formica. Russ climbs ontop of the table and grabs the thread.

dialog: top.

speaker_heading: DIANE
dialog: Thank god they're all right.
dialog: RON (even though he can't be

dialog: You should have seen us ten minutes ago!
text: She makes a move to grab the kids. They duck, Wayne

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Don't touch then.
text: She pulls her hand back.
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: They're too small to handle. We may

speaker_heading: BIG RUSS
dialog: You're a maniac, Szalinski. Do you realize
dialog: what you've done? They're ruined for life!
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: I have the atomic makeup computed.
text: Wayne adjusts the computer, focusing it on the children.
speaker_heading: BIG RUSS
dialog: If you hurt them any more, Szalinski, I'11
dialog: personally re-do your house with my

dialog: Now, I have to figure the amount of space
dialog: needed to be placed between their atoms.
speaker_heading: MAE
dialog: Please hurry.
speaker_heading: WAYNE

scene_heading: INT. ATTIC, DAY

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Russ, toss me that ball?
speaker_heading: BIG RUSS
dialog: I oughtta bean you with this ball.
text: He picks up the baseball and tosses it to Wayne. Wayne
text: studies it. He gazes at the burn mark on the ball. He then

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: The answer has been right under my
dialog: nose all along.
speaker_heading: BIG RUSS
dialog: You like baseball.

speaker_heading: C) . WAYNE
text: The machine uses two beams, a laser tracking
text: beam and the actual shrinking beam. The
text: tracking beam focuses the second beam on
dialog: the target. The reason things have been
dialog: blowing up instead of shrinking is that,
text: when the beams collide, they generate too
dialog: much heat. Yesterday, this ball must have
text: blocked the tracking beam. The shrinking
dialog: beam worked all on its own. Now, all I have
dialog: to do is shut off the one beam...
text: He throws the switch into "on" position again. THE MACHINE
text: SPUTTERS TO LIFE. THE BEAMS GO SKITTERING THROUGH SPACE,
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Let's see if it works. I need a
dialog: a target.
speaker_heading: BIG RUSS
dialog: You already blew up my hat.
text: Wayne looks about. He realizes he still has the ball in his
text: hand. He tosses the ball before the beams. THE BALL IS
text: ZAPPED AND MINATURIZES. THE TINY BALL FALLS NEXT TO THE
text: CHILDREN. Nick turns to Ron.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I told you he'd figure it out.
text: Big Russ is impressed. He turns to Mae.
speaker_heading: BIG RUSS
dialog: Did you see that?
speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: Now, all I have to do is reverse the
dialog: polarity of the beam and...add some
dialog: energy.

scene_heading: TALL, FIFTEEN FEET.

dialog: Am I big enough for you, now, dad?
speaker_heading: BIG RUSS
dialog: Russell! I never...I mean,..you were

dialog: Please. I'm sorry I yelled. I'll never
dialog: yell at you again. You don't have to play
dialog: football. You can play...checkers and it'll
dialog: be fine with me, Honest. Put me down. Don't
dialog: hurt me, Please. I'm your father, Russell,
text: LITTLE RUSS SMILES AND PLACES BIG RUSS GENTLY DOWN ON THE
speaker_heading: FLOOR.
speaker_heading: LITTLE RUSS
dialog: I'd never hurt you, dad. I'm still the
dialog: same old Russ. You see, dad, it's not
dialog: how big you are on the outside...it's
dialog: how big you are on the inside that really
dialog: counts. Size doesn't mean anything.

speaker_heading: WAYNE
dialog: So, I brought along, a, um, visual aid.
dialog: Dr. Frederickson? Would you be so kind as
text: to open the back doors.
text: Puzzled, Frederickson moves towards the doors. He swaggers,
