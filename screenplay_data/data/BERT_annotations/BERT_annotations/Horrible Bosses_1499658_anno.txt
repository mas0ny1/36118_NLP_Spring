scene_heading: 4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4

speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Damn.
dialog: 
text: He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple

dialog: 
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might
dialog: have been a minute late.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HARKEN
dialog: Two minutes according to this. So
dialog: either you're a liar -- which I
dialog: know you're not -- or our system
text: is off by a full minute. And if
dialog: that's the case, I have no choice
dialog: but to dismiss Thomas, our

speaker_heading: KURT
dialog: Here we go.
