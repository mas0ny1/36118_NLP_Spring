scene_heading: INT. PETER’S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
text: PETER BRETTER (26) watches television alone in his dark,
text: creepy apartment. A fake MUMMY lies in the corner. Vintage
text: magician posters and a giant, creepy French Clockwork Orange
text: poster adorn the walls. Cigarette butts, overflowing
text: ashtrays and bottles of liquor crowd the table and a GIANT
text: PLASMA TELEVISION adorns one wall. In the corner are a
text: guitar and keyboard.
text: Peter sits, smoking, watching THE ISLAND with SCARLETT
text: JOHANNSEN. THE COLONY IS ADDRESSED BY A MAN ON PLASMA
text: SCREENS THROUGHOUT THE COMPOUND
text: ---Peter has made it so his computer is being mirrored on his
text: GIANT PLASMA. He sits in front of his computer’s camera so
text: that his GIANT FACE is on the tv. He is wearing a Jacket and
speaker_heading: TIE.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (mimicking THE ISLAND)
dialog: The lottery will begin in twenty
dialog: minutes. The lucky winners will get
text: to smoke a gigantic joint.
text: Peter chuckles to himself and lights a joint, which he
text: watches himself smoke on TV. He tries to make smoke rings.
text: We pull back to reveal, that he is wearing only the top half
text: of a suit and boxers.
text: -- Peter’s watching the Red Shoe Diaries. The part that
text: Duchovny narrates.
text: -- Peter opens his fridge. It has nothing in it except for
text: some old orange juice.
text: -- Peter’s on his couch drinking old orange juice from the
text: carton, smoking, watching an informational about a treadmill.
text: -- Peter’s on the phone.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Yeah. I don’t need the elliptical.
dialog: Just the treadmill. Thanks. It’s
dialog: a Mastercard.
text: -- Peter’s pulled the treadmill out of its box.
text: -- It’s some time later. The treadmill is covered in
text: ashtrays and various junk. Peter’s on the phone.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Well, that’s great. Topher sounds
dialog: really cool. I’m glad you’re
dialog: having fun. I’m OK. No, I’m fine.
dialog: Seriously, I’m doing fine. I gota
dialog: treadmill. Yeah. I miss you and I
dialog: cannot wait to see you. Have fun
text: at the wrap party.
text: Peter hangs up. He then hits the treadmill on and watches
text: with little interest as a bunch of full ash trays, half-
text: filled soda bottles, and papers go flying off it.
text: -- Peter sits on his couch drinking coffee watching Talk
dialog: Soup. It goes to a commercial for “Comedy Mondays” and we
text: see a brief promo for “GRACE IS ACES,” starring “Emmy Nominee
text: SARAH MARSHALL.” Peter beams.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s my girl.
text: He addresses a Muppet style DRACULA PUPPET in the corner.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: We’re gonna get to snuggle in only
dialog: twenty three days, huh Vlad?
text: -- Peter watches the Red Shoe Diaries again. As he does so,
text: he bounces a ball against Duchovny’s face.
text: -- Peter's asleep. It’s 3:45PM. The phone rings. He lets
text: it go to answering machine.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (0.S.)
dialog: (answering machine)
dialog: Yo, it’s your bro. Pick up pick up
dialog: pick up pick up pick up.
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Since your lady’s not in for a
dialog: couple more days, I was thinking
dialog: you could let me and Liz take you
dialog: out for a meal. I know you’re
dialog: there. Pick up pick up pick up
dialog: pick up
text: Peter ignores the machine.
text: -- Peter's alarm goes off. The Cardigan’s “Lovefool” begins
text: playing. Peter HOPS OUT of bed.
text: -- Peter, in a nice suit and nice shirt, sits expectantly on
text: his couch. The phone rings. Peter answers it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hey, sweetie!
dialog: (then)
dialog: Not for another week? Oh. No,
dialog: that’s totally great. Say hello to
dialog: everyone for me. Love ya.
text: Peter leaves the room and returns seconds later wearing his
text: old sweatpants and dirty T-shirt.
scene_heading: INT. SHOWER - LATER
text: Peter stands, scrubbing and singing in a STRANGE OPERATIC
text: VOICE. The phone rings. He grabs a cordless next to the sink.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Hello? Hey Baby! Welcome Home!! I’m
dialog: just in the shower singing. I think
dialog: I’m zeroing in on Dracula’s point
dialog: of view. Yeah, of course, come on
dialog: over. Love you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Hello? Oh, okay, see you ina
dialog: minute.
text: Peter hangs up and looks at the phone, a bit concerned.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
text: A knocking at the door. Peter comes out from the bathroom,
text: dripping wet, naked, drying himself with a towel. He opens
text: the door for his stunningly beautiful girlfriend, SARAH
text: MARSHALL (30). She enters as Peter continues drying himself
text: with the towel, casually exposing his naked body.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (big, goofy smile)
dialog: Hey lover! Just scrubbing up for
dialog: you.
text: She can barely look in Peter’s direction.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Pete, as you know, I love you very
dialog: much. But...
text: Peter drops his towel.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Are you breaking up with me?
dialog: 4.
text: She looks down at the floor. Then she nods. Peter looks in
text: complete shock. He sits down on the couch and tries not to
text: hyperventilate.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Why don’t you put on some clothes
dialog: and let’s discuss this?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (already teary)
dialog: I can’t do anything right now.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (sweetly)
dialog: Honey, I’m sorry...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (starting to lose it)
dialog: What is going on? I love you, I
dialog: love you, please don’t do this --
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Just put on some clothes --
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Will that make you not break up
dialog: with me?
text: Sarah touches Peter’s shoulder. He roughly shakes her off.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m sorry, I’m just... oh god.
text: Peter sobs so hard that he begins to choke on his breath.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m in control, I’m in control, I’m
dialog: fine, let’s talk. Why?
text: She starts to speak.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Just tell me why.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (super rehearsed)
dialog: Pete, as you know, I love you very
dialog: much.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You already said that. Like in
dialog: exactly that tone.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (still super-rehearsed)
dialog: But I’ve felt for a long time that
dialog: we were growing apart and leading
dialog: different lives. It’s not that I
dialog: don’t love you, I do.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (ignoring her)
dialog: I love you too. Like so much.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: And that’s really sweet. It’s just
dialog: that... I think my love for you
dialog: has...changed.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Changed how?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Become...weaker. You know? Like, a
dialog: lot...weaker. It’s like you’re on
dialog: the dock and I’m in the lake and
dialog: I’m like, “jump in the lake” but
dialog: you just keep staying on the dock.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: What? I’11 jump in the lake.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I know you would, but it wouldn't
dialog: be for the right reasons.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why now? I told you, I’ve finally
dialog: figured out Dracula’s POV and you
dialog: dump me.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Now’s the time while your life’s on
text: the upswing.
dialog: (then, back to super
dialog: rehearsed)
dialog: While this is hard for me, I
dialog: understand that it might be even
dialog: harder for you. If you want to not
dialog: see each other for a while I
dialog: completely and totally understand.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Who’s the guy? Is there someone
dialog: else? Someone from the movie?
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Please tell me it’s not Dax
dialog: Shepard.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: No. There’s no one. I would never
dialog: hurt you like that.
text: Peter begins weeping and moving towards her.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: If there’s no other guy it doesn’t
dialog: have to be over, if there’s no
dialog: other guy it doesn’t have to be
dialog: over...
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (tearing up a little)
dialog: I’ve thought about this a lot,
dialog: sweetie.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I haven't seen you in so long,
dialog: you've forgotten what we have and I
dialog: forgive you for that. Just kiss me
dialog: one last time and I swear you’1l
dialog: remember.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I don’t know if that’s good idea -
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Just please...
text: Peter wipes tears and snot off his face and pulls Sarah
text: towards him. He starts kissing her and desperately clutching
text: her. Then he starts passionately rubbing up against her. We
dialog: can tell she’s not into it.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I love you baby. Do you remember
dialog: now?
text: Peter’s getting more and more into it.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (panicking)
dialog: There’s someone else.
text: Peter pulls away and stares at her for as long as Universal
dialog: will allow.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I should probably go.
text: She leaves.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S APARTMENT - LATER
text: Peter sits on the couch with his younger brother BRIAN
text: BRETTER (23). Three boxes of Camels sit in front of Peter,
text: who smokes one as he drinks a fuzzy navel, clearly not his
dialog: first.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Are you sure you don’t want to eat
dialog: something with that?
text: Peter shrugs indifferently. Brian OPENS Peter’s fridge.
text: There’s an old piece of moldy American cheese. That’s it.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Your place has gotten really
dialog: disgusting. I had no idea American
dialog: cheese could sustain mold.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Can we please focus on the fact
dialog: that the love my life has just
dialog: dumped me? It’s going to be OK,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: It will be. But you’re the only
dialog: one who can make it better. Clean
dialog: yourself up. You’re like the
dialog: walking dead.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: BECAUSE I'VE JUST BEEN DUMPED!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You were doing great before Sarah.
dialog: Honestly, you've been on a downward
dialog: spiral ever since you two met.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: That is not true!
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Right out of the gate you wrote a
dialog: kick ass song for Graces, you
dialog: hooked up with the star, you were
dialog: on your way. Then she took off like
dialog: a rocket and you sat on your ass in
dialog: this creepy theme restaurant of an
dialog: apartment.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’ve been working on my Dracula
dialog: musical.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: For five and a half years?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Musicals are one of the most
dialog: complicated art forms. There's a
dialog: story and songs and --
dialog: (then)
dialog: I don’t understand why we’re even
dialog: talking about this.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Because this is why Sarah dumped
dialog: you. When I met Liz, she wouldn’t
dialog: date me. Not because she didn’t
dialog: think I was a handsome and
dialog: intelligent man, but because I
dialog: didn’t have my life together. So I
dialog: quit pot, I went premed, I started
dialog: doing yoga and now we’re engaged.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’re like a fucking child bride.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Easy now. I’m not the one who made
text: Sarah sleep with Dax Shepard.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Get the fuck out of here. I’m
dialog: serious. Right now. Get the hell
dialog: out here.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Pete---
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Get out Brian!!
text: Brian takes Peter’s drink away, heads for the door. He begins
dialog: to speak again.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: When you sober up, Liz and I would
dialog: love to have you over for a BBQ.
speaker_heading: PETER
speaker_heading: LEAVE!
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
text: Peter lays in the bed, only his head free from the cocoon of
text: covers. He is sweating profusely, and breathing in a way that
text: is best described as panting. THE PHONE RINGS. Peter glances
text: at the caller ID, but does not answer.
speaker_heading: PETER’S MOM (V.O.)
dialog: (answering machine)
dialog: Peter, it’s your Mother. Brian’s
dialog: afraid you’re going to kill
dialog: yourself. I told him he was
dialog: overreacting. But please call and
dialog: let me know you’re OK anyway. We
dialog: love you.
text: Peter closes his eyes, desperate for sleep.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S LIVING ROOM - LATER
text: Peter sits on his couch in the dark, wrapped in a blanket. He
text: drinks wine with a straw from a giant box like it’s a juice
text: box and watches PROJECT RUNWAY.
speaker_heading: HEIDI KLUM (ON TV)
dialog: You had a lot of potential, but you
dialog: just couldn’t come through. I’m
dialog: sorry, you’re out.
text: Peter burst into tears.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Auf Wiedersehen.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - LATER
text: Peter finishes preparing a beautiful steak sandwich. The oven
text: clock reads 3:23 AM. He slices the sandwich and adorns the
text: plate with some Kettle Chips. Satisfied, he stares down at
text: his sandwich...and stares. Finally he reaches for it, but
text: just lays his hand on to of it sadly.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
text: Peter wakes up and looks at the clock. 6:17 AM.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You can do this.
dialog: 10.
scene_heading: INT. RECORDING STUDIO - MORNING
text: Peter adjusts his guitar strap and removes his sunglasses,
text: revealing haggard eyes. His MIXER (40s) speaks over the
text: intercom.
speaker_heading: MIXER
dialog: Late night?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah. But I’m good. What do we have
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: MIXER
text: Three lead-ins, an exit and a walk
text: down the street.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Alright, let’s go.
text: The room goes dark and an image projects on a screen in front
text: of Peter. It is silent footage of Sarah walking down the
text: street. It lasts for EIGHT SECONDS, then cuts to black.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Okay, let’s do this.
text: The footage begins again, Sarah walking. Peter plays a
text: VILLAINOUS SOUNDING diddy.
speaker_heading: MIXER
text: Too dark Pete. Opening of the show.
dialog: You alright?
text: Peter takes a moment to consider.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Sarah and I decided to take some
dialog: time apart.
speaker_heading: MIXER
dialog: Oh my God man, I’m sorry.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It was a mutual...
speaker_heading: MIXER
dialog: Dude, go home. I/’11 finish up
dialog: today. It’s not like we’re
dialog: composing a symphony here.
dialog: 11.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m a professional. JI can do this.
speaker_heading: MIXER
dialog: Alright, we got one more thing to
dialog: score.
text: He flips on sitcommy footage of Sarah kissing some YOUNG HOT
text: ACTOR like Freddie Prinze, Jr. The audience goes WHOOOO.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON Peter.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAT AND FIDDLE PUB - NIGHT
text: Peter and Brian sit outside at a table drinking. Peter looks
text: dressed for a date, Brian is far more casual.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You look good. I didn’t know you
dialog: owned a curduroy coat.
dialog: (then)
dialog: So, what am I doing here?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You’re going to be my wing man.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Oh, no. I can’t do this. This is
dialog: not what you need. Come over to my
dialog: house, Liz and I will cook up some
dialog: stir fry, we’ll watch Lost...
text: Peter sees two girls and winks at them.
speaker_heading: BRIAN (CONT'D)
dialog: That is just creepy. Don’t do that
dialog: look.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (through gritted teeth
dialog: while smiling
dialog: flirtatiously)
dialog: I haven't done this in six years
dialog: Brian, I’m terrified, so shut the
dialog: fuck up.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: You’re embarrassing yourself. And
dialog: me.
text: The girls HEAD OVER to them.
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Oh, am I?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: This place is so crowded. Are
dialog: these seats taken?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Not at all. Please, sit down. I’m
dialog: Peter, this is my little brother
dialog: Brian.
text: Brian waves, annoyed.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: I’m Leslie. This is Ann.
text: Peter stands up to pull out a chair.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: (as if a compliment)
dialog: You’re gigantic.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks. So what can I get you
dialog: ladies to drink?
speaker_heading: LESLIE
text: Amstel light.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Vodka sour.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Seltzer water’s fine.
scene_heading: EXT. CAT AND FIDDLE - LATER
text: Brian and Leslie are singing the “Graces is Aces” theme song.
text: Peter looks really embarrassed and very drunk.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: So, Brian, what do you do?
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: I’m engaged.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Oh. How about you, Peter?
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Give you a hint. He wrote a song.
dialog: (singing)
dialog: When you need a time-out just to...
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (embarrassed)
dialog: Stop it Brian.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Just to catch your breath.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Stop.
text: Leslie joins in for the chorus.
speaker_heading: LESLIE AND BRIAN
dialog: So many people in the world!
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Hey! That’s the theme from that
dialog: show.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: “Grace is Aces.” That’s my boy
dialog: right here.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: You wrote that? That was on a True
dialog: Love Sampler CD I got at The Coffee
dialog: Bean. I didn’t even realize it was
text: a whole song.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yeah. Yeah it is. CBS cut it down
dialog: to eight seconds.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: That’s so cool.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I’m glad you think so. It makes me
dialog: want to kill myself.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: My brother doesn’t just sit on his
dialog: ass and collect royalties. He’s
dialog: also been working on a rock musical
dialog: for six years.
dialog: 14.
speaker_heading: LESLIE
dialog: Oh wow! What’s your musical about?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Dracula.
text: Peter downs his glass.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: I think I should get going.
text: Peter stumbles to his feet to leave, rather abruptly.
speaker_heading: BRIAN
dialog: Are you sure you can drive?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Yes little brother, I’m sure.
scene_heading: EXT. CAT AND FIDDLE
text: Peter gets on his SCOOTER. He starts off but loses his
text: balance. He and scooter tip over onto the sidewalk. Peter's
text: too drunk and tired to lift himself up.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Need some help there?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (oddly coy)
dialog: Maybe.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: C'mon. let’s get you home.
text: Ann helps Peter and his scooter up off the ground.
scene_heading: INT. PETER’S BEDROOM - AFTER
text: Post-sex, Peter and Ann lay beside each other awkwardly.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (numb )
dialog: Wow. So I guess it’s really over
dialog: now.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: We can do it again if you want?
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. It’s just...she’ll never take
dialog: me back now.
text: Peter begins to cry. Ann looks at him awkwardly.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: (crying)
dialog: I’m sorry. I just ended a
dialog: relationship and I thought if I had
dialog: sex with you I'd feel better.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: Are you crying?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (weepy)
dialog: I’m sorry. I’m just clearly not
dialog: ready yet. You’re a lovely girl,
dialog: but it’s not safe for you to fall
dialog: in love with me. I’m not someone
dialog: you want to be with.
speaker_heading: ANN
dialog: That’s okay. I have a boyfriend.
scene_heading: INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE
scene_heading: C.U.: Peter SCRUTINIZES HIS LIPS
text: A GRANDFATHERLY DOCTOR enters. Peter quickly sits back down.
scene_heading: DR. ROSENBAUM
dialog: Hello Peter, great to see you
dialog: again. What can I do for you?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well. I guess it’s a long story.
dialog: Ummm. I just got out of a five and
dialog: a half year relationship. So, last
dialog: night, like an idiot, I slept with
dialog: somebody I don’t know at all. She
text: claims she has a boyfriend, but
dialog: there's really no telling how many
dialog: people she’s been with, possibly
dialog: thousands. So... do you think you
dialog: could take a look at me?
scene_heading: DR. ROSENBAUM
dialog: (comforting)
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: DR. ROSENBAUM (CONT’D)
dialog: But I do have to tell you, this
dialog: isn’t really what I deal with on a
dialog: day to day basis.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: But you’re my doctor.
scene_heading: DR. ROSENBAUM
dialog: I’m a pediatrician Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I appreciate that, but I woke up
dialog: feeling like, some pressure on my
dialog: lip.
scene_heading: DR. ROSENBAUM
dialog: (understanding)
dialog: Okay. Let’s take a look.
text: Dr. Rosenbaum gives Peter’s lips a good look over.
speaker_heading: DR. ROSENBAUM (CONT’D)
dialog: Where do you feel this pressure?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Pretty much my whole lip area. Do
dialog: you see anything?
scene_heading: DR. ROSENBAUM
dialog: Everything looks fine. You’re good
dialog: to go. Have fun.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Thanks, but no thanks. I am done
dialog: being irresponsible.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - LATER

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: NAME GIRL
dialog: Peter.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Ha. Wrong! It’s Joel.
speaker_heading: NAME GIRL
dialog: Ohmigosh, I’m so sorry.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s OK. It’s bound to happen.
dialog: Joel’s not the most memorable name
dialog: around.
speaker_heading: NAME GIRL
dialog: I feel like such a hypocrite.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: It’s OK.
dialog: 18.
text: The girl and Peter start kissing again. Peter guiltily stops
dialog: kissing.
speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: You were right. My name’s Peter.

speaker_heading: HI GIRL

speaker_heading: PETER

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Those are only for the newlyweds.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Well, you have a beautiful hotel --

text: BEAUTIFUL AS EVER, HAIR STILL WET, IN A BIKINI TOP AND

text: This is WILLIAM PENLY (28), the best looking man on the

text: Peter stares wordless, stunned, mortified. Rachel notices.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yeah. That’s Sarah Marshall from

speaker_heading: PETER (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, God. They’re coming over here.

speaker_heading: RACHEL (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SARAH

speaker_heading: SARAH (CONT'D)
dialog: Please tell me this is a

speaker_heading: PETER

text: Behind the desk, Rachel subtly winces. Sarah smiles.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Seriously though, what are you

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don’t know. I’ve felt like there
dialog: was an alien trying to burst
dialog: through my chest for the past three
dialog: weeks, so I thought I’d get out of
dialog: town.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: I know what you mean. William and
dialog: I are here because we used that

dialog: flight?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: I don’t know. It was a flight. I
dialog: ate peanuts.
text: An awkward pause. Peter finds the strength to look

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Actually, William, it doesn’t look

speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: You were?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes sir, the Kapua Suite.
text: Peter looks at her, confused, but she offers back a confident

speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Excellent. And you say that’s one
dialog: of the nicer suites, yes?
text: Rachel is mildly amused at his posturing.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes Mr. Bretter. I think you'll
dialog: find it acceptable.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Marvelous.
dialog: (to William)
dialog: I am staying here as a matter of
text: fact. Just a quick five-day trip.
speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: Great. Well if you’d like to have

speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: (interrupting)

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: He doesn’t want that.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: No. No. That’s very gentlemanly of

dialog: Good to see you, Sarah.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Thanks Pete. Have a good trip.

text: When she is out of sight, Peter nearly collapses.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You okay?
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (very faint)
dialog: I’m fine, I’m fine. Look, thanks
dialog: for bailing me out, but I still
dialog: can’t afford the room.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No one can. It’s just for people
dialog: like Elton John or the kids from
dialog: that 70’s show. I don’t think
dialog: anyone’s gonna be popping in to
dialog: stay there in the next four days.
dialog: You can use the room, you just
dialog: can’t let anyone know.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Wow. OK, sounds good.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You need a key card to activate the
dialog: electricity.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Great.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: But I can’t give you one. It’1l
dialog: register with the system. I’m
dialog: giving you a janitor’s key instead.
dialog: No room service, no phone and
dialog: you'll have to clean up after
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: PETER
dialog: Why are you doing this?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: She’s here with a guy already?

speaker_heading: PETER

dialog: Well, good seeing you. I’m just

speaker_heading: WILLIAM
dialog: I owe you an apology. For the
