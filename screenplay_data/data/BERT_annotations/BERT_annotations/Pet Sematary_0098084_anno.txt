dialog: Stephen King
speaker_heading: FADE IN ON
text: that most persistent summer SOUND: crickets in high grass--
text: ree-ree-ree-ree... This in dark which slowly
scene_heading: DISSOLVES TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A GRAVE MARKER SUMMER DAY
text: It's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in
text: black paint which has faded: SMUCKY HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters
text: are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a
dialog: child.
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
scene_heading: EXT. ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER
text: A child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating:
scene_heading: BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER
dialog: 1971-1974.
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
scene_heading: EXT. TWO MARKERS
text: I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for
text: the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers
text: themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers
text: there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut
dialog: butter jars, etc.
text: These two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1,
text: 1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL
dialog: 1958 (another board).
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
scene_heading: EXT. FIVE OR SIX MARKERS
dialog: We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the
dialog: "gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that
dialog: this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated --
dialog: animal graveyard.
text: We can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER
text: LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood,
text: painstakingly hammered flat.
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.
scene_heading: EXT. ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY
text: From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by
text: forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are
text: arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this
text: clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard
text: clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which
text: hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the
text: words on the arch face those arriving along the path.
scene_heading: MAIN TITLES CONTINUE
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU
text: MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is
text: the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.
text: THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY
text: DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking
text: across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead
text: branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet
text: from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are
text: thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible.
text: AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the
text: deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible
text: snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence?
dialog: Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA
dialog: HOLDS ON IT and then we
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: BLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY.
scene_heading: EXT. A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY EVENING
text: SOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree...
text: To the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the
text: woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road.
text: The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a
text: shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN
text: REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a
text: bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally.
text: GROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts
text: between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver
text: body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its
text: short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it
text: comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the
text: driveway of the house we've been looking at.
scene_heading: EXT. REAR OF THE WAGON
text: As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the
text: license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED
dialog: YOUR M.D. TODAY?)
text: The ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree-
text: ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then:
speaker_heading: ELLIE CREED (voice)
dialog: Is this our new house, daddy?
speaker_heading: LOUIS CREED (voice)
dialog: This is it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE
text: The two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32,
text: gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out
text: from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a
text: girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house.
text: They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon,
text: still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: So...what do you think?
text: RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's gorgeous!
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Am I really gonna have my own room?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yaay!
text: She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging
text: down from the bough of a tree.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (to RACHEL)
dialog: Is that a swing?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes, but the rope might be--
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yaay!
text: She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Let her go. It's cool.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Louis, the house is beautiful.
text: They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws
text: her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the
text: car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: The Master of Disaster awakes.
text: This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: And Buckaroo Banzai.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Come on--let's parole 'em.
text: They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors,
text: LOUIS to the rear of the wagon.
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT SEAT, WITH RAHEL AND GAGE
text: GAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly
text: yelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are
text: littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar
dialog: crud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in
text: this station wagon, and the wagon looks it.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Decided to wake up and see what home
dialog: looks like, huh?
text: She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just
text: wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.
text: EXT. THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS
text: He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big
text: tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Daddy! Mommy! I see a path!
text: LOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward:
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING
text: She's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs.
text: EXT. THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV
text: We see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up
text: its flank and into the dark woods.
text: THE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)
speaker_heading: RACHEL (irritated)
dialog: Not so high, Ellie! You don't know
dialog: how strong that rope is.
text: She puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then
text: stands there, looking at his sister.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU
text: The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping
text: through decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is
text: fraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is
dialog: going to have a great fall.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)
text: He's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up.
dialog: ELLIE (raptuous voice)
dialog: Wheee!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie, you heard your m---
text: His eyes widen.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Wh--
text: SOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swing--with
text: ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams
text: and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised.
text: LOUIS and RACHEL run to her.
speaker_heading: LOUIS				RACHEL
dialog: Ellie! Are you all right?	Honey? Are you okay?
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT
text: ELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old
dialog: girl.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Anyone who can scream that loud isn't
dialog: ready for intensive care just yet--
text: looks like she just skinned her knee.
text: Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from
text: the tire. RACHEL helps.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE
text: He's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly
text: forgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a
dialog: bit; the boy needs a change.
text: He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses
text: interest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station
text: wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a
text: moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never
text: got around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the
dialog: mesh.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Hi-Durch!
speaker_heading: CHURCH
dialog: Waow!
text: GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap.
text: Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the
text: strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment.
text: SOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV)
text: A big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in
text: blue letters--blasts by.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER
text: The windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his
dialog: forehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by
text: GAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Druck!
text: He starts down the driveway toward the road.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING)
text: ELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the
text: wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much
dialog: from tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine
text: her scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (to RACHEL)
dialog: Would you get the first aid kit?
speaker_heading: ELLIE (screaming)
dialog: Not the stingy stuff! I don't want the
dialog: stingy stuff, daddy!
text: RACHEL suddenly looks around toward:
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV)
dialog: No one there.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Gage's gone!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jesus, the road!
text: They get up together.
text: EXT. GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD
text: A truck is coming. A great big one.
scene_heading: EXT. ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU
text: The grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE
text: He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab
dialog: him.
text: GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is
dialog: used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers
dialog: are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL
text: The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old
text: blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears
text: a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply
text: wrinkled and kindly.
speaker_heading: JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)
dialog: No you don't, my friend--not in
dialog: that road.
text: But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Drucks!
speaker_heading: JUD (low)
dialog: No shit, Sherlock.
text: JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's
text: joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE
text: brings up the rear. She's still sniffling.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Gage!
dialog: JUD (hands him to her)
text: He was headed for the road, looked
dialog: like. I corralled him for you, missus.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you. Thank you so much.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
text: He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no
text: crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as
dialog: if he might have arthritis.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving
dialog: the wandering minstrel boy, here.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No harm, no foul. But you want to watch
dialog: out for that road. Those damn trucks go
dialog: back and forth all day and most of the
dialog: night.
text: He leans over toward ELLIE.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Who might you be, little Miss?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642
dialog: Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause)
dialog: At least, I used to.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow,
dialog: and your dad's gonna be the new doctor
dialog: up to the college, I hear, and I think
dialog: you're going to be just as happy as a
dialog: clam here, Ellen Creed.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (to LOUIS)
dialog: Are clams really happy?
text: They all laugh--even GAGE.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to
dialog: change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Same here. Come over and visit when
dialog: you get the chance.
text: As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away:
speaker_heading: ELLIE (worries)
dialog: Daddy, do I really have to have the
dialog: stingy stuff?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No-I guess not.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yayyy!
text: She goes belting off.
speaker_heading: JUD (amused)
dialog: I guess your daughter there ain't
dialog: going to die after all.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (also amused)
dialog: I guess not.
speaker_heading: JUD
text: House has stood empty for too long.
dialog: It's damn good to see people in it again.
text: SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down.
scene_heading: EXT. A MOVING VAN
text: It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hey--they actually found the place!
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I
dialog: usually sit out on my porch of an evening
dialog: and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner.
dialog: Come on over and join me, if you want.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, maybe I----
speaker_heading: RACHEL (voice)
dialog: Louis, what's this?
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL AND GAGE
text: GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores
text: the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to
text: the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path
text: ELLIE has already glimpsed.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
text: They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just
text: climbing out of the van.
speaker_heading: FIRST MOVER
dialog: You Mr. Creed?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes. Just a second.
text: EXT. RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH
text: She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at
text: that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the
text: deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: The movers--
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does
dialog: it go?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw
dialog: the house, this field was under four feet
dialog: of snow.
dialog: RACHEL (smiling)
dialog: I bet Mr. Crandall knows!
text: JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that
text: he is serious.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and
dialog: a good walk, too. I'll take you up there
dialog: sometime, and tell you the story, too--
dialog: after you get settled in.
text: He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of
dialog: understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference
text: between the CREEDS and JUD.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT
scene_heading: SOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree...
dialog: There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the
text: path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being
dialog: mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
text: There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in
text: here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's
dialog: going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers'
text: cartons stacked all over the place.
text: LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned
dialog: tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first
dialog: night in the new place will understand.
text: He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room. He
text: sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket,
text: and lights one. He drops the spent match in the empty can, and
text: taps into the can during the scene.
text: SOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of
text: the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)
text: Kids are asleep, doc.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Great.
text: He hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just
text: two good people in all the big darkness of their new house.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You're not really going over to have a
dialog: beer with that old guy, are you?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, I've got a million questions about
dialog: the area, and---
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: ---and you'll end up doing a free
dialog: consultation on his arthritis or urinary
dialog: problems and---
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Did you see his shirt?
speaker_heading: RACHEL (giggles)
dialog: Sure. Bruce Springsteen.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I really do have a million questions
dialog: about the area...but the thing I'm
dialog: really curious about is how come this
text: octogenarian Yankee is decorating the
text: slumped remains of his pecs with the
dialog: Boss.
text: She laughs.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE NIGHT
text: Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly
text: up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: That you, doc?
scene_heading: EXT. THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE
text: We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of
text: JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman
text: earphones.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's me.
scene_heading: INT. THE PORCH, WITH JUD
text: The Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the
text: headphones casually around his neck, like a kid.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Well, come on up and have a beer.
scene_heading: INT. THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT
text: LOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with
text: some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You need a glass?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Not at all.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Good for you.
text: LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: God, that's fine.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ain't it just? The man who invented
dialog: beer, Louis, that man was having a
dialog: prime day for himself.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What were you listening to?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Allman Brothers.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: The Eat A Peach album. God, they were
dialog: good before drugs and bad luck caught
dialog: up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
text: He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the
text: Walkman's PLAY button.
text: SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats.
text: LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I'm sorry. Wait.
text: He turns it down.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Try that.
text: LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments.
text: It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot
text: Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Nice.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I like rock and roll. No...I guess
dialog: that's too mild. I love it. Since
dialog: my ears started to die out on me,
dialog: it's the only music I can really hear.
dialog: And since my wife died...I dunno, some-
text: times a little rock and roll fills up
dialog: night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause)
dialog: One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope
dialog: your time here will be a happy one.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (great sincerity)
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Crandall.
text: He drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable
text: silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look
dialog: toward:
scene_heading: EXT/INT. THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)
text: One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are
text: little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too--
text: sweeps by in a blast of air.
scene_heading: INT. THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
speaker_heading: LOUIS (wincing)
dialog: Jesus!
dialog: JUD (lights a cigarette)
dialog: That's one mean road, all right--you
dialog: remember that path your wife commented on?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: The one that goes into the woods--sure.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: That road--and those Orinco trucks--
dialog: are the two main reasons it's there.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What's at the end of it?
speaker_heading: JUD (smiles)
dialog: Another day--after you get settled in a
dialog: bit. Meantime, doc---
text: Here JUD raises his glass in a toast.
speaker_heading: JUD (continues)
dialog: Here's to your bones.
text: LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: And yours.
dialog: They drink.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 9 NIGHT
text: LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA
text: FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He
text: pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new
text: house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his
text: attention the other way...toward the path.
text: He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in
text: a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.
text: A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS
text: recoils with a startled, muffled cry.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH
text: The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in
text: the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow!
text: EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Church! God, you scared the life
dialog: out of me!
speaker_heading: CHURCH
dialog: Waow!
text: LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND
text: comes again and he looks toward:
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV
text: Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH
speaker_heading: LOUIS (to the cat)
dialog: I know one thing that will keep you
dialog: home, good buddy.
text: He starts toward the house.
text: BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD
text: SPEAK.
scene_heading: INT. A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU DAY
scene_heading: Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN
scene_heading: JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S
text: FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!
text: THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a
text: few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape.
text: We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL,
text: climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a
dialog: Gerrypak.
text: EXT. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD
text: They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them
dialog: catch up.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Take a look behind you.
text: They turn around, and their faces express their wonder.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: My God!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's beautiful!
scene_heading: EXT. THE VIEW
text: It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9
text: just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning
text: along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river
text: valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue.
text: EXT. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You folks ready to go on?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You'll see soon enough, hon.
text: They go into the woods, still following the path.
scene_heading: EXT. FOREST DAY
text: These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight
text: shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his
dialog: mark here.
text: THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is
text: carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked.
text: JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there
text: are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps
dialog: are.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper
dialog: companies?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up
dialog: ahead is all that's left of their
dialog: tribal lands.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (giggling)
text: Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac.
speaker_heading: JUD (smiles)
dialog: Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it?
dialog: You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Not yet...how much further is it?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.
text: He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him.
text: LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then
text: they press on.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY
text: EXT. JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH
speaker_heading: JUD (stopping)
dialog: This is the place, honey.
text: ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch
text: but can't. She whips around to look at her mother.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: What's it say, mommy?
text: A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like
dialog: this. Not a bit.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's
dialog: misspelled, but...that's what it
dialog: says.
text: She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Ellen--!
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE
text: She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
dialog: RACHEL (a bit lame)
dialog: Be careful.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE
text: She goes racing into the Pet Sematary.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
text: JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I told you it was a bad road,
dialog: Louis--it's killed a lot of pets
dialog: and made a lot of kids unhappy.
dialog: But at least something good come
dialog: of it. This place.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (excited voice)
dialog: Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it!
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY
text: She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs
text: toward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as
text: she goes. We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD
text: They are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is
text: extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and
text: clearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: How can you call it a good thing?
dialog: A graveyard for pets killed in the
dialog: road! Built and maintained by broken-
dialog: hearted children!
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't
dialog: quite that way, deah!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I think it's rather extraordinary.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
text: She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Well...they have to learn about death
dialog: somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed?
dialog: The little ones?
speaker_heading: RACHEL (coldly)
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Well...well, because--
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL
text: She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely
text: dangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her
text: life. A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches
text: nimbly to the next one up.
text: EXT. THE GROWNUPS, AT THE ARCH
speaker_heading: JUD (alarmed)
dialog: No, honey! You don't want to go
dialog: climbing on that! Come on down!
text: He hurries in.
scene_heading: EXT. ELIIE, ON THE DEADFALL
text: She looks back at JUD.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: It's okay, Mr. Crandall--
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE'S FOOT, CU
text: The branch she's on breaks with a dry CRRRACK. Her foot drops down
dialog: suddenly.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE AND JUD
text: She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and JUD catches her as
text: she falls. Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up.
text: LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Well, I thought it was safe--
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns
dialog: like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Bite?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH
text: Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to
dialog: come in.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (calls)
dialog: Is she all right, Louis?
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE
speaker_heading: LOUIS (calls back)
dialog: Fine! Come and see!
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH
speaker_heading: RACHEL (calling)
dialog: I think I'll sit this one out, doc.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE--BY THE DEADFALL
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I want to look around, daddy--
dialog: may I?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: For a little while.
text: JUD looks toward:
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL AT THE ARCH (ELLEN IN F.G.)
text: RACHEL has retreated a bit. She sits on the pine needle carpet of
text: the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
text: JUD looks at LOUIS as if to say "What's all this about?" LOUIS
text: looks away.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Dad! Daddy! Look! A goldfishie!
scene_heading: EXT. ELLIE
text: She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a
text: kid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at
speaker_heading: SMUCKY'S.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
text: They are walking slowly toward her. LOUIS is looking at the
dialog: tombstones.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I can hardly read these.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh--they get older as you go
dialog: toward the middle. (Points) Pete
text: LaVasseur's dog is buried there...
dialog: (points) the Stoppard boys' racing
dialog: pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat
dialog: got...and I think that's the cat
dialog: himself right there, although it's
dialog: been so many years I can't tell for
dialog: sure.
dialog: (calling)
dialog: Missy Ellen! Come over here just a
dialog: minute!
scene_heading: EXT. ELLEN
text: She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to
text: the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the
dialog: adults.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I see you're quite a reader for such
dialog: a little girl. Can you read that?
text: He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.
scene_heading: EXT. ELLEN, AT THE GRAVE MARKER
text: It is a small slate marker slanted to one side. ELLEN reads the
text: words laboriously, tracing them with her finger.
speaker_heading: ELLEN
dialog: "Spot a good fellow we love you boy."
dialog: (Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..."
dialog: Gee, I can't read the rest.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD AND LOUIS
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Last name's Crandall, little missy.
text: LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: That's where I buried my dog Spot
dialog: when he died of old age in 19 and
dialog: 14. Dug it good and deep. By the
dialog: time I finished, I had blisters all
dialog: over my hands and a hell of a crick
dialog: in my back. Soil's stony up here.
text: ELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too.
text: JUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is
text: still looking at ELLEN.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Do you know what this place is,
dialog: Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a
dialog: boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing
dialog: and even a whole pile of 'em don't
dialog: amount to much. Do you know what a
dialog: graveyard really is?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Well...I guess not.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: It's a place where the dead speak,
dialog: Missy.
text: He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her
text: hair reassuringly.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No--not right out loud. Their stones
dialog: speak...or their markers. Even if the
dialog: marker ain't nothing but a tin can
dialog: someone wrote on with a Magic Marker,
dialog: it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I think it is so, Ellie.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: What if you can't read what's
dialog: written on there anymore?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Well, it still says some animal got
dialog: laid down here after, don't it?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yes--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: And that someone cared enough about
dialog: that animal to mark the spot.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: To remember.
speaker_heading: JUD (smiles)
dialog: Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary
dialog: place, Ellie. It's a place of rest
dialog: and speaking. Can you remember that?
dialog: ELLIE (a little awed)
dialog: Yes, sir.
text: They start to walk slowly back toward the arch.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH
text: It's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (calls)
dialog: Louis, can we go? I'm tired!
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Mommy! This is a place where dead
dialog: animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so!
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL AND ELLIE
text: But RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (soft)
dialog: Did he.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: My wife is not crazy about cemeteries
dialog: of any kind. As you may have noticed.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Me neither. But I believe in knowing
dialog: your enemy.
text: LOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He
text: laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE
text: The men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (voice)
dialog: Did we take too long?
speaker_heading: RACHEL (curt)
dialog: Well, if supper's burned, I'm not
dialog: the one going out for pizza.
text: They move away.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH
dialog: The face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when
text: the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN NIGHT
text: There are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on
dialog: them. Guess dinner was burned.
text: THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen
text: table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is
text: putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and
text: tweezers. He's wearing glasses.
text: ELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (not looking around)
dialog: Hi, babe.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there
dialog: because of the road, isn't it?
text: LOUIS looks around at her, surprised.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: That's what I think. I heard
dialog: Missy Dandridge tell Mom when
dialog: Church was fixed he wouldn't
dialog: cross the road so much.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, it's always better to take
dialog: precautions--but I'm sure Church
dialog: will be all right, honey...
scene_heading: INT. JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR
text: RACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices
text: and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: No he won't! Not in the end! He won't
dialog: be all right in the end no matter how
dialog: you fix 'im!
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND ELLIE
text: Ellis has started to cry.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Lovey...Church might be still alive when
dialog: you're in a high school...and that's a
dialog: very long time.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: It doesn't seem long to me. It seems
dialog: short. I think the whole thing about
dialog: pets dying s-s-sucks!
text: Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms
text: and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: If it was up to me I'd let Church live
dialog: to be a hundred...but I don't make up
dialog: the rules.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (muffled)
dialog: Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's
dialog: not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get
dialog: His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not
dialog: mine! Not--
text: She breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and
dialog: forth.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL
text: She is crying silently.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
text: She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of
text: light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep
text: with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her
dialog: mouth.
scene_heading: INT. THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL
text: RACHEL looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly
text: closes the door.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM NIGHT
text: LOUIS is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the
text: bed. There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's
text: making notes from one as RACHEL comes in.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: She's finally asleep.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: She was a little over-excited,
dialog: that's all. Poor kid.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It was that place. That creepy cemetery
dialog: up in the woods. Whatever disease the
dialog: kids in this town have got, I don't want
dialog: Ellie to catch it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Do you think I didn't hear her tonight,
dialog: crying as if her heart would break?
dialog: Here she is thinking Church is going to
dialog: die.
text: It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is
text: much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook
text: aside and caps his pen.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Rachel...someday Church is going to
dialog: die.
text: RACHEL (whirls on him)
dialog: That is hardly the point! Church is
dialog: not going to die today, or tomorrow--
dialog: Never mind. I can see you don't have
dialog: the slightest idea what I'm talking about.
text: She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes
text: in and slams the door. He goes for the knob.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Rachel--!
text: SOUND: CLICK OF THE LOCK.
text: LOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 9 NIGHT
text: Here comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM
text: The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS
text: and RACHEL asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she
text: can get, with a big empty space in the middle.
text: Lights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade.
scene_heading: INT. GAGE MORNING
text: Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way
text: across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of
text: the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon.
text: Now he scoops up a handful and throws them.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE
text: Splat! Eggs on the serving plate of toast.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yee-uck! Gross!
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, A WIDER SHOT
text: RACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with
text: its message near her).
text: LOUIS comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his
text: first day on the job...and ELLIE is in a pretty first day of
dialog: school dress.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is
dialog: going to be beyond him for a few years.
scene_heading: INT. BY THE KITCHEN DOOR
text: Here is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it. He waows unhappily.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE AND GAGE
text: ELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I don't want him to get his nuts
dialog: cut, daddy! What if he dies?
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK
text: LOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIE'S colorful choice of
dialog: words.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Good God! Where'd you hear that?
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a
dialog: operation!
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK
text: LOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so
text: he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement
dialog: dies.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Honey, Church will be fine.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE, BY THE CAT CARRIER
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: But what if he dies and has to
dialog: go to the Pet Sematary?
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND RACHEL, BY THE SINK
text: She gives him a look as if to say: "There! Now do you understand
dialog: what you did?"
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't be silly. Church is not going
dialog: to die.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: According to what Mr. Crandall says, the
dialog: road's a lot more dangerous than the
dialog: operation. Church will be just the same.
dialog: Well--almost the same--and we won't have
dialog: to worry about him getting turned into
dialog: catburgers by one of those damn Orinco
dialog: trucks.
text: At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--she's
text: actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgers--but under the
dialog: anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be
text: shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's enough of that kind of talk!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I just said--
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I know what you just said. Ellie,
dialog: clear your place.
text: ELLIE goes slowly back to the table.
dialog: ELLIE (sets the plate down)
dialog: I'm scared. What if school here isn't
dialog: like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want
dialog: to go h-h-home!
text: ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL)
text: THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be
dialog: excused. Go and wash your face.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: And Church will be fine.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (anxious)
dialog: Do you promise, Daddy?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, honey...you know that...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
text: the little girl her promise.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (reluctantly)
dialog: Church will be fine. I promise.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yayyyy!
text: She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh, you're welcome. Only if some-
dialog: thing should go wrong while he's under
dialog: the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot,
dialog: but it happens--you explain to her.
text: He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and
text: a little frightened.
scene_heading: INT. GAGE
speaker_heading: GAGE (conversationally)
dialog: Here, Durch!
text: He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and
text: throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAT-CARRIER
text: CHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the
text: mesh, driving him back, surprised.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE MORNING
text: The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it
text: across the lawn, with her lunch-box.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Have a great day!
text: LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Bye-bye!
scene_heading: EXT. THE BUS
text: ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls
dialog: away.
text: EXT. THE CREED DRIVEWAY MORNING
text: The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy
text: briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens
text: the wagon's doorgate.
text: A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS.
text: A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the
text: front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She
text: looks at the cat-carrier.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Gonna get his--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: --nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy,
dialog: for introducing that colorful phrase
dialog: into my daughter's vocabulary.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: Don't mention it.
text: She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat
text: pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and
text: presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an
dialog: attack of indigestion.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (sees this)
dialog: How's that belly-ache of yours?
dialog: MISSY (gets the sheets)
dialog: No better and no worse.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You ought to see a doctor about it.
speaker_heading: MISSY
dialog: It'll pass. They always do.
text: She starts toward the house with the sheets.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SIDE YARD MORNING
text: RACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into
text: the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the
text: wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (anxious)
dialog: Still friends, doc?
text: LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then
text: he smiles and hugs her. They kiss.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank God. I was a little worried
dialog: there. Have a great first day at
text: school, doc. No broken bones.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (smiles)
text: Not so much as a sprain.
scene_heading: EXT. VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS MORNING
text: PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one
text: girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to
text: drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the
dialog: bearers.
text: PASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead
text: of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has
text: been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male
text: of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red
text: jogging shorts.
text: THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to
text: mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on
text: break to either side. The infirmary doors open.
scene_heading: EXT.. NURSE CHARLTON, AT THE DOORS
text: She's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty.
speaker_heading: CHARLTON
dialog: Holy Jesus.
dialog: (turns)
dialog: Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed,
dialog: we've got a mess here! Stat!
text: The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of
text: blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform.
scene_heading: INT. THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA
dialog: THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will
text: seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after
dialog: Sirhan shot Bobby.
text: As the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by
text: STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student
text: nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified.
text: LOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between
text: onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and
text: pulsing brain tissue beneath.
text: There's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the
text: blanket is having hysterics.
speaker_heading: GIRL
dialog: Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!
speaker_heading: LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
dialog: Get her out. Get them all out.
text: CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl.
speaker_heading: GIRL (struggling)
dialog: No! No! He can't die! He can't die!
text: THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from
text: STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes.
text: CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out
text: the door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Steve, get the ambulance over here
dialog: right now. He's got to go to EMMC.
speaker_heading: STEVE
text: The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco
dialog: downtown, getting--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: --a new muffler, oh shit--
text: PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of
text: his mouth. He begins to seizure.
text: One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the
text: student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall.
text: CHARLTON rushes over.
speaker_heading: CANDYSTRIPER
dialog: I can't look at it...I can't stand it...
dialog: CHARLTON (slaps her)
dialog: Yes you by God can. Go get the hard
dialog: stretcher!
text: As they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as
text: CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket,
text: THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Help me hold him.
text: They hold PASCOW'S spasming body.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: It wouldn't matter if we did have
dialog: the ambulance.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It wouldn't matter if we had the SST.
text: PASCOW begins to quiet.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: He's going. Steve, go call the motor-
text: pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.
speaker_heading: CHARLTON
dialog: It won't--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I know it won't! But let's for God's
dialog: sake do it by the rules!
text: She leaves. LOUIS is alone with PASCOW. CHARLTON has drawn the
text: drapes, so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary
dialog: privacy.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND PASCOW, A CLOSER SHOT
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: There wasn't even supposed to be a
dialog: sprain today, my friend--that's what
dialog: I told her.
text: PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps
text: LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but
text: relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: ...Pet Sematary...
text: LOUIS recoils, breaking the grip of the hand...but he cannot quite
text: snap the grip of those bright dying eyes. Blood leaks from
text: PASCOW'S mouth.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (whispers)
dialog: W-What did you say...?
text: PASCOW struggles hard to speak again. At first he can only gurgle.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: It's not the real cemetery...
dialog: (Long pause) The soil of a man's
dialog: heart is stonier, Louis...a man
dialog: grows what he can...and tends it.
text: LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: How do you know my name?
speaker_heading: PASCOW (gurgling)
dialog: I'll come...to you.
text: LOUIS grabs PASCOW'S bloody shoulder.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (low but urgent)
dialog: Dammit, how do you know my name?
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY ENTRANCE TO RECEPTION, WITH STEVE
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Louis, they're sending a--
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND PASCOW
text: PASCOW begins to spasm again.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (snaps)
dialog: Help me!
text: PASCOW spews more blood as STEVE kneels beside LOUIS.
scene_heading: INT. THE MAIN INFIRMARY HALLWAY
text: CHARLTON is pushing along your basic MEDCU goodie-cart, covered
text: with emergency life-saving gear.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, STEVE, PASCOW
text: PASCOW'S spasms are weakening.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
dialog: Never mind. He's going.
text: PASCOW'S hand comes up and paws at LOUIS'S shirt, leaving a bloody
text: handprint. Then it falls limply back. PASCOW is dead.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Steve, will you get a sheet to cover
dialog: him with?
text: STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body
text: of VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD, LATE AFTERNOON
dialog: It's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful. Here
text: comes LOUIS'S station wagon. As it reaches THE CAMERA, it swivels
text: to TRACK.
dialog: RADIO (voice-over)
dialog: Tragedy struck on the first day of the
dialog: University of Maine's fall semester
text: when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old
dialog: sophomore--
scene_heading: INT. THE CAR, WITH LOUIS
text: He still looks shocked by the tragedy. The dying man's bloody
text: handprint is partly visible on LOUIS'S shirt in spite of his
dialog: sport-coat.
text: LOUIS abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of
dialog: the road.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STATION WAGON
text: IT comes to a slueing, shuddering stop, almost going in the ditch.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, BEHIND THE WHEEL
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: He said my name. I heard it. He
dialog: said my name.
text: He stares blankly through the windshield.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT
text: All lights are off. It's late.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED BEDROOM NIGHT
text: LOUIS and RACHEL are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big
text: double. THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON LOUIS.
text: SOUND: Loud, hollow BANG. It's very loud--loud enough to wake the
dialog: dead.
text: LOUIS sits up. Beside him, RACHEL sleeps on. LOUIS'S eyes widen in
text: terror as he stares at:
scene_heading: INT. THE DOORWAY, WITH PASCOW
text: He's exquisitely dead. Now pallid as well as smashed up.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Come on, doc. We got places to go.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He is in terror...but he is also in a state of near-trance.
scene_heading: INT. PASCOW
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Come on, doc--don't make me tell you
dialog: twice.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud
text: voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast
text: asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed.
text: He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms.
scene_heading: INT. PASCOW
text: He turns and leaves the doorway.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at:
scene_heading: INT. THE BED, LOUIS'S POV
text: RACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed
text: asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad
dialog: dream.
scene_heading: INT. THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS (relieved)
dialog: Oh. Thank God.
speaker_heading: PASCOW (Voice)
dialog: Hurry up, doc.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN
text: LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the
text: shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it.
speaker_heading: PASCOW (low)
dialog: Come on, doc...
speaker_heading: LOUIS goes into:
scene_heading: INT. THE SHED/GARAGE
text: The station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands,
text: perplexed.
text: PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS
text: turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S
text: mutilated face.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Let's go, doc.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (moans)
dialog: I don't like this dream.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Who said you were dreaming?
text: He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS
text: follows him.
text: EXT. THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG NIGHT
text: We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW
text: and, behind him, LOUIS.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PET SEMATARY ARCH
text: CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, CLOSE
text: He looks around, obviously afraid.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV
dialog: We can see why. By starlight this is one scary place.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to
dialog: terror.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV
text: The face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls
text: on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified.
scene_heading: EXT. PASCOW, CLOSE
text: He really is a dreadful mangled mess.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: This is the place where the dead speak.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I want to wake up. I want to wake up,
dialog: that's all. I--
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND PASCOW
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: The door must not be opened. The
dialog: barrier must not be crossed. Don't
dialog: go on, doc. No matter how much you
dialog: feel you have to. There's more
dialog: power here than you know.
dialog: He points at:
scene_heading: EXT. THE DEADFALL
text: That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as
text: well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting
dialog: through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know.
text: After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind
text: the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before.
text: There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree
text: like a toothpick.
scene_heading: EXT. PASCOW AND LOUIS
text: LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly
dialog: shut.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Please, I want to wake up. Leave me
dialog: alone. It's not my fault you died; you
dialog: were as good as dead when they brought
dialog: you in--
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: The power of this place is old and
dialog: always restless. Sometimes the dead
dialog: do more than speak. Remember, doc.
text: CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Leave me alone!
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Remember.
text: CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS.
speaker_heading: RADIO (voice)
dialog: --another beautiful day in Maine!
dialog: This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that
dialog: the git-go ain't gonna be that bad.
dialog: Temps are going all the way up to 70...
dialog: We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's
dialog: "Sheena."
text: As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker":
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, IN BED
text: His eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE
text: CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the
text: covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back.
text: After the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved;
dialog: he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and
dialog: realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (calls)
dialog: You up, doc?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Getting there.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I got eggs down here!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Good d--
text: He throws the covers back and freezes.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS'S FEET, LOUIS'S POV
text: They are covered with mud and pine needles. The sheets are greased
dialog: with woods-muck.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, CU
dialog: Utter terror.
scene_heading: INT. THE LAUNDRY CHUTE, CU
text: LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the
dialog: chute.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL
text: He's naked but for a towel around his waist. He's obviously fresh
text: from the shower.
text: He starts down to the bedroom to dress.
text: BLACK. And on it a third title card: CHURCH.
text: Over this the SOUND of a RINGING TELEPHONE.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (voice)
dialog: Hello?
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM AFTERNOON
text: There's a bowling match on TV. LOUIS, dressed in his Saturday
text: afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt), has the phone to
text: his ear.
speaker_heading: JUD CRANDALL (phone filter)
dialog: Louis? 'Fraid you may have a spot of
dialog: trouble.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (frowning)
dialog: Jud? What trouble?
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
text: He's on the phone, looking out his window.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Did you tell me Rachel took the
dialog: kids back to Chicago for a few days?
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't
dialog: go because her old man thinks I'm a
dialog: shit and the feeling is heartily re-
dialog: ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow
dialog: night. Jud, what's this about?
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Well, there's a dead cat over here on
dialog: the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it
dialog: might be your daughter's.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CRANDALL HOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG
text: We're looking across from the CREED lawn. LOUIS waits for one of
text: those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses. It's cold and
text: windy. Downed autumn leaves fly.
text: LOUIS and JUD stand over a small furry body like mourners.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: Well?
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAT'S BODY
text: It's lying on its belly and doesn't look much damaged. Hands--
text: LOUIS'S--come into the frame. He puts one hand under the cat's
text: head and lifts it so the open eyes, now a dull green, stare into
text: THE CAMERA. There's some blood on its ruff. That's all.
text: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, ON THE EDGE OF THE CRANDALL LAWN
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's Church.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I'm sorry. At least it don't look like
dialog: he suffered.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.
text: From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and
text: hands it to JUD. JUD holds the bag's mouth open on the ground
text: while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in. During this:
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes.
text: LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on
text: it. Then he holds it up.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Bagged cat. What a mess.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You going to bury him in the Pet
dialog: Sematary?
speaker_heading: LOUIS (a little bitter)
dialog: I guess that's what it's there for, huh?
text: During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Going to tell Ellie?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Seems like you told me about a promise
dialog: you made--
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN MORNING
text: GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE, in her first-day-of-school
text: dress, is in her place. LOUIS is sitting at his own place staring,
text: hypnotized, at the middle of the table, where there is a large
text: serving dish. On the dish is scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, and
text: CHURCH'S corpse--staring eyes, bloody ruff and all.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (impatiently)
dialog: Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the
dialog: little girl her promise.
text: EXT. THE CRANDALL LAWN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS (defensive)
dialog: That was a mistake. But Rachel...
dialog: she doesn't like to talk about
dialog: death, or even think of it. Her
dialog: younger sister died of spinal
dialog: meningitis when Rachel was eight.
dialog: Rachel was there when it happened.
dialog: Alone. I guess you could say it
dialog: made a complex.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Cat's just as dead, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (snaps)
dialog: Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm
dialog: sorry, Jud.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No need to apologize.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Maybe when they call I'll just tell
dialog: Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat
dialog: around. You know?
dialog: JUD (after a long pause)
dialog: Maybe there's a better way.
text: EXT. THE START OF THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LONG EVENING
text: LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is
text: carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the
text: other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of
text: his own in the other.
text: Evening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark.
text: JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
text: JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones
text: slung around his neck.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jud, this is crazy. It's going to
dialog: be almost dark before we get back.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: It's going to be dark before we even
dialog: get where we're going, Louis. But
dialog: we can do it...and we're going to.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: But--
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Does she love the cat?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes, but--
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Then come on.
text: He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further
text: argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear
text: Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a
text: moment, LOUIS follows.
text: EXT. THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH LATE EVENING
text: The SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree...
text: The SOUND of footfalls.
text: Faintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working
dialog: For A Living."
text: It's now almost twilight.
text: JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around
dialog: curiously.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, folks, here we are, in Louis
dialog: Creed Dreamland.
text: JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck
dialog: again.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: What say, Louis?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on
dialog: the outer circle or start a new one?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: We're still not where we're going.
text: He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: The place we're going is on the
dialog: other side of that.
text: He points at the deadfall.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: We can't climb over that. We'll break
dialog: our necks!
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No. We won't. I have climbed it a time
dialog: or two before, and I know all the places
dialog: to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't
dialog: look down...and don't stop. If you stop,
dialog: you'll crash through for sure.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm not climbing that.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Give me the cat. I'll take care of it
dialog: myself.
text: He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as
text: he says. After a moment he says:
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Let's go.
text: JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its
text: snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of
text: stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (low)
dialog: Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.
scene_heading: EXT. THEIR FEET
text: First JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the
text: swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches
text: and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He's grinning, exhilarated.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: God, this is amazing!
scene_heading: EXT. JUD
text: There are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both
text: stern and a little scared.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Just don't stop and--
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He looks down.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS'S FEET
text: A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot
text: plunges down maybe six inches.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: And don't look down. Right.
text: He continues.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DEADFALL, REVERSE TWILIGHT
text: JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches
dialog: the top.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS (amazed)
dialog: Holy...!
scene_heading: EXT. BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV
text: In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe-
text: inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines
text: and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias.
text: The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an
text: old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle-
text: carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path
text: goes on.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with
text: frank amazement.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD
dialog: JUD (turns to look)
dialog: Come on, Louis--don't stop!
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL
speaker_heading: LOUIS (grinning)
dialog: I'm all right! I'm f--
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS'S FEET
text: One of the branches snaps. LOUIS'S foot plunges. His cuff rips.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, JUD'S POV
text: We're looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-
text: balance. He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, CLOSER
text: He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his
text: back, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand. His flashlight
text: also goes. Branches crack. White dust puffs out from under him.
text: EXT. JUD, AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL
text: LOUIS thumps to the ground nearby. JUD kneels beside him.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Louis! You all right?
text: LOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is
text: torn. His ankle is bleeding.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (dazed)
dialog: Sure. I guess I just lost my happy
text: thoughts for a second there.
text: LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather
text: shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (continues)
dialog: I shouldn't have stopped...and it
dialog: does bite.
text: He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the
text: light comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No, you shouldn't have stopped. But
dialog: you got away with it. Important thing
dialog: is are you sure you're all right?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You'll see before long. Let's go.
text: He starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying
dialog: the bag.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, FROM THE DEADFALL
text: Again, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go
text: tolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient
dialog: firs.
text: SOUND OF CRICKETS, LOW at first, then UP TO LOUD: Ree-ree-ree...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP TWILIGHT
text: Lots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too. The SOUND
text: OF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack: BUZZ OF CICADAS,
text: THUMP OF FROGS. Swamp-sounds.
text: LOUIS looks frankly doubtful.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis--
dialog: you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow
dialog: me and don't look down.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S AND JUD'S POV DEEP TWILIGHT
text: Mysterious...awesome...scary. Dead trees poke out of the murk like
text: twisted hands. There's scummy water standing around tussocks
text: covered with long grass, most of it dead. There's a lot of choking
text: underbrush.
text: All of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Is there quicksand?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh.
dialog: LOUIS (nervous; joking)
dialog: Are there ghosts?
text: JUD looks at him expressionlessly.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh.
text: JUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment,
speaker_heading: LOUIS follows.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD, CU
text: His face is set, strange.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: There's a lot of funny things down
dialog: this way, Louis.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BEHIND JUD
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're telling me.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD
speaker_heading: JUD (still walking)
dialog: The air's heavier...more electrical...
dialog: something. You might see St. Elmo's
dialog: Fire...what the sailors call 'foo-lights.'
text: It makes funny shapes, but it's nothing.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: HE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees:
scene_heading: EXT. ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV
text: A faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of
text: the dead trees. It looks a bit like a corpse. In fact, I think it
text: looks quite a bit like PASCOW'S corpse.
text: As we watch it fades...fades...is gone.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being
text: scared. Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the
text: surface of the standing water toward him...and then just fades
text: into the thick mist.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's funny, all right.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Just don't stop, Louis. You don't
dialog: ever want to stop down here in
dialog: Little God. (Pause) And you don't
dialog: ever want to look behind you,
dialog: whatever you hear.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD AND LOUIS, LONG ANGLE NIGHT
text: We see them moving through the mist like wraiths, JUD with his
text: digging tools, LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin. The
text: whole swamp is glowing dimly.
text: EXT. THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP NIGHT
text: In the extreme f.g. we can see firm ground sloping up. Ahead is a
text: thick white mist. And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it
text: and out of it. Both of them are wet from the knees down. They head
text: into the woods on the far side.
text: EXT. A LOW, STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL
text: In the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky
text: hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well. We can see
text: steps cut into the side, and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling
dialog: up them.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD AND LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT
text: JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse
dialog: shape.
speaker_heading: JUD
text: Almost there, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You keep saying that.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: This time I mean it.
text: He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars,
text: the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments
text: later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.
text: EXT. THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV
text: The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a
text: number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see,
text: there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst
dialog: apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the
dialog: Pet Sematary: concentric circles.
text: SOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly.
text: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND
speaker_heading: LOUIS (awed)
dialog: What is this place?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: This was their burying ground, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Whose burying ground?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: The Micmac Indians. I brought you here
dialog: to bury Ellen's cat.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Why? For God's sake, why?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later.
dialog: All right?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I guess so...but...
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You want to rest a bit before you start?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to
dialog: dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.
text: He hands him the pick and shovel.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I'm going to sit over yonder and have a
dialog: smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to
dialog: do it yourself. Each buries his own.
dialog: That's how it was done then.
text: JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand
text: and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out
text: into the burying ground.
text: EXT. LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE NIGHT
text: SOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here.
text: The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude
text: from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom,
text: and flashes fire.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside
text: him we see a low pile of rocks and earth.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: Should be deep enough.
text: He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You think so?
text: He notices the rocks.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What are those for?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Your cairn.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV
text: Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Doesn't look like they last long.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Don't worry about that.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jud, why am I doing all this?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Because it's right.
text: He walks off again.
text: LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG
text: He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You
dialog: were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if
dialog: you were worth all this aggravation,
dialog: but you were a hell of a good cat.
text: He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then
text: begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CAIRN, CU NIGHT
text: LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three
dialog: stones.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN
text: He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: That's fine. You did real good.
text: LOUIS looks at him.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE NIGHT
text: There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence
text: at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS'S FIELD NIGHT
text: LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their
text: lights. They are both clearly fagged out.
text: SOUND, FAINT: The telephone.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh, shit! Rachel!
text: He drops the tools and sprints.
text: EXT. THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING
text: LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder.
text: EXT. THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS
text: He runs to the door and inside.
scene_heading: EXT. THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD
text: He stands there, eyes inscrutable.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE
text: It stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up,
text: although he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND
text: of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle,
dialog: disgusted.
text: He starts to dial a number from memory.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: Louis.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: When you talk to 'em, not one word
dialog: about what we done tonight. 'S'far's
dialog: you know, the cat's still fine.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, BY THE PHONE
text: After a moment he lowers it into the cradle.
scene_heading: INT. JUD
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You'll understand. In the meantime,
dialog: keep your peace. What we did, Louis,
dialog: was a secret thing. Women are supposed
dialog: to be the ones who are good at
dialog: keeping secrets, but any woman who
dialog: knows anything at all would tell you
text: she's never seen into a man's heart.
text: The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
dialog: Louis--like the soil up there in the
text: old Micmac burying ground. A man
dialog: grows what he can...and tends it.
text: During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his
text: hand on LOUIS'S shoulder.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: But--
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No buts! Accept what's done, Louis.
dialog: What we done was right. Another time
dialog: it might not be, but tonight it was...
dialog: at least I hope to Christ it was. Now
dialog: you make your call...but not a word
dialog: about tonight.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD, WITH JUD
text: SOUNDS: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone. Ringing. Then:
scene_heading: DORY GOLDMAN (voice)
dialog: Goldman residence.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hi, Dory...it's Louis--
text: During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck.
text: As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear
text: on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for
dialog: tonight's piece of work.
text: A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA
speaker_heading: and JUD.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM NIGHT
text: He's on the phone, smiling and happy.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (voice)
dialog: You want to talk to the birthday girl?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That'd be real fine.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Hi...daddy?
speaker_heading: LOUIS (sings)
dialog: Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday
dialog: to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy
dialog: birthday to you!
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: That was awful, daddy.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yeah, I know...how are things out
dialog: there in Chicagoland?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Fine...except when Mom was airing
text: Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and
text: got into Grampa's study and pooped in
dialog: Grampa's favorite chair.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (grinning broadly)
dialog: Way to go, Gage!
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I said that's too bad. What did you
dialog: get for presents from Gramma and Grampa?
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and
dialog: a Chatty Cathy doll...
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE
text: She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is
text: crooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: ...and a Garfield radio! How's Church,
dialog: dad? Does he miss me?
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: The smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of
text: combined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which
text: are still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie.
dialog: I haven't seen him this evening, but--
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE
text: RACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Well, make sure you put him down
dialog: cellar before you go to bed so he
dialog: can't run out in the road and get
dialog: greased. And kiss him goodnight for me.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (voice)
dialog: Yuck! Kiss your own cat!
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Want to talk to Gage?
text: Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and
text: RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL
text: encourages him to say a few words.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling.
text: LOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE MORNING
text: LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the
text: tire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake
text: against the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS
text: It's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates
text: to the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat
text: HISS. He turns.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH, ECU
text: He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't
text: notice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming
text: right down our throats. He's hissing angrily.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack
text: on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING
speaker_heading: NOISE.
text: INT. ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH
text: He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as
text: he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but
text: we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright.
text: He goes to the garage door and looks out.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (calls)
dialog: Church?
scene_heading: EXT. THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV
text: Grass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
text: He's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there
dialog: should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living
text: room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly
text: outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now.
scene_heading: EXT. THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS
text: He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Food, Church...food!
dialog: SOUND: Miaow.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV
text: CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward
text: THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Come on, Church! Chow down!
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH
text: He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (to himself)
dialog: Christ. I don't believe this.
text: He picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (wincing)
dialog: God, you stink, Church.
text: CHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: In a second.
text: He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S
dialog: neck.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV)
text: There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant	of the crash. A
text: line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all
dialog: grows.
text: EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP
text: LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes
text: something out of CHURCH'S whiskers.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS'S HAND, ECU
text: It's a shred of green plastic.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND CHURCH
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded
dialog: Christ, he ch--
text: CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ow!
text: He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS
text: slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek,
text: welling blood. He looks at the cat.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD
text: The garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling
text: slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several
text: pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a
text: Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear
text: the Romantics doing "What I Like About You." JUD is singing along
dialog: and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you
dialog: can dig it.
text: He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it.
text: He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets
text: the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is
dialog: right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking
text: totally stunned.
text: JUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the
text: phones off JUD'S ears.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What did we do?
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL KITCHEN
text: LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD
text: comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens
dialog: them.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I most generally don't start before
text: noon, but this looks like an exception.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What did we do, Jud?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Why, saved a little girl from being
dialog: unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
text: LOUIS drinks about half the beer.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I tried to tell myself I buried him
dialog: alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets
dialog: Felix the Cat. But...
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Wouldn't wash?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I
dialog: see it, and Church was dead. He smells
text: horrible and he uses his claws, but
dialog: he's alive...and I feel like I'm going
dialog: crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about
dialog: the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids
dialog: just called him Stanny B. He was half
dialog: Micmac himself.
text: LOUIS drains his beer.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Can I have another one?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I guess it wouldn't hurt.
text: He gets up and goes to the fridge.
scene_heading: INT. JUD, AT THE FRIDGE
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: The Micmacs used to bury their dead
dialog: up there long before the whites came.
text: He returns to the table with the beer.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: They buried their dead and for a long
dialog: time their dead stayed buried. Then
dialog: something happened. Half the tribe died
text: in a season. The rest moved on. They
text: said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Wendigo?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Spirit of the north country. Not a good
dialog: spirit. Wendigos are great liars and
dialog: tricksters, according to the stories.
dialog: And if one touches you...
text: JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Maybe it really was a Wendigo--
dialog: I ain't the one to say it wasn't--
dialog: or maybe it was just some disease.
dialog: Whatever the reason, those that were
dialog: left moved on. But they left that
dialog: place...the way it is now.
text: JUD shrugs, and drinks.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE DAY
text: The time here is about 1910. JUD is wearing short pants. He's
text: crying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to
dialog: keep doing it for a long time. I mean he looks really sad.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: I loved my dog a lot, Louis. When Spot
dialog: died, I thought I was gonna die.
text: JUD is sitting on the front stoop. It's the same house JUD lives
text: in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt
text: rather than tar.
text: Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY B.'S wagon. The
text: wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap.
text: Strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their CHIMING
text: SOUND...but faint, like bells heard in a dream.
text: STANNY B. is old and drunk. Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he
text: draws up to the CRANDALL house and stops. He gets down, almost
text: falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and
text: approaches JUD. We can see him speaking.
scene_heading: INT. JUD'S KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You and this old Indian rag-man--
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Stanny B. did for me what I did for
dialog: you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't
dialog: alone when Spot came back.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CRANDALL BACK YARD/SEPIA TONE DAY
text: JUD'S MOTHER is back to THE CAMERA, hanging sheets on the line.
text: The sheets billow. And suddenly, pushing out from behind them,
text: quite near her, is a small mongrel dog. SPOT. He's covered with
text: graveyard dirt. His eyes are red and rolling. He splashes the
text: sheets with the muck of his passage.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: My mother was with me.
text: She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away, screaming,
text: horrified.
scene_heading: EXT. SPOT, CLOSER/SEPIA
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: He'd got caught in bobwire that infected.
dialog: You could still see the marks on him.
text: And so we can, around his neck and along the side of his head.
dialog: These marks are the counterpart of the marks we've already seen on
speaker_heading: CHURCH.
text: SOUND of JUD'S MOM SCREAMING. Like the bells, these are screams
text: heard in a dream.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACK STOOP OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE/SEPIA
text: The BOY JUD comes running out, dressed in a night-shirt.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD'S MOM/SEPIA (JUD'S POV)
text: She's cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard. SPOT
text: stands in front of her, swaying from side to side, as if doped.
speaker_heading: JUD'S MOM (dim; far)
dialog: Get your dog, Jud! He stinks of the
dialog: ground you buried him in! Come here
dialog: and get your dog!
text: She is in utter terror.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BOY JUD/SEPIA
text: Horrified...ashamed.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD'S MOM/SEPIA
speaker_heading: JUD'S MOM (terror)
dialog: COME AND GET YOUR DOG!!
scene_heading: INT. JUD AND LOUIS, IN JUD'S KITCHEN
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: How did your mother take it, Jud?
dialog: How did she take it when your dog
dialog: came back from the dead?
text: JUD'S face is a complication. He's lying to LOUIS, certainly--but
dialog: is he also lying to himself? Yes, I think so.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Well, she was a little upset at first,
dialog: and that's why I thought you ought to
dialog: hold your peace when you talked to
dialog: your people last night...you did, didn't
dialog: you, Louis?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Why, then, things should be fine.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: A little upset is all she was? Because
dialog: I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a
dialog: little like a nuclear reactor on the
text: edge of a meltdown.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: She got used to the idea. Spot lived
dialog: another four years. He died peacefully
dialog: in the night that second time, and I
dialog: buried him in the Pet Sematary...where
text: his bones still lie.
text: EXT. THE ROAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
text: We see them crossing.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (voice)
dialog: You still haven't told me why you
dialog: did it.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD AND LOUIS, ON THE CREED FRONT LAWN
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: A man doesn't always know why he does
dialog: things, Louis. I think I did it because
dialog: your daughter ain't ready for her
dialog: favorite pet to die.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ellie's a little scared of death. And
dialog: the main reason Ellie's that way is
dialog: because your wife is a lot scared of
dialog: death. Now you just go ahead and tell
dialog: me I'm wrong.
text: But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrong--in fact, JUD has
text: hit the nail right on the head.
scene_heading: INT. BATHTUB FIXTURES, CU
text: LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and turn the spigots.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: He starts to undress, still looking troubled. We should notice
text: that the door behind him is firmly shut. The bathroom has no
dialog: windows.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHTUB SPIGOTS
text: The hot water is steaming. LOUIS'S hands enter the frame and turn
text: off the faucets. SOUND of LOUIS climbing in.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS IN THE TUB
text: A big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure. He relaxes in
text: the hot water. After a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over
text: his face.
scene_heading: INT. BY THE KITCHEN SINK, WITH RACHEL
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
text: the little girl her promise.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE
text: GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE is at her place, crying. In
text: RACHEL'S place sits VICTOR PASCOW, bloody and wrecked. LOUIS sits
text: in his place. On the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is
text: CHURCH'S mangled body.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: The door must not be opened. The
dialog: barrier must not be crossed.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You don't understand--
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS
text: The washrag is slipping, but it still covers his face.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (mutters)
dialog: --I'm a doctor.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE
text: In attendance: PASCOW, LOUIS, ELLIE, GAGE in his high chair. Lying
text: in the middle of the table, clotted with dirt and blood, eyes
text: staring, neck a gory mess of infected wounds, is SPOT. He's also
text: dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Sometimes the dead do more than speak.
dialog: Remember, doc.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK
dialog: RACHEL (with great force)
dialog: Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me.
dialog: Promise me. Promise me.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS
text: The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are
text: closed--he's dozing.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Promise...
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE
text: To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD,
text: his eyes shocked and staring.
speaker_heading: JUD (to LOUIS)
dialog: You do it for all the best reasons,
dialog: but that ain't why. You do it because
dialog: it gets hold of you...you do it
dialog: because you have to.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU
text: The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze
text: is deepening; he's started to snore a little.
text: SOUND: A splash. Something has been dropped into the bath.
text: LOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in
dialog: shock.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV
text: A very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath,
text: actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain
dialog: the water.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out.
scene_heading: INT. THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH
text: Its mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHROOM
text: LOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself
text: frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him
text: and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing.
text: LOUIS looks at the closed door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: How the hell did you get in?
text: He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He
text: opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once,
text: LOUIS helps it with his foot.
text: Then he looks down at:
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: Staring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES.
scene_heading: EXT. A DELTA 727
text: Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor
dialog: International Airport.
scene_heading: INT. A DEPLANING AREA DAY
text: Lots of people making their way up the jetway.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT
text: He's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a
text: dozen roses. His face lights up.
scene_heading: INT. THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV
text: Here comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is
text: pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Daddy!
text: She runs for him.
scene_heading: INT. JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT
text: ELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like
text: a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her
text: cheerfully.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hi, sugar!
text: She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Daddy, is Church all right?
text: LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping
dialog: on the front porch when I left.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Cause I had a bad dream about him.
dialog: I dreamed he got hit by a car and
dialog: you and Mr. Crandall buried him in
dialog: the Pet Sematary.
dialog: LOUIS (trying to smile)
dialog: That was a silly dream, wasn't it?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Is he really all right?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Because you promised.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I know.
text: RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face,
text: good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit
dialog: stale.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Want to take your son, doc?
text: LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic.
text: LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT
text: CHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors.
text: CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She
text: looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT
text: RACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a
text: medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket
text: suit, is sacking on the couch.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (entering)
dialog: Can cats have shampoos?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes--you have to take them to someone
dialog: who grooms animals, though. I think
dialog: it's pretty expensive.
dialog: ELLIE (still upset)
dialog: I don't care. I'll save up my allowance
dialog: and pay for it. Church smells bad.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up
dialog: the money, Ellen.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I hate that smell.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, CU
text: He looks both grim and sad--a man discovering that what you pay
dialog: for you own, and what you own always comes home to you.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes--I hate it, too.
text: BLACK. And on it, a fourth title card: MISSY DANDRIDGE.
text: SOUND: A pen scratching over paper.
scene_heading: INT. A STUDY DESK, CU
text: A single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the
text: desk-lamp. On it, MISSY'S right hand is just finishing: "Dr. says
dialog: Intestinal Cancer. Cannot face this Pain. Sorry."
text: The hand puts the pen down. It tears the paper in two, leaving
text: just the half with the message.
scene_heading: INT. THE DANDRIDGE CELLAR, NIGHT
text: A light comes on and we see a hangman's noose strung over a beam.
text: It dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to
dialog: cellar duty.
text: SOUND: Descending footsteps.
scene_heading: INT. THE NOOSE, CU
text: SOUND of MISSY climbing onto the table.
text: Her face enters the frame. She looks very sick. She puts her head
text: into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DANDRIDGE HOUSE, NIGHT
text: One light on...a cellar light.
dialog: SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...then...
dialog: SOUND: Kick! THUMP!
scene_heading: SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...
scene_heading: INT. THE CELLAR, WITH MISSY DANDRIDGE
text: She hangs limply, hands dangling at her sides, above the table,
text: which now lies upon its side. We can see the note clearly. She
text: pinned it to the bodice of her housedress.
text: SOUND: Car engines starting up.
scene_heading: EXT. IN FRONT OF THE GRACE METHODIST CHURCH DAY
text: People are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on
text: the headlights, even though it is only mid-morning.
text: In the immediate f.g. is a hearse. Four pallbearers are loading a

scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND ELLIE, ON THE CHURCH STEPS
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: They're all turning on their lights!
dialog: Daddy, why are they all turning on
dialog: their lights in the middle of the day?
text: JUD, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out
text: and stands with them. He looks haggard and old.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Is that right, dad?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes. To honor the dead.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CHURCH PARKING AREA
text: More cars start up; more lights come on; the back doors of the
text: hearse swing closed.
scene_heading: EXT. LUDLOW CEMETARY DAY
dialog: [NOTE: In the book LOUIS finds it difficult to enter at night
dialog: because of a high iron fence. Here we should see there's no such
text: problem; there's only a low stone wall between the graveyard and
dialog: the public road.]
text: The mourners are of course gathered around the grave of MISSY
text: DANDRIDGE. The coffin rests above it on runners.
speaker_heading: MINISTER (voice)
dialog: May the Lord bless you and keep you;
dialog: may the Lord make his face to shine
dialog: upon you, and comfort you, and lift
dialog: you up, and give you peace. Amen.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD
text: As the mourners begin to break up, these three start back toward
text: LOUIS'S car.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Rachel not feeling well?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well...a touch of the flu...
speaker_heading: ELLIE
text: She's in bed. She was throwing up.
dialog: Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said
dialog: Missy--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That's enough, Ellen.
text: They've reached the CREED station wagon.
speaker_heading: JUD
text: Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: This babe has said enough.
text: He opens the front passenger door.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hop in, Ellie.
text: She does, and LOUIS closes the door.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to
dialog: hear. I remember when she was
dialog: no older'n Ellen there, walking down
text: to the store with her Raggedy Anne
text: doll draggin' behind her in the dust.
dialog: I don't know why God takes someone
dialog: like her, who should have a bunch of
text: years still in front of them, and lets
dialog: an old shit like me just go on and on.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: My father used to have a saying, Jud--
dialog: "God sees the truth, but waits."
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: It's Ellie's cat.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Nope. He's your cat now.
text: JUD opens one of the back doors as LOUIS goes around to the
text: driver's side.
scene_heading: INT. THE BACK SEAT OF THE WAGON
text: JUD has tilted over in one corner and is snoring. His Walkman
text: 'phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of Billy Idol. A
text: little old man's drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth.
text: SOUND: ELLEN&lt; crying.
text: INT. THE FRONT OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE
text: Tears are spilling freely down ELLIE'S face.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie? What's wrong?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: No more chocolate chip cookies.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Missy made the best chocolate chip
dialog: cookies in the world--even Mom said
dialog: so. Now there won't be any more
dialog: because she's gonna be dead forever!
text: She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair.
scene_heading: EXT. THE STATION WAGON, DAY
text: Moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall
dialog: foliage.
scene_heading: INT. TV SCREEN, CU NIGHT
text: On it is a scene from "Night of the Living Dead."
speaker_heading: NEWSCASTER
dialog: Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems
dialog: almost beyond doubt: the dead are
text: returning to eat the living.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Daddy?
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED LIVING ROOM NIGHT
text: There's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching "Night."
text: Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV.
text: She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What's up, sugar?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge
dialog: went to heaven?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What?
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL
text: She's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this
text: and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look
text: at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE
text: She's gotten up into his lap.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: At school Michael McDowell said she was
dialog: gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says
text: all sewersides fry in hell.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full
text: of shit he probably squeaks when he walks,
dialog: my dear.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL, AT THE DOOR
text: She smiles a little at this.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND ELLIE, IN THE LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: But don't you dare say that.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you
dialog: think?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I don't know, honey. Different people
dialog: believe all sorts of different things
dialog: happen to us when we die. Some believe
dialog: in heaven or hell. Some think we're
dialog: born again as little children--
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Sure, carnation. Like in that movie
dialog: you rented, Audrey Rose.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: Well, it's actually reincarnation, but
dialog: you get the idea. And some people think
text: we just wink out...like a candle flame
text: when the wind blows hard.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Do you believe that?
text: LOUIS looks toward:
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM SOFA, WITH CHURCH, LOUIS'S POV
text: CHURCH is sleeping.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND ELLIE
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I think we go on. I'm not sure
dialog: what happens after we die, but yeah--
dialog: I have faith in that.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: You believe in it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh, faith's a little more than just
dialog: believing.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR
text: Listening intently.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND ELLIE
speaker_heading: LOUIS (continues)
dialog: I'll tell you what faith is--it's the
dialog: evidence of the heart; the assurance
dialog: of things not seen.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I don't get it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Well, here we are, sitting in my
dialog: chair. Do you think my chair will
dialog: be here tomorrow?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Yeah, sure.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Then you have faith in that. But
dialog: we don't know it will be; after all,
dialog: some crazed chair-burglar might break
dialog: in while we're away and steal it, right?
text: ELLIE'S giggling.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL, AT THE DOOR
text: She's smiling, too...but tears are running down her cheeks.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND ELLIE
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: But we plan on that chair. We believe
dialog: in that chair. And I plan on going on
dialog: somehow as Louis Creed, after I die.
dialog: I believe I will.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (awed)
dialog: You have faith in that.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that
dialog: it is now time for Ellen Creed to get
text: ready for bed. So buzz.
text: He gets her off his lap.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I'm not tired!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm sure you're not.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Then why do I have to go to bed?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Because your mother and I need
dialog: the rest, sugar. Now buzz.
text: She heads toward the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM
text: LOUIS is in bed, reading. RACHEL, wearing a robe over her
text: nightgown, comes in.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I heard you tonight.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I thought maybe you did. I know
dialog: you don't approve of the subject
dialog: being raised--
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: That's not true. The subject
dialog: scares me. Because of Zelda.
text: LOUIS puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Your sister, I know.
text: RACHEL sits down on the end of the bed. She's clasping her hands
dialog: nervously together.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Sometimes you're so good with her,
dialog: Louis--so straight with her--that
dialog: you make me ashamed of myself.
text: LOUIS sits up and scoots down the bed to her. He tries to put an
text: arm around her. She rejects it--but gently.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm sorry I couldn't go with you
dialog: to Missy's funeral. And that I
dialog: blew up when we went to that
dialog: silly animal graveyard.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: That's forgotten.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Not by me, it isn't. I know how
dialog: badly I acted, how unfair I was.
dialog: It's just that I..you know.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes, I guess I do.
text: He makes a place for her beside him and hugs her. They lie
text: silently together for awhile, taking comfort from each other.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm going to try to do better.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You're doing fine.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: BLACK. And on it, a fifth title card: GAGE.
text: SOUND: An idling truck motor.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GRILLE OF A TRUCK DAY
text: It looks monstrous...as high as a mountain.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TRUCK, A NEW ANGLE
text: It's an Orinco tanker. The driver, a young man in khaki fatigues
text: and a baseball cap, climbs up into the cab. He slams the door and
text: jams the truck into gear.
speaker_heading: IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
dialog: I knew something like this would happen.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ORINCO SHIPPING YARD DAY
text: The truck comes rolling slowly toward the main gate...stops so the
text: driver can look both ways...and then pulls slowly out onto ROUTE
dialog: 9.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (voice continues)
dialog: I told her when you were first married.
dialog: 'You'll have all the grief you can stand,
dialog: and more,' I said.
scene_heading: INT. A FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN GOLDMAN AND LOUIS DAY
text: There are others here, but they are in the b.g., and concentrating
text: on the scene the old man is making. He's RACHEL'S dad. LOUIS is
text: sitting in the aisle seat of a pew-like bench. He looks terribly
text: shattered--they both do, actually. He's staring at the old man as
text: if he cannot in the least comprehend what he's saying.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (continues)
dialog: And now look at this!
text: He gestures toward:
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT OF THE FUNERAL CHAPEL DAY
text: Here, half-buried in floral tributes, is a child-sized coffin.
speaker_heading: GAGE'S.
scene_heading: INT. IRWIN AND LOUIS DAY
speaker_heading: IRWIN (weeping)
dialog: Run over in the road like a...a
dialog: chipmunk!
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 9, W/TRUCK DAY
text: Getting up to speed.
scene_heading: EXT. A KITE, CU
text: There's a hand holding it--LOUIS'S. The kite begins to move and
text: THE CAMERA TRACKS IT. It flaps and flutters.
text: EXT. THE FIELD BESIDE THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS
text: He runs with the kite beneath a gorgeous fall sky in which fat
text: clouds move like airy ocean liners.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Go, daddy!
scene_heading: EXT. A PICNIC TABLE DAY
text: The remains of a picnic lunch are spread here. Looks like everyone
text: ate well. In attendance: RACHEL, ELLIE, GAGE, and JUD CRANDALL.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Go, dayee!
text: They all laugh--JUD ruffles the kid's hair.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, RUNNING WITH THE KITE
text: He's paying out string--and the kite is going up.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (voice)
dialog: Where's Rachel?
scene_heading: INT. THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN
speaker_heading: IRWIN looks toward:
text: INT. THE BACK OF THE CHAPEL, WITH RACHEL AND DORY GOLDMAN
text: They are by the sign-in book. Both are dressed in black. Both look
text: haggard. But RACHEL looks more than haggard; she looks damned near
text: insane with grief and horror.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND IRWIN
speaker_heading: IRWIN (leaning forward)
dialog: With her mother! Where she should be!
dialog: As for you, I hope you rot in hell!
dialog: In hell, do you hear me?
text: We should; by now he's screaming his head off.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAB OF THE ORINCO TRUCK DAY
text: The driver is whistling. A transistor radio hangs from the rear-
text: view mirror on a strap. He turns it on. The Ramones. "Sheena."
dialog: Hey-ho, let's go.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 9, TRUCKER'S POV
text: Unrolling before us at a good clip--too good, maybe.
scene_heading: INT. THE TUCKER'S FOOT
text: Stamping the pedal closer to the metal.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ONCOMING TRUCK
text: Belting toward THE CAMERA. SOUND of the GROWLING ENGINE.
text: EXT. THE SKY, WITH THE KITE
text: LOUIS has clearly gotten it up okay.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, IN THE FIELD
text: He's holding the string, looking up at the sky. Now he looks back
text: at the picnic table.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hey, Gage!
scene_heading: EXT. THE PICNIC TABLE
text: GAGE gets down and runs toward his father.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 9 WITH THE ORINCO TANKER
text: Belting along fast. SOUND of the Ramones.
text: EXT. THE FIELD, WITH LOUIS AND GAGE
text: GAGE runs to his dad, chubby legs working. He reaches him, and
text: LOUIS transfers thee ball of string to GAGE'S hands.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Dat?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: String! You're flying it,
dialog: Gage--you got the hammer, my man!
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Gage fline it?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Bet your boots. Look--
text: LOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down.
scene_heading: EXT. THE KITE
text: It dips in the sky.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND GAGE
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: See?
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Gage fline it!!
speaker_heading: LOUIS (tenderly)
dialog: Bet your ass, little hero.
text: He kisses his son. They look up at:
scene_heading: EXT. THE KITE
text: Dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky.
speaker_heading: IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
dialog: Where were you while he was playing in
dialog: the road? Thinking about your stupid
dialog: medical articles? You stinking shit!
dialog: You killer of children!
scene_heading: INT. THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: You--
text: But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As
text: LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the
text: nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the
dialog: floor.
scene_heading: INT. THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY
text: RACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT!
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND IRWIN
text: LOUIS is getting up groggily. Hs nose is pouring blood.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: How do you like that, you son
dialog: of a bitch? I should have done
dialog: it sooner!
text: IRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS "oofs" and doubles over.
scene_heading: INT. ANGLE ON THE OTHER MOURNERS
text: Among them we see STEVE MASTERTON and MARCY CHARLTON.
speaker_heading: STEVE (getting up)
dialog: Hey!
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND IRWIN
text: LOUIS is slowly straightening up. IRWIN is in a sour frenzy of
dialog: glee.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: How do you like that? How do--
text: LOUIS pushes the old man with both hands.
scene_heading: INT. IRWIN GOLDMAN
text: He goes stumbling and flailing backwards...strikes the coffin...
text: knocks it off its bier. A SCREAM goes up from the mourners.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL AND DORY
text: RACHEL screams. Her mother struggles to hold her but RACHEL easily
text: breaks free and goes running down the aisle.
scene_heading: INT. ANGLE ON MOURNERS, WITH MARCY AND STEVE
speaker_heading: MARCY
dialog: Stop them. Right now.
text: STEVE gets up and goes toward:
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT OF THE CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN
text: He's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and
text: overturned floral tributes. His suit is wet from spilled water.
text: He's weeping.
text: LOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think
text: he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny
text: little body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic
dialog: pose.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll
dialog: take y'apart!
text: As LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them...at the last
dialog: possible moment.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Stop it!
text: LOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with
dialog: you, Louis? It's your son's funeral,
dialog: not a boxing match!
text: That gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression
text: creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have
dialog: the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly
dialog: have happened.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: PASCOW (voice)
text: The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
dialog: doc--
text: LOUIS turns toward:
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT PEW, WITH PASCOW AND CHURCH
text: PASCOW, bloody and ruined in his jogging shorts and muscle shirt,
text: has the pew to himself...except for CHURCH, who is sitting on his
text: lap and PURRING.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
text: A man grows what he can...and tends it.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, CU
text: A sense of horrible awareness comes into his face...and then he
text: covers it with his hands and begins to SOB.
text: SOUND, COMING UP: A TRUCK MOTOR.
scene_heading: INT. THE CAB OF THE TANKER
text: The trucker is singing along with the radio.
scene_heading: INT. THE GAS PEDAL
text: It's closer to the floorboards than ever.
text: EXT. LOUIS AND GAGE WITH THE KITE, IN THE FIELD
text: We are at some distance--far enough to see that the two of them
text: have moved quite close to the road.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND GAGE, A NEW ANGLE (KITE'S POV)
text: We can see their faces upturned to us--we can hear the AMPLIFIED
text: RATTLING SOUND of the kite itself.
text: THE CAMERA PANS TO THE LEFT--to the road. And we can see the
text: truck, fairly close by now, and coming closer.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PICNIC TABLE, WITH RACHEL, ELLIE, AND JUD
text: JUD'S lighting a cigarette. His Walkman 'phones are around his
dialog: neck.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I want to fly it! Can I fly it now,
dialog: mommy!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his
dialog: turn.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND GAGE
dialog: This is the last moment of happiness in this man's life--so let's
text: make it very happy. As he and GAGE stare up at the kite:
speaker_heading: IRWIN (voice)
dialog: Jesus. Louis. I'm sorry--
scene_heading: INT. THE FUNERAL CHAPEL
text: The fight has gone out of IRWIN and STEVE has backed away--but
text: cautiously. He's ready to jump back in if one or the other goes
text: mad again. But IRWIN is shuffling toward LOUIS, hands out--
text: everyone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel.
text: Among them is RACHEL and her mother, weeping in each others' arms.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: I don't know what happened to me.
dialog: Louis, please--
text: LOUIS brushes by him with no acknowledgement that IRWIN even
text: exists. He kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head
dialog: against it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (weeping)
dialog: I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry,
dialog: little hero.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS AND GAGE, IN THE FIELD
text: There's a strong gust of wind. The ball of string falls out of
text: GAGE'S hand.
text: EXT. THE KITE, BLOWING AWAY
scene_heading: EXT. THE PICNIC TABLE
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: It got away from him! That numb shit!
speaker_heading: RACHEL (outraged)
dialog: Ellen Creed!
scene_heading: EXT. THE BALL OF KITE TWINE
text: It is bouncing and unraveling. More importantly, it is being
text: carried directly toward the highway.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE
text: He takes off after the ball of twine.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: Kite fline too fast!
text: SOUND: The oncoming truck.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TRUCK
text: Slamming toward us--a brutal leviathan on eighteen wheels.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He's looking--looking toward his people at the picnic table.
dialog: LOUIS (shrugs, good-humored)
dialog: What can you d-
text: TRUCK SOUND CONTINUES.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PICNIC TABLE
scene_heading: TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.
text: Alarm hits JUD'S face. He rises.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Don't let him go in the road, Louis!
text: RACHEL looks; registers terrible alarm.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (screams)
dialog: Get him, Louis!
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE
text: He's still scampering after the bouncing ball of kite-twine, which
text: has now almost reached the road.
scene_heading: TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: The SOUND is loud enough so he's having trouble hearing.
dialog: LOUIS (cups his ear)
dialog: What?
scene_heading: EXT. THE PICNIC TABLE
speaker_heading: RACHEL (shrieks)
dialog: GET THE BABY!!
text: JUD is running toward the road, although he'll never get to GAGE
text: in time; only LOUIS has a chance.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: Horrible understanding dawns on his face. He whips around and
dialog: sees:
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE, LOUIS'S POV
text: The kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it.
text: RISING DRONE OF THE TRUCK.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ONCOMING TRUCK
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE, RUNNING INTO THE ROAD
speaker_heading: GAGE (cheerful)
dialog: Geddit-geddit-geddit!
scene_heading: EXT. EVERYONE, KITE'S POV
text: GAGE reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the
text: corner. LOUIS is running across the field, getting close to the
text: side of the road. RACHEL is clutching ELLIE by the picnic table.
text: JUD is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE, IN THE ROAD
text: As he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string.
text: SOUND OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK.
text: GAGE turns his head.
speaker_heading: GAGE (not afraid)
dialog: Druck!
scene_heading: EXT. THE ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE DRIVER, GAGE'S POV
text: Suddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror.
text: He BLASTS THE AIR-HORN.
text: EXT. LOUIS, ON THE VERGE OF THE ROAD
speaker_heading: LOUIS (shrieks)
dialog: NO!!
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE
text: BLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an
text: audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen-
text: dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a
text: ball of string in his hand...and a shadow lying across his face.
scene_heading: EXT. PHOTO MONTAGE
text: a.) LOUIS is pushing RACHEL out of a hospital door. RACHEL is in a
text: wheelchair and looks radiantly happy (so, for that matter, does
dialog: LOUIS). I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed
text: bundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE.
text: b.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a
text: baby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm.
text: c.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of
text: present-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand. LOUIS
text: and RACHEL are in pajamas. GAGE, about five months, is lying in a
text: drift of wrapping paper. He looks confused but calm.
text: d.) A child's sneaker lying in the road. It's splashed with blood.
text: e.) GAGE--he's about nine months old in this snap--is propped up
text: in the angle of a sofa. There's a big white rabbit in his lap.
dialog: GAGE looks c. but c.
text: f.) ELLIE and GAGE, bundled up against the Chicago winter. ELLIE
text: is pulling a child's chair-sled. GAGE is propped up in the chair.
text: He's about eleven months old in this snap. He's laughing.
text: g.) The Orinco tanker, overturned on the far side of Route 9.
dialog: h.) This one was taken at Gage's first birthday party. He's
text: wearing a party-hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single
text: candle on it while LOUIS kisses one cheek and RACHEL kisses the
dialog: other.
text: i.) LOUIS, in the road. He's holding GAGE'S jumper, which is torn,
text: blood-soaked, and inside out. LOUIS is looking up toward the sky
text: and screaming.
text: j.) Here is a full-face studio portrait of GAGE. He is smiling at
text: us, heartbreakingly lovely. CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS while:
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
text: Sedative finally took hold. She's asleep.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS
text: He's holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it
dialog: fixedly. The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the
dialog: screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in LOUIS'S tortured
text: memory) are scattered on the table. We only saw a few; there are
dialog: actually hundreds.
text: LOUIS puts the photo down as JUD comes in and crosses to the
text: fridge. LOUIS'S nose is badly swelled. He also has a black eye.
text: JUD gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Your father-in-law packs a wallop,
dialog: for an old guy. He and his wife gone
dialog: back to Chicago?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No...squatting out there at the
text: Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures.
dialog: He really thinks Rachel's going to go
text: back with them. Her and Ellie.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Louis--
text: The swing door opens. They look toward:
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE
text: She looks dazed and shocked. There are brown circles under her
text: eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white. She's
text: wearing fuzzy pj's. She's carrying the picture of her pulling GAGE
text: on the sled.
scene_heading: INT. JUD AND LOUIS, AT THE TABLE
dialog: ELLIE (coming to the table)
dialog: I want to go back to my own room.
dialog: I can't sleep with mommy. She
text: keeps stealing the covers.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: What you got there, Ellie?
text: At first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind.
speaker_heading: JUD (studying it)
dialog: Why that's real nice...you pullin'
dialog: him on a sled. Bet he liked that,
dialog: didn't he?
text: ELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (crying)
dialog: I used to pull 'im a lot.
text: LOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I'm going to carry this picture,
dialog: Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage
dialog: come back.
text: JUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious...but
dialog: hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? Yes--I
dialog: think it has.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ellie...God doesn't do things like
dialog: that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: He can if He wants to. He can do
dialog: anything, just like Inspector Gadget
dialog: on TV. But I have to keep things ready
dialog: for him, that's what I think. I've got
dialog: his picture and I'm going to sit in
dialog: his chair--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ellie--
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: And I'm going to eat his breakfast
dialog: cereal, too, even though it tastes
dialog: like boogers. And...and...
text: She bursts into tears.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Louis, take care of your little
dialog: girl...she needs you.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, CU
text: His face is stricken.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT
text: LOUIS comes in with ELLIE in his arms. He puts her gently into her
text: bed and pulls the covers up. She's already mostly asleep.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (kisses her)
dialog: Good night, Ellie.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: G'night daddy.
text: He starts for the door.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE, CU
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: God could take it back if He wanted
dialog: to, couldn't He? If He really, really
dialog: wanted to? Can I have faith in that?
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, AT THE DOOR
text: He stands looking at her for a long time, apparently thinking
dialog: about this quite deeply.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes--I suppose you can. Good night,
dialog: Ellie.
text: He steps out, closing the door.
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE, IN BED
dialog: In some sense comforted--it may be a poison comfort but she surely
text: doesn't know this--she turns over on her side to go to sleep. We
text: can see the picture of GAGE under her arm.
scene_heading: INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS
text: The light here is fairly dim. LOUIS goes down and opens another
text: door. He pokes his head in.
scene_heading: INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: He reacts first with surprise, then a species of horrified
dialog: disgust.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BED, LOUIS'S POV
text: CHURCH is crouched on RACHEL'S sleeping form.
scene_heading: INT. THE BED, A NEW ANGLE
text: LOUIS comes in and swats the cat a damned good one.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (low snarl)
dialog: Fuck off, hairball!!
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH, CU
text: It hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs, its eyes big green
text: balls...and then it flees. CAMERA FOLLOWS IT out the door.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, BY THE BED
text: RACHEL stirs and mutters thickly, then lies still again...she's
text: doped to the gills. LOUIS bends over and kisses her gently.
text: He leaves the room and closes the door behind him.
scene_heading: INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS
text: He tries the door a couple of times to make sure it's firmly on
text: the latch (his face wears an expression of "How'd he get in there
text: in the first place?"). Then he walks down the hall to the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. ON THE STAIRS, CU
text: The cat is on one of the risers. LOUIS trips over it.
text: EXT. ON THE STAIRS WITH LOUIS, WIDER
text: For a moment he's pinwheeling madly for balance, on the verge of
text: falling. He regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across
text: the dining room toward the kitchen.
text: LOUIS regains his equilibrium after a bit and continues on down.
text: INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS AND CHURCH
text: As LOUIS enters through the swing door from the dining room, JUD
text: is just letting CHURCH out the back door. As JUD closes the door:
speaker_heading: LOUIS (slightly antagonistic)
dialog: I thought you'd be gone by now.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I got you a fresh beer out of the
dialog: fridge, Louis.
text: He indicates the table, where there is indeed a fresh beer.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jud, I buried my son today and
dialog: I'm very tired. I wonder if we
dialog: could just--
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You're thinking of things best
dialog: not thought of, Louis.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm thinking about going to bed.
text: But he begins pouring the beer into a glass.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You never asked me if anyone had
dialog: buried a person up there in the
dialog: Micmac burying ground--
text: LOUIS'S hand jerks. Beer goes foaming across the kitchen table.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: --but I think the thought
dialog: has crossed your mind.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Shit! Look at this mess!
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
text: As LOUIS goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess:
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I know the Micmacs thought it was a
dialog: holy place...and then they thought
dialog: it was a cursed place. That's why
dialog: they moved on.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Because something called a wendigo
dialog: soured the ground.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: And because the dead walked.
text: LOUIS stops sopping and looks at him.
scene_heading: INT. JUD, CU
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've
dialog: been thinking of has been done.
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY RAILROAD STATION/SEPIA DAY
dialog: The time is the late summer of 1944, although I don't believe we
text: need to know that specifically. The sign on the station reads
text: LUDLOW. There are a few 40s cars parked near the station--they
text: have gas-ration coupons on the windshields. And a hearse.
text: A train is coming.
scene_heading: EXT. THE HEARSE, WITH UNDERTAKER AND BILL BATERMAN/SEPIA
text: We can see the UNDERTAKER is trying to talk to BILL BATERMAN, a
text: man in his forties who periodically wipes his brow with a bandana.
text: BILL walks away. He doesn't want to talk; he doesn't want comfort.
text: He's a grief-stricken, bitter man.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice over)
text: Timmy Baterman was on his way home
dialog: from the war with his Purple Heart
dialog: when he got killed in some stupid
dialog: car accident down in Georgia.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TRAIN, IN FRONT OF THE DEPOT/SEPIA
text: The door of the mail-car is open. The UNDERTAKER and three
text: trainmen are unloading TIMMY BATERMAN'S coffin, which is draped in
text: a 48-star flag. BILL BATERMAN stands by, watching balefully as
text: they carry his son's final apartment to the back of the hearse and
dialog: load it in.
speaker_heading: JUD (v-o continues)
dialog: Bill was bitter--his son had been in
dialog: the thick of it two years and then got
text: shot in the leg--a clean flesh-wound.
dialog: He was supposed to be coming home safe
text: and sound. Instead, he come home in a
dialog: box after all.
scene_heading: EXT. THE REAR OF THE HEARSE/SEPIA
text: The doors close. The hearse pulls away. THE CAMERA PANS TO BILL
text: BATERMAN, who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his
dialog: brow.
speaker_heading: JUD (v-o continues)
dialog: He wasn't able to get to the bottom
dialog: of the truth, Louis.
text: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD NIGHT
text: LOUIS is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at JUD.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'll bite--what's the bottom of the
dialog: truth, Jud?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Why...that sometimes dead is better.
dialog: That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (bitter)
dialog: Tell that to my wife and little girl.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: It ain't your wife and little girl
dialog: that's got me worried, Louis.
scene_heading: EXT. THE LUDLOW CEMETARY/SEPIA DUSK
text: We're featuring a fresh grave...that of TIMMY BATERMAN. A truck,
text: showing only parking lights, turns into the graveyard and drives
text: slowly up to it. It stops, and BILL BATERMAN gets out. HE looks at
text: the grave and then goes to the back of his truck.
speaker_heading: JUD (voice-over)
dialog: Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as
dialog: I remember.
scene_heading: EXT. BILL BATERMAN AT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK/SEPIA DUSK
text: He reaches in...and brings out a pick and shovel.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. MARGIE WASHBURN, ON HER PORCH/SEPIA DAY
text: She's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style. She's got
text: a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the
text: sun. She's staring at something, horrified.
speaker_heading: JUD (v-o continues)
dialog: It was four or five days later when...
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY DIRT ROAD, WITH TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA DAY
text: A young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the
text: road. His eyes are vacant. His shirt is half untucked. His hair is
text: sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch. There is an ugly mess of
text: healed scars on his neck and one side of his face. I think one of
text: his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident.
speaker_heading: JUD (v-o continues)
text: ...Margie Washburn seen him walking
text: up the road toward Yorkie's Livery.
scene_heading: EXT. MARGIE/SEPIA
text: She's screaming--we hear her faintly.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMMY/SEPIA
text: He turns toward her and we see a green light like the St. Elmo's
text: fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes. He grins
speaker_heading: at MARGIE.
text: EXT. IN FRONT OF THE LUDLOW TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA
text: She hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: JUD (v.o.)
dialog: Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman
text: walking back and forth between the
text: home place and the town line. But
dialog: it was Margie...
scene_heading: INT. THE TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA
text: She's in a hallway in front of a door with LUDLOW SELECTMEN
text: printed on the frosted glass. After a moment she opens it and goes
dialog: in.
speaker_heading: JUD (v.o. continues)
dialog: ...who finally got up enough guts to
dialog: talk to the town fathers about it.
dialog: She knew it had to be stopped, Louis.
scene_heading: INT. THE SELECTMEN'S OFFICE/SEPIA
text: MARGIE and four men are grouped around a desk. She's talking;
text: they're listening. THE CAMERA LAZILY PANS the four men--one, of
dialog: course, is JUD as a YOUNG MAN.
speaker_heading: JUD (v.o. continues)
dialog: She knew it was an abomination.
dialog: George Anderson, the town postmaster,
dialog: was there...and Alan Purinton...Hannibal
dialog: Benson...and me. I was there.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BATERMAN PLACE/SEPIA SUNSET
text: It's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate
dialog: of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill.
text: An old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out.
text: SOUND BLEEDS IN: Most of all the SOUND OF THE CRICKETS.
text: They go to the door, and JUD is wordlessly elected as the prime
text: honcho. He knocks. No answer. Again. No answer.
text: SOUND: Crazy laughter.
speaker_heading: BILL BATERMAN (voice)
dialog: Stop that, Timmy!
text: The four men look at each other.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Come on.
text: They start around to the back.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACK YARD, WITH BILL AND TIMMY/SEPIA
text: TIMMY BATERMAN is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes
text: glowing with green fire. He's laughing like Goofy gone insane.
text: BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the
dialog: sun.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACK YARD, A NEW ANGLE/SEPIA
text: The four men come around the side of the house. They freeze when
text: they see BILL and TIMMY.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Oh holy Jesus lookit that.
text: BILL whirls around and sees them.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You men get out of here!
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I heard your boy was killed down
dialog: Georgia.
speaker_heading: BILL (agitated)
dialog: That was a mistake!
speaker_heading: HANNIBAL
dialog: Was it?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: You see him standing there,
dialog: don't you? Now get out! Get the
dialog: Christ off my land!
text: Now TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward.
speaker_heading: TIMMY (laughing)
dialog: Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an!
speaker_heading: GEORGE (revolted)
dialog: Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can
dialog: smell him!
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: He ain't dead! Give him a day or two
dialog: and he'll be fine! Don't you say that!
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Bill, this ain't right--you can see
dialog: that yourself--
speaker_heading: BILL (screaming)
dialog: GET OUT! YOU HEAR? GET OUT!!!
scene_heading: EXT. TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA
speaker_heading: TIMMY (laughing)
dialog: Dead! We love dead! Hate living!
text: Abruptly he reaches up with both hands and scratches down his
text: cheeks, goring deep grooves in his flesh. Blood flows sluggishly
dialog: out. Very weird blood.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ENTIRE GROUP/SEPIA
text: BILL grabs TIMMY, who's still laughing wildly, and gets him turned
text: around. TIMMY shambles back to where he was originally standing.
text: BILL goes with him like a man who has charge over a trained
dialog: baboon. A stupid trained baboon.
text: BILL (over his shoulder)
dialog: You want to get out of here before I get
dialog: my shotgun! You boys are trespassing!
scene_heading: EXT. THE FOUR MEN/SEPIA
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: God help you, Bill.
scene_heading: EXT. BILL AND TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA
speaker_heading: BILL (snarls)
dialog: God never helped me. I helped
dialog: myself.
scene_heading: EXT. TIMMY BATERMAN, CU/SEPIA
text: Staring directly into the setting sun and laughing wildly,
text: mindlessly.
text: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What happened?
scene_heading: EXT. THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE NIGHT
text: a.) A car pulls up with its lights off and stops.
speaker_heading: JUD (v.o.)
dialog: There was a fire.
text: b.) We see legs as people get out of the car, and hands holding
text: tin cans of gasoline.
text: c.) Hands splash gasoline from the cans along the sides of the
dialog: house.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BATERMAN PORCH NIGHT
text: JUD (as a young man) rings the bell--an old-fashioned twist type.
speaker_heading: BILL (voice)
dialog: Who's there?
text: TIMMY (laughing, screeching voice)
dialog: Ooo air? Ooo air?
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Get out, Billy--the place is
dialog: going up.
text: He walks away. BILL BATERMAN, wearing a strappy tee-shirt, looks
text: out the window.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!
scene_heading: EXT. THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE NIGHT
text: a.) A match is struck...and applied to wet boards. Whoosh!
dialog: b.) The other side of the house: The same.
text: c.) In the back yard, JUD lights a torch and heaves it through the
text: kitchen windows. Ka-PLOOM!
text: d.) The men draw away toward the front, their faces grim and
dialog: judgmental.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BATERMAN PLACE NIGHT
text: Burning. Going up fast.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MEN
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud?
speaker_heading: JUD (stony)
dialog: If he don't, he don't.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT DOOR
text: It bursts open. We see two men struggling at the forefront of an
text: inferno--correction, one man and an undead monster. TIMMY is
text: giggling and screaming, trying to pull his father back into the
text: flames.
speaker_heading: BILL (struggling)
dialog: No! No, Timmy! Let me go!
speaker_heading: TIMME (laughing)
dialog: Love dead! Hate living!
text: He sinks his teeth into his father's arm. BILL screams.
text: A beam falls on TIMMY, lighting him afire. BILL breaks free and
text: runs down the porch steps.
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT HALL, WITH TIMMY
text: He's burning and laughing.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING!
text: And into the fire he goes, still shrieking and laughing.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT YARD NIGHT
text: BILL BATERMAN is collapsed on the lawn as sparks drift down around

speaker_heading: GATE AGENT'S VOICE

scene_heading: INT. A BOARDING GATE, WITH LOUIS AND RACHEL
text: In the b.g. we can see IRWIN and DORY GOLDMAN waiting by the
text: jetway with ELLIE as the last few passengers board. RACHEL looks
text: confused and grief-stricken. She also looks punchy, doped up. I
text: imagine she's floating on a sea of Valium, and that makes her
text: easier to deal with. LOUIS'S battle-scars are fading a little.
text: The GATE AGENT is standing by the jetway with a mike in one hand
text: and a bunch of boarding passes in the other.
speaker_heading: GATE AGENT (concludes)
dialog: All passengers should now be aboard.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: You better get going, hon.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Oh Louis, I just don't know about
dialog: this--
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I told you last night--this can be the
dialog: start of patching things up with your
dialog: folks. If something good doesn't come
dialog: of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Louis, are you sure?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm sure.
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMANS, WITH ELLIE
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I don't want to go to Chicago,

speaker_heading: DORY
dialog: Why not, darling?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: I had a bad dream last night. A
dialog: nightmare.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (kindly)
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage.
text: DORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: And someone named Paxcow.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL AND LOUIS
text: LOUIS guides her to the jetway.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Come on, you guys--before you miss
dialog: the boat.
text: He kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: Louis, I am sorry. What can I say?
dialog: That I lost my mind? It's the truth,
dialog: but no good excuse.
dialog: LOUIS (hugs him back)
dialog: We all lost our minds, Irwin.
text: LOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Be good to your mother, darlin'.
dialog: She needs you.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Come with us, daddy. Please come
dialog: with us!
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'll be there in three days--four
dialog: at the most. I've got to get the
dialog: electricity shut off and square
dialog: things with your school so the

scene_heading: INT. ELLIE, CU
speaker_heading: ELLIE (crying)

scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND ELLIE
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Of what?

speaker_heading: LOUIS (great emphasis)
dialog: Everything's going to be all right,
dialog: Ellie. Now go on--get aboard.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Do you swear?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I swear.
text: The Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face
dialog: that while things are still not all right, they are a little
text: better. She joins her mother.
text: The four of them--RACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANS--start down the
text: jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come...and
dialog: then they're gone.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, CU
text: LOUIS'S face changes. Now it is a stony and contemplative face.
dialog: Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face.
text: He turns and strides away.
scene_heading: INT. THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, WITH LOUIS
text: The family station wagon is in the f.g. We hear the SOUND OF JET
text: ENGINES, and as LOUIS reaches the wagon he turns and watches:
scene_heading: EXT. THE TERMINAL,, LOUIS'S POV
text: From behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks
dialog: away.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, IN THE PARKING LOT
text: Face set, he gets into the wagon and drives away.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 15 IN BREWER
text: The CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware
text: and LOUIS crosses to it.
scene_heading: INT. THE HARDWARE STORE COUNTER, CU
text: On it: A six-cell flashlight, Duracell D-batteries, a pick, a
text: shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging. Now the

scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND CLERK (SMALL PUN, HEE-HEE)
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: Anything else for you today?
speaker_heading: LOUIS (after a look)
dialog: I think we got it all.
text: The CLERK starts to ring things up.
speaker_heading: CLERK
text: Looks like heavy work.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It could be.
text: The quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks
text: at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing
dialog: things up again.
scene_heading: INT. A UNITED JETLINER, WITH ELLIE AND RACHEL
text: ELLIE is in the window-seat, asleep. RACHEL is holding a paperback
text: but not reading it. Her eyes are red. She's looking into space.
text: CAMERA DRIFTS TO ELLIE. Her sleep is not easy. Her head turns from
text: side to side, as if in negation. She becomes steadily more upset.
text: She's starting to mutter. Suddenly her eyes flare open and she
dialog: screams.
scene_heading: INT. JETLINER, SLIGHTLY WIDER
text: We can see the GOLDMANS in the seats behind the CREEDS. They are

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Paxcow says it's almost too late!
speaker_heading: RACHEL

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Paxcow says it's almost too late!

scene_heading: EXT. LUDLOW CEMETARY DAY
text: The CREED wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes. It stops
text: and LOUIS gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He walks to a fresh grave on which the first flowers are already
text: starting to wilt. He sits down and takes a flower. He plucks it,
text: looking at the grave steadily. He says nothing for a long time.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's wrong. (Pause) What happened
dialog: to you is wrong.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE, IN THE FIELD

scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

speaker_heading: PASCOW (voice)
dialog: Remember, doc.
speaker_heading: LOUIS looks at:
scene_heading: EXT. A TOMB, LOUIS'S POV
text: PASCOW, bloody and mutilated, is standing by it.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: The barrier was not meant to be
text: crossed. The ground is sour.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
text: He is not put out of countenance in the slightest by PASCOW'S
text: appearance; he probably knows PASCOW is just a figment of his
dialog: conscience or imagination, and so do we.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'll tell you where the ground
dialog: is sour--the ground in my heart
dialog: is sour. Let me tell you something
dialog: else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
scene_heading: EXT. PASCOW
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Don't talk like an asshole even if
dialog: you are just a bit of underdone
text: potato or a blot of mustard.
scene_heading: EXT. PASCOW, BY THE TOMB
text: He stands mute, just looking.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS (weeping)
dialog: He was my son! He wasn't even two
dialog: and he was run down in the fucking
text: road and he was almost in pieces,
dialog: and if you don't think I'm going
dialog: to try...
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOMB, SANS PASCOW
text: VIC has put on his boogie shoes.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
text: He's crying harder. Abruptly he reaches out at the floral tributes
text: and knocks a bunch of them over.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: If it doesn't work--if he comes
dialog: back like Timmy Baterman--I'll
dialog: put him to sleep. But I'm going
dialog: to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't
dialog: work...they don't ever need to know.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GOLDMAN HOUSE IN LAKE FOREST, ILLINOIS NIGHT
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS HALL NIGHT
text: THE CAMERA MOVES LEISURELY along this hallway, which is lined with

speaker_heading: RACHEL (voice)
dialog: Honey, you just had a bad dream. You
dialog: know that, don't you?
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
text: It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow.

speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something
dialog: really bad. He--
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the
dialog: boogeyman?
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.

speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you

dialog: nonsense.
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Will you at least call and make sure
dialog: daddy's okay?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Of course I will.
text: She kisses ELLIE.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Now will you try to go to sleep?
text: ELLIE (turns over on her side)
dialog: Yes, Mom.
text: RACHEL gets up and leaves the room.
scene_heading: INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
text: PASCOW is here, halfway down the hall to the stairs, bloody as
text: ever. RACHEL doesn't see him. She looks perplexed, a woman trying
text: to think of something. She stops very near him.
dialog: RACHEL (to herself)
dialog: Paxcow, why do I know that name?
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Pascow.
text: RACHEL suddenly straightens. She looks startled and afraid.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Pascow? Was she saying Pascow?
text: She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast.
text: EXT. THE CREED HOME IN LUDLOW NIGHT
text: SOUND: A car starting up.
text: The station wagon backs out and heads down the driveway. As it
text: passes THE CAMERA, we see LOUIS driving. The wagon turns onto
text: Route 9 and heads off.
text: CAMERA HOLDS ON THE HOUSE. A beat of silence. Then: the telephone
text: starts ringing.
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM NIGHT
text: IRWIN and DORY are watching RACHEL with some anxiety. RACHEL is
text: holding the phone to her ear. We can hear the FILTERED SOUND of
text: one ring after another. She hangs up.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
text: He's not home.
speaker_heading: DORY
dialog: Why, he probably went out for
dialog: a hamburger or a chicken dinner,
dialog: dear. You know how men are when
dialog: they're alone.
dialog: Good old IRWIN'S face says that maybe LOUIS went out for a couple
text: of grams of coke and a whore in Nazi SS boots.
text: RACHEL is dialing another number.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CRANDALL HOUSE NIGHT
text: SOUND: Phone starts to ring.
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
text: He shuffles to the telephone. His Walkman 'phones are around his
text: neck. He's got a bottle of beer in one hand.
speaker_heading: JUD (picks up)
dialog: Hello--you got Judson.
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm
dialog: calling from Chicago.
text: JUD (surprised voice)
dialog: Chicago! Is Louis with you?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: No...we're going to be here
dialog: awhile, and he wanted a few days
dialog: to wind up our affairs there.
dialog: I just wondered if he was with you.
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
text: His face says this is very serious.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No--but if he drops by, I'll tell
dialog: him to call you.
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Jud, do you remember the name
dialog: of the student that died on Louis's
dialog: first day at work? The one that was
dialog: hit by a car?
speaker_heading: JUD (voice)
dialog: I don't--
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Was it Pascow?
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis
dialog: come home before I go to bed, I'll
dialog: tell him to--
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Don't bother. I'm coming home.
speaker_heading: JUD (alarmed voice)
dialog: Rachel!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you, Jud. Goodbye.
text: She hangs up.
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: No! Rachel! Don't do that!
dialog: Rachel--!
text: The buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces
text: the receiver. The man looks very grim.
scene_heading: INT. THE FRONT HALL OF THE GOLDMAN HOUSE
text: RACHEL comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling. She's
text: carrying a suitcase in one hand. Her parents meet her at the foot
text: of the stairs.
speaker_heading: DORY
dialog: Rachel...darling...you're upset...
dialog: a night's sleep...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I have to go. The connections are
dialog: tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in
dialog: forty minutes. Will you drive me,
dialog: daddy?
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: You know something's wrong, don't you?
dialog: You know. And Ellie does, too.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: I'll drive you.
speaker_heading: ELLIE (voice)
dialog: Mommy?
dialog: They all turn to:
scene_heading: INT. ELLIE, ON THE STAIRS
speaker_heading: ELLIE
dialog: Please hurry.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL AND THE GOLDMANS
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I will. Come and kiss me.
text: ELLIE races into her arms.
scene_heading: EXT. LUDLOW CEMETERY NIGHT
text: SOUND Of a car engine, THROBBING AND LOW. It cuts off.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the
text: road. Beyond it we can see the roof of the CREED station wagon.
text: LOUIS appears, dressed in dark clothes. He looks both ways, then
text: tosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside.
text: LOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the
dialog: scene.
scene_heading: EXT. LUDLOW CEMETERY, LOUIS'S POV
text: A quiet city of the dead. Spooky. SOUND of crickets: Ree-ree-
dialog: ree...
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He heads for GAGE'S grave.
scene_heading: INT. THE GOLDMAN CAR, WITH RACHEL AND IRWIN
speaker_heading: IRWIN
dialog: I'll come with you if you want,
dialog: honey.
text: RACHEL (shakes her head)
dialog: I've got three planes to catch and
dialog: I got the last seats on two of them.
dialog: It's like God saved them for me.
text: EXT. O'HARE UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL, WITH IRWIN'S CAR
text: IRWIN'S car heads for it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED
text: LOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing
text: equipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then
text: opens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave
text: for a long second.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (low)
dialog: Gonna bust you out, son.
text: He starts to shovel.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SHOVEL, CU
text: Digging...throwing...digging again. Already the shape of the
dialog: excavation is beginning to show. The work is easy; this earth is
dialog: new and fresh.
scene_heading: EXT. JETLINER, IN A LINE-UP OF JETLINERS
scene_heading: INT. JETLINER, WITH RACHEL
text: Everyone looks impatient, but RACHEL looks half crazy.
speaker_heading: PILOT (voice)
dialog: This is the Captain speaking.
dialog: I'm sorry about this delay, folks,
dialog: but we've got a real low ceiling
dialog: tonight and air traffic control's
dialog: playing it safe. Looks like it's
dialog: going to be about half an hour before
dialog: we get on a roll, so I'm turning off
text: the NO SMOKING sign.
dialog: SOUND: Bing!
text: There's a general groan. CAMERA MOVES IN ON RACHEL, who has closed
text: her eyes. I think she's praying.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE'S GRAVE NIGHT
text: Now it's pretty deep. Four feet, maybe. LOUIS is standing in it.
text: We see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS NIGHT
text: He's sweating and dirt-streaked. He's tossing dirt on a big pile.
text: Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND.
text: He tosses the shovel aside and squats.
scene_heading: EXT. IN THE GRAVE, WITH LOUIS
text: There's a white streak on the bottom of the grave--the top of
text: GAGE'S coffin. LOUIS swipes his hand through the loose dirt,
text: uncovering more, and then he begins to sweep off the top of the
text: coffin with his hands.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CRANDALL PORCH
text: JUD comes out. He's wearing a light jacket. His Walkman 'phones
text: are around his neck. He's got a six-pack. He looks at:
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE, JUD'S POV
text: It's dark.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CRANDALL PORCH, WITH JUD
text: He sits down.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: You done it, you stupid old man...
dialog: now you got to undo it.
text: He puts his earphones on. Cracks a beer. Lights a cigarette.
text: Pushes the PLAY button on the deck. Faint SOUNDS of The Clash
text: buzz-sawing "Rock The Casbah."
text: JUD begins to watch.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag. He starts to
text: pull out the pick.
text: SOUND of an approaching car.
text: LOUIS freezes.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD OUTSIDE OF THE CEMETERY
text: A police car comes cruising slowly along. The spotlight on the
text: driver's side comes on and runs along the graveyard's stone wall.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: Watching. Waiting. Hardly breathing.
scene_heading: EXT. THE POLICE CAR
text: It reaches the end of the wall. Everything looks jake. The
text: spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He relaxes perceptibly. He gets the pick and drops back into the
dialog: grave.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOP OF THE COFFIN, CU
text: LOUIS inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and
text: levers it. CRACKING SOUND. Again. More CRACKING. Again. And the
text: lock breaks. The coffin lid comes up a little, dirt gritting in
text: the hinges.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, CU
text: Here's a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness.
scene_heading: EXT. JETLINER LIFTING OFF FROM O'HARE
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL AND HER SEATMATE
speaker_heading: SEATMATE
dialog: Think you'll make your connection
dialog: in Boston?
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I have to.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE
text: He's lying on his stomach, reaching in. We hear the SOUND of dirt
text: grating in hinges again.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, CU
text: We're looking up into his face. If GAGE had a POV, this would be
text: it. LOUIS'S face fills with a terrible grief.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh, Gage--oh, honey.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH
text: His chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his
text: 'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels. There's a
text: long round ash on his cigarette in the tray. A couple of empty
text: beer cans on the table beside him.
text: A truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze. He jerks his
text: head up suddenly...and slaps himself. He's okay...for now.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS
text: He is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in
text: his arms, rocking him. GAGE is back to us. We see only a small
text: limp figure in a dark suit. Hair flops limply.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It's going to be all right...I
dialog: swear it's going to be all right...
text: The canvas tarp has been spread open to the right. LOUIS begins to
text: lay his son down on it.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GROUND BESIDE THE TARP, CU
text: It's littered with flower petals. One limp hand appears among
dialog: them.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He closes the tarp over GAGE, making a roll. He then produces rope
text: from the duffle bag. He cuts the rope and begins to tie one piece
text: around one end of the canvas roll containing the corpse of his
dialog: son.
scene_heading: EXT. JETLINER IN THE NIGHT SKY
speaker_heading: PILOT (voice)
dialog: Good evening again, ladies and
dialog: gentlemen...
scene_heading: INT. THE JETLINER, WITH RACHEL
text: Her seatmate is knitting something. Across the aisle sits VICTOR
text: PASCOW, bloody but serene, hands clasped in his lap, looking
text: straight ahead. RACHEL looks around tensely.
speaker_heading: PILOT (continues)
dialog: I'm delighted to tell you that we've
dialog: got a strong tail-wind tonight and
dialog: we expect to arrive at Boston's
text: Logan Airport almost on time.
text: PASCOW clenches his fist in a "That's one for our side!" gesture.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (softly)
dialog: Thank God.
text: Her SEATMATE looks at her a bit strangely.
scene_heading: EXT. THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS
text: He's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the
text: tools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the
text: SOUND of another motor. He crouches at the base of the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ROAD
text: Here comes that same police car. The spotlight runs along the
dialog: wall.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: Crouching against his side of the wall and sweating.
scene_heading: EXT. THE POLICE CAR
text: It stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: Crouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks
text: down...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back.
text: LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat.
text: Silence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz.
scene_heading: EXT. THE COP
text: Ah! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the
text: cemetery for a moment.
speaker_heading: COP
dialog: I ain't afraid of no ghost.
text: He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL
text: He collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously
text: over the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down
text: on the other side of the road.
text: He tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the
text: canvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults
dialog: over.
text: EXT. THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS
text: He takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by
text: the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy
text: territory. He goes to the rear of the wagon.
text: EXT. THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS
text: He puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No
text: keys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The
text: other pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt
text: feverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope.
text: SOUND: An approaching car.
scene_heading: EXT. PASSING CAR
text: A civilian--not the ubiquitous cop.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere. Nothing.
text: Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes. He goes to the
text: driver's side of the car and looks in at:
scene_heading: INT. IGNITION, LOUIS'S POV
text: The keys are in the switch.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses
text: the key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then
text: the duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of
text: the car. He opens the driver's door and freezes.
text: LOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes
text: back to the front, gets in, and drives away.
scene_heading: INT. A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL
text: People are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes
text: RACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself
text: incoherently. PASCOW is walking near her.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: There's just time. If you run.
text: Without looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs.
scene_heading: INT. THE CONCOURSE, WITH RACHEL
text: She's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit!
scene_heading: INT. GATE 27, WITH FEMALE GATE AGENT AND PASCOW
text: The FEMALE GATE AGENT is starting to close the jetway door.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: Don't do that, babe.
text: The GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or
text: maybe a gas pain). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into
text: the area. She sees:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS
text: It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL AND FEMALE GATE AGENT (PASCOW IS GONE)
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Make it come back!
scene_heading: FEMALE GATE AGENT
dialog: I can't--
text: RACHEL bolts down the jetway. The GATE AGENT stares after her, and
text: then runs for her stand, where we can see FLIGHT 61 and BANGOR on
text: the slide-cards. She picks up her mike.
scene_heading: EXT. THE JETWAY NIGHT
text: RACHEL stands all alone at the end of it.
text: AMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF JET ENGINES.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (screams)
text: COME BACK, MOTHERFUCKER!!
scene_heading: EXT. THE JET, RACHEL'S POV
text: It starts to swing back to pick her up.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL
text: PASCOW appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: You're doing just fine.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH
text: He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out
text: of his Walkman 'phones.
text: SOUND: An approaching car.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE
text: The station wagon turns in and parks. LOUIS gets out. He opens the
text: back, removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with
text: tools. He manages to get everything together and walks to the edge
text: of the path. He looks at:
scene_heading: EXT. THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV
text: Off it goes, glimmering in the dark.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He holds the corpse of his little boy to him.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Please God--let this work.
text: He sets off.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD, ON HIS PORCH
dialog: Zonked out. He missed the whole thing. Nice going, Jud.
text: EXT. OUTSIDE THE ARCH TO THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS
text: Louis passes under like a ghost.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS
text: LOUIS is crying. He crosses to the deadfall.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't
dialog: gonna look down.
text: He begins to mount the deadfall.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE
text: He reaches the top. And woven into the deadfall, behind him,
text: facing the Pet Sematary, is that snarling face.
text: LOUIS descends the other side.
text: EXT. THE FOOT OF THE DEDFALL, WOODS SIDE
text: LOUIS reaches the bottom and looks at:
scene_heading: EXT. THE WOODS, LOUIS'S POV
text: The path winds onward through those gigantic trees--it glows
dialog: slightly.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, MOVING UP THE PATH
text: EXT. LOUIS, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP
text: That phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced. SOUNDS of
text: CRICKETS and FROGS. The water is mucky and still. Hummocks stick
text: up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen. Fog drifts
text: through the dead trees. LOUIS doesn't want to go in there. Smart
dialog: man. I wouldn't either.
text: But he does.
text: INT. THE HERTZ DESK, AT BIA WITH RACHEL AND CLERK--AND PASCOW
text: PASCOW is lounging back against the rack of folders--and getting
text: some of them bloody.
speaker_heading: HERTZ CLERK
dialog: I'm sorry...it's been very busy
dialog: tonight. I really don't have
dialog: anything.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: What about the Aries K with the
dialog: scratch on the side?
text: The CLERK starts looking through her papers.
speaker_heading: CLERK
dialog: I do have an Aries K, but it came
text: in sort of beat up--there's a long
dialog: scrape up one side--
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'll take it.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP
text: He comes walking toward THE CAMERA with GAGE in his arms and the
text: duffle bag over his shoulder. Mist swirls around him. The
text: landscape is weird, surreal. CRICKET SOUNDS, AMPLIFIED. In fact
text: there are a lot of swampy, marshy SOUNDS--too many. It sounds
text: almost prehistoric.
scene_heading: SOUND: HARSH, SCREAMING LAUGHTER
text: LOUIS stops. He looks slowly around at:
scene_heading: EXT. MIST-FACE, LOUIS'S POV
text: A demonic face takes shape in the mist and FLOATS SLOWLY TOWARD
text: THE CAMERA. It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long.
text: Its eyes blow out. Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the
text: sockets.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He closes his eyes. After a moment he opens them.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV
dialog: Nothing there.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: See? Just imagination. Just--
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS'S FEET
text: We can barely see them because they are thick in mist, but he is
text: standing on a couple of low, marshy tussocks. Suddenly a thick
text: tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers
text: around his ankle.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, LOOKING DOWN
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Nothing...there.
text: He turns around and begins to walk again.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS'S FEET
text: The tentacle falls away.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP
text: MYRIAD SOUNDS, none of them pleasant--laughter, gobbling howls,
text: screams. Sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of
text: escaped lunatics. LOUIS continues on regardless.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS
text: LOUIS comes into the frame. He's obviously tiring now, but he
text: keeps moving along.
text: SOUND: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding ones. Something
text: is coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus
text: Rex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder. LOUIS
text: looks plenty scared.
text: SOUND: A falling tree.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODS, LOUIS'S POV
text: Those SOUNDS keep getting closer and closer. Another tree falls--
text: we see this one. And now we see a SHAPE--just a SHAPE.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up.
scene_heading: EXT. THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV
text: It is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We
dialog: don't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's
text: flesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it
text: turns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow
text: eyes the size of lighthouse lamps.
text: It makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: The SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I
dialog: think the Wendigo just passed
dialog: within sixty feet of me.
text: Slowly he begins to walk again.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE
text: In the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no
text: small tree, either, but a great big old fir.
text: LOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at:
scene_heading: EXT. THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV
text: Here is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS
dialog: could swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen
text: before. Three big claws at the end of it.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: Looks up again. His face is set and hard.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.
text: He starts to walk again.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND
text: SOUND: The wind, lonesome and keening.
text: THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the slope, dreaming its way over
text: those rocky cairns...most of them burst apart.
text: SOUND: Tortured breathing. Panting.
text: LOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the
text: top. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles
text: over a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and
text: gets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks
dialog: at:
scene_heading: EXT. A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV
text: We can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He slowly kneels down. He puts the canvas tarp to one side and
text: slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag. By now he is
text: clearly a man approaching total exhaustion.
scene_heading: EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH AN ARIES K
text: It tracks past THE CAMERA.
text: INT. THE ARIES K WITH RACHEL AND PASCOW
text: Both of them look tense. RACHEL is bolt upright behind the wheel.
text: Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ARIES K
text: It goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half
text: off the rim. IT climbs the curb and hits a tree.
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL
text: She lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl!
text: She unbuckles it and gets out.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL
text: She looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it
text: than just a scratch up the side.
text: RACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been
dialog: through a lot tonight.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Now what?
text: PASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road,
text: looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: It's trying to stop you. Do you
dialog: hear me? It's trying to stop you.
text: RACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans
text: the scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Is anyone there?
text: After a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights
text: appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the
text: shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for
dialog: the first time in her life.
text: The car sweeps by her without slowing.
scene_heading: EXT. GAGE'S CAIRN, CU
text: LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is
text: the canvas tarp, now open and empty.
text: Absently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his
text: tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One
text: hand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Come back to me, Gage. Come back
dialog: to us.
text: He turns away toward the stairs.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9
text: She's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand.
text: Lights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts
dialog: by.
speaker_heading: RACHEL (shouts)
text: MAY THE SEWERS OF RANGOON BACK UP
text: IN YOUR BEDROOM, ASSHOLE!
text: She starts walking again.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FIELD BESIDE LOUIS'S HOUSE
text: LOUIS is moving down the path. As he passes the tire swing he
text: pushes it, setting it in motion.
scene_heading: INT. THE GARAGE
text: LOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the
text: kitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him.
scene_heading: INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALL
text: SOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view,
text: dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down
text: the hall toward the master bedroom.
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM
text: The clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first
text: on the immaculate bedspread and lies still.
text: In this shot we should note the closet door is standing open.
scene_heading: EXT. THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, FEATURING GAGE'S CAIRN
text: THE CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY. Holds. Nothing for a beat. Then:
text: A small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring
dialog: the living shit out of us.
text: CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as the hand begins to feel around. It takes
text: one of the rocks and pushes it aside. Another. Another. Another.
text: The SOUNDS are not encouraging. It is GRUNTING and GROWLING. There
dialog: is nothing human here.
text: Rocks begin to tumble as GAGE starts to come out of his grave.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: Fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL
dialog: My babe is still takin' a hike. But here comes another vehicle.
scene_heading: EXT. THE DEADFALL IN THE PET SEMATARY
text: THE CAMERA MOVES IN on that snarling face.
text: SOUNDS: GAGE coming. Dead dry breath. Low snarling noises.
text: Now we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the
text: deadfall.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL
text: Suddenly, as the lights appear, she does a Claudette Colbert,
text: pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg.
text: Lights--it's an Orinco truck, naturally--spotlight her. The truck
dialog: stops.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL AND THE TRUCK
text: The driver leans over and opens the door.
speaker_heading: DRIVER
dialog: Hop in, baby.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: She does.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH CHURCH
text: He's under the kitchen table, green eyes gleaming. I think he
dialog: loves dead, hates living.
text: SOUND: The doorlatch. CHURCH MIAOWS.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, A NEW (LOW) ANGLE
text: GAGE'S shoes grit slowly across the linoleum, leaving dirty
text: tracks. CHURCH turns to watch GAGE'S passage, and then follows.
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: CAMERA HOLDS ON LOUIS as those gritting footsteps approach. Then
text: we pan to the closet. On the floor is LOUIS'S little black bag. We
text: hold on this as the footfalls near. A small white hand enters the
text: frame and pulls the doctor-bag out of the closet. Now another hand
text: enters the frame and opens the bag. The hands search around inside
text: and bring out a scalpel.
text: They hold it up. The GAGE-THING makes a contented SOUND.
scene_heading: EXT. THE ORINCO TRUCK, ON ROUTE 9 NIGHT
text: It sweeps past THE CAMERA
scene_heading: INT. THE CAB, WITH RACHEL AND DRIVER
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Can't you go any faster?
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: Lady, I got nine points on my
dialog: license right now.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I understand. It's just that--
text: She looks at him, pleading. The TRUCKER speeds up.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you. If you only understood
dialog: how important this is--
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: That's all right, babe. Only if we
dialog: get stopped, next time I'll be the
dialog: one hitchin' and you can give me a
dialog: ride.
scene_heading: EXT. JUD, ON HIS PORCH
text: More deeply asleep than ever. Suddenly, from inside, comes the
text: sound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming "Bang Your Head." It's the
dialog: stereo, and boy, is it cranked.
text: JUD straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. His
text: hands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is
text: that it's coming from there--and then he hurries inside.
text: CAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.
scene_heading: INT. THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD
text: He hurries in, turns on the light, and rushes across to his stereo
text: system, which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying
text: saucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room. He
text: shuts it off and looks around, frowning.
text: SOUND: Todd Rundgren, singing "Bang on the Drum All Day" at the
text: top of his voice.
text: JUD'S head snaps toward the SOUND.
scene_heading: INT. A SONY RADIO, CU
text: THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as JUD hurries across the kitchen to the
text: counter, where the radio is. He turns it off, looking around, more
text: bewildered than ever.
speaker_heading: JUD (sharply)
dialog: Who's here?
text: He walks toward the door which gives on the hall.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL, WITH JUD
text: It's dimly lit by light-spill from the living room and kitchen.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Come on, stop playing games!
text: SOUND: Molly Hatchet, "Flirtin' with Disaster," being played top
text: end, from upstairs.
text: JUD hurries up. Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology
text: at work here--for the moment he's more concerned about waking the
dialog: neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with
dialog: the prowler...and he would certainly know who--or what--that
dialog: prowler was, if he had time to think.
scene_heading: INT. JUD'S BEDROOM
text: He enters and turns on the light. We see a portable phonograph
text: with the record, turning. JUD rushes over and turns it off.
text: He looks around, and we see by his face that he knows.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Gage? (Pause) Are you the one
dialog: playing games?
text: He goes to the window and looks out at:
scene_heading: INT./EXT. THE CREED HOUSE, WITH THE STATION WAGON, JUD'S POV
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM, WITH JUD
text: He turns slowly and walks toward the bed.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: Gage? Come on out.
text: He reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds
dialog: the blade.
speaker_heading: JUD
dialog: I want to show you something.
dialog: SOUND: Miaow!
scene_heading: INT. THE DOORWAY, WITH CHURCH, JUD'S POV
scene_heading: INT. JUD, BY THE BED
dialog: JUD (to the cat)
dialog: How did you--?!
scene_heading: INT. JUD'S FEET
text: A small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt
text: of the coverlet and slashes JUD'S calf,
scene_heading: INT. JUD
text: He screams with pain and staggers backward.
scene_heading: INT. JUD'S FEET
text: The other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and
dialog: pulls.
scene_heading: INT. JUD
text: With a startled yell, he falls.
scene_heading: INT. JUD AND GAGE
dialog: This one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We
dialog: finally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not
text: really GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the
text: mouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE.
text: There is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel.
text: Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife.
text: GAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds.
text: JUD expires.
text: GAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat.
scene_heading: EXT. ROUTE 9, BETWEEN THE CRANDALL AND CREED HOUSES
text: Headlights. RACHEL'S truck has arrived. It pulls up.
text: RACHEL opens the passenger door, which is on JUD'S side.
scene_heading: EXT. ANGLE ON THE CAB
text: We can see PASCOW sitting in the passenger seat where RACHEL just
dialog: was.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Thank you so much.
speaker_heading: TRUCKER
dialog: I didn't get a ticket, so you're
dialog: welcome, lady.
dialog: (And, more seriously)
dialog: Whatever your problems are, I hope
dialog: they work out.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: It's the end of the line for me,
dialog: too--I'm not allowed any further.
dialog: RACHEL (to the trucker)
dialog: I'm sure things will be fine.
speaker_heading: PASCOW
dialog: I'm not.
text: She closes the door and steps down.
text: The truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it
text: pulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when:
speaker_heading: GAGE (soft voice)
dialog: Mummy!
text: She stops, startled. Her face wears a "did I hear that?"
text: expression. She looks back toward JUD'S house.
speaker_heading: GAGE (soft voice)
dialog: Mummy!
text: RACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at:
scene_heading: EXT. JUD'S HOUSE, RACHEL'S POV
dialog: The one place in the whole world we do not want RACHEL to go.
scene_heading: EXT. RACHEL
text: She goes. Up the steps to the porch. All through this she's been
text: travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her
text: initials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and
text: opens the porch door.
text: She looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning,
dialog: and someone else's house. But...that voice...
speaker_heading: GAGE (voice)
dialog: Mummy, I need you!
text: RACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Who--
text: The door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes
text: into the doorway and sits down.
speaker_heading: CHURCH
dialog: Miaow!
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Church!
speaker_heading: GAGE (voice)
dialog: Mummy, I need you!
text: She crosses to the open door.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: Gage? Gage?
text: No answer. RACHEL steps in.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CREED HOUSE MORNING
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: He's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look. He rolls
text: back and forth. Closer and closer to the edge. Finally, with a
text: wild yell, he goes over onto the floor.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, ON THE FLOOR
text: He comes awake. Sits up. Ouch! He's aches from top to bottom and
text: side to side...but his back is worst. His hands go to it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Jesus!
text: He starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on:
scene_heading: INT. GAGE'S TRACKS ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV
text: They enter the house, go to the closet, then leave again.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Gage--?
text: He scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten. He
text: stares in wildly.
scene_heading: INT. THE DOCTOR-BAG
text: It's open.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He pulls the doctor-bag out. His original hope is now tempered
text: with the first signs of fear. He begins to go through the doctor-
text: bag. Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it. The case is
text: empty, but the indented shape is clear. There was a scalpel in
dialog: this case...but not anymore.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Oh my God. (Pause) Gage!
scene_heading: INT. THE HALL, WITH LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Gage!
text: LOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but
text: there's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the
text: door to GAGE'S room.
scene_heading: INT. GAGE'S ROOM, LOUIS'S POV
dialog: Empty.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS, ON THE STAIRS
text: He goes downstairs, yelling GAGE'S name.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
text: Nothing. The phone RINGS. LOUIS almost jumps out of his skin
text: reaching for it.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hello!
speaker_heading: IRWIN (voice)
dialog: Hello, Louis--it's Irwin.
dialog: I just wanted to be sure Rachel
dialog: got back all right.
text: As IRWIN says this, LOUIS'S eyes fix upon something.
text: INT. THE FLOOR, WITH TWO SETS OF GAGE-TRACKS, LOUIS'S POV
text: One set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and
text: upstairs. The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the
text: kitchen door giving directly on the outside.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
text: In his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything...or
dialog: almost everything.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (voice)
dialog: Louis...are you there?
speaker_heading: LOUIS (slowly)
dialog: Yes--I'm here.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (voice)
dialog: Did she get there all right?
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Yes, she's fine.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (voice)
dialog: Well, put her on at that end and
dialog: I'll put Ellie on at this one.
dialog: Ellie's very worried about her
dialog: mother. (Pause) She's almost
text: in hysterics.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
text: She...Rachel's asleep.
text: IRWIN (an edge in his voice now)
dialog: Then I suggest you wake her up.
dialog: Ellie...I think she had a dream that
dialog: her mother was dead.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'll call you right back.
speaker_heading: IRWIN (voice)
dialog: Louis--!
text: But LOUIS, whose last few responses have been almost trancelike,
text: hangs up. He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor.
scene_heading: INT. THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE
text: Tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle. A tiny bloody finger
text: dials.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED KITCHEN
text: The phone starts to ring. After two or three ringy-dingys, LOUIS,
text: looking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Irwin, you'll just have to--
speaker_heading: GAGE (voice)
dialog: I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come
dialog: over and play with me?
text: LOUIS is dumbfounded...slack-mouthed with terror.
speaker_heading: LOUIS (a bare whisper)
dialog: Gage?
speaker_heading: GAGE (voice)
dialog: Mommy already came. We played, daddy.
dialog: First I played with Jud and then mommy
dialog: came and I played with mommy. We had
dialog: an awful good time. Now I want to play
dialog: with you.
text: GAGE begins to giggle...a really awful sound.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What did you do? What did you--
text: CLICK! The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling.
scene_heading: INT. THE CREED BED, CU
text: He puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it. He
text: comes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts
text: them aside. Then he roots around some more and comes up with
text: several ampoules. He holds one up for inspection and we can read
text: the word MORPHINE on it very clearly.
scene_heading: INT. THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: He carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the
text: window. His hair has gone partially white.
text: He fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for
text: each syringe--i.e., enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in
text: the left breast pocket of his shirt. He puts the spare ampoules in
text: the right breast pocket of his shirt.
text: LOUIS is slowly going insane. What remains of his rationality is
text: like a rapidly fraying rope.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: What you buy is what you own, and
dialog: sooner or later what you own comes
dialog: home to you. Wasn't that what you
dialog: said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it?
text: He leaves the room.
scene_heading: EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE
text: LOUIS comes out the door. In one hand he's got a raw pork chop. In
text: the other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves. He walks
text: to the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass. Then
text: he crosses.
text: EXT. THE CRANDALL WALK, WITH LOUIS
text: He walks most of the way to the house, then stops.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH, LOUIS"S POV
text: He gets up, humping his back warily.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Hi, Church. Want some grub?
text: He tosses the pork chop onto the grass.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH
text: He hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts
text: to chow up. He looks up at:
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He is pulling on the rubber gloves.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Don't mind me. Eat it while you can.
dialog: Eat all you want.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH
text: He starts worrying the chop again. Smack-smack-smack.
scene_heading: EXT. ANGLE ON LOUIS AND CHURCH
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Eat all you can...all you want...
dialog: that's right...today's Thanksgiving
dialog: day for cats, but only if they came
dialog: back from the dead...
text: He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out
text: of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip,
text: then moves toward CHURCH.
text: CHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again,
text: and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he
text: talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs
dialog: him.
text: CHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries
text: to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: No, you don't!
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH, CU
text: The syringe plunges into his haunch.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH AND LOUIS
text: The needle is still dangling out of CHURCH'S haunch. The cat looks
text: dazed. It tries to walk and falls over on its side. It tries to
text: get up...and then falls over again.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.
text: He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag.
scene_heading: EXT. THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV
dialog: Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is
text: erased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: Twang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted.
text: He looks back at:
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV
dialog: Dead.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS
text: He climbs the steps and goes onto the porch.
scene_heading: EXT. LOUIS, ON THE PORCH
text: He strips off the rubber gloves. He tosses them onto the table
text: beside JUD'S beer-cans as he goes inside.
text: INT. THE FOYER OF THE CRANDALL HOME, WITH LOUIS
text: It's dark in here, and spooky.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause)
dialog: Gage?
text: No answer. He looks down and sees:
scene_heading: INT. A SHOE, LOUIS'S POV
text: One of RACHEL'S shoes. It lies by the foot of the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He goes over and picks up the shoe. It's a three-quarter heel, and
text: it's pretty badly scuffed. RACHEL, after all, did some pretty hard
dialog: travelling to get here.
text: There's a spot of blood on it.
text: SOUND: A low giggle.
text: LOUIS looks up:
scene_heading: INT. THE STAIRS, LOUIS'S POV
text: Mighty dark. Mighty shadowy.
text: SOUND: Another giggle.
text: INT. LOUIS, AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Gage?
scene_heading: INT. THE STAIRS
speaker_heading: GAGE (voice)
dialog: Let's play, daddy! Let's play hide
dialog: and go seek!
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: All right, Gage...let's.
text: He begins to climb the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS, WITH LOUIS
text: LOUIS arrives on the landing. We begin the nerve-wracking business
text: of checking rooms. First, the bathroom...and the shower curtain is
text: of course pulled. LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing.
text: He checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks
text: down it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a
text: guest room. Shadowy and empty.
text: Down the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a
text: bunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back.
text: Down the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in.
scene_heading: INT. JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS
text: He checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees:
scene_heading: INT. THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV
text: A bloodstain.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain.
text: He sees the skirt on the bedspread. He lifts it. He is nose to
text: nose with JUD, who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of
text: incredible horror on his face.
text: The DOOR SLAMS.
text: LOUIS bolts to his feet as GIGGLES fade down the hall.
text: Slowly, he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread,
text: which has mercifully fallen back into place.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm--
text: There's a SQUEAKING, SQUEALING SOUND.
text: LOUIS turns around. He gets up again. He starts for the door. Then
text: he turns back and speaks to JUD again.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: I'm going to set things back in
dialog: order. I...I know just what to do.
text: He goes out.
scene_heading: INT. THE HALLWAY, WITH LOUIS
text: He takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast
dialog: pocket.
speaker_heading: LOUIS
dialog: Gage?
text: Another SQUEAKING SOUND. And another GIGGLE.
text: LOUIS starts slowly forward. He gets about halfway down the hall--
dialog: and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a
text: SQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead.
scene_heading: INT. CEILING TRAPDOOR
text: This happens fast. The trap--which presumably gives on the attic
text: with a set of folding stairs--rises, and RACHEL'S body plunges
text: down through and then hangs, swinging: she has been bound around
text: the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of MISSY DANDRIDGE.
text: Half her face is gone. Eaten.
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS
text: He SCREAMS and backs against the wall. Twang! The last silver
dialog: thread parts.
scene_heading: INT. THE TRAPDOOR, WITH GAGE
text: He leaps down, crashes on the floor, and then picks himself up. He
text: is waving the scalpel.
speaker_heading: GAGE (screeching)
dialog: Allee-allee-in-free! allee-allee-
dialog: in-free! Allee-allee-in-free!
scene_heading: INT. LOUIS AND GAGE
text: I won't choreograph all the moves, but GAGE slashes his stunned
text: father up pretty badly with the scalpel. He's screeching the whole
text: time. LOUIS finally begins to react. He grapples with the little
text: critter, and tries to get the syringe into him. No good. It's
text: batted out of his hand just before he can do it. It breaks.
text: LOUIS and GAGE fall to the floor. LOUIS gets the other syringe out
text: of his pocket, but it's also knocked out of his hand. Only
text: consolation is this one isn't broken. It rolls off along the
text: floor. LOUIS finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes
text: on, and plunges it into GAGE'S neck.
speaker_heading: GAGE
dialog: No fair! NO FAIR!
text: He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his
text: neck. He's lost all interest in his father. He goes staggering
text: away. He's slowing down. He goes to his knees...and falls on his
dialog: face.
text: LOUIS watches this... and then his vacant, half-catatonic gaze
dialog: goes to:
scene_heading: INT. RACHEL, LOUIS'S POV
text: She swings slowly back and forth.
text: EXT. THE BACK YARD OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE
text: Time has passed. It's late afternoon. LOUIS comes out with a
text: sheet-wrapped form in his arms. RACHEL, of course.
text: He sets the body down and goes back inside.
scene_heading: INT. THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS
text: He's splashing around a can of coal-oil. When he's got the room
text: wetted down to his satisfaction, he goes to the door, lights a
text: match, and tosses it.
text: Flame runs across the floor. The fire is slow at first, but then
text: it begins to gain rapidly.
text: LOUIS goes out.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BACK LAWN, WITH LOUIS
text: He picks up the sheet-wrapped form of his wife and walks around
text: the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows.
text: EXT. THE FRONT OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE, FROM ACROSS THE ROAD
text: LOUIS appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road.
