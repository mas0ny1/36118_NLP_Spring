speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: Would you like another glass of wine?
speaker_heading: ETHELINE

speaker_heading: ETHELINE (CONT’D)
dialog: Maybe we’re rushing things, Henry.
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: You’re right. It’s awkward sitting here

speaker_heading: ETHELINE
dialog: No, I think you’re right. I should go.

text: necktie up to his temple. He says earnestly:
speaker_heading: HENRY
dialog: How can I help?
text: Etheline begins to point to Henry’s necktie suspended near

text: necktie, hurling his glasses off his face and on to the
dialog: floor.
text: Henry picks up his glasses and puts them back on. He looks

speaker_heading: ROYAL
dialog: Holy shit.
text: Richie slowly reaches out to the falcon. He smooths out the
text: feathers on its neck and says softly:
speaker_heading: RICHIE
dialog: You came back.
text: Royal looks up at the sky. He seems frightened.
speaker_heading: ROYAL
dialog: Jiminy Cricket. He must have a goddamn

speaker_heading: RICHIE

speaker_heading: ROYAL
dialog: What do you mean? He flew right in

speaker_heading: RICHIE
