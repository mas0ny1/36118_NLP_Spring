speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: FIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUIT
text: lies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the
text: body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The
text: white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red.
scene_heading: REVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT
text: The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift.
scene_heading: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Dark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling
text: winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead
text: in the doorway.
text: It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes.
text: His face is missing.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third
text: BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of
text: an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed
text: through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened.
text: A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang
text: off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent.
scene_heading: INT. ROOM - NIGHT
text: A floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of
text: neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool.
text: The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now.
scene_heading: EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT
text: where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine,
text: which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously
text: atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed.
text: His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face,
text: late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN.
text: He opens his eyes.
speaker_heading: RUDY (V.O.)
dialog: I never was much for the holidays.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
text: THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND
text: rises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..."
text: And then, to complete the sentence: "...XMAS."
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY
text: Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the
dialog: Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
text: Rudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling --
text: where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.
text: The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo
text: through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across
text: the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.
text: He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage
text: self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family
text: photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful
dialog: Dodger.
scene_heading: A WALL CALENDAR
dialog: Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.
text: December 22nd is circled again and again.
text: Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops
text: to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen.
text: Turning back to the beds we reveal --
scene_heading: THE LOWER BUNK
text: where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached
text: and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is
text: a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost
text: a mural.
text: All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties,
text: smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous
text: brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores,
text: turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen
text: this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
text: The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick
text: absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What's the first thing, man? What's
dialog: the first thing you're gonna do?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Haven't thought about it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hell you haven't.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get to thinking about it, it won't
dialog: happen.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: We walk outta here, we hit that road,
dialog: what's the first thing you're gonna
dialog: do.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ain't there yet.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Three days, man.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Not yet.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin,
text: Christmas on the outs.
text: Dozens of uniformed INMATES wander the yard, stamping feet,
text: hands tucked away, breath frosting. Nick tries to light his
text: cig, but the wind plays havoc. Nick curses, tosses it.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hot chocolate.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get a hot mug of chocolate.
dialog: (nods)
dialog: First thing I'm gonna do.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: And a slice of pecan pie, right?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: And some pecan pie.
text: Nick laughs, stares through the fence at the gates of the
text: prison's entrance road. Longingly.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: She's gonna be out there, man. Right
text: there. Right there waiting.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and
text: right into her arms.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing
dialog: her own damn sheets, you read that
dialog: part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves
dialog: in the whole week, drinking wine,
dialog: taking baths, man, see if they got
dialog: those room service steaks... anything
dialog: I want to do. Remember when she wrote
dialog: that? Anything I want...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas.
text: Nick grins. They stand there, shivering. It's freezing, but
text: the time they get outside is too precious to give up.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: All those pictures she's sent...
dialog: y'know... you sure they're all of
dialog: her, Nick? You hear sometimes they
dialog: don't send their real pictures. Could
dialog: be her cousin or something.
text: Nick studies him.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why you gotta say a thing like that.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm just saying.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why you gotta. We were gonna give
dialog: you a ride someplace, man. Now I
dialog: just don't know.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm just talking.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
text: They trail off in silence. Nick looks out at the prison road
text: again. A snowy wasteland.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I'm gonna marry this girl.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - DAY
text: Rudy lies in his bunk, staring at the same paper snowflakes.
speaker_heading: NICK (O.S.)
dialog: Hey, hey, listen here. "I've made my
dialog: list and I've checked it twice, and
dialog: as long as you're naughty, it's gonna
dialog: be nice. These cold winter weeks
dialog: have been killing me, Nick, as I lie
dialog: here alone. It's not enough to have
dialog: your warmth in my heart anymore; I
dialog: need your warmth next to me. Work at
dialog: Penney's has been busy because it's
dialog: Christmas and that's when we do almost
dialog: half of our business for the whole
dialog: year -- ", okay, whatever, whatever --
dialog: (skipping on)
dialog: " -- my manager's still mad at me
dialog: for asking for the whole week off,"
dialog: whatever, whatever --
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Here we go. "And all that gets me
dialog: through the day is to close my eyes
dialog: and imagine holding you, and kissing
dialog: you, and touching you, and tasting
dialog: you everywhere because I know at
dialog: that moment, I'll feel I've found
dialog: the reason for my whole entire life."
text: Rudy still stares at the stone ceiling.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: For twenty-five, she sounds pretty
dialog: mature.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you
dialog: get matured real quick.
text: Nick's doing pushups on the floor below, smoking a cig,
text: reading sheets of pink stationery. With a new photo: of the
text: same GIRL, in a bikini by a lake. Vamping a childish pose.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sure as hell don't make me miss Millie
dialog: Bobek. Guess I owe Millie, though.
dialog: If I hadn't been rollin, her, I woulda
dialog: never ended up here. And I woulda
dialog: never met Ashley.
dialog: (studies photo)
dialog: That's the world for ya.
text: Nick climbs off the floor, paces back to the bunks, marvelling
dialog: at the latest letter.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What if she sees you, man, sees what
dialog: you look like... and it's not there.
dialog: You just don't do it for her.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Me and her got a connection.
dialog: (hands page to him)
dialog: Read this part. Read the part about
text: stuffing her stocking.
text: Nick drops the page on his stomach. Rudy sighs, picks it up,
text: brings it to his nose.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: She's using a new perfume.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, I think that's just oranges. She
dialog: writes here she's eating oranges.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Oh.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shoulda written to that magazine,
dialog: Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here,
dialog: walk right into a relationship. Not
dialog: some one-nighter, man... a
dialog: relationship. You? You're gonna walk
dialog: outta here with bus fare. Searching
text: for the drunkest skirt in the room.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shoulda written, Rudy...
text: Nick drops back to his bunk, pasting the new lakeside photo
text: among his collage of pictures. Admiring his pen pal:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Shoulda got yourself a girl.
text: Above, Rudy peruses the page Nick gave him. Some lipstick
text: marks pressed to the paper. He passes it back, closes his
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw,
dialog: and sit down for Christmas dinner.
dialog: Watch some ball with my old man,
dialog: sleep in my old bed, and have
dialog: leftovers for bout six months.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thought you hated Sidnaw.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Just taste that Christmas turkey.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Thought you hate your old man.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Five years, Nicky. Five years.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: I just want to go home.
text: There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING.
text: Nick smiles, still staring at his girl.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be
dialog: thinking about you.
scene_heading: INT. MAIN PRISON FLOOR - DAY
text: GUARDS monitor PRISONERS as they file out of their cells for
text: the afternoon meal. Rudy and Nick are motioned out by a MEAN
text: GUARD, his bitter world etched in his face. They join the
dialog: line.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Shit. Alamo's back.
text: Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed
text: Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands
text: are the size of a man's skull.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don't look like he missed the
dialog: sunlight.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm
text: the one ratted on him beating up
dialog: Cree. Since I was there, I saw it,
dialog: he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Aw, Rudy.
text: At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy
text: swiftly looks away --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Count me outta mealtime --
text: He slaps Nick an the back, heads back for their cell --
speaker_heading: MEAN GUARD
dialog: GET BACK IN LINE!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm not hungry, I'm gonna --
speaker_heading: MEAN GUARD
text: SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET
text: BACK IN FUCKING LINE!
text: The mean guard pulls his blackjack. Another guard's ready
text: behind him. They want Rudy to give them trouble.
text: Rudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks
text: across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy
text: swallows, heads toward the mess hall.
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - DAY
text: A GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed
text: on Rudy's plate. Same with Nick. It's the cafeteria line.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What the fuck is this?
speaker_heading: UGLY STAFFER
dialog: Holiday jello.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: What's this shit in it?
speaker_heading: UGLY STAFFER
dialog: Swallow and see.
text: The ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick
text: looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just so you know, this man and I are
dialog: outta here in two days. So while
dialog: we're inhaling London broil and
dialog: lobster bisque, you're gonna still
dialog: be standing here smelling up the
dialog: mystery creamfuck.
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Who's in prison now?
text: The ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on,
text: taking his tray off the rail and turning --
text: -- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into
text: the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to
dialog: see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over.
speaker_heading: THE ALAMO
dialog: When you don't expect it.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: It wasn't me, Alamo --
speaker_heading: THE ALAMO
dialog: That's when.
text: The Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes
text: a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder.
text: They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Two days.
scene_heading: INT. MESS HALL - TABLES - DAY
text: Rudy and Nick sit at a cafeteria table. Beside Rudy is a
text: frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, ZOOK. Zook sits alone, talks
dialog: to no one, always has the shakes.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: So maybe after our week beneath the
dialog: sheets, we'll head down to Motor
dialog: City for New Year's. She says her
dialog: roommate's skipping town for a few
dialog: days, have the place to ourselves.
dialog: Remember how her brother's a truck
dialog: driver down there? I'm thinking he
dialog: might be able to help get me some
dialog: work.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What, working security?
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: No, I'm through with that shit.
dialog: Ashley's right. Gotta start doing
dialog: something I got a stake in. Get a
dialog: business going.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't know, I've seen the business
dialog: world.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify
dialog: as a small business. Chop shop
text: consultant; doesn't work on a resume.
text: Rudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts
text: of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ashley's talking about maybe we can
dialog: start something up together...
text: Next to Rudy, Zook has stopped eating. He is still as stone,
text: staring at his tray.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Whatsa matter, Zook?
text: They both watch Zook put down his utensils and reach into
text: his red-and-green jello with his bare hand.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: The hell you doing, Zookerman?
text: Gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a
text: large black cockroach out. Zook's shaking.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Just a roach, Zook.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Good for you. Protein.
speaker_heading: ZOOK
dialog: Monsters in the gelatin...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: It's a roach, guy --
speaker_heading: ZOOK
dialog: There are monsters...
dialog: (voice rising)
dialog: ...in the gelatin...
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, man --
text: Zook stands up, holding jello aloft:
speaker_heading: ZOOK
text: THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (shakes his head)
dialog: Fuckin, Zookerman --
speaker_heading: ZOOK
text: THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
text: THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
text: A GRUMBLING MURMUR sweeps through the cafeteria as inmates
text: sift through their jello, searching for --
speaker_heading: DISTANT INMATE
dialog: Sonofabitch!
text: He pulls something bug-like out of his dessert, holds it
text: aloft, and then HURLS it at the cafeteria line. A STAFFER
text: ducks away. The inmates LAUGH and suddenly they're all on
dialog: their feet --
speaker_heading: ZOOK
text: THERE ARE MONSTERS! IN THE GELATIN!
text: -- grabbing handfuls of jello and throwing it at the cafeteria
text: line. Inmates get errantly SPLASHED, and respond by wheeling
text: on their fellow inmates -- red and green globs flying to and
dialog: fro!
speaker_heading: GUARDS
text: SIT DOWN! SIT THE FUCK BACK DOWN!
text: As GUARDS immediately rush in to restore order --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Rudy, don't move --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Two days, we got two days! Don't do
dialog: nothing. Don't touch nothing --
text: An INMATE at the end of their table picks up their table and
text: overturns it, sending food flying. Rudy and Nick stand back,
text: hands raised in surrender. Jello HITS Rudy in the face.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Don't move, Rudy!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Standing right here, man!
text: Zook is still SHOUTING until a GUARD clubs him senseless
text: with a blackjack. WHISTLES are blowing. Guards SCREAM for
dialog: order.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (as a GUARD eyes them)
dialog: Ate the jello, jello was fine!
text: The guard leaves them alone, runs on. The melee's still out
text: of control. As Rudy turns --
text: -- and suddenly sees The Alamo charging across the room,
text: with murderous eyes, a metal shank in his hand! Five feet
dialog: away!
speaker_heading: NICK
text: RUDY, LOOK OUT!
text: Nick grabs him, trying to push him out of the way --
text: -- and The Alamo's shank plunges deep into Nick's stomach
text: burying between his ribs. Blood splashes. Nick slumps.
speaker_heading: RUDY
speaker_heading: NICK!
text: The Alamo pulls the blade out with a ferocious YELL, pushes
text: Nick to the floor and spins on Rudy! Rudy blocks with a chair,
text: stumbling back, cartwheeling over a table as The Alamo roars
dialog: over him for the kill --
text: -- and two GUARDS tackle the big Indian out of nowhere!
text: Knocking the knife away, hammering him with blackjacks. It
text: takes another three guards to keep The Alamo down.
text: Rudy scrambles across the floor. Nick's on his back, blood
text: pumping freely from his gut --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: GUARD! GUARD!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (in shock)
dialog: Alamo...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: GUARD!!!
text: No one's helping, the guards nearby all subduing The Alamo.
text: Nick grabs Rudy's shirt, gasping to speak --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Jesus, Rudy --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Take it, man! You're all right!
dialog: Hold it in! GUARD!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: GUARD!!!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Ash... Ashley...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No, man! No, no, no!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: (choking)
dialog: Tell her... I'll be there ...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You're GONNA be there! We're getting
dialog: outta here! TAKE IT!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Tell Ashley... I...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: YOU TELL HER!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ...be with her...
text: Blood spills out Nick's mouth. His eyes go vacant.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: NO!!!
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ...for Christmas...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: NICK!!!
text: And Rudy's suddenly hauled backwards. A trio of GUARDS
text: descend, grabbing Nick's body as his life fades away. Dragging
text: his figure out of the melee. WHISTLES are blowing.
speaker_heading: GUARDS
text: GET HIM OUT OF HERE! LOCK DOWN!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: NICK!!!
text: Rudy struggles, enraged, and gets blackjacked across the
text: skull for his trouble. He hits the jello-covered floor.
text: And the world goes dark.
scene_heading: INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT
text: Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his
text: head. The cell block silent for the first time.
text: Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's
text: somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with
dialog: distinct pleasure.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: The man had two days...
speaker_heading: MEAN GUARD
dialog: Well. Least he won't be coming back.
text: The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him --
text: -- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing
text: through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps
text: the cruel smile.
speaker_heading: MEAN GUARD
dialog: You need company tonight, Rudy...
dialog: you just give a holler.
text: He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling "Are You
text: Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request that he
text: shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the
dialog: row.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on
text: Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind.
text: THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY
text: Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the
text: photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of
dialog: it.
text: Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters.
text: He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages.
text: He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it.
speaker_heading: NICK (V.O.)
dialog: Rudy, man, here we go, here, what
dialog: she wrote here: "The car's waiting.
text: The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting.
dialog: I've waited for so long. I'm burning
dialog: for you, Nick. My whole body. My
dialog: whole heart. I'm burning for you..."
text: Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a
text: swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He was burning for you too...
text: And puts the letter away.
scene_heading: CLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT
text: As his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY
text: Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door
text: BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS,
text: make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered
dialog: in snow.
speaker_heading: EXIT GUARD
dialog: Your world and welcome to it,
dialog: dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now!
dialog: We'll keep the lights on for ya!
text: Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill
text: hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in
dialog: summer.
text: Secondhand shoes. No possessions.
text: He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All
text: fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the
dialog: fenceway.
scene_heading: BEYOND THE GATE
text: There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN,
text: several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats
text: and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them.
text: The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks
text: the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free.
text: The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives
text: rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade
text: slaps on backs. Reunion time.
text: The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head
text: down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he
text: can't help himself -- he glances up --
dialog: TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN
text: bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball
text: on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus.
scene_heading: INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
text: Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes
text: a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard.
text: Then the cons with relatives start to pile in.
text: Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into
text: his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the
text: picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it.
text: He rubs his window with his sleeve.
text: Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and
text: that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing
text: onto the bus with their loved ones.
text: The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the
text: gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming.
text: Rudy watches her sadly.
text: Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up
text: their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies,
text: buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's
dialog: changed.
text: The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball.
text: Rudy looks at the bikini picture again.
text: Then at the shivering bundle.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Don't do it, Rudy...
text: The bus ENGINE starts up. In the seat beside Rudy, an EX-CON
text: makes out with his WIFE while his bratty KID punches his
dialog: leg.
text: Out the window, the young woman is scanning the bus windows.
text: Then the prison again. She turns in a worried circle. Rudy
text: looks swiftly away. Closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Don't do it ...
text: The bus door closes. It REVS and starts forward. Rudy sighs
text: with relief. The photo of Ashley falls to the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. PRISON RELEASE GATE - CONTINUOUS
text: The young woman watches the bus pull away, down the snowy
text: road. But it doesn't get fifty feet before it suddenly stops.
text: The door opens. And Rudy steps out.
text: The bus REVS up again and GROANS OFF into the winter.
text: The young woman pushes her poofball hat out of her eyes. We
text: get a look at her face for the first time. Skin pale, lips
text: turning blue, but it's the girl from the pictures. It's
dialog: Ashley.
text: She watches Rudy's figure trudge back toward her. Snow
text: obscuring him until he's right in front of her. Both of them
text: shivering. Both of them standing there.
dialog: And finally:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You Ashley?
text: Ashley nods. And Rudy sadly smiles.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm Nick.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
text: Rudy and Ashley sit at a coffee shop booth. Coats still on.
text: Big rigs bluster by on the highway outside.
text: Two untouched cups of coffee sit before them.
text: She's watching him in silence.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I like your coat.
text: Ashley says nothing. Rudy looks at his own:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: This -- this is just something they
dialog: gave me at the door. Wasn't snowing
dialog: when we signed up, y'know?
text: Ashley nods.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: How's your coffee?
text: Ashley looks at it, like she's just realizing it's there.
text: She lifts the cup, takes a sip. Puts it down.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Good.
text: Rudy nods. Silence again.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Gotta be ten degrees out there.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Radio said negative five.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Negative five?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't think it's negative five.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Radio said.
dialog: Beat.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Wind chill. That's probably what
dialog: they meant.
text: Ashley nods. Rudy bites his lip.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I was scared. Scared you were gonna
dialog: take one look at me and change your
dialog: mind. Scared I was walking into
dialog: heartache. All those words... you
dialog: put a picture in your mind of where
dialog: they come from and when you see where
dialog: maybe it's not the same as your
dialog: picture.
text: He trails off.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I figured you walked outta there and
dialog: saw me and walked right the other
dialog: way --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No, no --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No, hey, I like your coat --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Saw me --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ashley, no. That was me, that's what
dialog: I was scared of. I mean, be serious...
dialog: I ain't exactly looking like Mr.
dialog: Universe here.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You are to me.
text: Rudy goes silent. Whoa. Ashley considers.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I can get another one going. Y'know,
dialog: hey, whatever you want me to --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
text: Another awkward pause. Rudy picks up a milk dispenser beside
text: the coffee, puts it to his lips. It gives him a wide white
text: mustache. He stares straight-faced.
text: Ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Do that again.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Smile.
text: Ashley smiles again, blushing now.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: One more. Smile. One more.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (trying not to)
dialog: No, c'mon --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I've been dreaming about that smile,
dialog: Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
text: They stare across the table, drifting into one another's
dialog: eyes.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You're better than the picture in my
dialog: mind, Nick...
dialog: (softly)
dialog: You're real.
text: Outside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow.
scene_heading: SMASH CUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. INTERSTATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY
text: And Rudy and Ashley SLAM inside, kissing passionately, limbs
text: intertwined, pawing at each other's coats. Rudy kicks the
text: door closed. Mouths devouring, hands lost in snowy hair.
text: They collide with a side table, knocking over a lamp, tumbling
text: onto the lumpy bed. Rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater
dialog: and turtleneck and capilene and whatever else's she got on,
text: as Ashley's lips explore his neck and body. Writhing and
text: wrestling and rolling off the bed. Bang.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER
text: Rudy and Ashley fuck like lovers in R-rated movies.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - LATER
text: The bed sheets lie tangled on the floor. Rudy and Ashley
text: rest naked amidst them. Her pretty young head on his chest,
text: all their inhibitions gone. Rudy strokes her arms.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Tell me something. This the first
dialog: time you've ever done this?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that
dialog: supposed to mean --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No, not that, no...
dialog: (laughs, kisses her)
dialog: I mean this, the whole thing. Start
text: writing to a guy, guy in the bricks.
dialog: Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me
dialog: the truth.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Well. You're not the first guy I
dialog: wrote to. But you're the only one I
dialog: kept writing to.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah. Me too.
dialog: (considers)
dialog: Why? I mean I know why for me, why I
dialog: paid for the ad. But you... why start
dialog: writing to some guy -- some con --
dialog: you don't even know?
text: Ashley studies his face, smiles in reflection.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I told you, Nick. Remember?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Tell me again.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: All the guys I've ever been with...
dialog: they never want to know me. Who I am
dialog: on the inside. They just want to qet
text: inside. When they do, they think
dialog: that means they know who I am. That
dialog: I trust them. That they know me.
dialog: That there's nothing left to learn.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: A guy like you, Nick -- six months
dialog: before you can even touch my face. I
dialog: figure a guy in that kind of bind,
dialog: he's gonna hafta work to get to know
dialog: me some other way.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Had some bad relationships, didn't
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Not bad. Just regular.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You wrote me wonderful things, Nick.
dialog: Personal things.
text: She turns to him, kisses his chest --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Yes it was all you --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Guy I was in with... he helped
dialog: sometimes... some of the romantic
dialog: stuff, actually... you'd like him --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I'm talking about the heart, Nick.
dialog: I'm not talking about the words.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Y'know, some of the heart mighta
dialog: been his too...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Then he shoulda signed his name.
text: She turns over playfully, eases herself back atop him. Ready
text: to make up for lost time. With a kiss:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: And he'd be here right now.
scene_heading: INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY
text: Ashley runs through an Xmas-decorated megamall, dragging
text: Rudy behind her. Both of them laughing, as she hauls him
dialog: over to some cookie bakery company:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Where the hell are you going?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Provisions! We are not leaving that
dialog: motel room again till after New
dialog: Year's: we need ten days worth of
dialog: provisions!
dialog: (to cookie matron)
dialog: What's good?!
speaker_heading: COOKIE MATRON
dialog: Oh my, we've got a special on our
dialog: chocolate crunchie elves, they're
dialog: shaped like little helpers --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: THIS MAN... has not had a cookie in
dialog: two goddamn years! Get him two of
dialog: everything!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ashley, Jesus --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Can't survive on our bodies alone,
dialog: Nick.
dialog: (to cookie matron)
dialog: Hurry up!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ash... didn't you write me that you
dialog: don't eat chocolate?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Yeah, well you wrote me you were six-
dialog: foot-four, baby.
dialog: (teasing smile)
dialog: So don't talk to me about little
text: white lies.
scene_heading: INT. J.C. PENNEY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
text: Teddy bears with nightcaps, green bows, red ribbons. Ashley's
text: tearing through men's clothing racks, all love and confidence.
text: Rudy's got a bunch of purchase bags weighing him down:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You need a COAT!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ash, you've gotten me enough --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No boyfriend of mine is going to
dialog: walk around in negative-five degree
dialog: wind chill without a goddamn good-
dialog: looking coat!
text: She pulls out a hellacious black leather fringe number.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I
dialog: haven't gotten you anything --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You got out, Nick. You're here.
dialog: You're my Christmas.
text: She puts the jacket against his chest, smiling. Rudy sighs.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: It's two hundred dollars, Ash --
text: She whips a Penney's card from her purse, grins wickedly:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You forget where I work?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (beat)
text: Beauty and fragrances.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho
dialog: ho ho.
text: She runs off with the jacket. Rudy turns to a dressing mirror,
text: left to stare at his reflection. An ex-con in rags, with a
text: half-dozen holiday shopping bags. To himself:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Just for the holidays, Nick. Then
dialog: we'll tell her. We'll let her...
dialog: have her holidays...
text: Rudy nods till he convinces himself. Can't help but smile.
scene_heading: INT. TOY STORE - DAY
text: Puzzles, Barbies and dinosaurs. KIDS scurrying, PARENTS
text: chasing. Rudy and Ashley with a scared TEEN CLERK:
speaker_heading: TEEN CLERK
dialog: You can't find... what?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Toys for adults. Where are your toys
dialog: for adults?
speaker_heading: TEEN CLERK
dialog: Toys for... adults?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: C'mon. How old are you, sixteen?
dialog: C'mon.
speaker_heading: TEEN CLERK
dialog: We sell children's toys --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (slams money down)
dialog: I got fifty dollars to spend in your
dialog: store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you
dialog: help me or not?
text: The clerk glances around, then, low:
speaker_heading: TEEN CLERK
text: Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in
text: aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Thank you.
scene_heading: INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON CONVEYOR
text: As bottles of wine, vodka and rum, cartons of egg nog and
text: orange juice, and countless prepackaged sandwiches come
text: scrolling past.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: You know what I was thinking, after
dialog: our holiday hideaway? Instead of
dialog: going back to Detroit, maybe we could
dialog: go gambling. Y'know? Drive up to
dialog: that Indian place you worked at.
dialog: Wouldn't that be fun? I haven't gone
dialog: gambling in forever!
scene_heading: EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - DUSK
text: Light snow falls. Rudy, in his new black fringe eyesore, and
text: Ashley carry grocery bags across the icy asphalt:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Well, I don't know about that --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good
dialog: at. I mean, they'd give us some free
dialog: games or something, wouldn't they?
dialog: Since you worked there?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Security, Ash, I just worked security.
dialog: They wouldn't be rolling out the red
dialog: carpet --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: And the slots, slots I'm good at
dialog: too. Wouldn't that be fun?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We'll have more fun in Detroit.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: We could live it up and --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ashley. We're not going anywhere I
dialog: used to work.
text: It comes out too harsh. Ashley stops, a little hurt.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I just... I thought you'd have friends
dialog: there...
text: Rudy softens, touches her arms:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hey. I been in prison for two years,
dialog: Ash. Believe me. Those guys wouldn't
dialog: want to see me.
text: He kisses her. She nods, dismisses it, kisses back.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Well, they don't know what the hell
dialog: they're missing.
scene_heading: EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
text: Ashley's Chevy Nova pulls back into the lot of the roadside
text: joint. There's an artificial (silver) Christmas tree tied to
dialog: the roof.
text: She and Rudy climb out; she heads for the office:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to
dialog: disturb us for the rest of the year.
dialog: I get back in that room, you better
text: be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'll see what I can do.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
text: She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring
text: his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their
dialog: shopping score. Gifts and goodies.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (sings, sotto)
dialog: I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum-
dialog: pum-pum. No treasures for the king,
dialog: pa-rum-pum-pum-pum...
text: Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags
text: on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside.
scene_heading: INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
text: Pitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: ...but I got a girl to be with, rum-
dialog: pum-pum-pum...
speaker_heading: MERLIN (O.S.)
dialog: Hi, Nick.
text: Rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky
text: black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door
dialog: shut --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What the fuck --
text: -- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets
text: an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a
text: mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again --
text: -- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a
dialog: dresser.
text: Rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests
text: him to the ground. Grabs the bat --
text: -- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a
text: little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the
text: bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor --
text: -- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries
text: and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head!
text: Pug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again
text: in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing
text: into one wall, then another, YELLING for help --
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!!
text: -- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun.
text: Rudy stops still. A lamp clicks on.
text: Standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a
text: sawed-off on him.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Welcome home, Nick.
text: Another lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold,
text: gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy
text: hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot
dialog: of road.
text: Rudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth,
text: bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne.
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: I owe ya a drink, ya fuck --
text: -- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up.
text: Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles.
text: Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian
text: in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door.
text: Gabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes
text: his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You... you don't know me --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you
dialog: real well.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No, you can't --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: The hell I can't.
text: As the room's door gets kicked open --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the
dialog: fucking tree!
text: and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting
text: forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans --
speaker_heading: RUDY
speaker_heading: ASHLEY!
text: Merlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through,
text: followed by Ashley, face in branches --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I'm telling you, we got the best one
dialog: in the store... I don't know why
dialog: people want their houses smelling
dialog: like the stupid woods...
text: She's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he
text: slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: NO!
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
speaker_heading: NICK!
text: Rudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks
text: Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug
text: have her held firmly. Her face to the wall --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (re: the silver tree)
dialog: Hope her taste in men's better than
dialog: her taste in Christmas.
text: Ashley's turned to face him. Her eyes widen. Gabriel nods.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Hey, sis. Happy holidays.
text: Rudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel.
text: Ashley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her
text: back against the wall for her trouble --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Jumpy, don't hurt her, now.
text: Gabriel steps to Rudy. Studies him.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So. This is the guy you been waiting
dialog: for. Man of your dreams.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel -- !
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (unimpressed)
dialog: Must have a way with stationery.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel, what are you doing!
text: Gabriel raises the sawed-off to Rudy's chest. Rudy flinches,
dialog: but Merlin's got him.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: GABRIEL!!!
text: Gabriel fixes her with a stare. She shuts up. To Rudy:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You better be here to be good to
dialog: her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been
dialog: good to you.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel, let him go --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Read a lot about you, Nick.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What are you doing here?!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Read you're a man of some knowledge.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: A man of some travels.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
text: Rudy's trying to speak, voice CHOKED. Gabriel nods to Merlin,
text: who again eases his hold. Rudy coughs.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm... not... Nick...
text: Gabriel frowns. Rudy turns to Ashley.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm not him. I...
dialog: (then to Gabriel)
dialog: You want something from Nick, you
dialog: got the wrong guy.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (hurt)
dialog: Nick...
text: Gabriel looks from her to him, then lowers his sawed-off,
text: and SWINGS it into Rudy's stomach. Rudy buckles. Panicked.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Who are you now.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You got the wrong guy! She thinks
dialog: I'm Nick, I'm not!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (to Merlin)
text: Put him in the truck.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I was in the joint with him! I knew
dialog: about him and her, okay!? I took his
dialog: place!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You what...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended
dialog: I was him! I knew about her letters!
dialog: Jesus Christ, whatever you want from
dialog: him -- I'm not Nick!
dialog: (to Ashley)
dialog: I -- I just wanted to be --
text: A glance of regret amidst his desperation. Ashley stares
text: back, confused, searching his eyes.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You're not Nick Mason...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I shared his cell!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: But you were saying you were...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So you could get with my sister.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So you could get down her chimney.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: And you think telling me that's gonna
dialog: help your cause.
text: Gabriel RATCHETS him across the chin with the gun butt. Rudy
text: hits the floor. Gabriel spins on Ashley, enraged:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Is this him!?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (reaches for Rudy)
dialog: Don't hurt him...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Is this the fucker you been writing
dialog: all year!?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (reaches for Rudy)
dialog: Please, Gabriel, don't...
text: Gabriel puts the gun to Rudy's head.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: YES!!!
text: Gabriel doesn't shoot. Studies Rudy.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Well, he's gonna have to learn to
dialog: give you some respect.
text: Gabriel KICKS Rudy in the jaw. Ashley screams. Gabriel motions
text: to his boys: Jumpy and Pug drag her outside. Gabriel KICKS
text: Rudy again. Rudy lies there and takes it.
text: Merlin lights a cig, examines Rudy and Ashley's grocery bags:
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Take 'em.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: How 'bout the tree? You want the
dialog: tree?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Leave the tree.
text: Merlin nods, tucks the bags under his arms, leaves the room.
text: Gabriel drops beside Rudy, with a sick smile:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I've read your letters, motherfucker.
dialog: Don't play no reindeer games with
dialog: me.
scene_heading: EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT
text: As we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway,
text: arcing into the blackness.
text: CLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward,

scene_heading: INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT
text: Gabriel at the wheel, Merlin smoking, Jumpy eating cookies.

speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you
dialog: now. You're okay...
text: Her hand strokes his face. Rudy's eyes struggle open.
speaker_heading: ON FULL SCENE
text: They're in the back of the truck. There's some packing mats,
text: rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova.
text: Rudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his
text: wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze.
text: In a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping
text: chewing tobacco, reading Road &amp; Track, headphones on. Gives
text: Rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't
dialog: hurt you anymore.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Your brother...
text: Ashley nods. Rudy looks around, remembering.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: ...the truck driver...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He's not a bad person, Nick... he's
dialog: not...
text: From the corner, Pug spits some chaw. Ashley wheels.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You're not gonna hurt him anymore!
text: Pug doesn't even look up. Still stroking Rudy's face:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Since Janey moved in... Gabriel...
dialog: he's come over more and more. To the
dialog: apartment. Janey's the divorced one,
dialog: 'member, with the tit job --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What the fuck is going on.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He read the letters, Nick. Some day
dialog: I wasn't there. He went through my
dialog: room. He found your letters.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What's going ON!!!
text: The truck shakes.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He knows you worked in that casino.
text: Rudy stares at her. She's scared
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You motherfucker.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, no --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You sold him out.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: When'd you decide to do it, Ash?
dialog: After which of his letters, huh?
dialog: The fortieth? The fiftieth? The
dialog: first?!
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, what are you --
text: She reaches out for him; Rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles
text: against the opposite wall of the trailer.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'M NOT NICK!
dialog: (raging)
dialog: You thought you'd fuck him over?!
dialog: Well he's fucked you! I've never

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, I love you --
speaker_heading: RUDY
speaker_heading: JESUS CHRIST!
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'M NOT NICK!
text: Ashley runs at him, wraps her arms around him tightly. He

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get the hell off of me!
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (hard whisper)
dialog: Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
text: Rudy stops fighting. She has a terrified look in her eye.
text: Checks to Pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. Ashley
text: turns them away from the little guy's view
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He'll kill you.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You're not hearing me here --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: My brother's killed people, I know
dialog: he has. Truckers. If you talk him
dialog: into thinking you're not you, you'll
dialog: only get yourself dead.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did
dialog: he.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, please, it's me --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You told him about Nick's letters.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No, Nick, no --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You're in on this.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I love you!
text: Rudy stares at her coldly.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Y'know, in a way, I'm glad it's me.
dialog: 'Cause you woulda broken his heart.
text: Ashley stares, panicked. Pug's still watching them.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Your pen palls dead, lady.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: If you say that, if you keep saying
dialog: that, they will kill you. If they
dialog: think you're not you, they will kill
dialog: you. Don't you see? I know what you're
dialog: doing, but it won't work!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nick died for me....
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I won't let him hurt you! He just
dialog: wants what you know!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (ruefully)
dialog: ...maybe I die for Nick...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Just tell him what you know, Nick!
dialog: That's all they want! And we'll get
dialog: out of this!
text: Rudy gives her a stone cold stare. Ashley crumbles, touching
text: his face, shaking her head, tears. Devastated.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He found them... I swear, Nick...
dialog: (helpless)
dialog: ...he found them...
text: The truck shudders through downshifts, to a groaning stop.
text: Ashley embraces Rudy fiercely, holding on for the last.
text: The trailer gate RATTLES open into the truck's roof.
text: Ashley shuts her eyes.
scene_heading: EXT. REST STOP/INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CONTINUOUS
text: The rig all alone at a snowy rest area. Gabriel, Merlin and
text: Jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries. Gabriel surveys,
text: then lifts a piece of paper:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: "My sweet, sexy Ashy-lashy, I have
dialog: been dreaming of you constantly, and
dialog: knowing you are out there makes these
dialog: walls not seem so close or so strong
dialog: or so cold..."
dialog: (to Merlin/Jumpy)
dialog: Women live for this stuff.
dialog: (reads on)
dialog: Dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming
dialog: 'bout your those, gettin' X-rated on
dialog: me here, Nicky... where are we...
dialog: oh, right, other side...
dialog: (turns paper over)
dialog: "Someday I'm gonna take you up by
dialog: Lake S. Before I went in, before
dialog: goddamn Millie, 'fore I had my
dialog: situation, I used to work up at this
dialog: casino, working security. Used to
dialog: watch for people stealing chips,
dialog: counting cards, getting piss-drunk,
dialog: that kinda shit. Indian place, they
dialog: hired this reject outta Vegas to run
dialog: it, got about as much business sense
dialog: as a buffalo patty. Anyways, it's a
dialog: fun place to run some numbers and
dialog: play."
text: Gabriel puts the letter down.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You're a good writer, Nick. I give
dialog: this writing an A-plus.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I never worked at no casino.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (hopeless)
dialog: Nick...
text: Rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: That's the guy I was in with, I did
dialog: my last ten months with him. He rode
dialog: a two-year bit for manslaughter --
text: split a guy's skull open at a bar
dialog: for harassing his girl. That's Nick
dialog: Mason. He worked at that casino.
dialog: He's the one who wrote her letters.
dialog: Me, I'm a damn mechanic, my last job
dialog: was a Quickie Lube, I did five for
dialog: lifting cars. I don't know shit about
dialog: blackjack, I don't know shit about
dialog: Indians. I'm not him.
text: Gabriel stares at him. Then crumples the letter.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Bury this guy.
text: Merlin and Jumpy grab Rudy and THROW him from the truck. He
text: HITS the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel, you promised!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I promised that when he helped us,
dialog: we'd be gone! When he helped us!
dialog: Loverboy don't want to play!
text: Merlin and Jumpy drop to the snow, picking Rudy up.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You promised me!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: And you promised me you'd get your
dialog: sweetheart to help!
text: Rudy meets eyes with Ashley. She's caught.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: He'd rather die than be with you,
dialog: he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend
dialog: anyway.
dialog: (to Merlin/Jumpy)
text: Bury him all over the place.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: NO!
text: She charges at her brother. Gabriel grabs her, spins her
text: into control and PUNCHES her in the jaw. She goes flying out
text: of the truck. HITS the ground hard. In shock.
text: Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy across the lot. A stand of dark
text: and snowy woods ahead...
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Beats prison, I guess.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
text: NICK!!! NICK!!! NOOOOO!!!
text: Rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. Jumpy loads a
text: handgun, as he muses for the very first time:
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: The problem with prison... is that
dialog: it is founded on the fundamentally
dialog: flawed perception of rehabilitation
dialog: through punishment. A society can't
dialog: hope to create a "changed man" by
text: surrounding him with the worst in
dialog: his fellow man; what it
dialog: "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction
dialog: that if he can survive the inhumanity
dialog: of prison, what then, can he not
dialog: withstand? He has seen man's darkest
dialog: soul and kept his sight: what is
dialog: left for such a man? What faith?
dialog: What fear?
text: At the woods' edge, Jumpy gives the gun to Merlin --
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Don't get no blood on my boots --
text: The gun goes to Rudy's head. A bullet fills the chamber.
text: Ashley SCREAMS. Rudy shuts his eyes tight and --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW!
text: Merlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: About the Tomahawk! What the hell do
dialog: you want to know!
text: His guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I spend six months writing poetry
dialog: and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over.
dialog: Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want
dialog: me, you got me. Whaddya want to know.
text: Ashley gasps relief. Gabriel smiles.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Everything.
text: Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I love you... Nick, I love you...
text: Rudy won't meet her eyes.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: She says a lot of things.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: She's getting you to help us... 'cause
dialog: she knows if you don't, you're dead.
dialog: You just tell us what we need to
dialog: know, you two live happily ever after.
dialog: My sister loves you, motherfucker,
dialog: and I ain't gonna have you break her
dialog: heart.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Wish I had a brother like you.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: A girl says she loves you, you say
dialog: something.
text: Rudy looks at Ashley. Her eyes plead forgiveness.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I had better sex in prison.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna
dialog: be working together here.
dialog: (to his boys)
dialog: Get him back in the rig.
text: Merlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to
text: him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes
text: silent, casts her eyes to the snow.
speaker_heading: PUG (O.S.)
dialog: He's not the guy, Monster.
text: Everyone looks to the truck. Weasel-faced Pug has sidled
text: next to Gabriel. Spits some chaw.
text: It hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls.
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: Whole time you were driving, he was
dialog: telling her he's not the guy, he's
dialog: not the guy. I know why he'd tell us
dialog: he's not the guy. why's he telling
dialog: her he's not the guy? What if he's
dialog: not the guy?
text: Gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: The man who wrote those letters loved
dialog: Ashley, boys. He lived for her love.
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Let's see him live for love.
text: Gabriel puts a gun under Rudy's chin. Rudy flinches.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Where's she work?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (forces gun harder)
dialog: Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't
dialog: she? Where's she work?
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What's her middle name?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (thinking hard)
dialog: Samantha.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What'd they call her in high school?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Bam Bam.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What'd they call her in college?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What college.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Where'd she drop her cherry?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Canada.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Be more specific.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: A station wagon in Canada.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What's her greatest fear?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Her brother.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No. It's her brother.
text: Rudy stares him down. Gabriel shrugs.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: That's love.
text: He puts the gun away. Ashley regains her breath.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Let's get back on the road. It's
dialog: time to start talking, Nick. Time to
dialog: start telling tales --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nick don't talk till Nick gets
dialog: something.
text: Gabriel gives a challenging stare. Rudy stares right back.
text: It's a showdown.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hot. Chocolate.
text: The trucker slowly smiles. His crew chuckles.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: You want that for here or to go?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I been in Iron Mountain for two years,
dialog: truck driver. I do one more crime,
dialog: I'm back there for good, so fuck you
dialog: and fuck your sister and fuck your
dialog: trucker friends. You want to hear
dialog: about some goddamn job of mine? I
dialog: want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
dialog: They've stopped laughing.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: And some pecan-fucking-pie.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSE ON HOT CHOCOLATE AND PECAN PIE
text: The six of them sit in a booth, Ashley leaning on Rudy's
text: shoulder apologetically. The four truckers watch him scarf
text: his pie. "White Christmas" plays over the speakers.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So when you worked there --
text: Rudy raises a finger sharply. Silence. He continues eating.
text: Scrapes the last of his pie crumbs.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You knew the place --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hey.
text: Rudy stares hard. Gobbles the crumbs, washes it down with
text: his hot chocolate. Savors it. Sets the mug down.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Y'know, I could really go for some
text: onion rings.
text: Gabriel nods to Jumpy, who snaps his arm up, SMASHING his
text: knuckles into Rudy's face.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's
dialog: all you ever said...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We're talking, aren't we?
text: Rudy holds his nose. Blood trickles.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: How much money's in that casino?
text: Day-to-day.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: The hell you don't.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (sighs, a guess)
dialog: Five million?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You wrote Ash that letter, you told
dialog: her that story 'bout working Christmas
dialog: Eve, bout how they'd send half the
dialog: security guys home, nobody comin, in
dialog: that night. And the rest of you got
dialog: shit-faced drinking hot buttered
dialog: rum. That a true story now?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Christmas... Eve...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You know where the guards are. You
dialog: know how to get in and out. You know
dialog: where the money is.
dialog: (nods)
dialog: We're taking down that casino,
dialog: convict. You're the guy gonna tell
dialog: us how.
text: Rudy turns slightly pale.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hey, it's... been two years --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We got faith in you, Nick Mason.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: You're our inside man.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP BATHROOM - NIGHT
text: Rudy slams in, letting the door smack shut behind him. It's
text: a tiny windowless closet. Rudy kicks a stall door, pacing.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: ...goddamn it, Rudy... goddamn it...
dialog: goddamn girl, goddamn Nick... you're
dialog: so smart, so fucking smart...
text: He stalks a circle, grabs a sink, and stares at his reflection
text: in the mirror. He looks a wreck. He settles down.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Where's your Christmas dinner now...
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: A COUPLE leaves the booth behind Gabriel's crew. Pug and
text: Merlin reach over, steal their leftovers and dig in. Ashley
text: fidgets.
text: Jumpy regards the garlands painted on the windows beside:
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: I've read where the retail industry
dialog: does fifty percent of its business
dialog: between December 1st and December
dialog: 25th. Half the year's business, in
dialog: one month's time. It seems to me an
dialog: intelligent society would legislate
dialog: a second such gift-giving holiday,
dialog: create, say, a Christmas Two -- late
dialog: May, early June -- to further
dialog: stimulate growth and prosperity. For
dialog: who would protest such a holiday?
dialog: Taking the fifty percent model, a
dialog: Christmas Two would grow this
dialog: country's annual per capita income
dialog: by close to one-third.
text: Everyone stares at Jumpy.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Christmas Two.
text: The Indian nods. Gabriel shakes his head.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Ever since you started night school,
dialog: you been givin, me headaches, Jumpy.
text: Headaches.
dialog: (to Merlin/Pug)
dialog: Go see what's taking him.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM - SAME
text: Rudy crouches behind the door, a piece of iron pipe in his
text: grip, ready to strike. Listening... listening...
text: AS the door SLAMS open, swinging fast and BASHING him in the
dialog: head.
text: Rudy tags the floor, drops the pipe, knocked out.
text: Merlin and Pug gaze down on him, shaking their heads. Pug
text: spits tobacco. Hits Merlin's boots again.
scene_heading: INT. TRUCK STOP - MOMENTS LATER
text: Rudy's back, with a new facial bruise. Ashley reaches for
text: his hand; he pulls it away. Gabriel unfolds a piece of paper --
text: it's a crude map.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Here ya go, convict. We cased the
dialog: place in the fall, got the layout
dialog: down. What you're gonna do is show
dialog: us where each of these doors go,
dialog: what the upstairs level looks like,
dialog: where they got the alarms, all of
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: And where they hide the real money.
text: Merlin exhales some smoke in Pug's face. Pug hacks, shoves
dialog: him.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: And Nick? If you even think about
dialog: setting us up, giving us some bad
dialog: information? We go down... you go
dialog: down...
dialog: (lets it settle)
dialog: Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards
dialog: are there gonna be?
text: Rudy surveys the table. All five waiting for him. Sighs.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hell. Ten?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: And which of these doors here lead
dialog: up to the security level?
text: Gabriel passes the map across the table. Rudy stares at it.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Start talking, Nick.
text: Rudy's still staring.
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: Start talkin
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Who the hell made this map.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I said, who the hell made the map?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I did.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: This isn't the Tomahawk.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What the fuck are you talking about.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: This is the front entrance, right?
dialog: You get through the slots, you hit
dialog: craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's
dialog: here to here -- lined up. What's
dialog: this, the cage? Cage is over there,
dialog: hard to get to, you got it all mixed
dialog: around --
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: That's what it looks like!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Since when? What the hell is this
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What
dialog: the hell kind of map is this?!
text: Gabriel reaches across the booth, grabs Rudy's shirt, pulls
text: his face to table level:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We walked the place for a week.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: And I worked there. For a year.
text: Neither man blinks.
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: They changed the layout.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What?
text: Rudy nods, pretending to be dawned upon.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: They changed the layout -- whadda
dialog: they call you? Mr. Monster? They
dialog: remodeled the place. When I worked
dialog: there -- listen to me -- guy that
dialog: managed the joint, guy who ran it--
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: Jack. Jack Bangs.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was
dialog: always talking bout fixing the place
dialog: up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta
dialog: gone and done it while I was in the
dialog: Mountain.
dialog: (pushes map away)
dialog: I don't know this map, man. How the
dialog: hell am I supposed to tell you what
dialog: door goes where?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: They wouldn't have changed the
dialog: security setup.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: When I worked there, this was Bangs,
dialog: office. Back here. He kept a little
dialog: safe in the... uh, the wall, money
dialog: held take for himself, skim from the
dialog: Indians. Called it the... uh...
dialog: (stumbling)
dialog: ...the Powwow Safe.
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: The Powwow Safe?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: His personal safe, he gave it a name.
dialog: Now you're telling me they've taken
dialog: his office, put the buffet there?
dialog: Then who knows what else they changed.
text: Gabriel stares at him, suspicious.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: So what the hell good are you...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You'd have to get me inside.
dialog: (carefully)
dialog: Get inside, watch where the money's
dialog: moving, see where the guards are
dialog: going. Then I could work with your
dialog: map.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Wrong, convict. You walk in there,
dialog: they recognize you.
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: So what?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: They recognize him, they'll remember
text: him after the job goes down.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: They won't recognize me.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Why not.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Trust me. They won't recognize me.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We'll trust you when we're rich. Why
dialog: not.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
text: Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I give you the wrong information,
dialog: you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't
dialog: know your damn map. So you can either
dialog: find a way to get me in there... or
dialog: you can shoot me right now.
text: A WAITRESS comes over, drops their check on the table. It
text: rests near Rudy. Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel.
text: And pushes the check his way.
scene_heading: EXT. SNOWY HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The "Motor City Monster" RUMBLES along a two-lane blacktop.
text: Across barren Michigan tundra. A sign reads "You Are Now
dialog: Entering Powahachee Indian Lands. No Littering."
scene_heading: INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT
text: Gabriel drives, with Ashley beside him. Rudy sits in the
text: sleeper, Jumpy sitting guard.
text: OUT THE WINDOW
text: they pass a brightly neon-lit building, with a parking lot
text: full of cars. The Tomahawk Casino, with a red neon axe
text: pointing the way.
text: And a marquee which reads: "10X ODDS ON CRAPS. $5.95 PRIME
scene_heading: RIB. PERFORMING TONIGHT: DAKOTA!"
text: The truck motors on by. Gabriel nods to Rudy:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Bring back some memories, Nick?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: More than you know.
scene_heading: EXT. KNIGHTS INN - NIGHT
text: A Midwestern castles-and-Camelot-themed chain hotel, amidst
text: an outcrop of roadside exit civilization: fast food and gas.
text: The Great Lakes Trucking rig parked in the hotel's lot.
scene_heading: INT. KNIGHTS INN - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Faux stonemasonry and torches. "Regal" purple carpets. Gabriel
dialog: and his crew escort Rudy into --
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM
text: -- his quarters. Jumpy marches Rudy to the bed, snaps a
text: handcuff around his ankle --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What the hell is this? What happened
dialog: to working together?
text: -- and snaps the other cuff to the bedframe.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Rather be back in the Mountain?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Might as well be.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Don't have Weather Channel in the
dialog: Mountain, Nick.
text: Gabriel tosses him a TV remote. Merlin rips the room's phone
text: out of the wall, takes it. They return to the hallway.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Sleep good, loverboy. Tomorrow you
dialog: got singing for your supper to do.
text: The truckers leave. Rudy tugs at his ankle cuff, sighs,
text: collapses back on the bed. Ashley has remained.
text: Rudy sits up, sees her.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get your own room.
text: She approaches instead. Sits beside. Gently:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He said he wanted to talk to you.
dialog: When he found the letters... he said
dialog: "when your boyfriend gets out, I
dialog: wanna talk to him." I thought he
dialog: meant back in Detroit. I thought he
dialog: meant --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: But you knew why. Knew why, didn't
dialog: ya.
text: Ashley stands her ground, guilty.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I thought we'd have a few more days.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: For what? You to talk me into
dialog: "helping"? What, he promise you a
dialog: share of the winnings?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at
dialog: least gotten that --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick! He wants to know how to rob
dialog: it, and he'll leave you alone! That's
dialog: all he wants!
dialog: (breaking down)
dialog: I hate him, Nick... you know how...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: So get him outta your life. Get out
dialog: of Michigan. They got perfume counters
dialog: in Chicago, don't they?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Not without you.
text: She reaches to touch him. Rudy turns his back on her.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Since when do some trucker pals start
dialog: thinking big, anyway?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: They run routes mostly east, retail
dialog: stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows
dialog: some guys in New York, Miami, guys
text: he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides
dialog: 'em with his regular loads.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He working for them on this one?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No. He wants to be working for himself
dialog: someday.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: And I'm his ticket.
dialog: (considers)
dialog: What's the last place they took down?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Gabriel and his guys. What's the
dialog: last place they robbed?
text: Ashley frowns.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I don't think they've ever robbed
dialog: anything before. I think they've
dialog: just driven guns.
text: Rudy looks at her with new interest.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: They've never done a robbery?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: They're truck drivers.
text: For the first time in a long time... Rudy smiles.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Then they do need me, don't they.
dialog: They really need me...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: We're gonna get out of here, Nick.
dialog: We're gonna get out of this...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We? What "we"...
text: Rudy stares at her. The smile gone.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get your own room, Ashley.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get your own room.
text: Ashley pulls away, walks to the door. Turns back, wanting to
text: say something, but Rudy's not even looking her way.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd
dialog: have been gone. You'd have gotten on
dialog: that bus and stayed on it. And if
dialog: that's selfish, I am. If that's lying,
dialog: I'm a liar. But I been dealing with
dialog: fucked-up brother and his fucked-up
dialog: friends for a long time, and I was
dialog: stronger than him then and I'm
dialog: stronger than him now. 'Cause he
dialog: showed up for money. I showed up for
dialog: love.
dialog: (hard)
dialog: And if you're so ready to make me
dialog: your enemy... then what did you show
dialog: up for, Nick. What did you really
dialog: want... with me...
text: With a fiery look, she strides from the room.
text: Rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. Checks the end
text: table, finds a Bible and a deck of cards.
text: Out his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking
dialog: lot.
text: Rudy watches as a Chevy Blazer parks and two drunk FISHERMEN
text: get out. The truck's bumper sticker reads "Ice Fishermen Do
dialog: It All Year Long."
text: Rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. He

speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: GABRIEL

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: At least gimme video poker.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Shut the fuck up. You play what your

dialog: to know the run of the place.
text: Rudy examines his new hair and cowboy gear.
speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Y'know what, guys? I woke up this
dialog: morning, I got a really lucky feeling

dialog: and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't
dialog: even have to --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Get out.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS
text: Rudy stamps feet, shivering in the cold, as Merlin unlocks

speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Get your goddamn hands off me --
text: She edges toward Rudy, then stops. A chill still there.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You got one hour.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm gonna need some money.
text: Gabriel hands a bill.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ten dollars? What do I do with ten

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Don't tip.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Monster. If we're working together
dialog: here, we gotta be working together.
dialog: I can't walk in there looking like
dialog: the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten
dialog: bucks to throw down. You don't want

dialog: noticed costs a guy at least a couple
dialog: hundred.
text: Gabriel glares, turns to his crew. Mutters, rubs his fingers

scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY
text: The cascade of JINGLING and JANGLING COINS fills the brightly

text: suggest a rustic theme, but the neon slots, lush green tables
text: and red wheels of fortune are pure Midwest Vegas.
text: The Tomahawk is tiny by Nevada standards, about the size of
text: a large bingo hall. This morning, about FIFTY GAMBLERS mill
dialog: about.

speaker_heading: ON FULL SCENE
text: An office overlooking the casino floor through smoked glass.
text: JACK BANGS, late 50's, silver-hair, capped teeth, shark suit

speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: There's an S-word I'd really like to

dialog: they got laws against the stuff.
dialog: They got Egypt down there, right,

speaker_heading: JACK BANGS

speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
text: The Paiutes, they cook their books.
speaker_heading: OLD GOVERNOR
dialog: The Waitela reservation made seventeen

speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: (sobers)
dialog: Seventeen?
speaker_heading: OLD GOVERNOR
dialog: Perhaps you have researched this,
dialog: Mr. Bangs. Is the snowfall on our
dialog: side of the lake that much greater
dialog: than the snowfall on theirs?
text: Jack Bangs stares at them both. Considers his next move --
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: I'm bringing in this great showroom

speaker_heading: YOUNG GOVERNOR

speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Guys. We're doing it right, here.
dialog: $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in

speaker_heading: YOUNG GOVERNOR
dialog: The tribe is concerned that many of

speaker_heading: OLD GOVERNOR
dialog: Like the Paiutes and the Waitela.
text: The young man stands, stares Jack Bangs in the eye.
speaker_heading: YOUNG GOVERNOR
dialog: We want you doing the job... that we
dialog: brought you here to do.
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK - DAY
text: Rudy and Ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket
text: of quarters. Rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two
text: SECURITY GUARDS punch a code in a private door, step inside:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: So does it look a lot different?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's
dialog: the main expansion. Tables've been
text: moved around; the big man's office,
dialog: I dunno, might be upstairs now.
text: They settle at a slot machine. Another SECURITY GUARD walks
text: past them. Rudy turns his back. Ashley notices.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: That guy knows you?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
text: At the door, Merlin and Jumpy enter, wandering through the
dialog: slots.
text: Rudy sees them.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You start spending your brother's
dialog: money. I'm gonna take a circuit around
dialog: the joint, check for any new ins and
dialog: outs. I'll snag us some drinks.
text: As he strides away --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (sotto)
dialog: Be careful, Nick...
scene_heading: MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO
text: with Rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking
text: out the layout. In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS.
text: Passing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian
text: governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors
text: turn their backs an him and storm out.
text: ARRIVING AT THE BAR
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Couple rum and Cokes, please.
speaker_heading: INDIAN BARTENDER
dialog: You want that rum and Coke or rum
dialog: and Pepsi?
text: Rudy gives him a strange look. The bartender shrugs. Rudy
text: still scans the tables, settling on --
scene_heading: A BLACKJACK TABLE
text: where a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips. One of
text: them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans.
dialog: Rudy studies this kid for moment.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS (O.S.)
dialog: Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything.
text: BACK AT THE BAR
text: Jack Bangs sidles up, distraught. The barkeep hands him a
text: bottle. Bangs takes a swig.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: I can't go back to Vegas, Bear.
dialog: They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I
dialog: can't go back...
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: What does the tribe want?
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: They want gold-paved roads is what
dialog: they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin'
dialog: Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the
dialog: interstate. Nothing I can do about
dialog: that, man, I didn't pick the spot
dialog: for your reservation.
speaker_heading: BARTENDER
dialog: Neither did we.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Yeah, yeah, whatever.
text: Rudy gets his drinks, as Jack Bangs turns his way:
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run
dialog: the place. Nice to have you in the
dialog: Tomahawk. Tell me something...
text: Rudy winces, glancing to see Merlin and Jumpy watching him.
text: Frowns on their faces.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: ...does upstate Michigan need another
dialog: roadside casino or does upstate
dialog: Michigan need an international gaming
dialog: destination?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (wants outta here)
dialog: Roadside casino?
text: Jack Bangs, smile falls flat.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Well, so how'd you hear about this
dialog: place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass
dialog: mailings? Cable TV?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Prison.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Prison?!
text: Rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. Bangs looks
text: sick, turns to a FAT GUY on the next stool over. But before
text: he can ask, the guy shakes his head --
speaker_heading: FAT GUY
dialog: I just stopped in to use the can.
text: Bangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands:
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I
dialog: can't...
text: From the slots, we hear a JACKPOT PAYOFF.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Aw fuck.
text: THROUGH THE TABLES
text: walks Rudy, as Merlin sidles up next to him:
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: What the hell was that about --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He didn't recognize me. Back off,
dialog: willya? He didn't recognize me.
text: Merlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots.
text: As he nears Ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where
text: the College Kid has left... heading for the bathroom --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents!
text: -- and as a barely-dressed COCKTAIL WAITRESS crosses between
text: Rudy and Ashley, blocking her view of him --
text: Rudy pretends to crash into her, splashing the rum and Coke
dialog: into his own face --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Heyyyy!
text: Reaching Ashley, his goatee is dripping --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, what happened --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: There went my... damn... well, doesn't

dialog: switched... Ash, shit, this mustache
dialog: is starting to fall off. I gotta fix
dialog: this thing --
dialog: (hands her his glass)
dialog: -- drink this for me.
text: He hustles for the bathroom. A moment later, Jumpy storms
dialog: by.
text: Stops at Ashley.
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: What happened?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: He started losing his hair.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO BATHROOM - DAY
text: The College Kid is zipping up when Rudy SLAMS into his back,
text: money in hand, crashing him against the wall:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hundred bucks to wear this jacket --
speaker_heading: COLLEGE KID
dialog: Jesus, man, don't kill me!
speaker_heading: RUDY

scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK SAME

speaker_heading: WAITRESS

text: charging for the bathroom.
scene_heading: INT. BATHROOM
text: As Merlin crashes in, seeing the cowboy hat and jacket, back
text: turned, adjusting a belt. As the figure turns around.
text: It's the College Kid. Merlin stops in his tracks --
text: -- as Rudy CRASHES into him from a stall, kicking his legs
text: out, driving his throat into a countertop. Merlin hits the
text: ground, gagging. Rudy wears the kid's sweatshirt:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: GO! GO!
text: The College Kid, shaking, hustles out the door.
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK - CONTINUOUS
text: As the College Kid, in Rudy's black getup, strides out of
text: the bathroom hall, walking for the casino exit.
text: From the slots, Ashley and Jumpy glance up, seeing him go.
text: From their vantage, it looks like Rudy. They frown.
text: As they're watching the Kid hit the door, Rudy darts out of
text: the hall, heads the other way.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA
text: Gabriel and Pug sit sentry, seeing the cowboy figure leave

speaker_heading: COLLEGE KID
dialog: (scared shitless)
dialog: Oh man. It's your jacket, isn't it...
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK

dialog: MEDIUM RARE?! You call this MEDIUM

text: Running for a thicket of winter woods.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Merlin and Jumpy stride out to join Gabriel and Pug. Ashley
text: follows, stumbling to keep up.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Where the HELL did he go?
speaker_heading: MERLIN

speaker_heading: GABRIEL

scene_heading: EXT. SNOWY MEADOW - DAY
text: Rudy races as best he can through the waves of snow. He keeps

speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: Nick! Run! RUN!!!
text: Rudy turns back to see Merlin, Jumpy and Pug round into view

scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS - ON CHASE - DAY
text: Rudy darts among barren oaks and brush pines, crunching deeper

text: -- as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the treeline. Gaining but
text: struggling too. With guns held.
text: Rudy keeps battling through the drifts --
text: -- as GUNSHOTS start to ring out. Rudy glances back to rest;
text: the truckers are a hundred yards distant. But as he turns to
text: struggle on, treebark SPLITS apart beside him.
text: Rudy keeps running.
scene_heading: INT. NOVA
text: Bouncing over a snowy dirt road, having found a shortcut

scene_heading: EXT. WOODS

speaker_heading: MERLIN (O.S.)
dialog: Wherever you run... we'll get there.
dialog: Fast as you want... we'll be there.
dialog: We drive for a living, Nick. Twelve,
dialog: fifteen, twenty-hour days.
text: Rudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush
text: away his footprints. Realizes it's useless.
text: A BULLET whistles through the pine branches.
speaker_heading: MERLIN (O.S.)
dialog: We got nothing but time.
text: Rudy takes a breath, crashes onward --
text: -- then stops at the sound of a RUMBLING. Getting louder.
text: Closer. It's a car's engine.
text: Rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out
text: a snow-covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale.
text: Another BULLET smashes treebark. Rudy runs for it.
scene_heading: EXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY
text: As Rudy leaps out to wave down the car, as around the corner
dialog: comes a Chevy Nova --
text: -- with Gabriel and Ashley inside. Gabriel's eyes widen, he

text: Rudy scampers toward the opposite roadside, a steep wooded
text: slope cradling a meadow and frozen river --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No!!!
text: -- as Ashley grabs Gabriel's steering wheel, swerving the
dialog: other way. Gabriel fights her for control --
text: -- as the Nova just misses Rudy, who dives off the road,
text: hits the slope and tumbles head-over-heels toward its bottom,
text: a hundred feet down, kicking up geysers of snow!
text: On the road, the Nova skids to a stop. Ashley and Gabriel
text: leap out, as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug reach the road.
text: AT THE SLOPE'S BOTTOM
text: Rudy pops to his feet, a dazed snowball.
text: BACK UP AT THE ROAD
text: Gabriel grabs a rifle from the Nova, steps to the slope-top
dialog: edge and takes aim --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: RUN!!!
text: -- as Ashley suddenly slams into him from behind --
text: Sending the both of them tumbling down the slope! Sliding
text: and tangled, the rifle flying from Gabriel's grasp --
text: TO THE BOTTOM
text: -- where they come to a tangled, snowy halt. Gabriel struggles
dialog: to clear the ice from his face --
text: -- as the butt of his rifle cracks him in the jaw.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: That's for reading her mail.
text: He extends a hand to Ashley --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Come on.
text: -- and hauls her to her feet. Ashley beams. As Gabriel howls,
text: the two of them scramble away from the woods, Rudy with the
text: rifle, toward the meadow and its frozen pond.
text: More GUNSHOTS ring as Merlin, Jumpy and Pug slide their way
text: down the ravine.
scene_heading: EXT. FROZEN RIVER - CONTINUOUS
text: Rudy and Ashley race out across the ice. The traction's
text: slippery, but there's no way around. There's a highway bridge
text: two hundred yards away, with sparse truck traffic.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We get to the bridge, we're all right!
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, the ice is --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get to the bridge!
dialog: (waving at traffic)
text: HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE!
text: He grips her hand tighter, as SHOTS crash into the ice at
text: their feet. Suddenly, the ground splinters and gives way --
text: -- and Ashley goes plummeting through to the river! She
text: vanishes from sight in an instant!
text: Rudy scrambles back, onto sturdy ice. He stares, stunned, at
text: the ripples in the freezing water.
text: Ashley's not coming up.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: Looks to the truckers in pursuit. Coming down the ridge.
text: Then the highway. Safety within sight.
text: But he can't run. Cursing himself, he grips the rifle tightly
text: and LEAPS into the ice-hole --
scene_heading: EXT. RIVER BENEATH THE ICE
text: -- plummeting underwater, the temperature hitting his body
text: like needles. He writhes, spinning around --
text: -- and sees Ashley ten yards away, desperately pounding at
text: the ice above her. Strength giving out.
text: Rudy struggles to her, wrapping an arm around her. She fights,
text: panicked, clawing at the ice, both of them pulled further
text: away from the opening.
text: With Ashley safely in hand, Rudy raises his rifle-arm,
text: pressing the barrel against the ice above them --
text: -- and FIRES. A HOLE blasts a shaft of light into the gray-
text: blue. Rudy FIRES again. Another HOLE caves in. Ashley reaches
dialog: for a sheath of ice, splashing --
text: TO THE SURFACE
text: -- clutching frozen ground, treading water. Rudy surfaces
text: beside her, the both of them gasping, facing the bridge.
text: Instinctively, they spin around --
text: TO FIND GABRIEL, MERLIN, JUMPY AND PUG
text: -- standing right behind them. Guns trained.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (rubs his jaw)
dialog: At the rate you're going, Nick...
dialog: I'm gonna have a hard time ever

text: The trailer doors swing open, crashing harsh light upon him.
text: He squints into the light, shivering madly.

dialog: Pa-rum-pum-pum-pum.
scene_heading: INT. KNIGHTS INN GAME ROOM - DAY
text: Gabriel is hurling darts again, focused, expressionless.
dialog: Bullseye.
text: Merlin and Jumpy haul Rudy in. He collapses at Gabriel's
text: feet, unable to stand. Still trembling.
text: A couple KIDS scamper into the doorway --
speaker_heading: MERLIN
text: Game room's closed.
text: -- and Merlin slams the door in their face. Gabriel hurls
text: another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for
dialog: effort and an honorary degree. I'm
dialog: surprised you never escaped from the
dialog: Mountain.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (teeth chattering)
dialog: ...never... tried...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In
dialog: the spirit of the season, I'm going
dialog: to give you a chance. I understand
dialog: you're unhappy. Right outta the
dialog: lockup, here against your will, it's
dialog: the holidays and there's reruns on
dialog: TV.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So we're gonna have a contest.
text: Gabriel strides back to him, with two darts.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We're each going to get one of these.
dialog: Whichever one of us hits closer to
dialog: the bullseye... gets what he wants.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You land closer, you get Ashley.
dialog: And you guys get to go free. I land
dialog: closer... and we start getting your
dialog: help.
text: He lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's
text: fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to
dialog: wedge it in.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: May the best sportsman win.
text: Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his
text: dart. It thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Damn.
text: He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand,
text: trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering,
text: tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws --
text: -- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his
text: icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally
text: tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet.
text: Gabriel smiles, steps close.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Got something to say to me, Nick?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: ...ttt..tt... two out of three?
text: Gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward. Rudy CRASHES
text: into a chair, flanked by video games.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What'd you tell that casino manager?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nnn... nothing...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You were talking to him! What'd you
dialog: tell him!?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nothing... I promise-nothing...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: NO!
text: Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and
text: wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the
text: wall beside his ear.
text: He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third
text: HITS the wall by his chin.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He thought I was some gambler... he
dialog: didn't know me... he didn't recognize
dialog: me!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I been driving rigs a long time,
dialog: Nick. Four, five million miles of
dialog: road. Worked for people who wouldn't
dialog: keep me on less I was driving fifteen
dialog: hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep,
dialog: I needed rest, shit, they'll hire
dialog: someone else...
text: Gabriel flings another dart. Just misses Rudy's other ear.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: ...Dispatcher's screaming for me to
dialog: haul ass, he's got a load on the
dialog: runback for me. Shipper's making me
dialog: wait for the pickup, receiver's
dialog: bitching 'bout the count...
text: Another dart NAILS the wall, right through Rudy's hair.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: ...Got the cops at the bottom of
dialog: every mountain, got the DOT at the
dialog: top. And every day, every day, I see
dialog: all those faces in their little airbag
dialog: Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam-
text: faced kiddies, giving me that look
dialog: to go to hell and get off their happy
dialog: goddamn highway. Hey. They don't
dialog: gotta get two thousand miles by
dialog: sundown, or the gang don't eat come
dialog: sunrise.
text: Gabriel strides to Rudy, sitting stock-still, his head ringed
text: by darts. Stares him down.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: It's time for me... to be working
dialog: for me. I want mine, Nick. And I
dialog: need you.
dialog: (frightening calm)
dialog: Did you tell your manager there's
dialog: gonna be a robbery?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No, Gabriel... no...
text: Gabriel pulls the darts free. Backs away again.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: ...he... he asked me... how I'd heard
dialog: about his place... he didn't know it
dialog: was me...
text: GABRIEL RAISES A DART TO THROW
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
dialog: ME!
text: -- and then lowers it. Believing he's gotten a reprieve,
text: Rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Man, Monster... just... just don't
dialog: start trying to hit me...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Nick. I been trying to hit you.
text: Gabriel rears back and WHISTLES another dart. It plugs into
text: Rudy's chest. Rudy screams. Gabriel FIRES another, skewering
text: him in the ribs. Then a third, fourth and fifth.
text: Rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. Five
text: darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering
text: and spreading rivulets of blood.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Maybe that'll help sharpen your
dialog: memory.
text: Gabriel stalks close.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Tonight we're gonna take another
dialog: look at that map. And this time you're
dialog: gonna tell me what I need to know.
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM - DAY
text: Rudy gets hurled inside by Merlin and Jumpy. He hits the
text: floor beside the bed, where Ashley sits prisoner. Pug sits
text: guard, watching "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" on TV.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick! Jesus, Nick --
text: She falls to his side. Merlin cuffs Rudy's ankle again to
text: the bedframe. He and Jumpy head out --
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Pug.
text: Pug's engrossed in the cartoon. They're singing in Whoville.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
speaker_heading: PUG!
text: Pug snaps to. Shuts off the TV, spits some chaw on the floor
text: and gone. Rudy and Ashley are left alone.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, oh my God, what'd he do to
dialog: you? What'd he do?
text: She touches his bloodied chest. Rudy winces badly.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He had some points to make...
text: Ashley helps pull his shirt off, sees the wounds:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move,
dialog: stay right here --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (near-delirium)
dialog: All I wanted... was to make it home...
dialog: for a little of Dad's turkey, and
dialog: Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's
dialog: acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry
dialog: buns...
text: Ashley has leapt to the bathroom. She brings wet washcloths
dialog: back to clean and dress --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: We'll get there, baby... we'll get
dialog: there...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in
dialog: five whole years...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick.
dialog: You haven't had cranberry buns in
dialog: two years.
text: She kisses him softly. Rudy meets her eyes. Staring to get
dialog: his bearings back...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You saved my life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You could have run, but you didn't.
dialog: You saved me.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You saved me.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I saved you because I love you, Nick.
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Why'd you save me?
text: Rudy studies her hopeful face, attending to his wounds. still
text: weak and distant:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Guy I was in with... car thief... I
dialog: used to read your letters to him. I
dialog: know they were private... I know,
dialog: but... you spend twenty-four hours a
dialog: day with somebody, you gotta talk,
dialog: y'know? You gotta share. Or the room
text: gets even smaller.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: And sometimes, I'd be reading them,
text: and he'd close his eyes, get a smile
dialog: on his face... and I'd know somewhere
dialog: inside he was pretending you were
dialog: writing to him -- He'd see your face,
dialog: your pictures on the wall...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Some nights I think he fell in love
dialog: with you, too.
text: Rudy touches a hand to her hair.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You gave a couple guys hope, Ashley.
dialog: And with hope, there ain't nothing
dialog: you can't survive.
text: Ashley stares, touched, still kneading the cloth into his
dialog: chest.
text: Rudy struggles up, his face level with hers. She kisses him
text: tenderly. Lingering.
text: And this time Rudy responds, mouth seeking, working down her
dialog: neck.
text: Her eyes flutter closed.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Don't say my name...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I love you, Nick...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
text: Ashley hesitates. Carefully strokes his chest. He's still
text: kissing her, softly, still somewhat delirious.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (a small frown)
dialog: I love you...
text: As he returns to her lips, mouths joining. Ashley's eyes
text: close again, as they fold into each other...
text: ...and move slowly, tenderly, back to the floor.
scene_heading: EXT. KNIGHTS INN HOTEL - DUSK
text: A bitter cold sunset. Through a room's window, Rudy and Ashley
text: lie tangled in sheets on the carpet.
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM
text: Ashley nestles against him. Rudy stares skyward. Hard.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: They'll have guns.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You said they've run guns, in their
dialog: trucks. So they'll have guns. To do
dialog: this robbery. They'll have serious
dialog: guns.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I don't know...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We'll need one.
text: Ashley frowns. There's a new look in Rudy's eyes.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm going to have to be inside that
dialog: casino. When it happens. I'll need
dialog: to be part of it. I can't just be
text: drawing some map.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick, what are you talking about?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We need to find a way to make me
text: part of it.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Part of... with them?
text: Rudy meets her eyes.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: If we're helping them with their
dialog: robbery, we're gonna be doing more
dialog: than just walking away. Like that's
dialog: some Christmas bonus.
text: He nods, scheming the way he's always known.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You want him outta your life? You
dialog: want a real New Year to look forward
dialog: to?
dialog: (bravely)
dialog: If we're gonna do this... we're gonna
dialog: do it to get it all.
scene_heading: INT. KNIGHTS INN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
text: A medieval-themed biergarten. A happy FAMILY of five sits at
text: a booth, singing along to "Good King Wencelas."
text: In the booth beside, Merlin and Pug are holding court.
text: Merlin's puffing smoke rings. Pug watches dully, chewing:
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten
dialog: packs a day like you. His lungs got
dialog: so black they couldn't find 'em with
text: an x-ray.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: That right? Shit. I used to run rigs
dialog: for a guy loved your chaw there.
dialog: Shit rotted out his tongue, had to
dialog: build him one outta silicon so the
dialog: poor boy could talk. You ever see a
dialog: motherfucker with a silicon fucking
dialog: tongue?
text: The Happy Family stops singing. Pug considers, spits a wad.
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: Hell. The guy from Joliet, those
dialog: black-ass lungs were the least of
dialog: his problems. Got so much smoke in
text: him his lungs couldn't even hold it.
dialog: Got into his system, man. Into his
text: blood. Coming out his ears, man,
text: coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking
text: the row, smoke'd be puffing out his
dialog: skin.
text: The Happy Family trade discomfited looks. Merlin shrugs,
text: takes another drag.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: This trucker? Met a girl in a bar
dialog: one night, she didn't know his
text: situation. He's drunk, she's drunk,
dialog: they get to mackin' hot and heavy
text: and the woman swallows it. His tongue.
dialog: Sucks it right down.
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: My guy would walk into a room, set
dialog: off the goddamn sprinklers.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: His lips went next. You ever see
dialog: some silicon-fucking-lips?
text: The Happy Family flees their booth. Pug and Merlin glance
text: over. And grab their leftovers. Rifling the grub:
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: (with disgust)
dialog: Vegetarians...
text: Behind them, Gabriel and Jumpy file into the biergarten,
text: leading Rudy and Ashley to the booth. Meeting commenced.
text: Rudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first.
text: Gabriel throws down the casino map:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Start singing.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum-
dialog: pum-pum
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Sing it in pictures, Nick.
text: Rudy takes the map, glances at Ashley, and then takes charge.
text: For the first time, he's giving the orders:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What you gotta worry about first is
text: the guards. Place doesn't look much
dialog: richer than when I worked there, so
dialog: let's figure you're gonna have to
dialog: deal with ten of 'em. There'll be
text: two on the floor, walking the room,
text: that leaves eight up above. Eyes in
text: the sky. They see something up,
dialog: they're the ones who'll hit the silent
dialog: alarm and you're fucked.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: How do we take them out?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You gotta get someone upstairs.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: How do we do that?
text: Rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area:
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: Across from blackjack, there's a
text: security doorway. Keypad access.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: What's the code?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Uh... they change it every month. I
dialog: wouldn't know.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: If there's trouble on the floor,
dialog: you'll get security coming through.
dialog: what you gotta do, is get inside
dialog: that doorway once they do. You gotta
dialog: draw 'em out.
speaker_heading: PUG
text: Without having them hit the alarms.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I got an idea on that one. Once you're
dialog: up there, you gotta hold those guards
dialog: down till some backup can get there.
text: There's a security camera room that
dialog: videotapes everything. You've gotta
dialog: destroy every last one of those tapes.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: What about the money?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You lock down security, you move
dialog: behind the cage. You hit the Count
dialog: Room. There'll be a guy in there but
text: he's got no guns; room's accessed by
dialog: another code. Cashiers'll know it.
dialog: They'll have alarms.
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: What about the Powwow Safe?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: The Powwow Safe. The secret safe.
dialog: You said the manager's got a safe in
text: his office where he hides skim money.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs.
dialog: Uh. Here. Powwow Safe.
text: His confident manner wavers. Gabriel notices, narrows his
text: eyes. Rudy quickly grabs the map again:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: So. You're gonna need a man through
text: here, two men at the cage, one to
dialog: cover the count. You're gonna need a
text: lookout outside, a sweeper through
text: the back, and a gun guarding the
dialog: front.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You need six.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You need six.
text: Gabriel eyes him darkly.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: NO.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You go in with five, you're either
text: leaving an alarm free or an exit
dialog: free. Someone hits an alarm, you're
text: fucked. Someone gets to a phone,
dialog: gets outside, 'cross the street,
dialog: whatever, you're fucked. You need
dialog: six.
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Six is me.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You guys get caught, I go away for
dialog: good. I got an interest in making
dialog: sure you don't. You need a sixth man
dialog: covering an exit. What're you gonna
dialog: do about it.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Yeah. What're you gonna do about it.
text: She puts an arm around Rudy, smiles. That's her man.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I want a map of that security level.
dialog: Every room, every guard, every thing.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: Six men means six guns.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm no threat without a gun.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: No, you're not.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: There'll be people in that casino.
dialog: I can't keep them from leaving if I
dialog: don't get a gun. I don't need bullets,
dialog: Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What's the matter, Gabriel? This is
dialog: what you wanted him for, isn't it?
text: Gabriel's eyes don't leave Rudy's.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: No gun.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Well. What you guys have to plan
dialog: out, then... is how you're going to
dialog: get to that cage and that security
dialog: level before anybody realizes
dialog: anything's wrong. Running in with
dialog: ski masks and bullets flying ain't
dialog: gonna do it.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: That part, Nick... was planned out
dialog: the day I read your letters.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What. We all gonna dress up like
dialog: cowboys?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
text: Gabriel smiles.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Not on Christmas Eve.
scene_heading: INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - TRAILER - NIGHT CLOSE ON STORAGE LOCKER
text: Pulled open to reveal FIVE SANTA CLAUS SUITS, hanging side-
text: by-side. Red polyester coats and pants, white felt trim and

scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL TRAILER
text: As Gabriel lifts a Santa Claus suit and presses it against
text: Rudy. Ashley, Merlin, Jungy and Pug look on.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You gotta be kidding me.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: 'Tis the season, convict.
text: He puts the suit back in the locker, pulls another. Finding
dialog: Rudy's size.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Can't be attracting attention, right?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: What, we walking in there and
dialog: delivering toys?
text: He turns to see Merlin open another locker. This one stacked
text: with rifles, carbines and handguns.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Hell yeah.
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT
scene_heading: CLOSE ON SKETCH
text: of a floor plan, a sheet of paper overlaid on Gabriel's map
text: of the casino. A pencil draws a boxy room and labels it
text: "Security Video Room." Then an eraser wipes it out.
scene_heading: WIDEN TO REVEAL RUDY
text: still cuffed to the bedframe, pulled close to a desk. He's
text: sitting, working on the security level map.
text: The door opens; Ashley enters, looking worried:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He wants to see your map.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm almost done.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He says he wants it now.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: If he wanted a photographic memory,
dialog: he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working
dialog: on it here.
text: Ashley walks over, puts her arms around his neck. Whispers:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: How are we gonna do this, Nick?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You're the getaway girl. The money's
dialog: gonna get to you eventually. Gonna
dialog: be my job to be the guy who walks
dialog: outta there with it. But I can't do
dialog: that without a gun. Any luck talking
dialog: to him?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Bullets or no bullets, he won't do
dialog: it.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Is there any way you could get into
dialog: his truck?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
text: Rudy studies his map, then quickly pencils in the "Security
dialog: Video Room," in a totally different place than he drew it
text: before. Hands the paper to her.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Here's the Picasso. Is he in his
dialog: room?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: They all are. Football's on.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (nods, thinks)
dialog: Keep 'em there for a little while.
text: Ashley takes the map, frowns. Rudy kisses her gently.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We're gonna get you out of Detroit,
dialog: Ash. Get you out of beauty and
text: fragrances.
dialog: (smiles, then)
dialog: Remember that. After all this is
dialog: over, when you know me, when you
dialog: really know me... remember it was
dialog: me.
text: She searches his eyes, not quite understanding. But smiles.
text: Rudy smiles back, nods toward the door. Ashley slips out.
text: When she's gone, Rudy stands and turns to the window. Outside,
text: the Blazer with the "Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long" bumper
text: sticker still sits parked.
text: Rudy reaches for his jeans pocket, and pulls out-one of the
text: game room darts, flecked with blood.
text: HE GIVES IT A SOLEMN STARE
scene_heading: INT. RUDYS ROOM - MOMENTS L&amp;TER - NIGHT
text: Rudy lies on his back, under the bed frame, dart in hand. He
text: tears off the plastic feathering, to get at the cross-shaped
text: end, furthest-from the tip. Four protruding metal edges.
text: He finds the Phillips screws on the bedframe, and tries to
text: work the dart-end into the grooves. It scrapes and jags, but
text: with pressure he's able to do a quarter-turn at a time.
text: The screw starts spiraling out.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON BEDFRAME
text: As two metal pieces split apart, and Rudy wriggles his ankle
text: handcuff off the frame.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON CLOSET
text: As Rudy's hand grabs a paper-covered wire hanger and rips
text: the paper off, untwisting the wire.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON ROOM'S WINDOW
text: As Rudy slides it open, and climbs outside.
scene_heading: EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Light snow falling. Rudy drops from the second floor window
text: into some snowy shrubs and an empty parking space. He
text: stealthily darts ahead to the ice fishermen's Blazer.
scene_heading: AT THE FISHERMEN'S BLAZER
text: Rudy peers in the windows, spotting fishing rods, tackle and
text: gear boxes in the back seat.
text: He takes his wire coat hanger, now stretched straight, and
text: slips it between the driver's window and moulding, jamming
text: it around until it trips the door lock.
text: The lock pops up; Rudy pops in --
scene_heading: INT. BLAZER
text: -- and raids the gear box. Bait, reels, fishing wire. Boning
text: knives. A compass. A first aid kit. A switchblade.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Gun, gun, c'mon, boys like you gotta
dialog: be keeping a gun...
text: He rustles around in the backseat. Ice cooler, open bag of
text: pork rinds, another gear box. Nothing.
text: Some HEADLIGHTS sweep past the Blazer. Rudy ducks down,
text: pockets the switchblade. Munches some pork rinds.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Rudy scrambles out, heads to try another car, a pickup truck.
text: And then suddenly drops to the ground, seeing
scene_heading: MERLIN AND JUMPY
text: stride outside, talking casually, kicking snow on their way
text: toward the Nova. Voices too low to hear.
speaker_heading: ON SCENE
text: Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.
text: Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.
text: Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars,
text: heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances
text: back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem
text: to. They stand at the Nova, talking.
text: Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs
text: turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building.
text: He slips around the corner, out of sight.
text: AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL
text: Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving
text: toward a side entry --
text: -- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.
text: Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling
text: water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this
dialog: wall.
text: Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.
text: Rudy stands absolutely still. His breaths stop frosting.
text: Because his breathing has stopped.
scene_heading: INT. HALLLWAY TO INDOOR POOL - NIGHT
text: Rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads
text: "Pool CLOSED. Open 9 am to 9 pm, No Lifeguard on Duty."
text: Rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. The
text: small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. From an
text: unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view --
text: It's Ashley. Hair wet, naked beneath the surface. Smiling
text: and splashing someone offscreen --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: ...and he's saying "We're not gonna
dialog: help him just to walk away. If we're
dialog: gonna help him... we're gonna get it
dialog: all...
text: She splashes again. Taunting --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: ...he wants to help now, he wants to
dialog: rob it now we could probably stay
dialog: right here, he'd go on and rob it by
dialog: himself --
text: As Gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward

speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: He wants the money.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: No, baby. He wants me.
text: Gabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. She smiles.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: He wants... your "sister"...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: ...whoever she is.
text: And they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples.
text: A steamy embrace.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Nick Mason's gonna help us more than
dialog: we ever dreamed.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON RUDY
text: in the shadows, hearing them. Staring into darkness.
speaker_heading: IN THE POOL
text: Gabriel turns with Ashley, wrapped together. Moving slow.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: All those letters are about to pay
dialog: off, baby... all those letters...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: To all those cons...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Searching for a money man...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: We musta written what, twenty of
dialog: 'em? And they were before this guy.
dialog: One, two letters apiece, ten to the
dialog: racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: -- till he fucked his parole --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: -- plus the forty to Mason... how
dialog: many letters is that?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: That's a book, baby.
dialog: (presses closer)
dialog: That's a book of love.
text: They kiss again. Gabriel strokes her wet hair:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I can't take watching you touch him.
dialog: I can't take his hands on you.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: One more day, baby. One more day to
dialog: Christmas.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I've been doing good, though.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Didn't have to hit me so fucking
dialog: hard. Didn't have to throw me outta
dialog: the goddamn truck.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Didn't have to send me down a fucking
dialog: mountain.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What, he should see me help you catch
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: ON RUDY
text: still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY (O.S.)
dialog: He's shown us the setup, he's drawn
dialog: us the map, he's helped us do the
dialog: plan. He wants a gun, give him a
dialog: gun. Take the bullets out, whatever,
dialog: but give him the gun. The more
dialog: manpower we've got in there, the
dialog: better. He won't try and make his
dialog: move till the money's in hand.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (O.S.)
dialog: He'll be dead when he does.
text: BACK IN THE POOL
text: Gabriel and Ashley rock slowly, coupled, in the water.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Y'know something, baby? If you were
dialog: my sister? I'd still want to wake up
dialog: Christmas morning with you...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be
dialog: the tinsel round your tree...
text: And as their words turn to moans and murmurs...
text: IN THE SHADOWS
text: Rudy is gone.
scene_heading: INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Rudy strides a corridor, eyes dead ahead, passing a stairwell
text: on his way toward the "Exit" sign posted above a door. He's
text: almost there, marching fast --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Here's my present to you, truck
dialog: drivers --
scene_heading: AS THE EXIT DOOR OPENS
speaker_heading: MERLIN (O.S.)
dialog: Where the hell's Gabriel?
text: -- and Rudy dives to the stairwell, out of sight just as
text: Merlin and Jumpy stride back inside.
speaker_heading: JUMPY
text: With his girlfriend. Making up for
dialog: "Nick" time. I'm going down to the
dialog: bar, you want something?
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Get me a brew. I'm gonna check on
dialog: our convict.
text: They separate, Jumpy down the hall, Merlin to the stairs --
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
text: Merlin trudges upward, while Rudy steps from hiding one flight
dialog: down.
text: Checks the hall for Jumpy, then races out --
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Rudy slams out the side door, scrambling straight for the
text: same Blazer. He jimmies the lock again, leaps in, tears free
text: the engine panel and searches for ignition wires like a pro.
text: Stripping the plastic, trying to spark contact --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Catch, dammit, catch! Like riding a
dialog: bike, it's like riding a bike!
text: But there's nothing. The engine won't start.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRWELL
text: Merlin reaches the second floor, steps into the hall.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Rudy jumps from the Blazer, looks at the lot, the highway,
text: the woods. His own footprints in the dusting snow.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: How far you gonna get, Rudy...
text: Realizing the answer, Rudy looks to his room's window. Forced
text: to race back. He tries clambering the wall, standing an
text: shrubbery, but he can't reach. He whirls, desperate.
text: And his eyes find the Blazer.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
text: Merlin ambles the corridor. Approaching Rudy's room.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Rudy flings open the Blazer door, slams the emergency brake
text: down. Forces the gearshift into "Reverse."
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
text: Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the
dialog: key.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding
text: on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front
dialog: bumper.
text: The wheels start to move.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
text: Merlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle
text: but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: My room.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs
text: ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space
text: below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up
text: speed, rolling on its own.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
text: Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his
text: feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper,
text: the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof --
dialog: -- getting two roof-steps worth of running start --
text: -- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs --
text: -- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right
text: through the window to his room --
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM
text: -- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a
text: somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet.
scene_heading: INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL
text: The key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash --
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM
text: -- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly
text: on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe.
text: Spreading a deck of cards out before him.
text: Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hey.
text: Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The
text: window's open. Rudy continues his card game.
text: Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut.
text: Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard,
text: heart pounding. The cards go flying.
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks
text: outside... and stops still. In parking lot...
text: ...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's
dialog: seat. It's Merlin. Now watching.
text: Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches
text: the falling snow. Caged again, after all.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
text: Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back
dialog: in.
text: Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket
text: over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My
dialog: love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve...
text: Ashley closes her eyes. With a smile.
text: A moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her
text: smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare...
scene_heading: INT. KNIGHTS INN LOBBY - DAY
scene_heading: CLOSE ON DESK CLERK
text: In a elfin cap, smiling cheerfully:
scene_heading: SMILING DESK CLERK
dialog: Hello, gentlemen. And how can we
dialog: help you on this holiday morning?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON GABRIEL, MERLIN AND PUG
text: Three grim faces.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: Checking out.
scene_heading: EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY
text: The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards
text: Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their
text: car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces
dialog: overnight.
text: Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut.
dialog: Rudy hits the snow --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Gabriel!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: That's for the hundred bucks worth
dialog: of pay-per-view.
dialog: (then KICKS him)
dialog: And that's for the two hundred you
dialog: took outta your minibar.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (chokes, pained)
dialog: You guys were paying for the room, I
dialog: just figured --
text: Gabriel KICKS him again, then pulls a handgun, points it at
text: Rudy's head. Ashley screams, rushes him --
text: -- as Gabriel's gun SHOOTS a thin stream of water into Rudy's
dialog: face.
text: It's a forty-five caliber squirt gun.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (cruel smile)
dialog: You wanted a weapon, convict? You
dialog: got one.
text: Gabriel tosses the water pistol onto Rudy's chest. Jumpy and
text: Pug haul him up. With venom:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Merry Christmas-Eve.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The Motor City Monster cruises the snowy landscape, with
text: Lake Superior beyond. Pug drives the Nova in convoy.
scene_heading: INT. GABRIEL'S RIG
text: Gabriel hands copies of Rudy's sketched map to Merlin and
dialog: Jumpy.
text: Rudy and Ashley are in the sleeper.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Commit this thing to memory. Every
dialog: guard, every exit... don't tape it
dialog: to your fuckin, wrist: remember it.
dialog: That's the Gospel right there. The
dialog: Gospel. Matthew, Mark, Luke and
dialog: John...
text: Rudy watches them studying his made-up map. Ashley strokes
text: his arm, gives a loving smile. Rudy stares at her.
text: He smiles right back.
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
text: The rig and the Nova blow by a roadsign: "Now Entering
dialog: Powahachee Indian Reservation Lands."
scene_heading: INT./EXT. TRAILER DAY - PREPARATION MONTAGE
text: The storage locker with the Santa suits SLAMS open.
text: Merlin's hands PULL automatics and shotguns from the weapons
text: chest. Pug's hands UNLOAD ammo.
text: A red-and-white Santa coat gets PULLED ON and BUTTONED UP.
text: Jumpy's hands apportion GUNS and AMMO on a picnic table.
text: Black Santa boots STAMP TIGHT in the snow.
text: A shoulder-strap ASSAULT RIFLE gets hidden under a Santa
dialog: coat.
text: AMMO CLIPS are taped inside a fat black buckle-belt.
text: A HANDGUN gets tucked under a Santa hat.
text: And the rig's trailer doors come CRASHING SHUT.
scene_heading: EXT. LAKESIDE REST AREA - DUSK
text: Lake Superior shimmers in the dying light. The rig's in the
text: empty rest area lot. On a nearby bank, four men in Santa
text: Claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic
text: tables, guns at their sides. Staring out at the lake.
speaker_heading: RUDY AND ASHLEY
text: sit apart from the rest. Rudy in a red suit, black boots,
text: cap in hand. Ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Where should we go, Nick? When we're
dialog: gone from here... where should we
dialog: go...
text: The Nova drives into the lot. Pug gets out, carrying several
text: fast-food bags. Hurrying to stay warm:
speaker_heading: PUG (O.S.)
dialog: Okay, who had the cheeseburger with
dialog: bacon; what about a roast beef, I've
dialog: got two roast beefs here --
speaker_heading: JUMPY (O.S.)
dialog: Cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine --
speaker_heading: MERLIN (O.S.)
dialog: I got a bacon too; there another
dialog: bacon in there?
speaker_heading: PUG (O.S.)
dialog: I got a bacon for him and a bacon
dialog: for me; there's four cheeseburgers
dialog: and two roast beefs --
speaker_heading: MERLIN (O.S.)
dialog: Somebody better give me something
dialog: with some goddamn bacon --
text: As they continue chow dispersal, Rudy stares over the lake.
text: Distant. Not even aware Ashley's there.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: This time right now... Dad's stacking
text: wood out back, getting ready for
dialog: tomorrow. Little blaze in the
text: fireplace. Mom's setting out the
text: good silver, hanging her cinammon
text: sticks, up in the doorways. Getting
text: out her scratchy old records...
dialog: singing along...
text: Rudy smiles to himself. He's got a faraway look.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I don't know where you're going.
dialog: But I'm going home.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: We go together, Nick. Wherever... we
dialog: go together. Remember?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Well. I'm going home.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: sits by the water, staring over the lake too. With a white
text: cotton Santa beard resting on his chin. He unwraps his roast
text: beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a
text: savage bite.
text: Munches away, stares to Rudy and Ashley. She meets his eyes.
text: Gabriel smiles. And looks again to the water.
speaker_heading: ON FULL SCENE
text: The snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. And the six figures
text: scattered, watching day turn to night...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - NIGHT
text: The neon axe lit up in full regalia, with Christmas lights
text: now strung along the building's roof. There are fewer than a
text: dozen cars in the parking lot.
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT
text: Filled with the JINGLING, JANGLING slots, but there's only
text: two FAT WOMEN sitting at them. Three INDIANS at a poker table.
text: An OLD TIMER in his 90's playing blackjack.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY LEVEL
text: A ragged headquarters, looking down to the casino level
text: through smoked glass. Desks, file cabinets, pin-up
text: centerfolds. A room with video monitors to one side. Stairs
text: to a camera catwalk that rings the casino.
text: Jack Bangs is at a table of wassail and cookies. He opens a
text: battle of brandy, pours a bit into the punch, and takes the
text: bottle for himself. Walks over to his HEAD OF SECURITY,
dialog: watching the lack of activity below:
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: And all through the house... not a
dialog: creature was stirring...
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: Why don't you go ahead and send most
dialog: of your guys home, Ed.
speaker_heading: SECURITY BOSS
dialog: Thanks, Jack. Merry X-mas.
text: The boss smiles, heads off. Jack Bangs swigs his brandy,
text: eyes his high-tech security gear glumly:
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Hell. Nobody even comes here to
dialog: cheat...
scene_heading: EXT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT
text: The Nova pulls into the lot and parks. Merlin, Pug and Ashley
text: inside. On the road, the Motor City Monster slows to an idling
text: stop. In the cab, Gabriel turns to Rudy and Jumpy:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Go.
text: Rudy gives Gabriel a withering look. He and Jumpy climb out.
text: Gabriel's rig rumbles up the road.
dialog: [NOTE: All five men, save Ashley, from now till story's end,
dialog: are in their Santa Claus suits.]
scene_heading: RUDY AND JUMPY
text: make their way across the lot, heading for the entrance.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hey Jumpy, I want to ask you
dialog: something. You have any problem with
dialog: the fact that we're on our way to
dialog: take millions of dollars from an
dialog: Indian casino?
text: The Native American considers. As they walk:
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Nick. It's true that Indian gaming's
dialog: gone a long way toward restoring
dialog: wealth and pride to communities who've
dialog: been economically isolated and
dialog: enslaved for centuries. Stronger
dialog: infrastructure, better schools, higher
dialog: employment... they're all the results
dialog: of reservation casino success stories.
dialog: Still, many natives believe that
dialog: these are temples to a godless
dialog: materialism and greed that will only
dialog: infect the souls of indigenous peoples
dialog: until their love of money has
dialog: destroyed the spiritual values their
dialog: ancestors died to protect and their
dialog: homelands have become no different
dialog: from any United States suburb,
dialog: satellite city or industrial park.
dialog: Destroying the Indian legacy once
dialog: and for all and leaving behind a
dialog: nation of selfish, angry natives, of
dialog: which I, it's true, am one --
text: -- as they hit the Tomahawk's doors --
scene_heading: INT. TOKAHAWK - NIGHT
text: -- and SLAM inside, stumbling into each other, suddenly
text: LAUGHING and slapping backs. Surveying the casino:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Hey-hey, egg nog for everybody!
text: Rudy spreads his Santa arms wide and whoops. Jumpy laughs
text: with him, steadying his balance. Drunken and slurred:
speaker_heading: RUDY
scene_heading: Let's win some MONEY! MONEY-MONEY-
speaker_heading: MONEY!
text: The few gamblers inside look up at the commotion. Bear the
text: Bartender. Two CASHIERS and one WAITRESS. Ed the Security
text: Boss strides over, smiling tightly:
speaker_heading: SECURITY BOSS
dialog: How you gentlemen doing tonight?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We're out of work tonight, that's
dialog: how! Christmas Eve! We're out of
dialog: work!
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: (shakes his hand)
dialog: Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's
dialog: with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas
dialog: the season...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We're all outta gifts, boys and girls,
dialog: but we got charitable donations!
text: Rudy grabs a wad of bills from his pocket, drops some to the
text: floor. Jumpy retrieves them --
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: ...bunch of us got together for the
dialog: union party. Hey, how late are you
dialog: open?
speaker_heading: SECURITY BOSS
dialog: (eyes on the money)
dialog: All night and all day.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I got wampum for the Cocktail Waitress
dialog: Civil Defense Fund! Are there any
dialog: representatives here present?
text: A Waitress sidles close; checks with the Boss. He nods okay.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: What can I get ya, Santa?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Santa drinks American beer.
speaker_heading: SECURITY BOSS
dialog: (to Jumpy)
dialog: What's your game, guys?
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Blackjack. Got a buddy from
text: Woolworth's out parking the sleigh.
text: The Security Boss stares him down. Then:
speaker_heading: SECURITY BOSS
dialog: Good luck, gentlemen.
text: He steps aside and indicates the tables. Jumpy claps him on
text: the back, pushes Rudy on through the slots.
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT
text: Gabriel's truck at the roadside, hazards on, with signal
text: triangles as if broken down. Gabriel places the last one,
text: hurries back down the casino road.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT/INT. NOVA - NIGHT
text: Ashley sits between Merlin and Pug. Gabriel jogs by the car.
text: Ashley checks her watch:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: Three minutes.
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK - NIGHT
text: Rudy and Jumpy sit at a blackjack table, beside the Old Timer.
text: Jovial ad libs as the Waitress brings Rudy's beer. Rudy
text: doubles down, busts, and gets belligerent:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (to the Old Timer)
dialog: That was my card, pop!
dialog: My card! You hit for
dialog: my card!
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: I... sorry, Mister...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: That was my king!
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: Well...sorry...
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: (to the Waitress)
dialog: How are you tonight?
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Fuckin' freezing. What can I get ya,
dialog: Santa?
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Jack and Coke.
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: Want that Jack and Coke or Jack and
dialog: Pepsi?
text: Behind them, Gabriel SLAMS through the casino doors.
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Woolworth's!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Hey, Sears! Hey, Wal-Mart!
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Saved you a seat, man. Get in on a
dialog: hand here!
text: Gabriel sidles to the table, claps Rudy on the back.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (re: Old Timer)
dialog: Careful. Watch out for this guy.
text: They throw chips in. The Waitress circles around:
speaker_heading: WAITRESS
dialog: What can I get ya, Santa?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: American beer.
text: The Old Timer hits and stays. Rudy hits and busts:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: POP! That was My card!
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: But... I had a five...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You're hitting for MY cards!
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Ashley's eyes on her watch. Nods to Merlin and Pug:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Go.
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK
text: Jumpy has left the table, sidling to a change booth, glancing
text: at his watch. Passes a $100 bill:
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Could Fat-Man-With-Flying-Horse get
dialog: some quarters, please?
text: AT THE BLACKJACK
text: Gabriel slides off his stool, punches Rudy in the shoulder:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Be back, Wal-Mart. Watch my bank.
text: Rudy nods, slugging beer. He's becoming an unruly drinker.
text: The Old Timer motions to hit; but before the Dealer can pull
text: the card, Rudy slams the table, points to it:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: That is my card, guy. My card.
speaker_heading: DEALER
dialog: He hit, mister.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He didn't hit.
dialog: (to Old Timer)
dialog: You didn't hit. You're not hitting.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: But you don't even know what it is!
text: The dealer hits grandpa to twenty-one. Then hits Rudy and
text: busts him. Rudy stares darkly.
text: IN THE HALL TO THE BATHROOMS
text: Gabriel walks to the men's room door. Then stops. Adjusts
text: the rifle under his red coat. And turns back.
text: AT THE CHANGE BOOTH
text: Jumpy is handed a bucket of quarters.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME
text: Merlin and Pug march toward the entrance, hands in pockets.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY LEVEL
text: The Security Boss returns upstairs, beside Jack Bangs, who's
text: watching the video monitors. On one screen, a parking lot
text: cam shows Merlin and Pug approaching:
speaker_heading: VIDEO GUARD
text: There's two more coming.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Hell, there we go. That's the spirit.
text: He drunkenly clinks his battle to the Security Boss, wassail.
text: The Boss frowns.
speaker_heading: SECURITY BOSS
dialog: Jack? Is there a union for department
dialog: store Santas?
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK - ON BLACKJACK
text: Rudy bolts up suddenly, sends chips and his chair to the
dialog: carpet.
text: Points sternly at the Old Timer, slurring:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Switch seats with me.
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: What? No...
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You're taking my money. Switch seats
dialog: with me. Switch seats with me if
dialog: you're not taking my money --
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: I'm ninety-two years old --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Then get yourself another table!
dialog: You're hitting Santa's cards and
dialog: you're taking Santa's money!
speaker_heading: OLD TIMER
dialog: There is no other table --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
text: Rudy grabs the blackjack table and wrenches with all his
dialog: might,
text: OVERTURNING IT, cards, chips, cash scattering --
text: AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE
text: Two SECURITY GUARDS at the door (?) rush for Rudy --
text: Gabriel steps from the restroom, hall, moves toward the keypad
dialog: door to the security level --
text: Jumpy carries his bucket of quarters past the cage --
text: Rudy tackles the Old Timer, fists and false teeth flying, as
text: the Guards arrive, trying to wrench him off the poor guy --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (hard whisper)
dialog: Stay down, pop! Trust me, stay down!
text: As Gabriel stops just beyond the keypad door --
scene_heading: IN THE SECURITY LEVEL
text: The Security Boss grabs more men, while Jack Bangs merely
text: smiles at the sight. Guards wrestling a drunken Santa:
speaker_heading: SECURITY BOSS
dialog: Help them down there! HELP them!
speaker_heading: IN THE CASINO
text: Three guards CHARGE out of the keypad door --
text: -- right past Gabriel, who slips deftly inside --
text: AND UP THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE
text: -- opening his coat, pulling his assault rifle --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: Right at the top of the stairs, right at the top of the
dialog: stairs...
text: -- charging to the top, starting right and running SMACK
text: into a wall.
text: He spins, sees the doorway's on his left --
text: TO A PRIVATE HALLWAY
text: with three doors. Gabriel stops at the first, grips his gun --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Video room, video room --
text: -- and swings open a closet bathroom. He frowns, confused.
text: Jumps to the second door --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Map said video room --
text: -- and swings open a storage closet. Gabriel grumbles, leaps
text: to the third door and flings it open,
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Map said goddamn video room!
scene_heading: TO REVEAL THE MAIN SECURITY AREA
text: -- with two Guards sitting at their posts, and Jack Bangs,
text: the Security Boss and the Video Guard in the doorway to the
text: video room. Which is on the far opposite side of the space.
text: As they turn to see the furious Santa Claus with the AK-47 --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!!
text: -- as he SPRAYS the ceiling with GUNFIRE.
scene_heading: INT. CASINO FLOOR
text: Where the RIFLE sounds, just as Jumpy grips his bucket of
text: quarters at the cashier's cage and wheels --
text: -- throwing a fragmentation grenade's worth of quarters at
text: the two Cashiers! Bits Of metal flying between the bars.
text: They SCREAM, stepping backwards in defense --
text: -- and Jumpy whips a sawed-off shotgun from his coat --
speaker_heading: JUMPY
dialog: Step BACK from the desks!
text: AT THE BLACKJACK
text: The five guards wrestling Rudy spin and scramble, pulling
text: pistols from shoulder holsters as --
speaker_heading: MERLIN
text: CHARGES through the casino entrance, shotgun held --
speaker_heading: MERLIN
text: DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (from the floor)
dialog: DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
text: But the guards don't. Whirling on Merlin --
text: -- who OPENS FIRE, BLASTING two of the guards off their feet.
text: Rudy stays on the ground, covering his head, holding the
dialog: petrified Old Timer down --
text: -- as the other three guards FIRE back, forcing Merlin to
text: race behind the slots. BULLETS rip into slot machines --
text: -- as GUNSHOTS ring out from the casino restaurant. Two of
text: the Guards spin to look behind them as --
text: -- PUG storms in, contorted glee, twin pistols BLAZING,
text: popping a steel flurry into an outgunned Guard.
text: Merlin spins from hiding behind the slots. He and Pug both
text: OPEN FIRE, blowing away the two remaining men from both sides.
text: One of the guards falls in front of Rudy, gun in hand --
text: -- but as Rudy-reaches for the guy's pistol --
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Hold it right there, Nick. Your squirt
dialog: gun's all you need.
text: Merlin steps to him, gun aimed. He and Pug collect the Guards,
dialog: weapons.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Cover 'em.
text: Rudy gets to his feet, pulls the water pistol from his pocket.
text: Moves to round up the Old Timer, the waitress, the Poker
text: Players and the Fat Slots Women.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Sorry, guys. But what the hell were
dialog: you doing here an Christmas Eve
dialog: anyway.
scene_heading: INT. SECURITY LEVEL
text: The two Guards lie on the floor, with Security Boss and Video
text: Guard. And the ruined Jack Bangs.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: No... not here... please... mister...
text: Gabriel storms to the video room's doorway. Slams a new clip.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm
dialog: begging. This is not some card club,
dialog: 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an
dialog: international gaming destination.
dialog: We're in guidebooks. You can't do
dialog: this... you can't do this to me...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Show's over.
text: He OPENS FIRE, BLOWING AWAY the wall of monitors and VCR's
text: recording the robbery. SPARKS and METAL fly.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: Ashley waits in the Nova, checking her watch. Behind her a
text: RED WRANGLER rolls in and parks. A FIRE CHIEF and his DEPUTY,
text: just off-duty, stroll toward the casino, laughing.
text: Ashley sinks low, panicked. Presses her HORN. The firemen
text: spin around but don't see her. They shrug. Keep walking.
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK
text: Rudy forces the gamblers and employees behind the bar. Onto
text: the floor with Bear the Bartender, whispering hard:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Get down and stay down, and you're
dialog: gonna be fine. Just don't do anything.
dialog: My friends are disturbed --
text: The hostages do as told. Rudy breathes relief, squirt gun in
text: hand. And then stares at the array of bottles around him.
scene_heading: IN THE CASHIER'S CAGE
text: Merlin and Pug force the cashiers to the floor:
speaker_heading: PUG
dialog: What's the security code to the Count
dialog: Room?
speaker_heading: CASHIER #1
dialog: Security code? What security code?
dialog: You just use a key!
speaker_heading: PUG
text: NICK SAID SECURITY CODE!
speaker_heading: CASHIER #1
dialog: Who's Nick?!
text: Pug bangs the guy's head off the floor, stalks to the Count
text: Room door. Just a key lock. Pug BLOWS it away with his guns,
text: kicks the door open --
text: -- and gets SHOT TO HELL by three COUNT MEN inside, pistols
text: blazing! Pug puppets, dead. A wad of chaw hits the ceiling.
text: Stunned Merlin FIRES BACK.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT
text: -- as the Firemen hear the GUNFIRE, pulling holstered pistols --
scene_heading: INT. TOMAHAWK
text: -- while Merlin dives out of the cage, joining Jumpy, taking
text: cover as the Count Men FIRE AWAY --
text: -- as Rudy scrambles back from the bar --
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: You said no GUNS in there! NO GUNS!
text: Merlin and Jumpy leap up, GUNS BLAZING, firing through the
text: cage bars at the Count Men. Killing all three just as --
scene_heading: THE OFF-DUTY FIREMEN
text: storm through the doors, pistols ready --
speaker_heading: FIREMEN
dialog: DROP IT! DROP THE GUNS!
text: Merlin and Jumpy are caught. Trade a look. And let their
text: weapons fall, turning just as --
speaker_heading: THE CHEVY NOVA
text: CRASHES through the casino doors, MOWING DOWN the firemen!
text: The car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots
text: send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino
text: floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray.
text: Ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. Rudy stares
text: darkly at her. She knows he knows. And she doesn't care.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: (wild-eyed)
text: WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Yeah. That's love.
text: She storms on by. The slots pay off behind her.
scene_heading: INT. COUNT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
text: Jumpy, Merlin, Ashley and Rudy step inside the Count Room.
text: There are stacks and stacks of bills.
text: Ashley smiles wide, throws Jumpy three laundry sacks.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
scene_heading: MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!
text: Merlin, meanwhile, slams Rudy against the wall:
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: You knew there were guns in here!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Merlin, I didn't know --
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: You got Pug killed! You tried to get
dialog: ME killed! You just lost your Get-
dialog: Outta-Jail-Free --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I promise you, I didn't know!
text: As Merlin puts a gun to Rudyls head --
speaker_heading: GABRIEL (O.S.)
dialog: (over casino speakers)
dialog: Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa
dialog: Claus... would you please bring our...
dialog: mapmaker... to the security level?
text: Merlin stares daggers at Rudy. Shoves the gun away.
scene_heading: INT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - NIGHT
text: Gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage.
text: The taped jingle of slots still plays.
text: Poor Jack Bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. Blood
text: runs down his face and shark suit. Tears and shock:
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: I can't go back to Vegas... I can't...
dialog: go back...
speaker_heading: JUMPY (O.S.)
dialog: What the hell is with this place?
dialog: Thought the video room was back there --
text: Merlin and Jumpy lead Rudy in. Ashley follows. They carry
text: bulging money sacks. Gabriel stares Rudy down.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: I told you not to fuck us with that
dialog: map, Nick. I told you not to, and
dialog: you did. How am I s'posed to keep my
dialog: promises now?
dialog: (Ashley joins him)
dialog: How's she s'posed to keep hers?
text: He kisses her hard. Sloppy. Grins.
text: Then points to Jack Bangs:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: He won't tell us where it is. The
dialog: Powwow Safe.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: I don't know... what you're...
text: Gabriel hammers him with the butt of his rifle. CRACK.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW
speaker_heading: SAFE!
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: What... Powwow...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: The Powwow Safe where you steal your
dialog: money! Where you cheat your Indians!
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: I don't steal any --
text: Gabriel CRACKS him again. And again. Rudy winces. Gabriel
text: grabs Rudy, pulls him over.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We
dialog: KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you
dialog: work! Because WE know who's worked
dialog: for you!
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: Remember a guy named Nick Mason!? A
dialog: security guard named Nick Mason!?
text: Gabriel pushes Rudy's head toward the desk. Jack Bangs,
text: drooling blood, eyes swollen, turns his face to see.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Nick... Mason... ?
text: Jack Bangs stares at Rudy. Rudy stares back.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: ...so where is he?
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: (laughs, mocking)
dialog: Where is he?! Where is he?!
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: He's not Nick Mason...
text: The smile fades from Gabriel's face.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: Nick Mason... worked for me two years
dialog: ago. This man...
dialog: (a spark of recognition)
dialog: ...he's some cowboy...
text: Gabriel grabs Rudy, slams him against a wall. He glares at
text: Ashley for answers. She stares in disbelief.
text: Rudy meets her eyes.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Fucked the wrong guy, Ashley.
dialog: (shrugs)
dialog: Story of your life.
scene_heading: BACK TO GABRIEL:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I did time with Nick Mason, Monster.
dialog: Told you that from the start.
dialog: Ashley's putting it all together...
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You... you... YOU --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: We still gonna spend Christmas
dialog: together?
text: Ashley CHARGES him. Gabriel stops her; Merlin and Jumpy help
text: hold her back. Gabriel spins on Rudy with his rifle:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You are lucky, convict. You're
dialog: spending Christmas with the birthday
dialog: boy himself --
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
text: Gabriel hesitates. Doesn't fire.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I did time with Nick Mason, remember?
dialog: I knew he worked here, didn't I!?
dialog: Well, some shit he told me!
text: Rudy steels himself for the shot. It still doesn't come.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Nick told me his manager kept a safe
text: in his office, his stealing safe.
dialog: His Powwow Safe. I swear, please...
dialog: Nick told me.
dialog: (looks to Jack Bangs)
text: Behind the liquor cabinet.
text: Jack Bangs dully meets Rudy's eyes.
text: Gabriel steps to the liquor cabinet, feels at the shelves.
text: They split in the middle. And there is a combination safe
text: mounted in the back. Gabriel turns to Jack Bangs:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Open it.
text: He pulls him off the desk. Jack Bangs wavers, struggling. He
text: looks at Gabriel. Then at Rudy.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: I can't go back to Vegas...
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: OPEN IT!!!
text: Jack Bangs steps to the safe. Spins the lock. Spins back.
text: Spins forward. Click. Jack Bangs looks at Rudy.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: (nods)
dialog: Pow. Wow.
dialog: And Jack Bangs opens it --
text: -- reaching inside in the same swift motion, so that as the
text: safe swings open to reveal it's a rack of WEAPONS that lies
text: inside, Jack Bangs already has an Uzi in hand --
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
text: VEEEEGGGGAAAASSSS!!!
text: BULLETS as he turns back to the room --
text: -- sending Gabriel, Ashley, and Merlin diving for the floor!
text: Jumpy can't get down, as BULLETS riddle him dead --
text: -- and BLOW OUT the smoked windows overlooking the casino --
text: Jack Bangs keeps turning in a madman's circle --
text: -- BLOWING OUT the windows to the parking lot, shattering
text: the liquor, sending Rudy scrambling under his desk --
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
text: I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
dialog: I CAN'T! GO BACK!
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: GO!!!
text: He and Ashley both scramble for the windows, jumping out
dialog: with two of the money sacks --
scene_heading: TO THE CASINO FLOOR
text: -- and landing on poker tables below, overturning them --
text: Jack Bangs keeps FIRING, into the casino, SHREDDING the tables
text: but missing Gabriel and Ashley -- as he JUMPS right after
dialog: them.
text: BACK IN BANGS' OFFICE
text: Merlin scrambles to his feet, whirling with his gun, looking
dialog: for Rudy --
text: -- just as Rudy slams into him. Merlin's SHOT hits the
dialog: ceiling.
text: The two of them CRASH down, wrestling and rolling toward the
text: parking lot window. Two guns spill to the floor. Rudy grabs
text: one, just as Merlin kicks out, leaping up --
text: -- and freezes, seeing Rudy's got a pistol on him.
text: Before Merlin can make a move, Rudy fires --
text: -- and a thin stream of water shoots out. Leaving a stain on
text: his shirt. It's the water pistol. Rudy stares blankly.
text: As Merlin swiftly snatches the second gun, a real gun, off
dialog: the floor. Rudy's dead to rights.
speaker_heading: MERLIN
dialog: Hell. I'm gonna take pleasure in
dialog: this...
text: With the gun on Rudy, Merlin finds a cigarette in his pockets.
text: Pops it between his lips, raises a lighter's flame --
text: -- and hesitates. Sniffing the air. Looking down.
text: At the stain on his shirt. His lighter still lit --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Me too.
text: -- and Rudy fires the water pistol again, this time catching
text: Merlin's lighter, which turns the stream into a ARC OF FIRE!
dialog: He's filled alcohol in the gun!
text: FLAMING LIQUOR shoots into Merlin's face and eyes. He drops
text: the handgun. Rudy keeps squeezing the squirt gun, spreading
text: the fire down his neck and chest. Merlin howls wildly --
text: -- and staggers back, blind and helpless, pinwheeling himself --
text: OUT THE PARKING LOT WINDOW
text: -- and CRASHING down on the hood of a Pontiac, head through
text: the windshield, boots on the bumper, dead. Flames flickering.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Smoke 'em if you got 'em.
speaker_heading: IN THE CASINO
text: Gabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in
text: with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward
text: them, still FIRING and babbling.
text: Gabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers,
text: but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering
text: the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down,
dialog: slamming it into reverse --
text: -- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance,
text: into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight.
text: Jack Bangs stops shooting.
text: He staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns,
text: gun still raised.
text: Rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level.
text: He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs,
text: face. The uzi drops to the ground.
text: A silence. Even the slots have stopped.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm sorry.
text: Jack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor
text: man's empire. And gives a small shrug.
speaker_heading: JACK BANGS
dialog: That's why they call it gambling.
text: He slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead.
scene_heading: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
text: Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He
text: takes a few wary steps toward the road --
text: -- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind
text: him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Your turn.
text: Rudy shuts his eyes for the end.
scene_heading: EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT
text: The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in
text: reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley
text: collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab.
scene_heading: EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a
text: couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way.
scene_heading: INT. GABRIEL'S RIG
text: Gabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks:
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: With the wrong fucking guy! We took
dialog: the place down with the wrong fucking
dialog: guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is
dialog: that Christmas?!
text: He grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back --
text: TO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT
text: Where Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: God bless us every one...
scene_heading: EXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT
text: A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a
text: grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been
dialog: no traffic here for awhile.
text: The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook.
text: Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is
text: fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge.
text: A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below.
text: Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer
text: gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer
text: to five feet away from, the ravine drop.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAB
text: Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back --
scene_heading: TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE
text: -- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is
text: in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with
text: a can of gasoline.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: You almost got away with it, Santa.
dialog: Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your
dialog: car, got halfway to Canada till you
text: caught some ice in the road. By the
dialog: time you hit bottom down there, whole
text: car was burning like a comet. Musta
dialog: burned up all that money too.
text: Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls
text: of bills into the car.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
text: Buncha guys in red suits busted in,
dialog: they'll say. Started shooting. They
dialog: won't be able to remember... if it
dialog: was three, or four... or five. Four
text: dead Santas and some burned-up cash.
dialog: Merry Christmas, The End.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it
dialog: hers.
text: Gabriel smiles at him.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: She told me 'bout the convict
dialog: magazines. Had to figure there'd be
dialog: some boys in the pen with some useful
text: knowledge. With nobody to talk to.
dialog: Nobody to listen. So we stocked up
text: on stationery.
text: Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Hard life being a trucker's girl.
text: Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I saved your life.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You shouldn't have.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: He did love you, you know. Nick. He
dialog: did love you.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Who wouldn't.
text: So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Maybe this is where you wanted him,
text: Ashley. At the bottom of a ravine,
text: dead as ice with a burnt-up heart.
dialog: Maybe. But it didn't happen. 'Cause
dialog: what you did for him was make him
dialog: the happiest held ever been. You
dialog: showed him hope and taught him mercy.
dialog: And he died a peaceful man. You wanted
dialog: to destroy some convict... and all
dialog: you did was save his soul. Remember
dialog: that. Love your money and remember
dialog: that.
text: Ashley shivers, a touch shaken. But steels herself:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Merry Christmas, Rudy.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I'm glad it was me.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Merry Christmas.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Get in the car.
text: Gabriel hauls him up. Marches him to the trailer. Rudy stops
text: at the ramp. Gabriel pushes. Rudy doesn't move.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Get in the CAR!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: How'd you know my name...
text: He turns back to Ashley.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Rudy. How'd you know my name?
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: What are you talking about?
text: Rudy looks at Gabriel. He's frowning. To Ashley:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I... you told me your name was Rudy.
dialog: You told me a million times, back in
dialog: the truck, telling me you weren't
dialog: Nick --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: No --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You were screaming you weren't Nick!
dialog: And we just didn't fucking believe
dialog: you!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: But I never said Rudy.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: You said it a million times!
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: I never told you my name.
text: He stares her down. Then stares at Gabriel.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Ash?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: How'd you know my name was Rudy.
speaker_heading: GABRIEL
dialog: Ash?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: How'd you know my name.
text: Ashley stares daggers. Shakes her head ruefully --
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: Men.
text: -- and pulls a handgun, SHOOTING Gabriel in the heart.
text: Gabriel falls to his knees in the snow, his mouth a ring of
text: shock. Blood spurts through his red coat. He stares at Ashley,
text: incredulous.
text: She steps forward and PUTS another bullet in his neck. Gabriel
text: falls still.
text: Ashley's breath frosts in the cold.
text: Rudy watches her. Finally, she meets Rudy's eyes. They stare
text: each other down for a long moment, before:
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Where is he.
text: A silence.
text: No one moves.
text: And finally, the CRUNCH of footsteps from around the side of
text: the trailer. And WHISTLING. "Silver Bells."
text: A shadow moves across the snow behind the trailer, and soon
text: steps into Rudy and Ashley's view.
dialog: It's Nick Mason.
text: Alive and well.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Merry Christmas, Rudy.
text: Ashley smiles. Her muscles-and-mustache man pen pal is here.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I missed you, beautiful.
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: I missed you too, Nicky baby.
text: They share a passionate kiss. Ashley malts at the sight of
text: him, embracing happily. Then turns to Rudy:
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
dialog: For your information. I never fuck
dialog: the wrong guy.
text: Rudy just stands there, his mind playing catch-up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Oh, hey. Have you two been properly
dialog: introduced? Sweetness, this is Rudy
dialog: Duncan, I did almost a year with him
dialog: in the Mountain. Read him all your
dialog: letters, talked about you all the
dialog: time, made him feel like he really
dialog: knew you.
dialog: (turns to Rudy)
dialog: My friend... wantcha to meet Millie
dialog: Bobek. 'Member Millie Bobek, dontcha?
dialog: My girlfriend fore I went in? Worked
dialog: at that bar in Motor City, where I
dialog: manslaughtered that guy? Hell. Didn't
dialog: talk about her much once the Ashley
dialog: letters started coming, I guess.
text: Rudy doesn't notice it's started to snow.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Millie here used to serve drinks to
dialog: these gunrunning truckers, real big
dialog: talkers, talking bout a real score
dialog: one day. I was in the Mountain, man,
dialog: what the hell, why not let her get
dialog: friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em
dialog: an idea she had, 'bout writing guys
dialog: in prison. Getting one who could
dialog: show 'em a sure thing.
speaker_heading: RUDY
text: She set them up. All of them.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Why not have her pretend to find me?
dialog: Pretend to write me and reel me in?
dialog: Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose
dialog: as some sister of his named Ashley?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: And you set me up.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Always wanted to rob that casino,
dialog: Rudy. Way back when I worked there.
dialog: What better way than to get some
dialog: guys to rob it for me.
text: Nick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the
dialog: shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does
text: he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty
dialog: to put out the story I was dead.
dialog: Once the wound healed up...
dialog: (notes cash-sacks)
dialog: Got out of the Mountain this morning.
dialog: And tonight I'm a rich man.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: How'd you know I'd do it.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Do what?
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Walk outta there and tell her I was
dialog: you.
text: Nick looks back at Ashley.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Because every time I read her letters,
dialog: Rudy... you listened.
dialog: (to Ashley)
dialog: Keep your gun on him.
text: Nick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and
text: lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel.
speaker_heading: NICK
text: Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk,
dialog: Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll
dialog: say. So we gotta have five Santas
dialog: not walk out. Gotta have five...
dialog: (working)
dialog: This'll burn right away... in the
dialog: fire...
text: Nick gets Rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. He laughs.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hell, you never needed to convince
dialog: Ashley you were me. Just the dumb
dialog: fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked
dialog: enough about the Tomahawk in the pen
dialog: for you to get by --
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: Talked about the old man's weapons
dialog: stash, probably forgot I'd remember
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if
dialog: you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd
dialog: start convincing 'em soon enough.
text: Nick slams the car door, locking Rudy in.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: They had the weapons and the
dialog: willpower. We just gave them their
dialog: inside man.
speaker_heading: RUDY
dialog: You gave them me.
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: I gave them me.
dialog: (shrugs, smiles)
dialog: Said some nice things about me, Rudy.
dialog: I appreciate it. But don't worry. I
dialog: do love her. And she loves me. You
dialog: had that right all along.
text: Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car
text: into "Drive." Turns to Ashley:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Sweetness! Let's light up the tree!
text: Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick
text: steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his
text: wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of
dialog: his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --
text: -- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The
text: switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to
dialog: his right wrist!
text: Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through
dialog: the Santa belt --
text: -- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either
dialog: Ashley or Nick to see --
speaker_heading: IN THE TRAILER
text: Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick
text: is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time
dialog: with you!
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of
text: trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column,
text: RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free!
text: As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races
text: over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the
text: dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy --
text: -- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate
dialog: the right leads --
speaker_heading: IN THE TRAILER
text: Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the
text: flaming car to the trailer's edge --
text: -- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --
text: -- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --
speaker_heading: IN THE CAR
text: Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him --
speaker_heading: RUDY
scene_heading: LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A
text: BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE!
dialog: -- and the ENGINE IGNITES!
text: Rudy slams the gearshift into "Reverse", grabs the wheel and
text: looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him --
speaker_heading: RUDY

speaker_heading: ON FULL SCENE
text: As the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back
dialog: into the trailer --
text: Terrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go --
text: -- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's
text: legs between metal and metal!
speaker_heading: ASHLEY
text: NOOOOOOO!!!
text: Then Rudy faces front, pounds the shift into "Drive."
speaker_heading: RUDY
speaker_heading: RULE TWO!
text: Ashley stands at the bottom of the ramp, vengeance and rage.
text: She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE --
text: -- and Rudy SLAMS the gas again, shooting down the ramp --
text: -- as he flings open the car door, dives and rolls --
text: -- while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her
text: onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off
dialog: the ridgetop --
text: -- arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking,
text: blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.
text: The shooting star hits Earth and explodes.

scene_heading: INT. CASINO/EXT. SNOWY ROAD - MONTAGE
text: The same four shots that opened the film. The Santa on the
text: floor of the cage (Pug), the Santa on the hood of the car
text: (Merlin), the Santa in the hallway (Jumpy).
text: And the Santa lying face-down on the snowy road. Gabriel.
scene_heading: EXT. RAVINE'S EDGE - SAME
text: The last of the opening images. Rudy's motionless Santa
text: figure, upside-down on the snowy incline, bits of his suit
text: still aflame. He opens his eyes.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON SNOWY ROAD
text: Rudy staggers to his feet. Battered and dazed. Looks at
text: Gabriel's body. Then looks to the trailer.
text: Inside, Nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist
dialog: down.
text: He's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:
speaker_heading: NICK
dialog: ...Rudy... help me... Rudy...
text: Rudy climbs the tire ramp. And pulls the trailer gate shut.
text: He climbs into the rig's cab. Starts the engine. Puts the
text: truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.
speaker_heading: NICK (O.S.)
dialog: ...Rudy! Rudy! HELP ME!!!
text: The truck rolls backwards. And into the ravine.
text: Rudy listens to its TUMBLING SOUNDS all the way to the bottom.
text: He then looks up the road one way. Then the other.
text: And notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow.
text: He stares at them.
dialog: A long time.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. RUDY'S JOURNEY - MONTAGE - NIGHT/DAY
text: In his burnt and battered Santa suit, Rudy's figure trudges
text: the snowy night. Two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty
text: roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads "Sidnaw --
dialog: 35 Miles."
text: He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes
text: across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the
text: soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of "The Little
dialog: Drummer Boy" start to rise --
text: With snow falling, he passes a new sign: "Sidnaw -- 27 Miles."
text: With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window,
text: seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway.
text: Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.
text: -- and we follow Rudy's march, stuffing presents into
text: mailboxes. At every-stop on the way.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: EXT. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
text: A cul-de-sac of Norman Rockwell Michigan homes. Graced with
text: pines and a pristine snowfall. Christmas trees in windows,
text: lights on inside, figures of FAMILIES in holiday gear.
text: No one noticing the man in the Santa suit, his sacks long
text: gone, walking up the road.
scene_heading: EXT./INT. FIFTIES-ERA HOME - DAY
text: At cul-de-sac's end. Where a blackened red cuff KNOCKS.
text: After a moment, the door opens to reveal a smiling MOTHER
text: and FATHER in their sixties. There's a party going on inside;
text: a dining table visible beyond them.
text: The Mother and Father's smiles disappear. Shock. Concern.
speaker_heading: MOTHER
dialog: Rudy...? Rudy?
speaker_heading: FATHER
dialog: Son? Is... is that you...?
text: The Santa Claus shuffles inside, right past them.
text: The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room,
text: finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden
text: with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and
dialog: wine.
text: The relatives stop still. The room goes silent.
text: The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table.
dialog: Yes, it's Rudy.
text: Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes
text: a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings,
text: and sets it in front of him.
text: And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.
text: His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The
text: other relatives look likewise.
text: All staring at Rudy.
text: Then, while he eats, without another sound...
text: ...the Mother takes her seat at the table...
text: ...and the Father pulls up another chair.
text: They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates.
text: There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of
text: glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals.
text: CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to
text: the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room.
text: There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle
text: Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage
text: Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and
dialog: her husband Bill, Grandpa Walter, little Wendy Sue...
text: ...and at the head of the table...
dialog: Rudy Duncan.
dialog: Home for Christmas.
