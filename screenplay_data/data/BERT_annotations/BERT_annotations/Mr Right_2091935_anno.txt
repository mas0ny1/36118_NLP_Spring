scene_heading: INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY
text: It’s an upscale psychologist’s office, well appointed and
text: brightly lit from floor to ceiling windows.
text: MARTHA McKay, 29, lays on the couch. She’s very pretty but
text: without make-up save somewhat heavy eyeliner, lacking any
dialog: kind of fashion sense, and also minus the poise and self-
text: assured mannerisms that make beautiful women seem
text: unreachable. She seems terminally awkward in her own body.
text: She’s talking to DOCTOR Lisa KENNER, 31, very sexy, with
text: long, slender legs, who sits across from her.
speaker_heading: DOCTOR KENNER
dialog: It’s nice to have you back, Martha.
speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I guess I just feel...I don’t know. I'd

dialog: is that cliche?
speaker_heading: DOCTOR KENNER
dialog: No, it’s not cliche if it’s what you
dialog: feel.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I just don’t want to hide behind pre-
dialog: established ideas, I mean, I’ve been

speaker_heading: MARTHA

dialog: One woman, I could handle, it’d be fucked

dialog: But I mean...I have no idea, it’s scary,

speaker_heading: DOCTOR KENNER

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: DOCTOR KENNER
dialog: Think about it.

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (shaking her head)
dialog: No, NO, okay, no, I don’t feel that way.
dialog: Why should I, I gave him everything, I
dialog: trusted him, and then to go through his
dialog: phone and find text messages about having
dialog: anal sex in a hot tub? That’s what
dialog: eleven months earned me? My fucking
dialog: fault? Fuck that.

scene_heading: EXT. METROPOLITAN STREET - LATE AFTERNOON
text: Mr. RIGHT, 30, handsome with wavy, messy brown hair, walks up

text: The woman fervently nods.
text: Mr. Right shrugs, pulls a red foam clown nose out of his
text: pocket, puts it on, draws out a pistol and shoots her in the

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Yeah, maybe. That’s why I got into

speaker_heading: MARTHA’S
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 36.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: CONTEMPLATIVE
speaker_heading: FACE
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Not really.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: First time for everything.
text: Martha smiles nervously.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: It's slightly later; Right and Martha are nearer to the
text: center of the room. Right stands behind their bodies pressed
text: together, limbs moving slowly, synchronized, just an easy,
text: gradual dance. As they move, Right talks.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Ever since I was a little boy, I’ve
dialog: had an idea. It’s a theory.
text: (he leans back, forcing
text: her to lay back on him,
text: and runs her own hands up
dialog: her body)
dialog: Keep up.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (trying to keep her
dialog: balance)
dialog: I’m trying.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Everything we see, like physical
dialog: things, it’s all just islands. And
dialog: under it, carrying it, is this
text: sweeping current.
text: He brings their right hands up in front of Martha’s face, and
text: moves it fluidly back and forth.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: And if you pay attention, you can
dialog: start to feel it. Here, you see
dialog: how your hand moves with mine? You
dialog: can feel it. You can feel it
dialog: through me. Do you feel it?
text: Martha’s quiet as they move, trying to figure out if this is
text: just foreplay, or if that strange sensation she’s feeling
text: counts at what Right is talking about. He subtly grabs a
text: knife off the table with his left hand, and then continues
text: moving, bringing the knife dangerously close to her throat.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 37.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
text: (a little afraid, staring
dialog: at the knife)
dialog: I...uh...
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: It's okay, just concentrate on the
dialog: knife.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Now if we can feel the current, we
dialog: can feel other things in the
dialog: current, other moving things,
dialog: people...watch the knife...And we
dialog: can feel how the current will move
dialog: them, and we can see where they’1l
dialog: go. It’s all in the movement, see,
dialog: it pushes itself; it’s easier to
dialog: move with it than against it.
text: Martha’s gaze moves from knife to Right’s arm, and, very
text: faintly, we see the dotted trace lines from his shoulder, his
dialog: elbow, his
text: wrist and the tip of the knife. Right, staring at
text: Martha, watching her face, abruptly drops the knife, bringing
text: his and her other hands directly under it.
text: Martha yelps and jumps away, and Right easily catches knife.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Jesus christ!
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why the fuck would you-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I thought you would catch it.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Catch it, jesus-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (suddenly concerned and
dialog: apologetic)
dialog: Did it not work? Did you not see
dialog: where it was going to go?
text: Martha’s quiet for a moment.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You could’ve cut me-
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Then why didn’t you catch it?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I can't catch a knife-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Yes you can.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No I can't.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Yes you can.
text: Martha shakes her head, as though waking up from a dream.
dialog: -she heads
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I don’t even know your name, and
dialog: you just, attacked me-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I didn’t attack you, I just-
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (straightening herself)
dialog: Look, um, I had a really nice
dialog: night, but I have to-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I could tell you can feel it. You
dialog: don’t know how yet, but I can keep
dialog: showing you, I-
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No, really-
dialog: (picking up her purse)
dialog: That’s great, but I need to leave,
dialog: now, and I-
text: towards the door-
speaker_heading: MARTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: -think it would be better off if we
dialog: just took a day or-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: But you felt it!
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It doesn’t matter what I-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Martha.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 39.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Martha turns, just in time to see Right toss the knife at
dialog: her.
text: Time stops for a second, Martha’s eyes wide, staring at the
text: knife as it spins towards her.
text: Martha’s hand shoots up and plucks the knife out of the air,
text: holding it by the blade. There’s absolute stillness, with
text: Right realizing he just went way over the line to prove his
dialog: point.
text: Luckily, Martha is sprinting past that line as well. She
text: lets out short, deep, throaty “hur-hur-hur” laugh, staring at
dialog: the knife.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: That’s so gnarly-
text: Mr. Right tosses another knife at her, and Martha catches it
text: almost without looking.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (CONT'D)
dialog: No, no more, okay, it...I get it.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Gimme one of those back.
text: Martha throws a knife to Right, which he easily catches,
text: spins, and whips back at her, along with a second knife. She
text: throws the first knife at Right, and then catches both new
text: knives, and then has to catch the first knife as Right tosses
text: it back at her.
text: She stares at the three knives in her hands as Right
text: approaches.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: It's like a...Like a pulse?
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Yeah.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (thinking)
dialog: Like everything is on strings,
dialog: or...God, it’s like trying to
dialog: describe doing acid, I can’t...
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: It's like everything is moving
dialog: together at once, and I just-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I was worried.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I’ve never tried to explain it to
dialog: anyone before, and I thought it
dialog: would sound stupid, or that-
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No, no it just...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You've never talked about this to
dialog: anyone?
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Why me?
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Because I wanted you to know. I
dialog: needed you to know. You have this
dialog: grace about you, I can’t even
dialog: describe it, and I knew...I just
dialog: knew you’d understand.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Is that how you knew I’d catch the
dialog: knife?
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I didn’t know you’d catch the
dialog: knife.
text: Martha stares at him, not questioning, just listening.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: I believed you could catch the
dialog: knife. I wanted you to catch the
dialog: knife. But there was no way I
dialog: could know. You’re the one that
dialog: did it. You’re the one who knew.
text: Martha looks down, thinking very hard.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: So, are you mad, or-
text: Martha looks back up to him, and wipes her eye.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 4l.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: I’m not mad.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I want you. I really, really do.
text: Right makes a wide-eyed face of surprise.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I think that’s...that’s doable.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No, I mean, like, immediately.
text: They stand there staring at each other.
scene_heading: INT. RIGHT’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING
text: Martha and Right lay in bed together, naked. Mr. Right is
text: asleep. Martha is awake, staring straight ahead, a blank,
text: happy smile on her face.
text: CUT TO: THE BATHROOM
text: Martha stands in Mr. Right’s bathroom, naked, looking at ten
text: prescription medication bottles. None of them have labels.
text: She gives them a cursory examination, and then looks at his
text: toothbrush, his deodorant, and then his shaving razor.
text: She is quietly, serenely happy.
text: CUT TO: THE SHOWER
text: Martha is in the shower, washing her hair, when Mr. Right
text: gets in, also naked, and immediately starts kissing her,
text: pushing her up against the wall of the shower.
text: CUT TO: MARTHA AND MR. RIGHT DRIVING
scene_heading: INT. MR. RIGHT’S CAR - SHORTLY THEREAFTER
text: Mr. Right is driving, with Martha next to him. They’re both

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Ooh, damnit.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RIGHT

dialog: That... Last night was the first time
dialog: anyone’s called me hot.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: What? No way.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: No, it’s true. I mean, guys say shit
dialog: like that like right before or during
dialog: sex, and I always assumed it was just
dialog: because I looked better in dim lighting-
dialog: (Right laughs) )
dialog: But I’ve never had anyone just say it
dialog: like that.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I hope that’s not why you love me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you love me?
text: Right smiles. Martha smiles. The light turns green.
scene_heading: EXT. PUBLIC PARK - SHORTLY THEREAFTER
text: Right pulls up, and parks. Out on a park bench sits Charlie
text: Cartigan, but otherwise, the park is entirely empty. Charlie
text: fidgets nervously, waiting, holding a plastic bag.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: There’s my guy. I'’11 be right back,
dialog: okay?
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Okay.
text: Mr. Right leans over and kisses her. He then gets out, and
text: heads off towards Charlie. Martha sits in silence for a
text: moment, and then turns on the radio; it’s a pop love song.
text: She changes, it, country. Changes it again, and comes onto
text: heavy, bass-thumping, hardcore rap.
text: Martha smiles and calmly lip-syncs the words.
text: OVER BY THE BENCH...
text: Charlie stands up as Right approaches.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Are you the guy?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I’m a guy, sure.

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: How’d you get my number?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Doesn’t matter.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No, I guess it doesn’t. So what do you
dialog: need?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hah. What do I “need.”
text: We see, from Martha’s vantage point, Charlie hand Right
text: envelope from the plastic bag.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE (CONT'D)
dialog: Everything’s in there.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (cordial)
dialog: You're sure about this.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Sure about what?
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: You’re sure that you want me to kill
dialog: whoever it is that’s identified in this
dialog: envelope.
text: Charlie blinks, shocked.
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Well, I don’t...What’re you-
dialog: 43.
dialog: an
text: Right sighs and impatiently tears open the envelope. Inside
text: is picture of BOBBY YATSUDA, a vicious looking Asian American

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Him?
speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: Hey, hey, don’t do that-

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: It's not a trick. It’s not a game. You

speaker_heading: CHARLIE
dialog: -..Yes?
text: Mr. Right gives a somewhat sad smile.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Okay.
text: Martha watches from the car as Right and Charlie stand up and
text: shake hands.
text: Mr. Right then puts on the clown nose. Charlie looks
dialog: confused.
text: Mr. Right suddenly drops a gun out of his sleeve and shoots
text: Charlie through the side of the face. Martha gasps, her eyes
text: wide. Right catches Charlie as he falls forward, and we can
dialog: see him saying “Oh, shit, sorry.”
text: Right apologetically gives the horrified Martha a “one
text: second” finger, shrugs and mouths the word “sorry.”
text: Charlie tries to draw his gun, and Right abruptly shoots him
text: in the forehead, then turns and briskly starts walking back
text: to the car. Charlie’s body falls dead.
text: Martha sits frozen in the car. Mr. Right walks to the car
text: and gets in, giving her a quick smile.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: I told you it’d only take a second.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Is something wrong?
speaker_heading: MARTHA

dialog: Take me home.
speaker_heading: RIGHT

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are you mad because I shot that guy?
text: Martha is silent, and then raises her eyes to make contact
dialog: with his.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Martha, how I felt about that guy has
dialog: nothing to do with how I feel about you.
text: Martha drops eye contact. Right sighs, and puts the car in
dialog: gear.
text: They drive out of the parking lot, and we hold on the empty
text: park. We pan to reveal Johnny Howl, sitting in a innocuous
text: sedan. He stares at the body of Charlie Cartigan in silence;
text: his reaction is unreadable.
text: He sighs, blowing out smoke and then tosses out his
text: cigarette, and starts the car.
scene_heading: EXT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - STREET LEVEL
text: Right pulls up, letting Martha out. She immediately goes up
text: the stairs, but he gets out.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Martha, wait.
text: Martha stops on the stoop, and turns around.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: I don’t...I’m not a bad person. I don’t
dialog: think before I act sometimes, but...I
dialog: love you, and I’m not a bad person.
text: Martha slowly nods, and goes inside. Right sighs, and kicks
text: the car, and then gets in and drives away. Across the
text: street, in an alley, Johnny Howl watches the building.
scene_heading: INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
text: Martha comes in, closes the door, leans and then slumps
text: against it, staring straight ahead. We see her view of the
text: apartment, empty and hostile. Busta, her cat, meows,
text: approaching.
text: She slowly pets the cat, staring blankly at anything and
text: everything. She walks over to the window, and closes the
dialog: shades.

scene_heading: INT. RICHARD’S OFFICE
text: It's a plush office, in an office building. Johnny Howl

text: of either tears or an explosive outburst. Von leans against
text: the wall; he looks shocked and horrified. Bruce stands
text: behind Richard, listening.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: I don’t...understand.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL
text: The guy just walked up and shot him, like
dialog: that. Nothing to it. I don’t see what

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Von you shut him up or I swear to god-
speaker_heading: VON
dialog: Howl, shut your mouth.
text: Johnny makes a big show of being quiet.
speaker_heading: VON (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: VON
dialog: He’s Bobby fucking Yatsuda-
speaker_heading: RICHARD

dialog: fuck are you, Von? This is on your head;

dialog: back to us from the Picolos.
text: Von looks hurt.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: Why would Yatsuda hire a contractor?
speaker_heading: VON
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: I mean, we haven’t felt any backlash from

speaker_heading: VON
dialog: Who gives a shit, Bruce? We go get this
dialog: guy, eye for an eye, yeah?

speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL

speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: He’s...he’s not a bad person.
text: Hopper laughs.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: You don’t even know what he is, who he is-

text: Hopper spreads some photos out on the table, mugshots, news
dialog: photographs of assassinations.
speaker_heading: HOPPER (CONT'D)
dialog: He was formerly one of the world’s most
dialog: notorious professional killers. He had
dialog: been ever since he was a teenager, just a
dialog: kind of meat-grinder of a man. But then,
dialog: about a year ago, he had a nervous
dialog: breakdown and quit.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: (cutting off Hopper)
dialog: He’s a psychopath, not a sociopath. The
dialog: guy has emotions. He has guilt. They’re
dialog: just operating on a real low level, and
text: his “feelings” just finally caught up
dialog: with him.
dialog: (beat, a look from Hopper)
dialog: That’s the theory, anyway.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: Then what was today?
speaker_heading: HOPPER

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: After a beat, Hopper smiles an odd smile.
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: After the breakdown, Minch developed a
dialog: kind of moral code. He’s still

text: But now, he kills them.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: He kills the people who hire him?
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: That’s right.
speaker_heading: WALLY
dialog: Because “murder” is wrong.
speaker_heading: ELAINE

speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: So is Francis Minch.
text: Martha and Elaine are silent.
speaker_heading: ELAINE
dialog: Just how dangerous is he?
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: Oh, there’s no kind of chart. Minch
dialog: isn’t some kind of superhero, he’s as
dialog: human as you and me, he’s just...He’s
text: just frighteningly efficient. He dances
text: in, kills everyone, and dances out.
dialog: (to himself, ponderous)
dialog: It's kind of beautiful, really.
dialog: 50.
text: A long beat. Martha and Hopper have made eye contact, and
text: there’s an odd kind of understanding. Elaine and Wally look
text: distinctly non-plussed.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (quietly)
dialog: So what now.
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: (standing)
dialog: The man you witnessed him killing today

scene_heading: EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP - NIGHT

text: AT HER PHONE.
text: It reads MR.RIGHT. She lets it ring, near tears.
text: BACK TO: RIGHT IN THE LOT
text: Right sighs, pocketing his phone, and then stops. We see the
text: way he views the world; everything in the lot seems to vanish
text: piece by piece, leaving the Shotgun Steve, Uzi and SAW headed
text: across the lot towards him, moving in a void.
text: Everything comes back, and Right stares at them, not moving.
text: Uzi opens fire, blasting the car Right stands next to, and
text: keeps shooting. The windows shatter and the car’s alarm goes
dialog: off.
text: Right, either knowing that he’s beyond Uzi’s ability to aim
dialog: with any kind of accuracy or simply not caring, continues to
text: look vacantly at the trio of men; “Oh?”.
text: He puts on the clown nose.
text: Steve shoves down Uzi’s gun by the barrel, burning his hand.
speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE
text: Agh, shit, STOP FUCKING SHOOTING!
text: Right crouches down, and slowly, carefully starts squat-

speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE
dialog: Shh-sh-shh.
text: The car alarm keeps going off into the night. SAW sees

text: BRAKABRAKABRAKABRAKA into the side of three sedans; all of
text: their alarms go off, beginning the overture of a crazed,
dialog: dysphoric symphony.

speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE (CONT’D)
dialog: What the fuck, Jimmy?
speaker_heading: SAW
dialog: He mighta been back there. Maybe I
dialog: already got him.
text: The trio stands there waiting, and then there’s a thump, and
text: a car alarm starts going off behind them. The three turn,

speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE

text: CLOSE UP: A GRENADE BOUNCING AND ROLLING
text: ALONG THE ASPHALT UNDER THE CARS.
text: BOOM! A car on the other side of the lot EXPLODES into
text: flames. All three men turn, looking at the explosion, not
text: noticing that Mr. Right now stands between SAW and UZI.
text: Mr. Right leans over Saw’s shoulder, talking into his ear.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (gleeful whisper)
dialog: I'm gonna shoot you.
text: It is here for the first time that we see Mr. Right ina
text: combat situation. When he moves, it is in strictly sweeps,
text: glides and snaps; it could be compared to the dancing of Gene
text: Kelly and Fred Astaire, in that everything looks effortless
dialog: and smooth.
text: The effect is visually beautiful, blindingly fast, and
dialog: absolutely lethal.
text: Saw turns around, firing the massive machine gun at random,
text: whereupon Mr. Right grape-vines his arm and quickly shoots
text: him the in the side of the head, then gracefully turns, slaps
text: Uzi’s gun aside, kicks him in the nuts and then shoots him in
text: the forehead as he falls forward.
text: Right looks around, confused; where’s Shotgun Steve gone?
text: Right turns directly into Shotgun Steve FIRING THE SHOTGUN
text: OFF INTO HIS FACE FROM FOUR FEET AWAY, having ducked behind
text: the front of a car.
text: Right stumbles back, and blood pours from a dozen or so small
text: holes in his face and neck; he also has a bunch of holes in
text: his upper chest and shoulders, which spot red with blood. He
text: looks stunned.
text: Shotgun Steve, equally stunned, tries to cock the shotgun;
text: Mr. Right raises his pistol, holding it on Shotgun Steve.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: (pained)
dialog: Drop that.
text: Steve drops the shotgun. Mr. Right slightly lowers his
dialog: pistol.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: (genuinely baffled)
dialog: Birdshot? They gave you birdshot?
text: Shotgun Steve goes for his pistol, but Mr. Right immediately
text: brings his gun up into Steve’s face.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Don’t reach for your gun, that’d be a
dialog: stupid way to die.

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE

dialog: Steve.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I hate that feeling Steve, but there’s no

dialog: Steve. You are damn good. Why the fuck
dialog: would they give you birdshot?
speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE
dialog: S..isamistake...Iunno...

dialog: him.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (sighs)
dialog: You should get out of here.
text: Steve nods fervently.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Run, dude!
text: Shotgun Steve takes off running. The friendliness seems to
text: drain from Mr. Right’s face, and he looks alarmingly
text: emotionally vacant, thinking.
scene_heading: FLASH TO MR. RIGHT’S VIEW OF

text: Mr. Right sits on the bench with Charlie, and one by one, the

speaker_heading: HOPPER

dialog: Is everything...
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: Everything’s fine.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: How long have you been following
dialog: him?
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: Minch...three years. Wally came in
dialog: later, after the change-over happened.
dialog: (to Martha’s reaction)
dialog: When he started killing his clients.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (long beat)

speaker_heading: MARTHA

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: I have no idea. We think he’s in danger;

dialog: (beat, musing)
dialog: Of course, so did the Picolos, and that
dialog: didn’t help them.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: The who?
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: A little syndicate up north; drugs,
dialog: heroin mainly, thought they were really
dialog: tough guys. Tried to hire Minch, bing
text: bang boom, their guys are dead. They try
text: to come after him for revenge, and the
text: backlash destroys them.
dialog: (holds up two fingers)
dialog: One survivor. Of four leaders, and
dialog: fifteen underlings, one guy lived.
dialog: Everyone thought it was a rival gang, but-
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: You misunderstood, I meant...I
dialog: meant am I in any danger from him?
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: I...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Minch has no friends. He barely ever
text: talks to anyone. He spends hours in his
text: apartment, sitting and not moving,
text: staring at nothing, goes to work, sells
dialog: cars, comes home. Around you, his
dialog: behavior is...unique. He expresses
dialog: himself; emotions other than that blank,
dialog: happy thing he’s got going on. You’re
dialog: the one person in my entire time tracking
dialog: him that he’s had any kind of meaningful
dialog: interaction with that didn’t end in a
dialog: bullet...or a new car.
text: Martha smiles a tiny bit, and Hopper, though he doesn’t
text: smile, acknowledges it.
speaker_heading: HOPPER (CONT'D)
dialog: Maybe that doesn’t answer your question,
dialog: but that’s all I’ve got.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Personally, I’d say he hasn’t killed

speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE
dialog: Why the fuck would I, why would you guys
text: even have birdshot shotguns laying

speaker_heading: VON
dialog: Richie, wait, Richie-
text: Richard slaps Von across the face, nearly knocking him down.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Our uncle is dead. Two of our guys are

scene_heading: INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY

text: Hopper, knowing Right’s tricks too well, spins and draws his
text: gun, kneeling, aiming down the hall to his left.
text: He waits, bracing himself for the explosion of the grenade

scene_heading: INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT —- HALLWAY

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Hey Monsta, can you get the door?

speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL
dialog: A clown nose, huh? Cute gimmick. You

text: on it.
text: Right, Martha behind him, strolls out of the alley, a gun in
text: each hand. As he walks, he shoots two of the goons, one in
text: the shoulder and one in the head; he continues firing

speaker_heading: ZEKE

text: Right pops up onto his feet.
text: In less than two seconds, Mr. Right has casually shot and
text: killed four of the seven men, all, all direct hits to the

text: Johnny Howl drives slowly through the parking structure, eyes
text: wide, searching; he has a certain animal countenance to him,
text: his pupils bouncing around like an angry wolf on the prowl.
text: His car passes Mr. Right and Martha, who hide behind a
text: concrete pillar.
text: Mr. Right hands Martha his keys, and silently points at the
text: car, then makes a “go-around” motion with his hand. She
text: takes a moment to understand, then nods, and Right dives out
text: from behind the pillar while Martha runs off towards Mr.
text: Right's car.
text: Mr. Right runs up the back of Howl’s car, firing repeatedly
text: into the roof, and Howl slams on the gas and dives out the
text: driver’s side.
text: The sudden acceleration drops Mr. Right painfully onto the
text: ground, but he manages to hold onto his guns, firing dazedly
text: at Johnny, who ducks behind a car. Johnny’s car gently
text: crashes into the wall, and Johnny pops out like a jack-in-the-
text: box, advancing on Right and firing the shotgun as Right
text: scrambles out of the way.
text: Right flings one of his empty guns, and it clips Howl on the
text: side of the head, causing him to stumble back and be HIT BY
scene_heading: MARTHA DRIVING RIGHT’S CAR!
text: Howl rolls off the hood; the impact wasn’t too bad, but it
dialog: was certainly enough to throw him into shock.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: (rolls down the window)
text: LOOK BOTH WAYS!
text: Right laughs.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (CONT'D)
text: BITCH, YOU HAVE TO LOOK BOTH WAYS!

text: There’s a blinding flash of light and sound as the flash-bang
text: grenade explodes, and they go crashing into a parking meter
text: on the other side of the street, sending coins everywhere.
text: There’s a moment of silence, and then Mr. Right drops out of
text: the car, pained and dazed, rubbing his eyes; Martha’s been
text: nearly knocked out by the impact from the airbag.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Martha...Martha...
text: A flashbang rolls up next to him.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Aw, dang.
text: The flashbang EXPLODES in a flash of light and sound, and Mr.
text: Right stumbles back, crawling desperately.
text: Shotgun Steve comes out of NOWHERE, smashing Mr. Right with a
text: baseball bat, knocking him down. Right, in extreme pain,
text: turns and swats the bat out of Steve’s hands, grabs him by
text: the arm and slams him against the car.
text: Zeke bull-tackles the dazed Right, but Right shrugs him off,
text: slamming his body into the side of the car; as Zeke raises
text: his gun, Right snatches it away from him, headbutts him in
text: the face, and turns to try to shoot Steve, but Steve bashes
text: his hand with the baseball bat, bashes him in the arm, and
text: then raises the bat in the air to smash Right’s skull as
text: Right flips out a switchblade when-
dialog: BANG!
speaker_heading: VON
speaker_heading: ENOUGH.
text: Von stands, holding the dazed Martha to him tightly with one
text: hand, his smoking pistol raised in the other.
speaker_heading: RIGHT

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Steve, is that you? Did you get me
dialog: again? And then he stopped you, or...
dialog: (to Von)
dialog: Jesus christ, man, what’re you doing to
dialog: this poor guy?
text: Right kicks Steve, in the chest, leaps to his feet, rolls
text: across the trunk, and takes cover behind the car. Steve and
text: Zeke grab up their guns and fire repeatedly into the car,
text: while Von backs up, dragging Martha with him.
text: Mr. Right smiles, and Von jostles Martha and she gasps.
text: Right’s smile vanishes, and he tosses away the switchblade.
text: Johnny Howl comes limping up from the underground garage, as
text: Zeke and Steve frantically reload.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL
dialog: (tilting his ear)
dialog: Cops.
speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: I don’t hear anything-

speaker_heading: RIGHT

speaker_heading: VON

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I’m going to get you.
speaker_heading: VON
dialog: Yeah, give it your best shot,
dialog: psycho.
text: Right pops up from behind the car, motioning as though he’s

scene_heading: WHITE FLASH.
text: SLAM TO BLACK.
scene_heading: EXT. THE CARTIGAN LODGE - NIGHT - LATER
text: It's a massive house just outside of the city, in a wooded

speaker_heading: SHOTGUN STEVE

speaker_heading: VON

text: Shotgun Steve seems conflicted, but then sighs and pulls over
text: his car next to the gatehouse as the others drive in.
text: He lights a cigarette, and then shakes his head, frustrated,
dialog: thinking.
text: CUT TO BLACK.
text: There’s faint, somewhat chaotic music. It’s pretty; as
text: though composed from ambient sounds, woven together to form
text: one flowing song. It gradually falls apart, separating into
dialog: individual sounds, which leads to...
scene_heading: FADE IN: MR. RIGHT DAZEDLY
text: WAKING UP...
scene_heading: EXT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
text: Mr. Right blinks, he’s face down on the asphalt. He sees his
text: clown nose sitting only a couple feet away, and reaches for
text: it; we hear dozens of guns cock.
text: He looks around; there are eight police cars parked on the
text: road, some with lights on, and a mess of police officers,
text: Wally and Hopper stand behind the cars, pistols and shotguns
text: raised, trained on Mr. Right; he’s covered in laser sights.
speaker_heading: RIGHT

speaker_heading: HOPPER

dialog: This is bad, this is bad.
speaker_heading: COP SERGEANT
text: Hit him with the gas.
speaker_heading: HOPPER
speaker_heading: NO WAIT-

text: grenade launchers; he spins, catching them in his coat and
text: then using it as a sling to fling the canisters BACK AT THE
text: POLICE CARS, IMMEDIATELY ROLLING RUNNING FORWARD INTO THE
speaker_heading: SMOKE.
text: All of the cops open fire at once, but he’s already too
text: close, and a majority of the shots seem to hit their own cars

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 75.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Wally and Hopper stumble away from the cars, frantically

speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: (regarding Martha)
dialog: Explain to me again how this happened.
speaker_heading: VON

speaker_heading: BRUCE
text: But he got away. He was still up and

speaker_heading: VON

speaker_heading: BRUCE

dialog: It is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL

speaker_heading: VON

dialog: of the fact that we need to get the fuck
dialog: out of here, yesterday.
speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL
dialog: Why don’t we just kill him?
speaker_heading: VON
dialog: Kill who?
speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL

speaker_heading: VON

speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL

speaker_heading: VON
dialog: So I should...
speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL
dialog: Yeah.

speaker_heading: VON

speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL

scene_heading: INT. CARTIGAN LODGE - DEN - CONTINUOUS
text: The men walk down into the huge den, complete with a fancy

text: foyer.
text: There’s the sound of nearby machine gun fire.
speaker_heading: ZEKE
dialog: What is that? Where is he, in the
dialog: garage?
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: We have to get Richard out of the house.
speaker_heading: VON
dialog: Fuck that, we end this nonsense here and
dialog: now.
text: There’s an explosion at the front of the house, and everyone

speaker_heading: VON (CONT'D)
dialog: Fucking christ-

speaker_heading: BRUCE
scene_heading: SHIT GET DOWN-
text: Everyone tries to duck, but several men are still caught in

scene_heading: BACK TO: THE DEN
text: A large window to the right of everyone shatters, and
text: everyone turns and shoots into the woods outside.
text: Von quietly ducks away, exiting the room, and then Bruce,
text: annoyed by all the irrational shooting, turns and sees that
text: there’s a tiny bullet hole in the wall to everyone's left,
text: just above a window.
text: Up on the balcony over the staircase, a quietly observing

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: No, he’s-
text: Mr. Right comes crashing through the tiny window behind

text: It all happens blindingly fast:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Right turns and grabs a thug with two pistols in chest
text: holsters, flips them upside-down and shoots them up into his
text: armpits, ducks allowing two thugs to shoot each other, yanks
text: the pistols out of the chest holsters, kicks the body into
text: the two men behind him, shoots them both, ducks under a
text: shotgun blast, kicks the shotgun wielder in the knee, then
text: grabs his shotgun and yanks it away,

scene_heading: THE CHAIR.

scene_heading: BACK TO: RIGHT KILLING
scene_heading: EVERYONE.
text: Right launches one of his spring-loaded pistols into a man’s
text: face, catches it as it bounces off, trips a man behind him,
text: shoots him, shoots the guy whose face got bounced, blasts the
text: man behind him in the chest with the shotgun, and then holds
text: the shotgun out, butt first, to the gunless thug who
dialog: originally had the shotgun.
text: They stand there like that. Mr. Right takes off his gas

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Do you want your gun back?
scene_heading: GUNLESS THUG
dialog: ...Yeah?
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (laughs)
dialog: Psh, psych.
text: He flips the shotgun around and blasts the gunless thug in
text: the face.
text: Zeke abruptly stands behind Right, trying to raise his gun.
text: Right grabs him by the wrist, twirls him, takes the gun,
text: twirls him again, tears open his button up shirt, places the
text: barrel of the pistol sideways against his chest and FIRES.
text: The bullet fires off into the ceiling. Zeke screams as the
text: gun’s slide closes on his flesh; Right shoves him down,
text: leaving the smoking gun hanging from Zeke’s chest as he
text: shrieks in pain.
text: Bruce rushes Mr. Right, but Right knocks him away, and raises

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: RIGHT

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Well...If I put down my gun, will you

speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: ..-Okay.

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: (pained, angry)
dialog: THAT WAS KARATE, YOU ARE TOTALLY USING
speaker_heading: KARATE-
text: Right tries to get up, but Bruce catches him with several
text: strikes to the body. Right abruptly headbutts Bruce,
text: knocking him back, and then Bruce roundhouse kicks Right in
text: the face.
text: Right rolls, wiping the blood from his nose and drawing his
text: dual pistols, as Bruce turns and grabs a grenade, pulling out
text: the pin. Bruce spins, ready to throw the grenade, only to
text: find that Right has both guns pointed directly at him, point

text: Bruce freezes. Right smiles, and then notices the grenade in
text: his hand. Bruce notices it too. They stand there frozen.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: GET RID OF THE GRENADE!

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, sit down.
text: They sit down together.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
text: Just take long, deep breaths, in through

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Man, that was really scary. What’s your

speaker_heading: BRUCE

speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Damn, Bruce, I thought you were a goner.
speaker_heading: BRUCE
dialog: (weakly)
dialog: I thought...You were gonna shoot me...
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: I was going to shoot you, but then you

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: We see through Mr. Right’s POV as what looks like permanent
text: marker draws a “game-plan” on the men, numbering them and
text: crossing them off, drawing curved lines to represent when and
text: how they will raise their guns. It quickly draws a smiley
dialog: face, and then-
text: Time unfreezes.
text: Before they can even fire a shot Right stands and fires
text: seemingly without aiming, bang bang bang bang bang bang bang,
text: going through the men like a shooting gallery, leaving only
text: one man standing as Right runs out of ammunition; he was
text: ducked down when they came in, and ran behind his
dialog: compatriots.
text: It’s Shotgun Steve; he rolls and raises his rifle, the laser
text: sight resting on Right’s forehead.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Steve!
dialog: (smiles)
dialog: I thought that was you!
text: Steve stares at him; Right looks up at the laser sight on his
dialog: face.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh hey, you got me again!
text: Right gracefully lurches left, and Steve fires, but Right has
text: already lightning quick drawn a Deringer and fires a shot
text: that plinks off Steve’s rifle, knocking it out of his hands.
text: Right straightens up as though nothing happened.
speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)
dialog: You shouldn't have hesitated.
dialog: (thinks)
dialog: Steve, man, get over here.

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: RIGHT (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: STEVE
dialog: Uh...yeah.
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Radical, thanks dude.
text: Right smiles, and then races off through the doors and out of
dialog: sight.

text: Right’s face.
text: There’s also a hole in Zeke’s back, which we notice as he

text: to reveal Bruce and Shotgun Steve.
text: Shotgun Steve lowers his smoking pistol, Zeke collapses to

scene_heading: FADE TO: LATER
text: Hopper sits in the car, half asleep, and then wakes up as a
text: seemingly endless stream of police cars pour by, sirens on.
text: A couple of SWAT officers tap on the window, and Hopper just
text: looks at them, and then sort of shrugs.
text: CUT TO: THE BACK
text: OF THE HOUSE.
text: Several officers, guns drawn, approach Johnny Howl's
text: motionless body. He’s all covered in grey-white-black ash

speaker_heading: JOHNNY HOWL

dialog: +..The fuck are you looking at?

text: change according to what Hopper discusses.
speaker_heading: HOPPER
dialog: These two men, within the last month,
dialog: have settled into controlling positions
dialog: of what was formerly the Cartigan Crime
dialog: Syndicate. Now, their rise to these
dialog: positions was of course facilitated by
dialog: the massacre at the Cartigan estate in
dialog: Bonville, where Francis Minch and Martha
text: McKay evaded capture after killing all
text: remaining members of the Cartigan family.
dialog: Now, as you know, the immediate capture

dialog: this task force, and over the next couple
dialog: of weeks we’re going to learn everything
dialog: we can about them.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: As most of you know, I’ve been demoted to
dialog: advisory status on this case, so for a

speaker_heading: CZECH WORKER (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Miss Cumberbund, how do we-
speaker_heading: MARTHA (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Just turn the screw on the side. There,
dialog: you got it; yeah. Do you recognize the
dialog: shape of a head, sort of? You know where
dialog: the mouth would go on a head?
speaker_heading: CZECH WORKER (SUBTITLE)
dialog: -..On the bottom?
speaker_heading: MARTHA (SUBTITLE)
dialog: Oy...okay, just move the jaw into the
dialog: crater sockets and you should be-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Martha.
text: Martha looks down and grins. Mr. Right waits for her by the

text: embraces him.
speaker_heading: MARTHA
dialog: Hey babe, I thought you were at work-
speaker_heading: RIGHT
dialog: Lunch break. I wanted to give you this.
dialog: (quickly, quietly)
dialog: I drew you this picture of a dinosaur.

speaker_heading: RIGHT

dialog: and we’ve been putting it together for
dialog: hours without-
speaker_heading: MARTHA (SUBTITLE)
dialog: You guys, you guys...
dialog: (beat, composes herself)
dialog: T-Rex’s are totally awesome. Can we
dialog: please try to remember how totally
dialog: unbelievably cool it is that we get to
dialog: build a T-Rex?
speaker_heading: CZECH WORKER 2 (SUBTITLE)
text: (quietly, looking at the
dialog: skeleton)
dialog: This is pretty cool.
speaker_heading: MARTHA (SUBTITLE)

speaker_heading: DUSK
text: Right wanders down the road, much as we first saw him,
text: looking serenely happy.
speaker_heading: HOPPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
dialog: I think he probably just took McKay, flew
dialog: somewhere he wanted to be and they’ve set
dialog: up shop like nothing’s wrong. I think
text: he’s in love, and he’s done with
dialog: organized crime for now; he’s probably
dialog: selling cars, a travel agent, I don’t
dialog: know.
text: Right walks past an alley, where a group of Serbian thugs are
text: mercilessly beating on two men. Right stops, casually eyeing
dialog: the men.
speaker_heading: SERBIAN THUG #1 (SUBTITLE)
