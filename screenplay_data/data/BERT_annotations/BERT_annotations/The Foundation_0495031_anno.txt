scene_heading: INT. TRIAL SPHERE -- DAY
text: Doctor HARI SELDON stands on a rotating platform suspended in
text: the center of a spherical metal chamber. He is old and
text: frail, but his eyes are bright.
text: As the platform spins Seldon is displayed for one and then
text: another and another of the JUDGES seated along the perimeter.
text: The Judges are moving their lips, speaking rapidly into weird
text: ornamental headsets, in never-ending consultation with each
text: other. All we hear is a single unsettling androgynous voice:
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Doctor Hari Seldon, you stand before
dialog: this court as an enemy of the people.
dialog: State for the record your opinions
dialog: concerning the future of this planet.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: I have said, and say again, that
text: Trantor will lie in ruins within
dialog: three centuries.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: You do not consider this statement
dialog: a disloyal one?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: Scientific truth is beyond loyalty
dialog: and disloyalty.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: You say your statement represents
dialog: scientific truth.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: I do.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: On what basis?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: On the basis of the mathematics of
dialog: psycho-history.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: A new field of study you claim can
dialog: accurately predict events hundreds
dialog: of years in the future.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
text: Hundreds of years. Thousands. Even
dialog: tens of thousands.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Can you prove that this mathematics
dialog: is sound?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: I can. To another psycho-historian.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Of which you are the only one.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: How convenient.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: Seeing that I am currently on trial
dialog: for my life, I would say that it is
text: decidedly inconvenient.
text: Seldon smiles a little. The emotionless faces of the Judges
dialog: watch him.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: The court suggests your predictions
dialog: of disaster are intended to destroy
dialog: public confidence in the government.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: That is not so.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Then what is the purpose of your work?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: I believe our future can be changed.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Easily?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: No. With great difficulty.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Let us pretend we do not question
dialog: the validity of your theories. How
dialog: do we save Trantor?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: We don’t.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Now you are contradicting yourself,
dialog: Doctor. Can we or can we not save
dialog: this planet from destruction?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: The fate of this planet is of no
dialog: consequence.
text: For the first time even these Judges are rendered speechless.
text: They stop talking into their headsets. Listen.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON (CONT’D)
text: The coming destruction of Trantor is
text: not an event in itself, isolated in
dialog: the scheme of human development. It
text: is the climax to a drama which began
text: centuries ago and is accelerating in
text: pace continuously.
dialog: (short pause)
dialog: I refer to the decline and fall of
dialog: the Galactic Empire.
text: The Judges all begin to protest at the same time. The sound
text: system fights to organize fragments.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Treason-- Openly declare-- You go
dialog: too far, sir-- Outrageous-- You--
dialog: (settling on one)
dialog: You are talking about an empire that
dialog: has stood for 12,000 years and holds
dialog: a quadrillion human beings!
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: I never said I was glad the empire
dialog: would fall. Only that it will.
text: The platform slowly rotates. Seldon counters their hostility
dialog: with his usual scientific detachment:
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON (CONT’D)
text: The end is dictated by a rising
text: bureaucracy, a receding initiative,
dialog: a stagnation of commerce, an
dialog: increase in political insurgency--
dialog: and a hundred other minor factors.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: And when the empire is gone?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: (3)
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: The accumulated knowledge of the human
text: race will be lost forever. Interstellar
text: wars will wage. Galactic trade decay.
dialog: Populations decline. Worlds will lose
dialog: touch with one another, and so matters
dialog: will remain.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Forever?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: A second empire will rise, but not
dialog: for 30,000 years. Between it and our
dialog: civilization lies twelve hundred
dialog: generations of suffering humanity.
text: Between Seldon’s responses, the Judges consult furiously with
dialog: one another, then comes the question:
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Can we save the future?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
text: A galaxy full of people contains an
text: enormous inertia. The fall of the
dialog: empire is far too massive a thing to
dialog: stop. But if the onrushing events
dialog: can be deflected, just a little, I
dialog: believe we can rebuild civilization
text: in a single millenniun.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: How?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: I have begun my final and greatest
dialog: psycho-historical calculation.
dialog: The resulting equation will safely
dialog: guide us through the events of the
dialog: next one thousand years.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Let’s be very clear, Doctor. You
dialog: want the human race to entrust its
dialog: future to a mathematical equation
dialog: no one understands but you?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Elaborate please.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: (4)
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: My testimony here today is already
dialog: damning enough for the court to find
dialog: me guilty of numerous transgressions.
dialog: The tale of my trial and execution
dialog: will spread throughout the galaxy and
text: an increasingly desperate humanity
dialog: will gravitate toward my teachings--
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Stop right there.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: --studying the equation in a futile
dialog: attempt to stop the fall I predicted
dialog: centuries earlier. As our current
text: age of science reverts back to one
dialog: of mysticism, the inhabitants of our
dialog: dwindling future will view me as a
dialog: prophet and messiah--
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: That is quite enough.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: --sent to deliver them into the new
dialog: kingdom that lies at the end of the
dialog: darkness. Society will, of course,
dialog: reorganize around this new religion.
dialog: Finally socioeconomic forces will
dialog: secularize the equation until it is
dialog: the foundation of civil government--
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: (overlapping)
dialog: Doctor, we will have order!
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: --concluding my thousand year plan.
text: The Judges exchange shocked looks. Finally, that voice says:
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
text: This court is stunned and outraged
dialog: by the scope and magnitude of your
dialog: arrogant presumptions.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: Yes. I thought you might be.
text: The Judges have had enough. They place their palms down on
text: the control pads abruptly deciding his fate. It’s unanimous.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE
dialog: Hari Seldon, you are found guilty
dialog: of treason and sentenced to death.
text: The platform stops rotating and Seldon is suddenly encased in
text: a COLUMN OF ENERGY. His calm exterior gives way, just a bit,
text: enough to confirm that he fears death like the rest of us do.
speaker_heading: ARTIFICIAL VOICE (CONT’D)
dialog: Do you have any last words?
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: Not at the moment.
text: Suddenly one of the Judges tears off his headset. He may be
text: the eldest. He looks across at Seldon, with great intensity:
speaker_heading: ELDEST JUDGE
dialog: You are either the most brilliant
dialog: man who’s ever lived, sir, or the
dialog: most dangerously insane!
text: Seldon looks almost intrigued. As if wondering that himself.
speaker_heading: HARI SELDON
dialog: We’1l find out in a thousand years.
text: ...and he is DISINTEGRATED before our eyes. The column of
text: energy disappears and now there is only an empty platform. A
text: small automatic arm neatly sweeps his ASHES into a tiny hole.
dialog: cur TO:
text: THE SELDON EQUATION floats in some endless white nothingness.
text: The mathematical string is solving itself, growing larger and
text: larger, the strange symbols appearing at an astonishing rate.
text: TITLE AND CREDITS begin as we race down the length of the
text: expanding equation, faster and faster, as if hurling into the
text: future. We pass through numbers and symbols at random and
dialog: see images from the next one thousand years of human history:
text: --STARSHIPS are torn and twisted at the site of a great
text: battle. Petrified CORPSES tumble endlessly through the void.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --Tattered SURVIVORS make their way down a BOMBED STREET
text: searching the ruins for food. They eat like starved animals.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (6)
text: --The surface of a PLANET GOES DARK as the last of its power
text: reserve fails. One of the inhabitants lifts a BURNING TORCH.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --People die in agony from some PLAGUE, open sores on their
text: skin, diseased corpses piled high.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --A group of tired SEARCHERS force open an old vault and step
text: into a blinding white space. See the EQUATION. It has grown
text: huge, rising high above them, like a mathematical monolith.
text: They fall onto their knees in awe.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --A HOODED PRIEST leads a ragged CONGREGATION in prayer. A
text: moment later we see they are worshipping the Seldon equation.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --A town MARKETPLACE grows crowded and wild as trade returns.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --RESEARCHERS walk along a rickety SCAFFOLDING being built
text: around the equation. They study the strange mathematics and
text: copy the symbols into large books.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --A small hill is covered with the slain bodies of a SAVAGE
text: HORDE. Civilized SOLDIERS wearing uniforms raise their FLAG.
text: On it is a symbol of the equation.
dialog: We speed down the equation and:
text: --The images rush toward us, faster now, CITIES RISING as
text: industry grows, the POPULATION sky-rocketing, advanced modes
text: of TRANSPORTATION appearing, ROCKETS racing toward the stars.
text: The credits END and we slow down, completing our trip through
text: time. We pull back. See TECHNICIANS inside of the equation.
text: The men and women wear high-tech bodysuits as they make their
text: way down bizarre corridors formed by the mathematics. They
text: speak into microphones recording any changes in the equation.
text: We pull back further and realize the extent of this facility.
text: THE EQUATION HAS GROWN IMPOSSIBLY LARGE, stretching endlessly
text: above and below. We hear the VOICES OF A HUNDRED TECHNICIANS
text: in a cacophony of ominous unknowable jargon. And we confirm:

dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: EXT. CITY SQUARE -- DAY
text: The planet Haven is an idyllic fusion of advanced technology
text: and natural beauty. In the capital city is a gorgeous square
text: FILLED WITH PEOPLE enjoying a perfect day on a perfect world.
text: Somewhere among them is BAYTA and TORAN. They seem like any
text: other happy couple. Bayta stares up at the sky, and suddenly
text: a playful look comes over her:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Do you think it’s going to rain?
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I mean rain. Do you think it’s
text: going to descend. From the sky.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Don’t be ridiculous.
text: She looks disappointed in him.
speaker_heading: TORAN (CONT'D)
dialog: This planet is climate controlled--
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (irritated)
dialog: I know, I’m trying to fantasize.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: About atmospheric precipitation?
text: Bayta steps in front of Toran and brings him to a halt. She
text: moves close, and quietly asks:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Wouldn’t it be fun to get caught
dialog: in the rain?
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: I’m afraid I’m not following you.
text: Bayta looks frustrated. Takes his hand, and pulls him along.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I know this will come as a shock,
dialog: but there was a time when people
dialog: were commonly rained upon.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Is this going to be another one of
dialog: your history lessons?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (ignoring him)
dialog: What will the weather be today...
dialog: too hot? Too cold? No one knew.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Sounds horrific.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I want you to pretend it’s starting
dialog: to rain.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: But--
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I felt a drop. Did you? There’s
dialog: another. And another!
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Bayta, please--
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: It’s a downpour, we’re soaked to
dialog: the skin. What do we do, Toran?
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: I--
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: WHAT DO WE DO?!
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: (guessing)
dialog: Run for shelter?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: No, you idiot. You kiss the girl.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Inside of the rainfall?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 10.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Because it’s romantic.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: It’s romantic to expose yourself
dialog: and your partner to inclement
dialog: weather?
text: Suddenly Toran stops, realizing.
speaker_heading: TORAN (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait a minute. I know you. What
dialog: is this conversation really about?
text: Bayta looks pleased with herself, like she trapped him again.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: The Seldon Plan.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Oh no.
text: They wind their way through the square. Toran doesn’t want
text: to have this conversation. But he knows there is no way out:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: The equation tells us the future.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Yes. And without it, Foundation
dialog: never would have rebuilt
dialog: civilization in a thousand years.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I agree.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: You do?
text: Bayta gestures at the impressive city square all around them.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: We made it through the dark ages.
dialog: There’s been no war in a hundred
dialog: years. Peace and prosperity has
text: spread across the known universe.
text: The more positive she sounds, the more worried Toran becomes.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: ll.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Political, social, and economic
dialog: conflicts are identified and
text: resolved before they even begin.
text: Toran waits for the axe to fall.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Psycho-history has enabled us to
dialog: optimize our future, ushering in
dialog: an age of unparalleled progress!
text: Bayta turns to him. This is it.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: And the human race will never again
text: be caught in the rain.
dialog: (short pause)
dialog: Can’t you see why that’s wrong?
text: He thinks about it for a moment. Nods his head a little and:
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: No.
text: Bayta gives up. Starts walking.
speaker_heading: TORAN (CONT'D)
dialog: I have the same quibbles with the
dialog: current Foundation administration
dialog: as you. But without the equation,
dialog: the future would be nothing more
text: than an endless series of unknown
dialog: terrors. As a historian you know--
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I know there was a time when men
dialog: and women faced tomorrow bravely.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: And now, we've replaced “bravery”
dialog: with advanced mathematics. A more
dialog: than fair exchange if you ask me.
text: Bayta sees something and reacts.
speaker_heading: TORAN (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I think we’re being watched.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 12.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: A BUSINESSMAN sits at a table on the edge of the square. At
text: least that’s what he looks like, in his conservative suit,
text: with that BRIEFCASE on the ground next to his feet. PRITCHER
text: lifts a CUP to his lips. He does appear to be watching them.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Hm. What should we do?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Well we’re supposed to be on our
dialog: honeymoon, aren’t we?
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: So, it’s that kissing business
dialog: again, is it?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I’m afraid so, darling.
text: Bayta and Toran kiss. They look like a nice couple, deeply
text: in love, sharing a kiss in the middle of this bustling crowd.
text: They pull apart. Just a bit. Bayta peeks over his shoulder:
text: At the edge of the square, that businessman returns his cup
text: to the table. Reads his PAPER. Pays them no more attention.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: Was he suitably impressed?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: But that was a pretty good kiss.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: It was.
text: Toran looks up in the air, with:
speaker_heading: TORAN
dialog: And not a cloud in the--
text: SOMETHING FALLS from the sky. Too fast to see. It hits the
text: ground with a DEAFENING EXPLOSION. The world TILTS, crazily.
text: And everything goes pitch BLACK.
text: Now we see the square in ruins. THICK SMOKE hangs in the air
text: obscuring the RUBBLE AND BODIES.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: There is no sound but a RINGING.
text: It is the ringing in Bayta’s ears as she struggles to her
text: feet. She stumbles forward and
text: Bayta stares at the PEOPLE COVERED IN DIRT AND BLOOD, mouths
text: open in silent haunting screams.
text: She looks around, suddenly, wildly, searching for Toran. He
text: is not here, and Bayta stumbles.
text: She stares at a HUMAN ARM reaching out from under the rubble.
text: Suddenly Pritcher is beside her:
text: He is saying something, yelling, we don’t know what, all we
dialog: can hear is that damned RINGING.
text: Pritcher helps her and they run.
text: Up and down the street we see glimpses of a city being torn
text: asunder. BUILDINGS ARE FALLING.
text: They race through the smoke and
text: Slowly the sound begins to return. Anguished CRIES now we
text: wish we couldn’t hear. SCREAMS.
text: MORE SCARED PEOPLE struggle to get out of the square. Bayta
text: sees them. She reaches out and
text: They are encased in an odd GLOW.
text: Suddenly the people are REDUCED TO SKELETONS in front of her.
text: Bayta watches as the bones fall.
text: She can’t move. Just stares in horror. Pritcher grabs her
text: and pulls her down out of sight.
text: A LINE OF SOLDIERS emerges from the smoke, their faces hidden
text: under helmets. They are FIRING.
text: Pritcher forces Bayta into the twisted WRECKAGE of a vehicle.
text: Through broken glass they watch:
text: The soldiers disappear back into the smoke. Now a SHIP FLIES
text: OVERHEAD too fast to see. An EXPLOSION across the street and
text: The distant SCREAMS continue....
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
dialog: 14.
scene_heading: INT. BOMBED-OUT HOTEL -- NIGHT
text: The hotel has suffered obvious structural damage. SURVIVORS
text: gather in the lobby watching static on the cracked TV screen.
text: BAYTA looks battered and bloodied. Her tears dried up. She
text: waits with the rest as a desk CLERK tries to fix the picture.
text: An ELDERLY COUPLE holds onto one another. A MAN sits at the
text: bar burying himself in DRINK. A WOMAN walks the lobby like a
text: zombie. An EDUCATED MAN fights to keep his BROKEN GLASSES on
text: his face, as if to retain some small dignity. Men and women
text: alike are quietly WEEPING. A PRIEST moves among the WOUNDED.
text: PRITCHER stands apart from the others. Just watches. Waits.
text: A harsh WHINE comes over the speakers, and everyone looks up:
text: The television suddenly clears to reveal the PRESIDENT OF THE
text: PLANET seated at his desk. He looks composed, but strangely
text: so, and smiles for the cameras:
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT
dialog: Good evening, this is the President.
dialog: Less than one hour ago, I surrendered
text: the planet to the hostile forces of
text: an aggressor identified as “The Mule.”
text: Some people hold each other tighter. Others don’t dare move.
text: On screen the President smiles:
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
text: It is an unconditional surrender.
dialog: But I say to you now that our
dialog: world has not been imprisoned, but
text: freed. Soon the entire galaxy
dialog: will join us in this liberation--
text: Someone hands the President something. We don’t see what it
text: is. But the President seems absolutely delighted. He looks
text: down at his hands, then off screen, at somebody we can’t see.
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.
text: And now he turns back to the cameras, still smiling happily,
dialog: and RAISES A GUN to his temple:
speaker_heading: PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
dialog: Good people of Haven, it’s time for
dialog: me to go now. I leave this office
dialog: with high hopes...and confidence in
dialog: the future. Farewell--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Everyone in the lobby watches in horror. Their bodies jerk
text: at the SOUND OF THE SHOT. Some turn away and others CRY OUT.
text: The picture goes crazy again. A YOUNG WOMAN gets hysterical:
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: I want to go home. I don’t want to
dialog: stay here. I want to go home--
speaker_heading: ANGRY MAN
dialog: No one’s going anywhere. Don’t you
dialog: get it?!
speaker_heading: ELDERLY WOMAN
dialog: Stop yelling at her.
speaker_heading: WOUNDED MAN
dialog: I don’t understand. What happened
dialog: to the planetary defenses? How could
text: this “Mule” just march in and take
dialog: over the whole world?
speaker_heading: DRUNK MAN
dialog: Maybe he’s not human.
text: Everybody turns toward the bar.
speaker_heading: ANGRY MAN
dialog: What the hell does that mean?!
speaker_heading: DRUNK MAN
dialog: It means we don’t know what he is
dialog: .-..or what he isn’t, do we?
text: The angry man looks like he wants to go over there and beat
text: the hell out of him, but the educated man suddenly speaks up:
speaker_heading: EDUCATED MAN
dialog: I believe the pertinent question
dialog: is, where is the Foundation?
speaker_heading: WOUNDED WOMAN
dialog: Help is on the way. It has to be!
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: And what if it isn’t?
text: Pritcher watches Bayta closely.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: What if the Foundation doesn’t know
dialog: what happened here? What if no one
dialog: knows? That means we’re on our own.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 16.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: ELDERLY MAN
dialog: Young woman, that’s preposterous.
speaker_heading: EDUCATED MAN
dialog: I agree. The equation could not
dialog: fail to alert the Foundation to a
dialog: galactic event of this magnitude.
dialog: That priest crosses himself:
speaker_heading: PRIEST
dialog: Praise Seldon.
text: Several of the others cross themselves the same way. Repeat.
speaker_heading: OTHERS
dialog: (in unison)
dialog: Praise Seldon.
text: The drunk raises up his glass.
speaker_heading: DRUNK MAN
dialog: Praise Seldon!
speaker_heading: ANGRY MAN
dialog: Shut up, you--
text: The woman who has been walking the lobby like a zombie stops,
text: and extends her arm. Points.
speaker_heading: SHOCKED WOMAN
dialog: Look.
text: Everyone turns. Through the broken windows we see a group of
text: SOLDIERS MARCHING IN PERFECT FORMATION. They stop in front
text: of one of the other buildings.
text: Everybody moves to the windows to watch. The soldiers enter.
text: Within moments the FRIGHTENED PEOPLE inside the building are
text: forced out into the street, and the soldiers march them away.
text: They pass under a street lamp...and disappear into the night.
text: No one can find anything to say. Everyone slowly returns to
dialog: their places. Finally we get:
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Why did they take those people?
speaker_heading: DRUNK MAN
dialog: Don’t worry, darling. I’m sure
dialog: we'll find out soon enough.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: He quickly refills his glass. Can’t get drunk fast enough.
text: Bayta steps forward and says:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: We can’t just sit here and wait
dialog: for our turn.
text: No one speaks. No one even looks at her, as if embarrassed.
dialog: They know what’s coming next.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to do something. Fight.
text: She looks around for someone, anyone, who shows any response
text: at all, and then sees Pritcher. Bayta takes a chance on him:
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: What do you say, Mister--?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Pritcher.
text: Some of the others turn to see how he’ll respond. Pritcher
text: looks around the room. Pause.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: I say we should all try and get
dialog: some rest.
text: And Pritcher turns and walks out of the lobby. The angry man
text: chuckles, derisively. The disappointed Bayta watches him go.
scene_heading: INT. A CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER makes his way down a slightly damaged corridor. He
text: walks with a measured pace, not too fast, not too slow. It’s
text: almost as if his entire body is trained to give away nothing.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER enters his hotel room. The window is broken, and
text: there are spaces on the walls where the pictures have fallen.
text: He walks across to the window.
text: Pritcher looks out. Behind him the BRIEFCASE resting on the
text: table OPENS AUTOMATICALLY revealing the SUPERCOMPUTER within:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Good evening, sir.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER

scene_heading: INT. EBLING’S BEDROOM -- MORNING

scene_heading: INT. STERILE CORRIDOR -- MORNING
text: EBLING pulls his robe tight over his pajamas. He looks like

text: leads the grim AGENTS through a sterile high-tech passageway.
scene_heading: INT. EQUATION CHAMBER -- MORNING
text: A wide security door opens. EBLING and the Foundation AGENTS
text: step onto a PERSONAL TRANSPORT and the machine speeds them
text: down the weird mathematical corridors of the SELDON EQUATION.
text: The numbers and symbols stretch endlessly in every direction.
text: TECHNICIANS wearing high-tech bodysuits, seen earlier, patrol
dialog: their designated zones recording any changes in the equation.
text: The floors are invisible so everyone appears to be floating
text: inside mathematics. The agents are looking a bit...nauseous.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
text: It gets to everyone the first time.
dialog: If you’re going to be sick, try to
dialog: use the bags please.
text: He gestures at the SICK BAGS hanging on the console. Works

text: Ebling still views the Seldon equation with wide-eyed wonder:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Look around, gentlemen. Grasp the

dialog: began solving itself 1,000 years
dialog: ago, and has never stopped running.
text: They continue to quickly rise.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: AGENT

speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: That’s odd. Haven’t seen that
dialog: one before--
text: Suddenly the equation begins to transform all around them at
dialog: a frightening rate. It’s like the system just went totally
text: berserk. THEY ARE INSIDE A RAGING STORM OF NUMBERS. And now

speaker_heading: OLD MAN (CONT’D)
dialog: Azi, Azi, Azi?
text: Bayta watches him. She looks up. Sees HAUNTED FACES peeking

text: Bayta is almost trampled by MORE SOLDIERS. She jumps back.
text: Sees a STREET VENDOR watching.
speaker_heading: STREET VENDOR
text: More soldiers every day.
text: His cart is broken and barely stocked. The man offers her a

dialog: knows something that we don’t:
speaker_heading: STREET VENDOR (CONT’D)
dialog: More of them...and less of us.
text: Bayta backs away from him. Starts to walk faster and faster.
text: She reaches a large intersection and tries to make her way
text: across, but in the middle of the roadway she suddenly stops,
text: looking dizzy. Bayta tries to clear her head. Looks around.
text: Everyone in the intersection is stopped dead in their tracks.
text: Batya watches a WOMAN IN RAGGED CLOTHES drop to the ground.
text: Now a MAN. A whole GROUP. Bayta looks confused, and then
text: her legs give out. She drops. Bayta hits the pavement hard.
text: She GASPS for breath. Scared.
text: BAYTA’S P.O.V. The sky overhead is heavy with smoke. She
text: can’t move. There is RUNNING. Someone is coming closer and
text: closer. Now a SOLDIER enters the frame. Stares down at her.
text: He studies Bayta, then moves on.
text: Soldiers are running through the intersection, from body to
text: body, as if looking for someone.
text: They stand at attention as a SMALL FLYER descends from above.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 23.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: And now at last we see THE MULE.
text: His true identity is hidden beneath the shimmering LAYERS OF
text: FORCEFIELD that make up his body armor, but we can see that
text: there is a man inside, his FEATURES BLURRED and lost, like
text: some creepy technological ghost.
text: The Mule is always accompanied by an unnerving electrical
text: HUM. He steps from the flyer. The fields shift and CRACKLE.
text: A soldier runs to him. Salutes.
speaker_heading: SOLDIER
dialog: No sign of the escaped prisoner, sir.
text: The Mule seems to sense something. Turns and looks at Bayta.
text: She is still lying helpless on the pavement, unable to move,
text: but she hears the growing HUM of the forcefields as the Mule
text: approaches. Her eyes widen as:
text: BAYTA’S P.O.V. The Mule stands over her, and now he moves
text: closer. His eerie undefined face is only inches away. Bayta
text: looks right into his forcefield and sees her own TERRIFIED
text: REFLECTION staring back at her.
text: His voice emanates from inside the fields in DISTORTED waves:
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: You are not indigenous to this place.
dialog: Tell the Foundation that I am coming
dialog: for them. Tell them I am the Mule...
text: He reaches a hand toward her. Bayta tries to move but can’t.
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
dialog: Tell them only the dead have seen the
dialog: end of war.
text: He touches her. HORRIFYING IMAGES rush through Bayta’s mind,
text: invading her, terrorizing her. Suffering and death. Her
text: body convulses. She YELLS OUT.
text: And sees that the Mule is GONE.
text: Bayta can move. Slowly the people on the road begin to stir.
text: Bayta rolls onto her side. Watches the soldiers march away.
text: And now she sees something new.
text: LONG TWISTED FINGERS are protruding from a SEWER in the road.
text: Bayta watches. She tries to make sense of what she’s seeing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 24.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: The fingers grasp the rusty metal grate, trying to wrench it
text: open. Something is down in the sewers struggling to get out.
text: She crawls to the hole. Looks:
text: BAYTA’S P.O.V. Through the grate Bayta glimpses a CREATURE
text: HIDDEN IN THE SHADOWS. She startles it. The thing releases
text: its grip and drops out of view.
text: Bayta stares into the darkness.
text: She considers her options. No way does Bayta want to go down
text: there. She opens the sewer cover and slips beneath the city.
scene_heading: INT. SEWER SYSTEM -- DAY
text: The sewers are a dark, foul, inhospitable maze. BAYTA climbs
text: down the metal ladder and steps into an obscene river. She
dialog: doesn’t know which way it went.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You’re the one they’re looking for,
dialog: aren’t you? Hello? I know you’re
dialog: down here--
text: She detects movement and stops. The strange thing, whatever
text: it is, hangs back in the deep recesses. But its eyes catch
text: the light. Bayta moves closer.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: My name is Bayta. W-what’s yours?
text: The creature continues to move along the wall, hiding itself.
text: A gravelly little croak comes:
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: I don’t know.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You don’t know your name?
text: A sudden burst of odd LAUGHTER.
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: He calls me “Magnifico.”
speaker_heading: BAYTA

speaker_heading: THE VOICE

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Why is he looking for you?
text: The eyes burn with hate in the dark. That voice grows angry:
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: Why do you think? To find me!
dialog: To start the hurt!
text: Bayta lost track of the creature. She moves deeper into the
text: sewer trying to follow the voice.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: He tortures you?
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: Yes.
text: She turns at the sound. Follows.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Why does he torture you?
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: Because I’ve seen it.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Seen what?
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: Seen his face!
text: The creature is right beside her. Bayta stops. Reaches out.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Can I see your face?
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: NO! GO AWAY!
text: It comes out of the dark like a growl. Bayta can’t help but
text: tense up. Still she stands firm.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I’m not going anywhere until you
text: step into the light.
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: You don’t want to see me.
speaker_heading: BAYTA

speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I don’t think so.
speaker_heading: THE VOICE
dialog: (softer)
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Because if you were dangerous...
dialog: I’d already be dead.
text: Bayta stands there. Arm extended.
text: A trembling hand with long skinny fingers reaches out of the
dialog: blackness.
text: Slowly it takes her hand, and now MAGNIFICO steps
text: into the light. He is ugly and deformed...but not a monster.
dialog: Magnifico
dialog: smaller.
dialog: She looks
text: is short. His twisted spine makes him appear even
text: His face is aged but he acts like a frightened boy.
text: at him with compassion. It’s not what he expected.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to take you somewhere,
dialog: Magnifico. You want to come?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: (cautious)
dialog: Where?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Out of the sewer. And then, if
dialog: we’re lucky, to a planet at the
text: edge of the galaxy.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: And you want to take me there?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: So you can tell everyone what
dialog: you know about the Mule.
text: Magnifico looks like he’s in pain, or remembers being in
text: pain. He jerks a little and:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Will there be places to hide?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You won’t need to hide anymore.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Yes I will. And you too.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Then we'll hide together.
text: He thinks about it, very unsure.
text: Now FOOTSTEPS echo through the sewer. They see the DISTORTED
text: SHADOWS of pursuing soldiers spreading over the tunnel walls.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: He’s coming!
text: Magnifico is one second away from fleeing into the dark never
text: to be seen again. She knows it.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (talking fast)
dialog: I need you to hold onto my hand,
dialog: and not let go. You understand?
dialog: (short pause,
dialog: and trying: )
dialog: If you let go I’1l be all alone.
text: He looks at her. Some part of him responds, and he holds on,
text: previously undiscovered courage flashing across his ignoble
text: face. He takes a brave stance.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Don’t be scared, Magnifico will
dialog: hold your hand.
text: And they run off down the tunnel.
text: They don’t get far before the walls fill with MORE SHADOWS
text: blocking their escape. Bayta and Magnifico look around. See
text: another passage and hurry inside.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 28.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: They find a ladder to the surface. They start to ascend but
text: see SOLDIERS STANDING GUARD ON THE STREET above. They duck
text: out of sight, and keep on moving.
text: They emerge into a larger tunnel and bolt across the open
text: space for the far side. A group of soldiers hears them, and
text: for a moment, Bayta and Magnifico are bathed in bright LIGHT.
text: They run inside another opening.
text: They find a second ladder leading to the surface, but it’s
text: guarded just like the first one.
text: The sound of FOOTSTEPS grows louder as the soldiers close in.
text: Bayta and Magnifico race down a final tunnel. They reach a
text: GATE and pull on the rusty bars.
text: It is locked. They are trapped.
text: They see the SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching down the center
text: of the tunnel. He is backlit by the flashlights from the
text: search party following close behind. We cannot see his face.
text: Magnifico starts to panic. Pulls wildly on the gate. Bayta
text: looks for the locking mechanism.
text: And then she sees it. On the other side of the gate is an
text: extremely long tunnel, and down at the far end, almost too
text: small to see, is a tiny KEYHOLE.
text: Bayta’s face loses all hope. Magnifico stops fighting. He
text: slides to the floor, WHIMPERING.
text: THE SOUNDS OF PURSUIT ECHO THROUGH THE TUNNEL. Like a whole
text: army is coming for them. The silhouetted man moves closer.
dialog: We still can’t make him out....
text: Bayta turns to face the man and
text: He steps closer. It’s PRITCHER.
text: Bayta can’t believe her eyes. Pritcher doesn’t bother with
text: hellos. He moves past her, looks through the gate, and sets
text: his BRIEFCASE down on the ledge.
text: A light on the edge of the case BLINKS as the computer talks:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Please remain calm while we initiate
dialog: your rescue.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 29.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: Bayta watches Pritcher pull out a STRANGE GUN. He extends
text: the barrel to make it longer, looks through the gate again,
text: and makes the barrel even longer.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT’D)
dialog: Distance to the locking mechanism is
text: seventy meters.
text: Bayta watches him work and the truth is beginning to sink in:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: How did you get here? Are you
dialog: following me?
text: He pulls out a little SOFT BLOB of some kind of material,
text: molds it into the shape of a bullet -- and loads the chamber.
text: Pritcher aims through the gate at the keyhole on the far end.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Who are you?!
text: He doesn’t answer her. Just concentrates on making the shot.
text: Bayta turns and sees the LIGHTS GETTING CLOSER. The soldiers
text: are almost here. Not much time.
text: Pritcher stares down the barrel.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: As a point of interest, we will
dialog: be apprehended in approximately
dialog: twenty seconds.
text: The soldiers are nearly on them.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Shoot it now!
text: Pritcher stares down the barrel.
text: And he FIRES. The bullet speeds down the long tunnel INTO
text: THE KEYHOLE. The soft bullet material SPLATTERS inside the
text: lock, and triggers the tumblers.
text: The gate CLICKS and swings open.
text: They run through the open gate and disappear down the tunnel.
dialog: 30.
scene_heading: EXT. OCCUPIED CITY -- DAY
text: A sewer cover swings open. PRITCHER, BAYTA, and MAGNIFICO
text: climb out into a narrow alley. Look around. Magnifico is
text: clinging tightly to Bayta’s hand.
text: They run down the length of the alley. Look over the street:
text: They see a group of SOLDIERS standing watch at either end of
text: the block. They bolt for the alley directly across the road.
text: The soldiers are looking the other way and don’t notice them.
text: They race down the alley and run right into MORE SOLDIERS.
text: Before anyone can raise a weapon Pritcher drops his BRIEFCASE
text: and attacks. He moves with an almost mathematical precision.
text: A soldier grabs Bayta from behind.
text: The frightened Magnifico wants to run and hide. But he sees
text: Bayta being assaulted, and can’t. Finally he lets go a wild
text: SCREAM. He charges at the soldier but is easily pushed away.
text: Magnifico lands by that briefcase:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: May I suggest you pick me up and
text: propel me in a broad lateral arc.
text: Magnifico picks up the case -- and swings it savagely. The
text: blow knocks off the soldier’s battle helmet and he goes down.
text: Magnifico just stands there, BREATHING rapidly. He looks
text: terrified. Surprised. Thrilled.
text: Pritcher drops the final soldier.
text: Bayta steps closer to the one who attacked her, like she
text: doesn’t understand what she’s seeing, and suddenly she GASPS.
text: The soldier’s face. It is TORAN.
text: Pritcher hurries to another soldier and rips off the helmet.
text: Underneath is the face of an OLD MAN. He removes another and
text: sees a TEEN-AGE GIRL. He pulls off a third to reveal the
text: head of a BALDING HEAVY-SET MIDDLE-AGED MAN. Under the last
text: helmet he sees a matronly woman who must be someone’s MOTHER.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (0.S.)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)

dialog: knew except for that uniform.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: He was turned.
text: Suddenly Toran’s eyes open...
text: Bayta looks at him, hopefully. She opens her mouth to say
text: something. And he puts his hands around her neck. Squeezes.
text: Toran’s face is filled with rage and hate as he chokes Bayta.
text: She tries to get his hands off her neck, but can’t, staring
text: into that twisted version of a face she used to know so well.
text: Toran rolls on top of her and
text: Pritcher tries to pull him off. He hits Toran several times
text: and finally breaks him loose.
text: Bayta GASPS for air. Toran runs at them, like a wild animal.
text: A SHOT rings out and a RED HOLE appears in his back. Bayta
text: SCREAMS as Toran goes down. MORE SHOTS ring out and the
text: walls all around them erupt. Pritcher is GRAZED BY A BULLET.
text: SOLDIERS are running into the alley from the street SHOOTING.
text: Pritcher pulls Bayta to her feet. She tries to fight for a
text: moment, wanting to stay, trying to get to Toran, but he pulls
text: her away and finally she runs.
text: The soldiers are gaining ground. Still FIRING. Pritcher
text: leads Bayta and Magnifico toward a RUN-DOWN OLD SHACK. They
text: hurry inside, as if hoping to find a place to hide. The old
text: door with a broken hinge BANGS awkwardly shut. Moments pass.
text: The soldiers approach the shack, cautiously. Weapons raised.
text: They methodically surround the building. Still no sound or
text: movement from inside. Slowly they begin to close the circle.
text: A soldier reaches the door and
text: The shack BURSTS APART as a SMALL SPACECRAFT ROCKETS THROUGH
text: THE ROOF rising toward the sky on a trail of SMOKE AND FLAME.

scene_heading: INT. PRITCHER’S SHIP -- DAY

speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Systems are go. Firing booster
dialog: in five, four, three, two, one.
text: There is a DEAFENING ROAR and everyone is forced back into
text: their seats. It looks painful. Through the cockpit windows
text: we watch the sky dissolve away. Now they begin to see STARS.
text: The booster rockets cut out and the ship falls SILENT. They
text: are floating above the planet.
text: Finally they have a moment to rest. They look beaten down,
text: all of them, especially Bayta, just staring out at the stars.
text: Then comes the unwelcome BEEP.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT'D)
dialog: I have a proximity alert.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Hard to say.
text: They look through the window. Nothing for a moment. Then we
text: can see that something is floating closer, tumbling slowly
text: end-over-end. Gradually it takes the shape of a human being.
text: It is a BODY horrifically embalmed by the pressures of space.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Oh no...
text: Pritcher, Bayta, and Magnifico can only watch as the corpse
text: drifts toward them striking the cockpit with a ghastly THUNK.

speaker_heading: COMPUTER

speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I’1l get him.

text: SPACE. She floats past the petrified corpses of the dead and
text: Magnifico stares in wide-eyed wonder. She drifts toward him.
text: Bayta breaks his forcefield and lands inside his tiny section
text: of the ship. BLOOD TRAILS FROM HER EYES AND EARS. The
text: vessels in her cheeks have burst in the vacuum. She looks
text: like she’s passed through hell, and yet, her voice is gentle:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
text: Hide in my arms.
text: Magnifico buries himself in her body. Bayta holds him tight.
text: Pritcher yanks on the tether and
text: Bayta and Magnifico sail back across the void through a sea
text: of corpses. ONE OF THE DRIFTING BODIES seems to watch them
text: pass, staring with horrific eyes, its mouth open grotesquely.
text: Magnifico never moves. Just holds on. Bayta looks like she
dialog: is not going to survive when
text: They break through the forcefield...and drop to the floor of
text: the sliced cargo hold. Pritcher hurries over. Looks at her.
text: And yells toward the cockpit:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Get us out of here!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 35.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
text: The small ship jumps across space. Through the windows we

scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Magnifico cradles the unconscious Bayta. He gently caresses
text: her bruised cheek, and carefully sets one hair back in place.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Did you see how she flew? She
dialog: flew across the universe, just
dialog: to save me.
text: Pritcher injects her arm with the contents of an odd SYRINGE.
text: Magnifico watches him work.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: (innocently)
dialog: Has anybody ever done that for
dialog: you?
text: Pritcher just shakes his head. Finishes his work. Finally:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: You’re a lucky man.
text: Magnifico watches him walk off. It looks like that had an
dialog: impact on him, like no one ever called him lucky before, or
dialog: even referred to him as a man.
text: Pritcher reenters the cockpit.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
text: Ready for the next jump.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Go.
text: The small ship jumps across space. Through the windows we
text: watch the galaxy BLUR and a NEW SET OF STARS takes its place.
text: Magnifico is still thinking about what Pritcher said. He
text: looks down at Bayta cradled in his arms and pulls her closer.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
text: Bayta opens her eyes. Sees where she is. Magnifico is lying
text: beside her, sleeping like a baby. We have never seen him so
text: peaceful. Very carefully Bayta slips out from under his arm.
text: She covers him with a BLANKET.
text: Bayta moves toward the cockpit and steps inside. Pritcher is
text: at the controls. He knows that she entered but says nothing.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 36.

speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Thank you. For getting us off
dialog: the planet.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: You’re welcome. Feeling better?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Yes.
text: Suddenly, she looks impatient:
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Now that that’s out of the way...
dialog: can I ask you a fucking question?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Sure.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (angry)
dialog: How did the Foundation let this
dialog: happen? You people are supposed
dialog: to know everything.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Let’s review what we do know.
text: Pritcher hits a button on the control panel. PICTURES AND
text: SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE OF BAYTA appear floating in the cockpit.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re a Foundation-er by birth.
dialog: Real name is Bayta Darrel. You
dialog: are a Level 4 historian, and a
dialog: member of the Seldon opposition
dialog: -.-the so-called “underground.”
text: Pritcher turns. Looks at her.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Until a few weeks ago, you were
text: being held for questioning on
dialog: suspicion of conspiring against
dialog: the Foundation.
text: Bayta watches surveillance footage of her and Toran. They
text: look like they’re escaping from some kind of prison facility.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: You escaped from detention along
dialog: with a fellow subversive you met

dialog: relationship while masquerading
text: as a married couple on honeymoon.
text: Bayta plops in a seat. Waits.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
text: Then the bombs started dropping.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Okay. So you were following me.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: You seem to have a talent for
dialog: attracting conflict. You are
text: dynamic, vigorous, and lively.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Are you asking me out?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: I thought if I followed you
dialog: around you’d eventually stumble
dialog: into something interesting.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: What the hell kind of spy are you?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: I collect information. Right
dialog: now your little friend back
dialog: there is the only source of
dialog: information we have regarding
dialog: the Mule.
text: She watches him. He goes on.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s developed an attachment to
dialog: you. That’s good. But it means
dialog: I’m going to need your help.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: My help.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: To awaken the Foundation.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 38.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (6)
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (skeptical)
dialog: You think it needs to be “awakened?”
dialog: From what?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: The Foundation never acts unless
dialog: told to by the equation. If the
dialog: equation is no longer predicting
dialog: the future we’re in grave danger.
text: She smiles.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Why Mr. Pritcher, you sound like
dialog: an intellectual subversive.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: For the time being, yes.
text: The computer abruptly speaks:
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: We are prepped for final jump.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Go.
dialog: (back to Bayta)
dialog: That monster didn’t invade Haven
dialog: for wealth or territory. He is
dialog: taking the population and making
dialog: an army -- and now we know why.
dialog: A subspace transmission arrived
dialog: while you were sleeping.
text: The small ship jumps across space. Through the windows we
text: watch the galaxy BLUR and a NEW SET OF STARS takes its place.
text: And now, there is a planet. Pritcher and Bayta see TERMINUS.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT'D)
text: The Mule has just declared war on
dialog: the Foundation.
scene_heading: EXT. PLANET TERMINUS -- DAY
text: The surface of Terminus is barren and hostile. Like a large
text: desolate moon. But it holds a population that lives in the
dialog: best comfort high technology can offer -- a DOMED FUTURISTIC
text: CITY that fulfills the promise of one thousand years of hope.
dialog: 39.
scene_heading: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAY
text: MAYOR INDBAR stands at a podium addressing a large council
text: chamber filled with empty seats. WORKERS are visible on the
text: perimeter readying the chamber for some official celebration.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: ...and so as we commemorate the
dialog: end of the thousand year plan, we
dialog: recall the words of Hari Seldon...
text: He sees EBLING MIS step up and:
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR (CONT’D)
dialog: Ah, Ebling! You’re just in time
dialog: to hear my speech. Take a seat.
text: Ebling looks like he doesn’t like him but wants to play nice.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Right now
dialog: I’d like to discuss an important
dialog: matter with you, if I may?
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: An important matter? Oh, you’re
dialog: talking about that little glitch
dialog: with the equation.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I’m not sure if “glitch” is the
dialog: term I would use.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: I was told that the equation has
text: returned to normal.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Well, yes, it has--
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Then I’d say that glitch was an
dialog: appropriate term for a brief
dialog: technical problem that has been
dialog: resolved, wouldn’t you?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I suppose so--
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Good. I’m glad we settled that.
dialog: Now stand here while I check the
dialog: lighting. I don’t want to look
text: washed out during the broadcast.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 40.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Ebling doesn’t want to do it, but as the Mayor hurries off
text: the stage, he takes his place at the podium. Now Ebling’s
text: voice is magnified by the mike:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Sir, the equation underwent a
dialog: massive system failure a moment
text: after the appearance of a new
dialog: construct.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: A new construct?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: (explaining)
text: A complex representation that is
dialog: constructed from other simpler
dialog: representations. A new symbol I
dialog: haven’t seen before.
text: Mayor Indbar stops backing up. He stares at Ebling on stage.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: You’re a learned man, Professor,
dialog: but no one can know every single
dialog: inch of the equation.
text: Ebling is getting excited. He steps to the side of the small
text: podium and gestures animatedly:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Yes, sir, of course. But that’s
dialog: just it! This symbol has never
dialog: come up before. It’s never been
dialog: catalogued. Never appeared once
dialog: in a thousand years.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Uh, would you move back behind
dialog: the podium, please?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: What? Oh, sorry.
text: Ebling moves back in place. The Mayor does not look pleased.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: You look washed out.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: About this symbol--
text: The Mayor stares up at the ceiling. Tries to see the lights.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 41.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: (interrupting)
dialog: Did anyone else see it?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Did anyone see this mysterious
dialog: symbol, except for you?
text: Ebling doesn’t like where this is going. He takes a piece of
text: PAPER from his pocket. DRAWS A STRANGE SYMBOL. Holds it up.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: This is it, sir. As closely as
dialog: I can remember it.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: And what do you think it means?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I believe it may represent an
dialog: individual.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: That would be odd, wouldn’t it?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: (encouraged)
dialog: Yes, sir. Very much so.
text: Ebling descends the stage to get away from that mike. Speaks
text: in hushed tones as they walk.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Psycho-history concerns itself
dialog: with the actions of large groups
dialog: of people, whole societies, never
dialog: individuals. It’s possible that
dialog: an individual has arisen for whom
text: the equation is unable to adjust.
dialog: Now admittedly, it would have to
dialog: be an extraordinary individual--
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: (dismissive)
dialog: I doubt extraordinary men exist
dialog: in this day and age.
text: Ebling stops for a moment. He watches the Mayor walk ahead.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 42.
dialog: (3)
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Excuse me for saying so, Mayor,
dialog: but hasn’t war been declared?
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: You’re talking about this “mule”
dialog: character. My dear Professor,
dialog: there is a great deal of space
dialog: between us and the planet Haven.
text: Now we see an OLD ORNATE VAULT. It’s like an ancient relic.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR (CONT’D)
dialog: They say Seldon himself would
dialog: walk out of this vault, back in
dialog: the early days, and address the
dialog: Foundation at times of crisis.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I know the stories.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Do you believe them?
text: Ebling doesn’t answer lightly:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: With my whole heart and soul.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: You’re a man of solid faith. I
dialog: admire that, but I myself don’t
dialog: believe a word of it.
text: Mayor Indbar turns and places his hand on Ebling’s shoulder.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR (CONT’D)
dialog: Hari Seldon was a great man...
text: but still only a man. There is
dialog: no need anymore for old myths.
dialog: The reality around us is proof
dialog: enough. We made it. We saved
dialog: the human race from extinction.
text: He looks at the vault again.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR (CONT’D)
dialog: I don’t believe that Seldon is
dialog: going to step out of that vault
dialog: any more than I think some kind
dialog: of extraordinary superman is on
dialog: his way here to destroy mankind.
text: Ebling’s time is clearly up:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 43.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR (CONT’D)
dialog: Is the equation working?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Yes--
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: And what is it telling us to do
dialog: about this “mule?”
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: (pleased)
dialog: Then stop worrying, and start
dialog: enjoying yourself.

speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR (CONT’D)
dialog: This is a time for celebration!
scene_heading: INT. AUSTERE CORRIDOR -- DAY
text: BAYTA and MAGNIFICO wait outside a door. Magnifico obviously
dialog: does not want to go through there.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Maybe they don’t want to see me.
dialog: Maybe we should go. Maybe--
text: Bayta reassures him, with a touch.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: This is why we came. Remember?
text: Magnifico nods his head a little.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: I’1l be right beside you.
text: The door opens, and PRITCHER steps out. He gestures them in.
scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY
text: MAGNIFICO sits in an imposing chair with a strange APPARATUS
text: attached to his head. He looks nervous. BAYTA is beside him
text: holding his hand. PRITCHER stands a distance away from them.
text: A group of grim INTERROGATORS stare at Magnifico coldly, and:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 44,
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: Is it true that you have been a
dialog: prisoner of the Mule?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Y-yes.
text: Behind Magnifico, IMAGES FROM HIS MIND appear, a playback,
text: multiple memories going at once. It’s crazy visual insanity.
text: From the point of view of a prisoner, we are THROWN INTO A
text: DARK CELL. Laughed at by cruel GUARDS. Repeatedly TORTURED.
text: And now we see THE MULE, that ghostly suggestion of a human
text: being hidden under his forcefields. He oversees the torture.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 2
text: He hides his identity behind a
text: personal forcefield.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: But you have seen his true face
dialog: with your own eyes?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 3
dialog: What does he look like?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I don’t remember.
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1

speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I don’t remember.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 2
dialog: What does he look like?
text: Magnifico jerks in the chair, as if in physical pain. He is
text: terrified. Bayta holds on tighter. She wants to object, but
text: suddenly, Magnifico’s spasms subside. He stares out at them,
text: as if in some trance, possessed by his own fearsome memories:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: He is a man.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: Like us?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: No. Not like you.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 2
dialog: Describe him.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
text: He is tall. He stands above me
text: like a giant.
dialog: 45.
text: We see a DISTORTED IMAGE of an impossibly large man, so tall
text: his face is lost in the shadows.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 3
dialog: Would you say he was six feet tall?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 2
dialog: Seven feet tall?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Yes.
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: What is he doing to you?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
text: He’s putting his arm around my
text: throat, and picking me up. He
text: is holding me up with one hand
dialog: ...and I can’t breathe.
text: The distorted image is lifting Magnifico.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 2
dialog: Can you see his face?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: (almost a sob)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: INTERROGATOR 3
dialog: Why not?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO

speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO

scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: You see inside his head? Are you
dialog: speaking figuratively?
text: Magnifico LAUGHS. Very creepy.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: No.
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: Then what do you mean?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I mean I see inside his head. He
text: has no skull. His brains. I see
dialog: his brains.
text: The interrogators share a surprised look. Pritcher watches
text: them. Bayta squeezes his hand:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
text: His skin is torn away. I can
text: see the muscles underneath. He
text: has no lips. I see his teeth
text: even when his mouth is closed.
text: The portrait of the Mule forms for all to see, an IMAGE OF
text: ASTOUNDING HORROR, constantly adjusting as Magnifico goes on:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: (getting upset)
text: I see two holes where his eyes
text: should be. He has no eyes, but
dialog: he can see me. He has no eyes
dialog: but he can see!

speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)

text: He just goes limp in their arms. Bayta shares a look with
text: Pritcher. Follows them out. The door slides shut again and:
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: Captain. What is the point of
dialog: showing us the exaggerated memories
dialog: of a damaged mind?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: I’m not sure his account can be
dialog: dismissed so easily.
text: They look at him, skeptically.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Consider this. The Mule commands
text: an army -- and yet he conceals his
dialog: true appearance, even from his own
dialog: men. Why give up the advantage of
dialog: personal leadership?
dialog: They seem willing to go along.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: The reason may be that personal
dialog: contact would reveal a fact it is
dialog: vitally important not to reveal.
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: Such as?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: The Mule is not a human being.

scene_heading: INT. SPACESHIP CORRIDOR -- DAY

scene_heading: INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY
text: PRITCHER gestures as he speaks:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: During the attack, and despite my
dialog: training, I experienced a feeling
dialog: of overwhelming panic. I think
dialog: the Mule can trigger emotions over
dialog: relatively large distances. Make
dialog: you feel terror or despair.
text: The INTERROGATORS fidget uncomfortably as they listen to him.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT'D)
text: At close range it appears he can
text: access top-level brain waves.
dialog: Make you see something or forget
dialog: something. Cause a memory to be
dialog: associated with pain, as we have
dialog: witnessed in this room today.
text: He steps closer. Keeps at it:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Given time I believe he can alter
dialog: neurological patterns and rewrite
dialog: minds. I’ve seen normal men and
dialog: women converted into bloodthirsty
dialog: soldiers. Magnifico called them

speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: By now, we have to assume that
dialog: the entire population of Haven
dialog: has been affected. The Mule
dialog: is free to move from planet to
dialog: planet assimilating even greater
dialog: numbers into the single largest
dialog: military force ever conceived.
text: Pritcher makes his final play:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: Can a genetic accident be taken
dialog: into account by the Plan? How
dialog: could Seldon have foreseen this?
text: His words hang in the air like the most outrageous blasphemy.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: It took us a thousand years to
dialog: build the Foundation. If we do
dialog: nothing, it will take the Mule
dialog: an hour to lay it in ruins....
text: They just stare, for a long time, and say nothing. Finally:
scene_heading: INTERROGATOR 1
dialog: Thank you, Captain. We will
dialog: consider all of the evidence
dialog: presented here today before
dialog: making our recommendation to
dialog: the council.

scene_heading: EXT. ABOVE PLANET HAVEN -- DAY

speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Are you sure about this, sir?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Quite sure, Captain. I think I
dialog: can be of some use to him, and he
dialog: may still have secrets locked up
text: inside that head of his.
text: He looks them over as if to gauge:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I take it today did not go well.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Ha.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Not very well. No.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 52.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Try not to judge them too harshly.
dialog: (for Bayta)
dialog: It’s impossible to learn what one
dialog: thinks one already knows.
text: Bayta rolls her eyes. Ebling sees that Magnifico is nearing
text: a tall stand holding some kind of strange MUSICAL INSTRUMENT.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Good boy. Now pick it up--
text: Magnifico picks up the instrument. Looks at it. It’s an odd
text: little device with a single knob, and certain to attract him.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Ah, what have you got there?
text: Ebling walks over. Looks at it.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It’s called a visi-sonar. fry it.
text: Magnifico stares at it, uncertain. He places his finger on
text: the lone knob. A SINGLE PLAINTIVE NOTE OF MUSIC is heard,
text: and his eyes widen in surprise.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Where did that come from?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: From you, my friend.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I have music inside me?
text: Ebling looks at him, with great warmth, and gently explains:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: We all do. Every living creature.
text: The sounds and songs of life. It
dialog: is said the best players can strike
dialog: notes that are never heard by the
text: ears, but go directly to the soul.
text: Magnifico is clearly impressed.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: This will be yours to keep while
dialog: you’re here.
text: Magnifico happily nods his head and ambles off, like a kid
text: with a toy. Ebling is pleased.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 53.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: (back to Pritcher)
dialog: I have always believed in the
dialog: therapeutic value of--
text: He watches the elevator doors slide SHUT. Pritcher has just
text: left. Bayta tries to look as if she doesn’t care either way.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Not much for good-byes, is he?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
text: Not so big with hellos either.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You like him.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (as if appalled)
dialog: What makes you say that?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Your overly-calculated body
dialog: language intended to convince
dialog: me that you don’t like him.
text: Bayta doesn’t know how to position her body now. Resorts to:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Damn it.
text: Magnifico touches the instrument again, and hears another
text: note. Tries again. Ebling and Bayta move onto the terrace.
text: The view is stunning. We see a great deal of the city, and
text: beyond the enclosure, the grim moon-like terrain of Terminus.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You’ve become a common criminal.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: There’s nothing common about it.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: What would your parents say?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (defiant)
dialog: I don’t know. They died in a
dialog: shuttle accident when I was two.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I’ve told you all about them.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 54.
dialog: (3)
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: It’s not the same thing.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: They dedicated their lives to
dialog: the Seldon Plan.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: It didn't save them, did it?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You know very well the equation
dialog: doesn’t concern itself with the
dialog: deaths of specific individuals.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (getting upset)
dialog: Then to hell with it!
text: Bayta calms down. She knows that was pointless. From the
text: other room, they can hear Magnifico PLAYING. It is tentative
text: and clumsy, of course, not even music. But she is surprised.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: He’s really playing that thing.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: It doesn’t require coordination
dialog: or skill, just a kind of free-
dialog: form mentality. The best players
dialog: are often of low intelligence.
text: They are discussing Magnifico in order to avoid arguing.
text: Finally after an awkward pause:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Hari Seldon will not abandon the
dialog: Foundation. He has watched over
dialog: us for a thousand years.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You really believe that.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Have faith.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You’re a scientist.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Science without religion is lame
dialog: --.and religion, without science,
dialog: is blind.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 55.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Bayta is getting upset again, and that music is not helping
text: matters. HAUNTING EXTENDED NOTES. It is really very creepy.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Is it supposed to sound like that?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I wouldn’t expect it to sound any
dialog: more pleasant, seeing what kind
dialog: of life that poor creature has no
dialog: doubt led.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I guess the equation didn’t give a
dialog: damn about him, either.
text: Ebling looks at her. Saddened.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: How could I have failed so totally?
dialog: I tried to teach you, but you hate
dialog: it. The equation. The Seldon Plan.
dialog: You hate too much.
text: They realize the music has stopped. And Magnifico is there.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Are you fighting?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Not really. Just continuing an
dialog: old discussion.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: About what?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: A man named Hari Seldon.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: What did he do?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: He died for us.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: That’s too bad.
text: Ebling moves down to his level.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: No. No, it’s not. Do you want
dialog: to see what he did?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 56.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (5)
text: Magnifico nods, and they start to go. But Ebling pauses for
text: a moment before leaving the terrace. He says one last thing
text: to Bayta, without looking back:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m glad you’re home.
text: Bayta looks surprised and wants to respond, but can’t find
text: the words...and then he’s gone.
scene_heading: INT. EQUATION CHAMBER -- DAY
text: EBLING MIS and MAGNIFICO lie on their backs in the center of
dialog: the Seldon equation. It looks unusual, that’s for sure, the
text: two of them lying there so casually, on an invisible floor,
text: floating in a universe of math:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I wanted to show you my favorite
text: spot. From here it looks endless.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: (very impressed)
dialog: And Hari Seldon gave this to you?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: He gave the equation to all of us.
dialog: You too.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: No. Not me.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Why do you say that?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Because I am nothing.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You’re a human being.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: That’s not so big a deal.
text: Ebling thinks about him. Asks:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Don’t you have a family?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: My mother threw me away. No one
dialog: wants an ugly child.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: Magnifico
dialog: 57.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Where did you grow up?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: On the streets. I can find food
text: and clothes and hide.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Then you’ve always been alone.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Yes. I used to like it, but now
dialog: I like being with Bayta.
text: looks worried. Like maybe he said the wrong thing.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: Is that okay?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Of course. I like being with her
dialog: too.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Can you read these funny numbers?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Most of them. But I’m not a real
dialog: psycho-historian. There are none.
dialog: Only Hari Seldon truly understood
dialog: how the equation works.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Why didn’t he tell someone?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: No one knows. Maybe because if
dialog: we knew too much, we might mess
dialog: things up. Instead we must have
dialog: faith, believe in his plan, and
dialog: do as the equation instructs us.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: But you think it’s broken.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I’m worried it’s not showing us
dialog: the real future. If so we may
dialog: have deviated from the intended
dialog: course of human events.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Because of the Mule?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 58.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I don’t think the Mule was
dialog: supposed to exist.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: (thinking it through)
dialog: Then the numbers can’t tell
dialog: you what will happen when he
dialog: gets here.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Exactly. Very good.
text: Magnifico smiles, proudly. Just stares up at the equation.
text: And suddenly he looks worried.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What is it?
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Nothing.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I’m your friend, Magnifico. You
dialog: can say whatever is on your mind.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Maybe the numbers don’t want to
dialog: tell you what’s going to happen.
text: Ebling smiles, a little bit.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Why would the equation hide the
dialog: truth from the Foundation?
text: Magnifico’s haunted face stares out at the weird mathematics.
text: He wipes off Ebling’s smile:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Because maybe if you knew you’d
dialog: never stop screaming.
scene_heading: INT. HOME OF EBLING MIS -- NIGHT
text: BAYTA moves down the darkened corridor trying not to make
text: noise. She stops at a room.
text: The bed inside is empty. Bayta looks around. Sees MAGNIFICO
text: curled up in a ball on the floor. He is sleeping peacefully.
text: Bayta continues down the hall and reaches the study. She
text: hears EBLING talking to himself. She looks in. Watches him.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 59.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He is furiously filling a blackboard with strange numbers and
text: symbols, his mind calculating faster than his hand can write.
text: Ebling never hears her slip past. Bayta steps into the open
text: elevator, and takes it down.
scene_heading: EXT. FUTURISTIC STREETS -- NIGHT
text: BAYTA moves through the antiseptic streets of Terminus City.
text: She looks around to see if the coast is clear, and strangely
text: joins several OTHERS. They continue through the dark city
text: just as clandestinely, and eventually knock on a door. Wait.
text: The door opens. They go in.
scene_heading: INT. ABANDONED BUILDING -- NIGHT
text: A HEATED ARGUMENT is echoing through the abandoned spaces of
text: an unoccupied building. We move closer to the dim light and
text: emerge into a claustrophobic space crowded with MEMBERS OF
text: THE UNDERGROUND, about a dozen or so. They all look nervous.
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: You shouldn’t have come. They
dialog: know you. You are endangering
dialog: all of us, Bayta.
text: A few OVER-LAPPING agreements.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Are you finished?
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: Not by a long shot.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Well let me know when you’re done
dialog: because the Mule is heading this
dialog: way, I’ve seen him up close, and
dialog: when he gets here it’s all over
dialog: for the Foundation, and for us --
dialog: for every damned thing.
dialog: That doesn’t change anybody’s mind, but it does shut them up.
speaker_heading: NERVOUS WOMAN
dialog: The council must be taking some
dialog: kind of action.
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: Yeah, they’re getting ready for
dialog: their thousand year celebration.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 60.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: This city could be falling down
dialog: around them and they’d wait for
dialog: the equation to tell us to duck.
text: OVER-LAPPING comments and then
text: Bayta gestures at a NERDY MAN, one of the small group she met
text: on the street. He activates an odd device and SCHEMATICS OF
text: THE SELDON VAULT fill the air.
text: Everybody turns and looks at Bayta, as if she’s interrupting.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: These are the schematics for the
dialog: Seldon vault, compliments of the
dialog: Foundation archive.
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: (still irritated)
dialog: Uh-huh. So what?
speaker_heading: SKEPTICAL WOMAN
dialog: People have been studying that
dialog: thing for centuries. We know it’s
text: hollow. There’s nothing in it.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
text: Not yet there isn’t.
text: No one understands. Bayta gestures at another one of her
text: associates. A MOUSY WOMAN positions some kind of PORTABLE
text: PROJECTOR. She turns it on and
text: A HOLOGRAM OF HARI SELDON is sitting in the middle of the
text: room. Everyone instinctively moves away from it. The thing
text: looks like a real man at first, until we get a closer look,
text: and realize it is not breathing. Not moving a single muscle.
text: The Seldon Hologram sits in the chair staring straight ahead.
text: Bayta brings a small MICROPHONE to her lips, with a devious
text: smile, and carefully enunciates.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: Hello. I am Hari Seldon.
text: After a slight delay the creepy hologram opens its mouth and:
speaker_heading: HOLOGRAM
dialog: Hello. I am Hari Seldon.
text: The words come out in the voice of an old man. A convincing
text: illusion. She looks triumphant.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 61.
dialog: (2)
speaker_heading: BAYTA
text: In the middle of the Mayor’s
dialog: speech, the vault doors will
dialog: open for the first time in six
dialog: hundred years, and Hari Seldon
dialog: will address the Foundation.
dialog: No one knows quite what to say.
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: You’re crazy.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Am I?
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: I didn’t approve this project.
dialog: How long have you been working
dialog: on this?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: A little over a year.
text: Everyone is edging closer to the Hologram, hesitantly, like
text: they expect it to move any moment. In many ways it resembles
text: the real Hari Seldon we saw, but an idealized version of him.
text: They can’t take their eyes off it. It’s like...seeing Jesus.
speaker_heading: NERVOUS WOMAN
text: It looks just like him.
speaker_heading: SKEPTICAL WOMAN
dialog: How would you know if it looked
dialog: like him or not?
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
text: It looks like it looks like him.
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: You really think this thing is
dialog: going to work?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I would expect the return of the
dialog: Messiah to cause quite a fuss...
dialog: wouldn’t you?
text: A scared woman crosses herself.
speaker_heading: SKEPTICAL WOMAN
dialog: What are you doing that for?
text: That younger man does the same.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 62.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: YOUNGER MAN
dialog: I don’t even believe this guy
dialog: existed and I’m still freaked.
text: The section chief watches the reactions, considering it, his
dialog: irritation at Bayta forgotten:
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: You do realize that somebody is
dialog: going to figure this out.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Who cares? We’re creating a
dialog: moment. A single moment can
dialog: change the course of history.
text: Bayta looks at them. On fire.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: The Foundation needs someone to

dialog: to hear the word of God.
scene_heading: EXT. FUTURISTIC STREETS -- NIGHT

speaker_heading: PRITCHER

speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER

speaker_heading: PRITCHER

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: COMPUTER

text: BAYTA stands there with the other members of the UNDERGROUND
text: waiting for the section chief to make his decision. Finally:
speaker_heading: SECTION CHIEF
dialog: All right. Let’s do it.
text: Suddenly a small OBJECT BREAKS THE WINDOW and flies through
text: the air attaching itself to the wall. Immediately it shoots
text: out thin TENDRILS that crisscross the room like a spider web.
text: Bayta and the nerdy man drop to the floor. TWO MORE OBJECTS
text: burst through the walls and FIRE filling the space. The rest
text: of them are hopelessly ENTANGLED.
text: The mousy woman can’t get loose. She removes a DISK from her
text: projector and the SELDON HOLOGRAM DISAPPEARS. She manages to
dialog: toss it to Bayta a second before:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 64.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: AN ELECTRIC PULSE passes through the wires and everyone is
text: jolted. The group collectively slumps, hanging from the web
text: like food for a large arachnid. The Foundation AGENTS enter.
text: Bayta and the nerdy man lift a small cover, slipping through
text: a HOLE in the floor. They land hard in the basement and run.
text: They reach an intersection. Share a quick look and split up.
text: Bayta races through the sub-level. Sees a tunnel leading out
text: and goes for it. She reaches an exit and runs into PRITCHER.
text: For a moment they look at each other without much expression.
text: Then Bayta smiles. Like she’s happy to see him. Like she’s
text: going to say hey, baby, nice to see you. She turns and runs.
text: Pritcher FIRES a smaller version of the same device we saw
text: upstairs. The object attaches to her back, filaments quickly
text: wrap themselves around her torso, and a PULSE takes her down.
text: Bayta hits the floor. Hard. Her eyes are open, staring out
text: at the dirty wall and the floor, but she can’t move a muscle.
text: Pritcher unceremoniously picks her up and drapes her over his
text: left shoulder. Several MORE AGENTS peek through the door
text: from outside, and see him. He gestures okay. They hurry on.
text: With his free hand Pritcher picks up his BRIEFCASE and starts
text: through the basement, Bayta hanging from him like a rag doll.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: That was a very smooth arrest,
dialog: sir. Congratulations.

speaker_heading: COMPUTER (CONT’D)

speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Shortcut.
speaker_heading: COMPUTER
dialog: Of course. Very good, sir. I

dialog: around.
text: Bayta slowly begins to stir. She tries to talk, but it comes

speaker_heading: COMPUTER

speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (sounding normal)
dialog: So that’s it? This is all you

speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: A large brain is wasted on you,

text: Pritcher finishes his work.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: At least Hari Seldon had the guts
dialog: to take on the empire! You are
dialog: nothing but a cowardly--
text: He hits a button and the cords binding her FALL AWAY. Bayta

speaker_heading: COMPUTER

scene_heading: INT. A PLAIN HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

dialog: 67.
scene_heading: INT. HOME OF EBLING MIS -- NIGHT
text: EBLING MIS looks exhausted and discouraged. The study is in
text: complete disarray. He’s been working on a long calculation
text: and has scribbled parts of it on every available surface. He
text: looks around at the mess. Thinks. He hurries from the room.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Bayta, wake up. I think that
dialog: Magnifico was right.
text: He opens her door and walks in:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: I think the equation is lying--
text: Ebling stops. Sees that no one is here. He looks surprised.

dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER and BAYTA make love on the simple hotel room bed.
text: We listen to the SOUNDS OF LOVE-MAKING as we move over them,
text: leave the bed, and move past a small table toward the window.
text: We travel through the window and
scene_heading: EXT. ON A LEDGE -- NIGHT
text: MAGNIFICO is sitting on the ledge outside their room. His
text: face is twisted in anger. Grief. He listens. He loves her.
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOF -- NIGHT
text: MAGNIFICO climbs onto the roof of the building and perches on
text: the edge, like a deformed little gargoyle. TEARS stream down
text: his cheeks. He clenches his fists. Muffles his own SCREAMS.
text: Magnifico crouches there over-looking the city. His hand
text: finds something. It is the VISI-SONAR. He stares at it for
text: amoment. Lifts his hands. Slowly Magnifico begins to play.
text: The notes are simple and so sad.
text: The MUSIC carries on the wind drifting out into the night....
dialog: 68.
text: ON THE TRAIL OF THE MUSIC
text: We move away from the rooftop and wander through the city
text: seeing regular everyday PEOPLE doing regular everyday things.
text: They are cooking and sleeping and arguing and laughing,
dialog: nothing any more or any less extraordinary than that. We go
text: in through windows, move down corridors, enter living rooms.
text: We see the citizens of Terminus, not lingering long enough to
dialog: know their histories, just enough to see a story of humanity:
text: A father tickles a little girl. A grandmother kisses an old
text: photo. A woman fixes her face. A lonely man removes a coat.
text: We pass Pritcher and Bayta again, still making love, but we
dialog: don’t linger here either. They are just a small part of the
text: larger tapestry. We are travelling again past unknown faces.
text: And always Magnifico’s sad simple aching MUSIC plays on, like
text: some eternal lament joining each of these strangers together.
text: The music overwhelms them. First one. Then another and
text: another. People are gradually but steadily invaded by grief.
text: It doesn’t matter what they’re doing. Watching the news.
text: Eating dinner. Undressing. Sitting together. Standing
text: alone. Everybody in the area stops to feel Magnifico’s pain.
text: A man on the street can’t walk any further without weeping.
text: The woman in front of her mirror watches the tears roll down
text: her face. No one moves. No one speaks. A city in mourning.
text: Pritcher and Bayta look surprised to see each other crying.
text: They try to understand it. We can see them trying to make
dialog: sense of it, but they can’t and
text: They hold one another. It looks like they will never let go.
text: The music continues playing and
scene_heading: EXT. HOTEL ROOF -- NIGHT
text: MAGNIFICO removes his finger from the knob. The music STOPS.
text: He stares out over the city with a face drained of everything

scene_heading: INT. EQUATION CHAMBER -- NIGHT
text: EBLING MIS rides a personal transport up through the levels
text: of the Seldon equation. He reaches his destination and gets
text: out, looking around a while to see if anyone has noticed him.
text: Ebling pulls a piece of EQUIPMENT from the transport and
text: moves quickly down a long mathematical corridor. Like a guy
text: about to commit a crime. He reaches his destination. Stops.
text: Ebling opens the device and pulls out two wires. He inserts
text: the ends into the equation, as if plugging two power cords
text: into an invisible wall, and a spot OPENS inside the sequence.
speaker_heading: WARNING VOICE
dialog: Your interpolation has not been
dialog: authorized. Did you forget to
dialog: submit your request, Professor?
text: Ebling does not answer. Just works faster. His hands shake.
text: He takes his STYLUS and quickly draws that strange symbol --
text: the one we saw earlier -- into the equation. Immediately the
text: ALARM bellows, and all around him, the equation goes BERSERK.
text: A NEW CALCULATION RUNS and Ebling races through a storm of
text: black numbers trying to follow the trail of a new red
text: sequence as it solves itself. Now his eyes fill with horror:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
text: The planet Kalagan. Kalagan has
dialog: fallen to the Mule!
text: The TECHNICIANS all turn to watch as the equation ripples
text: with the effects of Ebling’s alteration. The large security
text: doors open and GUARDS rush in.
text: Ebling raises his hands to trace the new future, trying to
text: read as much as possible before they come. His voice cracks:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
text: Anacron is next. Planet Anacron
dialog: will fall today!
text: Suddenly he is grabbed from behind by the guards, but Ebling
text: doesn’t go without a struggle and they have to hold him, pull
text: him away. He keeps fighting.
text: Ebling sees something as he is dragged off. Something that
text: makes him stop struggling....
text: He tries to understand it and
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The guards deactivate his equipment. The equation abruptly

scene_heading: INT. THE MAYOR’S OFFICE -- NIGHT
text: MAYOR INDBAR waits in front of a big screen along with a few
text: of his STAFF. It’s the middle of the night. They’re hastily
text: dressed. Then a close-up of the GOVERNOR OF ANACRON appears.
text: There is a slight time delay between the two distant planets:
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: How’s it going, Bill?
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Couldn’t be better. How’s that
dialog: speech coming?
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: It’ll be ready.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Looking forward to it.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Thanks. Hey, everything quiet
dialog: over there on Anacron?
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Quiet?
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: No trouble of any kind?
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Just another uneventful orbit
text: around the sun, praise Seldon.
text: Mayor Indbar is relieved. But also feels stupid for calling.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Yes, praise Seldon.
dialog: (short pause)
dialog: Well, this call is costing me a
dialog: fortune. Good to see you, Bill.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Right back at you.
text: The screen BLIPS OFF. Mayor Indbar turns to his staff with:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: That’s it. Keep that crazy old
dialog: bastard away from the equation.
dialog: And I do not want to hear the
dialog: word mule again, you understand?
dialog: cUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE -- DAY
text: We see the GOVERNOR OF ANACRON in close-up, exactly as he
text: appeared to Mayor Indbar, with the same friendly smile. The
text: expression drains from his face.
text: Not just that. His mouth falls open, and his bottom eyelids
text: droop oddly. Something’s wrong.
text: We pull back and see that he is a DECAPITATED HEAD being held
text: in the air by THE MULE. We pull back further and see through
text: a big window. The planet is BURNING. Buildings are FALLING.
text: The Mule is gripping the head by its hair. He lifts up all
text: that’s left of the governor so that they are both eye-to-eye.
text: Now the head speaks:
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: How did I do, sir?
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: Very good.
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Thank you.
text: The face of the governor spasms a little. Like he’s in pain.
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: Is something the matter?
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: I think I might be hurt.
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: I removed your head.
text: The face of the governor thinks about it rather casually and:
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: That’s right. I forgot.
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: Would you like to die now?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: GOVERNOR
dialog: Oh yes. Very much.
text: The Mule releases his grip on the governor’s hair and the
text: head falls with a gross KUNK.
scene_heading: INT. THE COMMAND BRIDGE -- DAY
text: THE MULE stands on the bridge, and stares out over his FLEET.
text: By now it is composed of vessels from three worlds. We have
dialog: never seen a fleet of ships even close to this size. He can
dialog: surround a planet, literally.
text: That ghostly suggestion of a face considers his great armada.
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: Set course for Foundation.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. HOME OF EBLING MIS -- NIGHT
text: The doors open and EBLING MIS returns home. The GUARDS who
text: escorted him don’t leave the elevator. The doors slide shut,
text: and Ebling is all alone again.
text: Or is he? He looks. A window is open. Someone is waiting
text: in the dark. He can sense it.
text: Moonlight is coming in through the window. Ebling sees the
text: VISI-SONAR lying on the floor.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Magnifico? Is that you?
text: There is no answer. He turns around and MAGNIFICO jumps out
text: of the shadows like an animal.
text: He knocks Ebling to the floor.
text: Magnifico looks enraged. He wants to choke him to death.
text: Ebling is in pain. Surprised.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I played that thing! I played
dialog: that thing like you told me to!
dialog: Ebling speaks the best he can:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You’re hurting me--

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO

speaker_heading: EBLING MIS

speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Why did you do that to me?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: To show you.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: To show me what?!
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You came here filled with fear
dialog: and hate, but there is more in
dialog: you than that. So much more--
text: Magnifico loosens his grip, and his face softens. He looks
text: like a scared little boy again.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: You made me like him.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I made them sad--
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You shared your feelings. You
dialog: gave them a gift.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: A gift?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: You’re not alone. No one is
dialog: alone. We just think we are.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I don’t want to play anymore.
text: Magnifico buries his face in Ebling’s chest, and just holds
text: on. They stay there like that, on the floor where they fell.
text: After a moment Ebling pats him:

speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: I’ve watched things happen. Bad
dialog: things. To a lot of people who

dialog: Pritcher has been a man of few words. But these come easily.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT'D)
dialog: There wasn’t a single morning I

scene_heading: EXT. CROWDED STREETS -- DAY
text: PRITCHER and BAYTA wind their way through streets FILLED WITH

scene_heading: INT. SECRET HIDEAWAY -- DAY
text: PRITCHER and BAYTA open a basement door and step inside a

text: The entire POPULATION watches:
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: Through the mathematics of psycho-
dialog: history, he foresaw the course of

scene_heading: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAY

speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR
dialog: It was too late to prevent the

text: He realizes that the noise is coming from the vault. Stares.
speaker_heading: MAYOR INDBAR (CONT’D)
dialog: The hand of our great Foundation

dialog: embraces every known world. The

scene_heading: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAY
text: Sitting in the deep black of the vault is HARI SELDON. It is

text: COUNCIL members stand upright. No one moves. No one speaks.
scene_heading: INT. SECRET HIDEAWAY -- DAY

speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: That wasn’t me. I didn’t say--

scene_heading: INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAY
text: HARI SELDON suddenly rises from his chair and STEPS OUT OF

speaker_heading: HARI SELDON

text: The soldiers stop. Raise their RIFLES, in unison. Take aim.
text: Suddenly a SHATTERING SOUND pierces the air. Pritcher puts
text: his hands over his ears and falls. Everything goes BLACK....
text: He opens his eyes a moment later. Sees Bayta coming around
text: beside him. The soldiers are lying motionless on the street.
text: They rush to Ebling, beginning to stir. They help him up and
text: Pritcher sees MAGNIFICO standing there. With the VISI-SONAR.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I played for them. Bad music.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 85.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The warships in orbit FIRE ON THE DOME and the entire CITY
text: RUMBLES and shakes. Like an earthquake. But the dome holds.
text: Pritcher sees a HATCH IN THE STREET and runs over. Opens it.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: No. No more under the ground!
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: You don’t want to be here when
text: that dome breaks.
text: The warships FIRE ON THE DOME again and the city RUMBLES. An
text: enormous CRACK snakes across the dome, like a rip in the sky.
text: -..and Magnifico quickly follows.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS -- DAY
text: PRITCHER, BAYTA, MAGNIFICO, and EBLING descend a ladder down
text: into a high-tech subterranean tunnel system. They make it to
text: the bottom, looking beat, and find a long horizontal passage.
scene_heading: EXT. SURFACE OF THE CITY -- DAY
text: The warships FIRE on the dome, and the sky fills with CRACKS.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS -- DAY
text: Now a deafening ALARM sounds. A series of thick EMERGENCY
text: DOORS emerge from the walls threatening to seal off the
text: tunnel. PRITCHER, BAYTA, MAGNIFICO, and EBLING start to run.
scene_heading: EXT. SURFACE OF THE CITY -- DAY
text: The warships FIRE once again. The REMAINING POPULATION of
text: the city stops their fighting and smashing. They look up at
text: the dome...and what they see shakes them out of their frenzy.
text: For one last moment they are just everyday frightened people.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS -- DAY
text: PRITCHER, BAYTA, MAGNIFICO, and EBLING rush through the last
text: door and fall to the floor. The tunnel seals with a DOOOOOM.
scene_heading: EXT. SURFACE OF THE CITY -- DAY
text: The warships FIRE one final time and the great dome SHATTERS.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 86.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The enormous shards do not fall but are BLOWN OUT into space.
text: PEOPLE SCREAM AS THEY RISE INTO THE AIR. The dead and living
text: alike are hurled into orbit. Everything not tied down goes
text: up. VEHICLES and GARBAGE. Men and women try to run but are
text: lifted off their feet as if by the hand of some vengeful god.
scene_heading: INT. THE COMMAND BRIDGE -- DAY
text: THE MULE watches. Reflected in his forcefield, we see PEOPLE
text: AND OBJECTS HURL INTO SPACE. An image of apocalyptic horror.
text: There is nothing left on the planet but the remains of the
text: shattered dome, and empty streets. In a matter of seconds
text: Terminus City has been horrifically and vilely evacuated....
scene_heading: EXT. EMPTY CITY STREET -- DAY
text: THE MULE walks the empty streets. A group of SOLDIERS follow
text: along, a breathing apparatus added to their uniforms. The
text: Mule stops now. His ghostly undefined face surveys the
text: scene. It is a metal ghost town.
text: The Mule steps over to a HATCH in the street. He studies it.
speaker_heading: THE MULE
text: There are survivors.
scene_heading: INT. AUTOMATED COMPLEX -- DAY
text: PRITCHER, BAYTA, MAGNIFICO, and EBLING move quickly through a
text: completely automated facility. CORPSES are sprawled on the
text: floor, and SCREAMS echo through the passages with regularity.
text: Every so often a PANICKED SURVIVOR can be glimpsed running
text: through the adjoining corridors. The entire place is creepy.
text: They open a door and see a LOADING ZONE. A series of SMALL
text: PODS are being automatically filled with materials, and then
text: the pods are carried on a CONVEYOR BELT out through a tunnel.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: The cannon transports materials
dialog: to the moon. We should drift
text: right through the blockade. If
dialog: the Mule hasn’t destroyed the
dialog: refinery it will catch us, open
dialog: our pods, and we can commandeer
text: a small shuttle.
text: Pritcher gets right to work. Everyone else just stares at
text: him. Finally he turns back with:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: Don’t worry. They used to put

speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Did they ever survive the trip?
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Usually, yeah.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS -- DAY
text: An airlock opens and THE MULE enters. His SOLDIERS quickly
text: spread out through the underground.
scene_heading: INT. AT THE LOADING ZONE -- DAY
text: EBLING sits inside of a small pod, like a cramped metal egg,
text: and just stares straight ahead. Not caring if he lives or
text: dies. BAYTA checks the straps:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: How does that feel?
text: Ebling turns to her. After a moment, he seems to recognize
text: her. His eyes fill with TEARS. He tries to speak but can’t.
text: Bayta wants to cry too. Instead she kisses his forehead, and
text: seals up the pod. She watches the conveyor take Ebling away.
scene_heading: INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNELS -- DAY
text: SOLDIERS hurry through the tunnels finding SURVIVORS. A few
text: put up a fight. The soldiers march them through the complex.
scene_heading: EXT. AT THE LOADING ZONE -- DAY
text: PRITCHER checks the straps around BAYTA. She wants him to
text: look at her, really look at her, but he is avoiding her eyes.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Please -- look at me.
text: He stops. Looks into her eyes.
speaker_heading: BAYTA (CONT'D)
dialog: I want to tell you--
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 88.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: (stopping her)
dialog: Why don’t you tell me next
dialog: time I see you.
text: Bayta looks stronger now. As if that’s given her confidence.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I’1l tell you. On the moon.
text: ...and they kiss one last time.
text: MAGNIFICO sits off in the corner, and just watches them kiss.
text: Pritcher pulls away and seals the pod. It moves off into the
text: dark, and disappears from view.
scene_heading: INT. THE PATH OF THE POD -- DAY
text: The small POD moves through a series of passages. It is a
dialog: bumpy ride for anyone inside and
scene_heading: INT. INTERIOR OF THE POD -- DAY
text: The pod is knocked around, even rolled over. BAYTA can’t see
text: a thing. No windows. Her BREATHING quickens. The pod falls
text: a small distance and jerks to a stop. Bayta is reclining
text: back like an astronaut waiting for the countdown to begin....
text: There is an enormous ROAR. She is pushed back into her seat.
scene_heading: INT. THE PATH OF THE POD -- DAY
text: The small POD is propelled through an enormously long BARREL.
text: At the end of it lies the STARS.
scene_heading: EXT. THE PATH OF THE POD -- DAY
text: The POD bursts from the opening atop the highest MOUNTAIN and
text: sails into orbit. It floats harmlessly past the fleet of
text: WARSHIPS and follows the other pods tumbling toward the MOON.
scene_heading: INT. AT THE LOADING ZONE -- DAY
text: PRITCHER opens the next pod. He looks at MAGNIFICO and says:
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Come on. Don’t be afraid.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 89.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Magnifico just stays in the corner and stares. His voice is
text: a little different. A bit edgy.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: I’m not afraid.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Glad to know it, now move.
text: He enters a few numbers on the small console in the interior.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
dialog: You’re going to hear a lot of
text: noises and be bumped around a
dialog: little. Then you’ll have the
dialog: acceleration. After that you
dialog: won’t feel a thing--
text: Pritcher turns around again, and Magnifico hits him with a
text: LARGE PIPE. Pritcher goes down.
text: He falls hard. His head is bleeding. He tries to get up and
text: Magnifico looks frantic. Hits him again. This time he stays
text: down. Magnifico edges close, slowly, like he’s still afraid.
dialog: But he grows more confident and:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: You have to stay. You can’t
dialog: come. You have to stay here.
text: Suddenly he kicks him and yells.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT’D)
dialog: Stupid. Stupid!
text: Now he looks as if he might cry:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: She was supposed to love me,
dialog: not you. Not you.
text: Magnifico inches toward the pod.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: She will love me. She will!
text: Magnifico climbs into the pod. He straps himself in. The
text: small capsule seals shut and disappears inside of the tunnel.
text: Pritcher tries to force himself up. Falls back to the floor.
dialog: 90.
scene_heading: INT. INTERIOR OF THE POD -- DAY
text: The pod is fired from the cannon. MAGNIFICO looks terrified.
scene_heading: INT. AT THE LOADING ZONE -- DAY
text: The SOLDIERS move down the tunnels, and stop at the entrance
text: to the loading area. They take a moment to get ready then
text: run inside. But no one is here.
text: The soldiers take position and FIRE. The pods burst and the
text: entire complex GRINDS TO A HALT.
text: Now we see PRITCHER painfully pulling himself into a recess.
text: He tries not to make a sound....
scene_heading: EXT. TOWARD THE MOON -- DAY
text: The PODS tumble toward the moon.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE PODS -- DAY
text: BAYTA sits inside the small capsule. Her hair drifts in the
text: zero-gravity. She just BREATHES.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE PODS -- DAY
text: MAGNIFICO acts like a crazy man trapped inside a padded room.
text: He beats on the hull and SCREAMS.
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE PODS -- DAY
text: EBLING stares straight ahead. Thinks. After a moment he
text: reaches in his pocket for a PEN.
text: He writes on the interior of the pod, numbers and symbols,
text: calculating faster. And faster.
scene_heading: EXT. TOWARD THE MOON -- DAY
text: The PODS tumble toward the moon.
scene_heading: INT. THE UNDERGROUND -- DAY
text: SURVIVORS are lined up along either side of a tunnel. They
text: look strange. Emotionless. THE MULE strolls down the aisle:
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 91.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: Terminus has fallen. Now I will
dialog: remake the galaxy in my image. I
dialog: will begin here, with you, the
dialog: last survivors of the Foundation.
text: Inside of the fields, that ghostly suggestion of a man grins.
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT'D)
dialog: Tear off your faces.
text: The survivors bring their hands to their faces and dig the
text: fingers into the skin. We follow the Mule as he moves away,
text: and soon begin to hear SCREAMS.
text: The Mule walks further. Abruptly, he stops. As if he has
text: sensed something. He seems to forget it and simply walks on.
text: Down a dark passage, and around the corner, we find PRITCHER.
text: He stands flat against the wall trying not to be seen. The
text: agonized screams of the survivors ripping their faces ECHO
text: through the tunnels. He waits.
text: After a moment he sees the coast is clear. The BODY of a
text: soldier is at his feet. And Pritcher is wearing his uniform.
text: SOLDIERS are marching down the tunnels, leaving the facility.
text: Pritcher puts on the helmet and
text: The screams are OVER. Pritcher enters the tunnel. He steps
text: past the bodies lying on the floor, their faces a bloody
text: mess, and joins the soldiers....
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. INSIDE THE POD -- DAY
text: BAYTA sails inside the claustrophobic capsule. Suddenly she
text: hears a sound. A THUMPING on the hull. She CRIES OUT in
text: surprise as the pod violently rocks. More DEAFENING NOISE
text: and finally the top swings open.
scene_heading: INT. REFINERY, MOON -- DAY
text: BAYTA has arrived at the automated facility and her pod is
text: moving along a conveyor toward the large GRAPPLING ARMS that
text: are unloading the raw materials. Bayta jumps out of the pod.
text: She looks around. Sees something. EBLING’S POD is lying
text: open, the interior visible. She steps closer to it. Closer.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The inside of the pod is FILLED with mathematics. Ebling has
text: scribbled an equation on every available inch of space. It
text: looks like the work of a madman.
text: Bayta starts walking through the facility looking for Ebling.
text: It’s not hard. She just follows the calculation SCRAWLED ON
text: THE WALLS. Bayta grows worried.
text: She sees him through a small hatch. EBLING is hurrying back-
text: and-forth across the cabin of a SHUTTLE. His movements are
text: energetic. This isn’t the man who wanted to die on Terminus.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE SHUTTLE -- DAY
text: BAYTA steps inside and watches EBLING. He does not even seem
text: to notice her there, and when he does turn around, acts like
dialog: there’s no time for salutations.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Oh, you’re just in time to help
dialog: me program the jump coordinates.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Are you feeling all right?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: What? Never better! Could you
dialog: step out of the way? There’s no
dialog: time to lose.
text: Bayta moves out of the way and Ebling fiddles with a console.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Where are we going?
text: Ebling grabs her, his eyes afire:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: To find the Second Foundation!
text: And he runs around the cabin again. Bayta looks dumbfounded.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: How do we know there even is a
dialog: Second Foundation?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Because Hari Seldon told us so.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
dialog: 93.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
text: In a message 1,000 years old.
dialog: Even if he did create another
dialog: one there’s no guarantee they
dialog: survived.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: They survived. I’m sure of it.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: Then where the hell are they?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Seldon told us. We will find
dialog: them “at star’s end.”
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: (way too cheerful)
dialog: I haven’t the slightest idea!
scene_heading: INT. MOON REFINERY -- DAY
text: Another POD arrives. MAGNIFICO frantically scrambles out and
scene_heading: INT. SPACE SHUTTLE -- DAY
text: BAYTA tries to talk some sense into the seemingly mad EBLING.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: If they’re out there, then why
dialog: didn’t they do something by
dialog: now? Why didn’t they help us?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Suppose we had known about the
dialog: existence of another Foundation
dialog: somewhere in the galaxy. What
dialog: would we have done?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
text: Gone looking for them.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: And that is why their existence
dialog: was kept secret. But don’t you
dialog: think the other Foundation would
dialog: have suffered the same curiosity?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You’re saying Seldon didn’t tell
dialog: them the truth either?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: What better method to keep them
dialog: hidden? To keep them safe!
dialog: Ebling keeps running about:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: They may not even know about
dialog: the Mule or suspect their true
dialog: purpose in the Plan. They may
dialog: be waiting for us to find them.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (skeptically)
text: At star’s end.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Precisely!
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: That sonuvabitch Hari Seldon
dialog: put us here to die. You heard
dialog: him as well as I did.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: He couldn’t speak freely. The
text: Mule might have been listening.
scene_heading: INT. MOON REFINERY -- DAY
text: MAGNIFICO follows the equations scrawled on the walls. Now
text: he hears the MUTED talking.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE SHUTTLE -- DAY
text: EBLING moves to BAYTA. He speaks with heartfelt conviction:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: My mind has never been clearer.
dialog: I can’t explain it. It’s like
dialog: Seldon is operating through me.
dialog: I know we were put here for a
dialog: reason -- and it wasn’t to die.
dialog: It can’t have been only to die!
text: She looks like she wants to believe. It is just not in her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You think I hate everything you
dialog: stand for, but you’re wrong. I
dialog: wish I could believe the universe
dialog: is following some master “plan,”
dialog: and everything is happening the
dialog: way it should, but I just can’t.
text: MAGNIFICO is at the hatch. They see him...and the expression
text: on his face. Immediately Bayta knows something’s very wrong.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
text: Soldiers. The soldiers came.
dialog: He fought them, bravely, but
dialog: there were too many. He was
text: hurt, very badly.
text: Bayta takes a step back, as if that will somehow make him
text: stop, and finally her legs give out. She falls to the floor.
text: Magnifico runs to her. Takes her hand. Looks into her eyes.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: With his last bit of strength
dialog: he put me in the pod and told
dialog: me to go. He said that I had
dialog: to take care of you. For him.
text: Bayta is trying not to break down. It is taking everything
dialog: that she has just to listen:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: And then he died.
text: Magnifico suddenly reaches out and wraps his arms around her,
text: holding her, comforting her.
text: And when his ugly little face is out of view he slowly grins.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. MULE FLAGSHIP -- DAY
text: The SOLDIERS walk through the corridors in perfect formation.
scene_heading: INT. A LOCKER ROOM -- DAY
text: The SOLDIERS are methodically removing their armor. One of
text: them takes off his helmet revealing PRITCHER. The men and
text: women around him move by rote. Devoid of emotion. They do
text: not look at each other. Do not talk. Pritcher watches them.
dialog: 96.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP CORRIDOR -- DAY
text: The SOLDIERS file out of the room and disperse through the
text: corridors, human automatons going about their assigned tasks.
text: PRITCHER drains the emotion from his face. Walks through the
text: passage doing his best to mimic the others taken by the Mule.
dialog: cUT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SPACE SHUTTLE -- DAY
text: Nothing but stars. Now a SHUTTLE jumps back into real space.
scene_heading: INT. SPACE SHUTTLE -- DAY
text: EBLING MIS and MAGNIFICO stare out at the ruins of TRANTOR.
text: It looks like a great metal ball, but the surface is scarred
text: and rusted. A giant scrap-heap.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Trantor. This was the heart of
dialog: the First Galactic Empire. If
dialog: there are clues to the meaning
dialog: of the phrase star’s end, they
text: may be found in the old library.
dialog: But there are no continents or
dialog: seas to help us with navigation.
text: Ebling sinks into his chair. Suddenly, he looks frustrated.
text: Uncertain. Like it is too much.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: This isn’t my area of expertise--
text: Magnifico lays his hand on Ebling’s shoulder to reassure him.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: You’re the smartest man I ever
dialog: met, Professor. You’1ll figure
dialog: it out.
text: Ebling doesn’t have confidence, and is about to say so, when
text: his expression suddenly changes:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: (getting an idea)
dialog: The palace could be seen from
dialog: space. If we can find the
dialog: remains of the Imperial Palace
dialog: we may be able to extrapolate
dialog: the location of the library...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 97.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: He starts tapping furiously at the controls. Magnifico lets

text: Now he sees BAYTA at the hatch. She must have been watching.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Are you feeling better, Bayta?
text: Bayta nods her head. He smiles.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: I’m glad.
text: And he leaves the main cabin. Bayta watches him go, as if
text: some worry or suspicion has begun to enter her mind. She
text: moves across the cabin, looks around, and pulls open a panel.
text: Inside are a number of BLASTERS.
text: She takes out one of the holsters. Looks at it for a moment,
text: and almost puts it back. Then quickly she buckles it around
text: her waist. Something BEEPS and
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: The Imperial Palace, I found--
text: Ebling sees what she is wearing. Bayta pulls the weapon from
text: its holster. She looks it over.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: What are you doing with that gun?
speaker_heading: BAYTA
text: Holding it.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I can see that. Why?
text: Bayta holsters the blaster. She stares after Magnifico with:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: I don’t know yet.
scene_heading: INT. RUINS OF TRANTOR -- DAY
text: BAYTA, MAGNIFICO, and EBLING make their way through the
text: deteriorating husk of Trantor. The entire planet was encased
text: in metal and the surface is one long endless interior. The
text: only current inhabitants seem to be exceedingly large VERMIN.
text: The place has an unsettling life of its own. Although dark
text: and cavernous, scattered technology still runs.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 98.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: They hear the occasional deep RUMBLE of machinery coming to
text: life. Now and then they see blinking lights or jerking
text: automatic doors.
text: Bayta wields a FLASHLIGHT and leads the group. She has a
text: PACK on her back filled with supplies, and wears her BLASTER.
text: Ebling is beginning to show signs of fatigue. It’s not easy
text: to traverse this wreckage. Magnifico moves close, and Ebling
text: puts an arm around his shoulder.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Over there! Shine your light--
text: Bayta points the flashlight. A door is partly open, and
text: beyond, we see what could be the remains of the old archives.
scene_heading: INT. ANCIENT ARCHIVES -- DAY
text: BAYTA, MAGNIFICO, and EBLING squeeze in through the doors and
text: look around at the vast space that once held the accumulated
text: knowledge of the empire. The ghosts of the past are palpable
text: here, such obvious accomplishment laid waste. No one speaks.
text: Ebling and Magnifico walk together to a high-tech PEDESTAL,
text: and Ebling gently lays his hand on it. Waits. After a long
text: moment one small LIGHT within shines dimly. A spark of life.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: (to Magnifico)
dialog: There is hope. Come. Help me.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You need to rest now.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I’m fine.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: You look terrible.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I’ll feel better when I get to

scene_heading: INT. MULE’S QUARTERS -- DAY
text: THE MULE moves through his living quarters encased in his
text: forcefields, every movement accompanied by that familiar HUM.
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: There was a time when I was
dialog: nothing -- and the universe was
dialog: determined that I remain so.
text: The room is packed with FOLLOWERS. Men and women of varying
text: ages. They are positioned casually around the room, as if
text: they’re all guests at a dinner party listening to their host.
text: The blank expressions on their faces make it one eerie party.
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
dialog: Then one day, men came...brutal
dialog: men, with the desire to kill me.
dialog: My death had nothing to offer
text: them, save for simple amusement.
text: As the Mule wanders through the room his soldiers all move
text: their heads, following him, their faces devoid of expression.
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
text: As the killing blows descended
dialog: upon me I began to welcome the
dialog: darkness and the peace sure to
dialog: come. Then, to my surprise, I
dialog: felt my essence expanding --
dialog: until I was observing my body
text: being beaten, watching through
dialog: the very eyes of my assailants.
text: There is a collective GASP from everyone present. They are
text: like living marionettes playing their parts in his sick show.
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
dialog: My mind was repulsed by what I
text: saw and I instinctively let out a
dialog: single thought: STOP! And stop
dialog: they did. At the moment that
dialog: should have been my death, the
dialog: power within me came to life, and
dialog: my would-be killers became the
dialog: first of my “devoted” followers.
text: Now a big creepy smile appears on every face inside the room.
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
dialog: With them I took a town. With
dialog: the town I took a city. With
dialog: the city I took a world. Then
speaker_heading: (MORE)
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED )

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
dialog: The so-called guardians of the
dialog: human race, who did not care
dialog: enough about one human being,
dialog: have paid the price for their
dialog: hypocrisy.
text: In the rear of the room, behind the others, we find PRITCHER.
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
dialog: The Foundation was blinded by
dialog: the false teachings of Seldon.
dialog: He taught them that history
dialog: will make puppets of us all...
dialog: but am I not living proof to
dialog: the contrary?
text: The ghostly suggestion of a face stares out at his followers:
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT’D)
dialog: I have done in days what Seldon
dialog: could not do in a thousand years!
text: The galaxy is in order at last.
dialog: The Second Empire has arrived...
dialog: and I am its Emperor.
speaker_heading: FOLLOWERS
dialog: (in unison)
text: ALL HAIL MULE! LONG LIVE MULE!
text: Pritcher watches from the rear, not quick enough to join in,
text: but none of them seem to notice.
text: The Mule turns and looks at the stars. For the first time,
text: he sounds a little melancholy, even through the distortion
text: caused by his thick forcefields.
speaker_heading: THE MULE
dialog: Will the future call me master,
dialog: or monster? Perhaps I am just
text: the man who upset the universe.
text: Pause. Now he sounds impatient:
speaker_heading: THE MULE (CONT'D)

text: The Mule’s SOLDIERS lie flat on their backs, arms at their
text: sides, legs together, everyone sleeping like they’re spread
text: on a cold slab in some morgue. Lying among them is PRITCHER.
text: After a moment he opens his eyes.
text: Very slowly, Pritcher rises. He sets his feet on the floor,
text: gently. Now stands up. Pritcher walks past the other bunks.
text: He reaches the door and it opens.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP’S CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER edges out into the passage. No one here. It looks
text: like a ghost ship. He moves stealthily through the corridor.
scene_heading: INT. A SUPPLY CLOSET -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER works inside a narrow claustrophobic space. He is
text: constructing a small SPHERE that resembles a strange grenade.
scene_heading: INT. SHIP’S CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
text: Standing right outside the door where Pritcher is working we
text: see a dozen of the Mule’s SOLDIERS. They stand there like
text: live zombies, without expression, watching the door creepily.
scene_heading: INT. A SUPPLY CLOSET -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER finishes his work. Returns the tools. He hides the
text: small SPHERE in his clothes. Takes a moment to remove the
text: emotion from his face, and gets ready. He opens the door and
scene_heading: INT. SHIP’S CORRIDOR -- NIGHT
text: The corridor is empty again. Like a ghost ship. PRITCHER
text: looks around...and starts carefully back down the passageway.

scene_heading: INT. ANCIENT ARCHIVE -- NIGHT
text: BAYTA conceals herself behind the ancient data banks. She
text: watches MAGNIFICO dart from between the aisles and quickly
text: scurry off, his arms overflowing with dusty over-sized BOOKS.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 102.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Only when Magnifico has gone does Bayta step into the open.
text: She moves down the aisles looking for Ebling. Sees a table
text: overflowing with more old volumes and active VIEWING DEVICES.
text: There is a tangle of CORDS everywhere connecting the viewers
text: and the dim LIGHTS to various small POWER SOURCES. No sign
text: of Ebling yet. Then she hears what sounds like SCRATCHING...
text: ...and sees EBLING on the floor.
text: Bayta does not look pleased. Ebling is scrawling an ENORMOUS
text: EQUATION on the floor of the archive. He crawls on his hands
text: and knees. He does not look up, but knows that she is there:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: I tell you sometimes I wonder
dialog: what is going on inside me. I
dialog: seem to recall a time when so
dialog: much was a mystery to me, and
dialog: now I see it and I understand.
text: He does not stop writing. He never stops. Not for a moment.
text: A series of makeshift FLOODLIGHTS illuminate the equation.
dialog: We can see that this thing stretches on into the darkest
text: recesses of the ruins. He’s going to cover the entire floor.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: There are numerous references to
dialog: star’s end from the time of Hari
dialog: Seldon, but they do not indicate
dialog: a specific region, interpreting
dialog: the phrase as meaning the far or
text: opposite end of the known galaxy.
text: Bayta watches him. The way you look at a loved one who is
text: starting to slip away into sickness or insanity. He goes on:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Of course what is the other end
dialog: of the galaxy? It is circular,
dialog: and a circle has no end. Follow
dialog: the rim of a circle and you end
dialog: up back at your starting point!
text: He does not stop writing. He never stops. Not for a moment.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: But in truth the galaxy is not a
dialog: flat ovoid, nor is the periphery
text: a closed curve. It is a double
dialog: spiral -- and what is the other
dialog: end of a spiral, but the center?
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 103.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Everything that comes out of his mouth makes her want to run.
text: He babbles on faster and faster:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: And so you see that any attempt
dialog: at a physical interpretation of
dialog: the phrase not only fails to pin
dialog: down the location, but actually
dialog: expands the area of search to
dialog: include all of colonized space!
text: He does not stop writing. He never does. Not for a moment.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: That is an irrelevant solution,
dialog: and we must remember that Hari
dialog: Seldon was a psycho-historian,
dialog: not a physical scientist. And
dialog: what would “star’s end” mean
dialog: to a man of his sensibilities?
text: Bayta waits for the rest of it, knowing she won’t like it a
dialog: bit...but the rest never comes.
text: Ebling is staring in shock at the equation he just completed.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh my word.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. MULE’S QUARTERS -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER slips inside the dark quarters and patiently surveys
text: the scene. No one here. He moves quietly across the room to
text: a new vantage point. Looks clear.
text: Quickly Pritcher moves deeper into the room, and stops beside
text: a door, his back against the wall.
dialog: cUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANCIENT ARCHIVE -- NIGHT
text: BAYTA watches helplessly as EBLING scurries around looking
text: down at the equation at his feet. Like he cannot believe it.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: What is it? What do you see?
dialog: cUT TO:
dialog: 104.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM CHAMBER -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER looks inside. There is a large empty bed. THE MULE
text: can be seen staring out the window with his back to the door.
text: In one fluid motion Pritcher runs into the room and throws
text: the strange SPHERE he made. The thing sails through the air.
text: It attaches to the Mule’s back and ELECTRICITY SNAKES CRAZILY
text: around his body ATTACKING HIS FORCEFIELDS. The Mule writhes.
text: And suddenly, he stops his jerking. The Mule falls backward.
text: He hits the floor hard flat on his back. The forcefields are
text: in FLUX. Pritcher runs to the Mule and stands over the body.
text: Pritcher holds a JAGGED PIECE OF METAL like a homemade knife.
text: The first layer of forcefield SPUTTERS OUT. The Mule is more
text: visible than ever before. There really is a man in there and
text: The forcefields continue to SPARK -- and now the second layer
text: SPUTTERS OUT. The face of the Mule comes into sharper focus.
text: Pritcher positions his grisly weapon and waits for the rest
text: of the field to give way. He can’t wait to thrust the knife.
dialog: cUT TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANCIENT ARCHIVE -- NIGHT
text: EBLING turns to BAYTA finally. He looks like a wild man, his
text: face gaunt and sick, his hair a tangle. Ebling stares out
text: with eyes full of illumination:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: There is a Second Foundation,
dialog: and it can win. Bayta. The
dialog: Second Foundation can defeat
dialog: the Mule if it is given time!
text: Bayta listens to him. Despite her better judgement she finds
text: herself getting caught up in the moment, hoping against hope.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: It must not be taken. If it
text: is captured by the Mule
dialog: prematurely then we are lost.
text: Bayta sees MAGNIFICO slowly, quietly emerge from the shadows.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: (roughly)
dialog: You. Get out of here.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Let him stay and hear it all.
speaker_heading: BAYTA
dialog: No. I want him to go -- now.
text: Magnifico looks from one to the other not knowing what to do.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: (in anger and pain)
dialog: Let me speak. I have to get
dialog: this out of my head!
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM CHAMBER -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER is poised over the prone body of THE MULE. The last
dialog: layer of forcefield DISAPPEARS--
text: And Pritcher looks down in surprise at the face staring back.
text: It is pale like a corpse. The eyes are rolled back in their
text: sockets and the mouth hangs open. A bullet HOLE in its head.
text: Pritcher stares at the face of the PRESIDENT of planet Haven.
dialog: cur TO:
text: FLASHBACK. On television the President holds a pistol to his
text: own head smiling happily, and pulls the trigger to a GUNSHOT.
dialog: cUT TO:
text: Pritcher stares at the face. Out of the open mouth comes a
text: vile sound slowly rising up from the throat. It is LAUGHTER.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANCIENT ARCHIVE -- NIGHT
text: BAYTA watches MAGNIFICO. He wants to hear what EBLING found:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: The Second Foundation has kept
dialog: itself secret with good reason.
dialog: The secrecy must be upheld, do
dialog: you hear me? It has a purpose.
dialog: cUT TO:
dialog: 106.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM CHAMBER -- NIGHT
text: PRITCHER tries to run away--but only makes it a few feet--and
text: then he can’t control his legs. He drops onto his knees as
text: that LAUGHTER fills the room and
text: Pritcher brings his hands to his head, his face contorted in
text: pain, and finally, he collapses.
dialog: cur TO:
scene_heading: INT. ANCIENT ARCHIVE -- NIGHT
text: BAYTA looks like she wants to stop it all. She just listens.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: No matter what happens to us,
dialog: the Mule must not discover the
dialog: true meaning of “star’s end.”
text: Bayta turns. Watches MAGNIFICO.
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: We have to go. The information
dialog: we carry is vital. We must get
dialog: to the Second Foundation before
dialog: the Mule does.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: You know where they’re hiding?
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS
dialog: Yes.
text: Ebling looks at Magnifico, and smiles, as if the promise of
dialog: peace is here at last. He says:
speaker_heading: EBLING MIS (CONT'D)
dialog: Finally, I can tell you. The
dialog: Second Foundation--
text: There is a DEAFENING NOISE. We are looking at a RAGGED HOLE
text: in the wall where Ebling stood. He is not there anymore, and
text: now we see a PAIR OF LEGS teetering bizarrely, obscenely, and
text: then the legs fall to the floor.
text: The shocked Magnifico hurries over to what’s left of Ebling,
dialog: but there is nothing to be done:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: YOU KILLED HIM!
text: Bayta stands there shaking...and holding her smoking BLASTER.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Now we see the deformed body of Magnifico slowly rise and
text: straighten, standing tall for the first time. Somehow his
text: twisted spine has been repaired.
text: His back is to Bayta as he says:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: When did you know? A second
dialog: before you pulled the trigger,
dialog: I suppose. Well done. I was
dialog: expecting, if you fired, that
dialog: you would fire at me. It is
dialog: not an easy thing to surprise
dialog: aman of my peculiar talents.
text: And Magnifico turns around. He mocks her, with a formal bow.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: Allow me to introduce myself.
dialog: (short pause)
dialog: I am the Mule.
text: Bayta stands there, still aiming the blaster, frozen, unable
text: to move or speak. He has her.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: Poor Ebling. Thanks to me his mind
dialog: was operating at peak efficiency
dialog: for the first time in his life. of
dialog: course, the process was killing him,
dialog: but he would have lived long enough
dialog: for my purposes...if not for you.
text: Magnifico’s face does not look that different, but he is no
text: longer a grotesque joke. His ugly features have lost their
text: childlike quality. His fear is gone. His bearing is strong.
text: He steps close to Bayta, and looks at her, with great desire:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: The first time you saw me, you liked
dialog: me, without my having to juggle your
dialog: emotions. You were neither repelled
dialog: nor amused. You liked me.
text: Magnifico reaches out to Bayta and gently caresses her cheek.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: And so I stayed out of your mind. I
dialog: couldn’t bring myself to tamper with
dialog: it. My first -- and only -- mistake.
text: Now he abruptly lets go of her.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: I sense your...revulsion. How silly.
dialog: I could make you love me very easily.
dialog: It would be an artificial love, but
dialog: there would be no difference between
dialog: it and the real emotion. Not to you.
text: Magnifico steps away from her then, and seems to reach out
text: with his mind. Sensing things.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: The fleet is here. My new second-in-
dialog: command will arrive soon. Oh, here
dialog: he comes, would you like to meet him?
text: Bayta does not move. She just stands there. But her eyes
text: reveal the fear her body can’t.
text: And PRITCHER steps into view. We recognize the dead look on
text: his face. Seen it before on countless others. He is turned.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: The brave Captain infiltrated my
dialog: soldiers and tried to kill what
dialog: you thought was the Mule. Just
dialog: a shell into which I deposited a
dialog: part of my mind, in the process
dialog: giving birth to your “Magnifico.”
text: He steps back toward Pritcher.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: I am relieved to be whole again.
text: Walking around like a frightened
text: clown does grow rather tiresome.
dialog: And now he commands his slave:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: Say hello to Bayta. After all,
dialog: she loves you.
text: Pritcher turns his head and looks at her, without expression.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER
dialog: Hello.
text: And he turns back to Magnifico.
speaker_heading: PRITCHER (CONT’D)
text: The fleet is ready to depart on
dialog: your command, sir.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 109.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (3)
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO
dialog: Very good, Captain. Very good.
dialog: Magnifico has a final thought:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: Look on the bright side, my dear.
dialog: You have found your faith. Only a
dialog: true believer in the Seldon Plan
dialog: would kill to hide the location of
dialog: the Second Foundation.
text: Bayta’s eyes burn through him.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: I can feel the hate. I think you
dialog: hate Hari Seldon as much as you
dialog: do me. Maybe you picked the wrong
dialog: side. I will find them, you know.
dialog: If they exist I will destroy them.
text: Magnifico leaves her there. She points a blaster at nothing.
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: Or do you really think I will be
text: defeated by a man who took his
dialog: last breath 1,000 years ago? A
dialog: dead hand against a living will!
text: Pritcher walks through the door, without turning back. But
text: the Mule stops. He looks at her, one last time, pain and
text: regret spreading over his face:
speaker_heading: MAGNIFICO (CONT'D)
dialog: I will let you live. My foolish
dialog: mistakes are my own. I will let you
dialog: live...in the name of friendship.
text: Then his expression hardens. He gives us one last look of
text: bottomless hate. And he is GONE.
text: Bayta stands in the center of the room pointing that blaster.
text: She hasn’t moved since she shot Ebling, the pathetic remains
text: of his body visible on the floor.
text: She stands there for the longest time, like a statue, unable
text: to blink. The seconds tick away.
text: Bayta holds the weapon. There is no sound, just the silence.
text: She does not move. Not a muscle.
text: Her finger is on the trigger and
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (4)
text: Suddenly Bayta FIRES the blaster. Again and again and again.
dialog: Like she’s been trying to pull that goddamn trigger forever
text: and now she cannot stop shooting.
text: The sound of the blasts die and Bayta lifts her head up high.
text: She opens her mouth and RELEASES A DEFIANT SCREAM that rises
text: up from somewhere deep inside her and challenges the heavens.
