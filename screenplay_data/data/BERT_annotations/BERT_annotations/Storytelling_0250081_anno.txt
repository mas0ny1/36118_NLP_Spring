scene_heading: INT. MARCUS'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
dialog: The time is circa 1985.
dialog: 
text: Vi and Marcus finish making love. Marcus has cerebral palsy.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Hey, you want to hear my short
dialog: story now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Huh?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
text: (lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed)
dialog: I can read it to you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: You mean, again?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Well, I changed the ending a
dialog: little.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Oh. What happens now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Well, actually, it's the same, but
dialog: longer. I think it's better.
dialog: More...raw.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Well then, maybe you should just
dialog: read the ending.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: But it won't make any sense if you
dialog: hear it out of context.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: I think you should leave it the
dialog: way it was. It was good.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: So you don't want to hear my new
dialog: ending?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: You'll read it in class tomorrow.
dialog: Surprise me.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Anyway, I have to go. I promised
dialog: Melinda I'd help her with her
dialog: oral.
dialog: 
text: She rises, starts dressing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You're tired of me. I can tell.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You've lost interest...You hardly
dialog: even sweat any more when we
dialog: have sex.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: I was never much of a sweater. You
dialog: know that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You
dialog: feel You feel pity now. The
dialog: pleasure isn't there any more. The
dialog: kinkiness has gone...You've
dialog: become kind.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS GREEN - DAY
dialog: 
text: It is bright and sunny.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MR SCOTT'S CLASSROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Mr Scott, who is black, presides over his class. Marcus is
text: reading from his story, Vi at his side. Catherine, a stunning
text: intellectual, sits near the teacher. The rest of the students
text: (Amy, Elli, etc.) listen closely and take notes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: "...but when he saw her...it was
text: as if he could walk like a
dialog: normal person. His legs didn't
dialog: swing, his arms didn't spaz
dialog: away...He wasn't a freak any more,
dialog: for she made him forget his
dialog: affliction. No more cerebral
dialog: palsy! From now on "CP" stood
dialog: for...cerebral person. He was a
dialog: cerebral person.
dialog: 
text: Pause. Marcus and Vi exchange looks.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: I thought it was really good,
dialog: Marcus...Really moving and
dialog: emotional.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLI
dialog: Yeah, I thought it was really
text: emotional, too.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: And I mean, really good word
dialog: choices. It kind of reminded me a
dialog: little of Faulkner, but East Coast
dialog: and disabled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUCY
dialog: Or Flannery O'Connor. She had
dialog: multiple sclerosis.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOYCE
text: And Borges. He was blind.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Updike has psoriasis.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: Um...Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm
dialog: afraid I found the whole thing to
dialog: be a little trite. Its earnestness
dialog: is, well...it's a little
dialog: embarrassing. And those
dialog: adjectives, they're a little
dialog: flatfooted. And redundant. I'm
dialog: sorry, but...Anyway, what do I
dialog: know? Don't even listen to what I
dialog: say. I mean...
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Anyone else?
dialog: 
dialog: No response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Catherine is right. The story's a
dialog: piece of shit. You express nothing
dialog: but banalities and, formally
dialog: speaking, are unable to construct
dialog: a single compelling sentence. You
text: ride on a wave of clich√©s so worn,
text: in fact, it actually approaches a
dialog: level of grotesquerie. Ad your
dialog: subtitle, 'the rawness of truth'
dialog: is that supposed to be a joke of
dialog: some sort? Or are you just being
dialog: pretentious?
dialog: (beat; then checking his class book)
dialog: OK. Who's next?
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. CAMPUS COURTYARD - DAY
dialog: 
text: Marcus, upset, rushes outside, Vi in pursuit, desperately trying to
dialog: console.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Marcus, wait up!
dialog: 
text: Marcus stops.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What do you want?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Don't be so upset. It's OK...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: What the fuck are you talking
dialog: about? What's OK?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know he hated my story also.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Your story was terrible!
dialog: 
text: He moves on, she keeps up with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Marcus...You'll write something
dialog: better next time!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Patronizing fuck! If you had just
dialog: been honest with me in the first
dialog: place I wouldn't have read it. I
dialog: knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I
dialog: believed you!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: That's not fair! I was honest!
dialog: Just because I wasn't sucking up
dialog: like 	that bitch Catherine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Well, I sure didn't hear you voice
dialog: your opinion in there when it
dialog: mattered.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: I admit it - I was scared! I was
text: shocked, in fact , by what he
dialog: said. And he's so...convincing.
dialog: I'm sorry if I let you down, but
dialog: really, I still say he's just
dialog: one opinion. I don't even like his
dialog: books that much. They're all so
dialog: aggressively confrontational. I
dialog: don't care if he's won the
dialog: Pulitzer Prize.
dialog: 
text: Catherine and Mr Scott walk by together in the distance.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You just want to fuck him. Like
dialog: Catherine and every other white
text: cunt on campus.
dialog: 
text: He leaves her.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. VI AND MELINDA'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Melinda lies on her bed with some homework, watching Vi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI (O.S)
dialog: (on phone)
dialog: ...But Marcus! You can't just
text: unilaterally decide to end things.
dialog: This is a relationship we're
dialog: talking about! A friendship! You
dialog: don't just...Fuck you!
dialog: 
text: She hangs up and enters her bedroom, in tears.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI(cont'd)
dialog: Fuck him! Fuck him! Fuck him...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELINDA
dialog: Vi? Are you OK?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Yes. I'm OK. I'm totally OK.
dialog: 
text: Melinda rises, puts a hand on her shoulder.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELINDA
dialog: You did the right thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: I know that. Fucking cripple. Why
dialog: do I waste my time with
dialog: undergrads? They're all
dialog: so...juvenile! Uch! I just thought
dialog: Marcus would be different. I
dialog: mean he's got CP!
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MELINDA
dialog: What are you gonna do now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: I dunno...go to a bar...get
dialog: laid...whatever...Don't worry
dialog: about me. I'll be fine...
dialog: 
text: She starts changing into a new outfit.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. BAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Students hang around outside. Vi goes inside.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. BAR - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Vi walks up to the bar.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Can I have a beer?
dialog: 
text: After getting her beer, Vi turns around and suddenly notices Mr Scott,
text: who is sitting alone. She goes over to him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI(cont'd)
dialog: Hi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Hello, Vi.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: What are you doing here?
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just
dialog: didn't expect to run into you
dialog: here, that's all.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Well, now you have.
dialog: 
text: Vi laughs, sort of, ten blushes.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Uh huh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Can I join you?
dialog: 
text: Mr Scott gestures for her to sit down with him.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI(cont'd)
dialog: Gee, thanks. Well, um...I just
dialog: wanted to say that I'm really
dialog: happy with the class and,
dialog: um...I know you must here this all
dialog: the time, but I'm also a
dialog: great admirer of your work. A
dialog: Sunday Lynching,
dialog: especially...really, um spoke to
dialog: me. God, I hope I'm not
dialog: embarrassing you...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: You're not.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Good.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: 'Cause I...um...I really agreed
dialog: with everything you had to say
dialog: last week about how bad my story
dialog: was...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: And I also agreed with what you
dialog: said today about Marcus's story.
dialog: It is a piece of shit.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: You have beautiful skin.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Thank you.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So Catherine seems like she might
dialog: become a really good writer.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Maybe. She's OK.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Aren't you going out with
dialog: Catherine?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm sorry. It's none of my
dialog: business. I didn't mean...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: I'm not 'going out' with
dialog: Catherine.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Oh.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Do you think I have a potential as
dialog: a writer?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: No.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Thank you for being honest.
dialog: 
text: Mr Scott leans over and touches her hand.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: I have so much respect for you.
dialog: 
scene_heading: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Mr Scott and Vi walk together in silence.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MR SCOTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Vi and Mr Scott enter. He turns around and looks at her. Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Can I just freshen up for a
dialog: second?
dialog: 
text: He indicates the direction of the bathroom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: It's over there.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MR SCOTT'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Vi enters, locks the door behind her. She looks at herself in the
text: mirror, then notices a snapshot of Catherine: she is naked, legs open
text: wide. Other erotic photographs lie beneath Catherine's.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
text: (to herself, almost chanting)
dialog: Don't be a racist. Don't be a
dialog: racist. Don't be a racist...
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MR SCOTT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Vi emerges from the bathroom to find Mr Scott lounging on the bed.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: It's a really nice place you have.
dialog: Is the rent high?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Take off your top.
dialog: 
text: She obliges.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Now...take off the rest.
dialog: 
text: She does, and he looks hard at her. Finally he rises.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Turn around.
dialog: 
text: She does.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Bend over.
dialog: 
text: He starts making love to her, from behind.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT(cont'd)
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: Say, 'nigger, fuck me.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Say, Ni...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Ni...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: ...gger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: ...gger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Say, 'Nigger.'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Nigger.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: 'Fuck me hard!'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Fuck me hard!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Nigger, fuck me hard!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Again!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Nigger, fuck me hard!!...

speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: Again!!

scene_heading: EXT. MARCUS'S DORMITORY - NIGHT

dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MARCUS'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
dialog: 
text: Marcus looks in the mirror, ponders his reflection.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: Freak.
dialog: 
text: There is a soft knock at the door. He turns away from the mirror and
text: opens it. Vi is there, teary-eyed, disheveled.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: Can I come in?
dialog: 
text: They embrace.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: You're all...sweaty!
dialog: 
scene_heading: INT. MR SCOTTS CLASSROOM - DAY
dialog: 
text: Vi finishes reading her story to the class.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: '...So John flipped her around and
text: slammed her against the wall. Jane
dialog: braced herself: she thought about
text: her mother. She thought about
dialog: Peter. She thought about God...and
dialog: rape. ''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger.
dialog: Fuck me hard.''' John's flesh
text: abraded her soft skin. There would
dialog: be marks. She acquiesced, and said
dialog: what he asked her to say, and did
dialog: what he asked her to do. She had
dialog: entered college with hope, with
dialog: dignity, but she would graduate as
dialog: a whore.'
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: Why do people have to be so
dialog: ugly...write about such ugly
dialog: characters? It's perverted. I know
dialog: you all think I'm being prisssy,
dialog: but I don't care. I was brought up
dialog: in a certain way. And this
dialog: is...mean-spirited!
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Yeah, well, it did seem a little
dialog: affected. Like by using taboo
dialog: language you were trying to shock
dialog: us about the hollowness of your
dialog: characters.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: I think it was a little bit
dialog: racist.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLI
dialog: It was completely racist, and
dialog: beyond that I felt deeply offended
dialog: as a 	woman. As if a woman can
dialog: only operate from experiences of
dialog: objectification.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUE
text: Totally phallocentric.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLI
dialog: And so weirdly misogynistic. I
dialog: mean, why does Jane go through
dialog: with this? Is she stupid?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ETHAN
dialog: Hey, But wasn't this a rape? Or
dialog: ...did I miss something? Because I
dialog: - I'm confused. Because if this
dialog: was a rape, then why would she be
dialog: a whore?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CATHERINE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: It was confessional, yet
text: dishonest. Jane pretends to be
dialog: horrified by 	the sexuality that
text: she in fact fetishizes. She
text: subsumes herself to the myth of
text: black male potency, but then
text: doesn't follow through. She thinks
dialog: she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she
dialog: thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,'
dialog: what a notch he 'd make in her
dialog: belt, but, of course, it all comes
dialog: down to mandingo clich√©, and he
dialog: calls her on it. In classic racist
text: tradition she demonizes, then runs
dialog: for cover. But then, how could she
dialog: behave otherwise? She's just a
text: spoiled suburban white girl with a
dialog: Benneton rainbow complex. It's
dialog: just my opinion, and what do I
dialog: know...but I think it's a callow
dialog: piece of writing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
text: Callow and coy. Jane wants more,
dialog: but isn't honest enough to admit
text: it. In the end, she returns to the
dialog: safety of her crippled
dialog: (translation: sexually impotent)
dialog: boyfriend.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MARCUS
dialog: This is bullshit! Her story was
dialog: the truth!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: JOYCE
dialog: Right.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SUE
dialog: It's unbelievable!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: ELLI
dialog: It's clich√©d!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: AMY
dialog: It's disgusting!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: VI
dialog: But it happened!
dialog: 
dialog: Silence.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MR SCOTT
dialog: I don't know about 'what
dialog: happened,' Vi, because once you
dialog: start writing, it all becomes
dialog: fiction. Still, it certainly is an
dialog: improvement over your last story:
dialog: There is now at least a beginning,
text: a middle, and an end.

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Great!
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: So what's going on?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: That's what I was gonna ask you.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: But...you called.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just
dialog: calling because, well, I was
dialog: wondering if you still remembered
dialog: me, which I guess you do...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
dialog: Pause.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: So. Look at where we are: the year
dialog: 2000! Can you believe it? I mean,
dialog: did you ever think we would
dialog: actually make it?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Um, well, yeah.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So are you still acting?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I
dialog: kind of came to terms with myself,
dialog: I realized I had done what I had
text: to do. And it was time to move on.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Oh. So what did you do after you
dialog: gave up on acting?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Well, I went to law school, if you

dialog: 
text: Mike, Toby's roommate and cameraman, enters looking for a towel, then

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: I believe it.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah, well, it was really all kind
dialog: of a joke - and a rip-off, so,
dialog: uh...so I dropped out.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Oh, that's too bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah, well, then it got me
dialog: writing, so that was a good thing.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Anything I might know about?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Well, um, I kind of let things go
dialog: on this novel I'd been really into
dialog: - I mean, the whole publishing
dialog: industry is totally corrupt. I
dialog: mean, really, it's finished.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: That's too bad.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I worked over at a homeless
dialog: shelter for a while, drove a cab
dialog: to pay the rent, but, I mean, that
dialog: was like - I mean, I have some
dialog: dignity.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: That's good. So then what do you
dialog: do now?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: I'm a documentary filmmaker.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Oh? Anything I might have seen?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a
dialog: grant for this one project on
dialog: teenagers. Geez, remember when we
dialog: were teenagers?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to
dialog: the prom.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Oh, I don't remember that...
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: I do.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY

dialog: 
dialog: No response.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)
dialog: Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking
dialog: for subjects for this documentary
dialog: on teenage life in suburbia. Kind
dialog: of an exploration of the mental
dialog: psyche of its mythology. I wrote
dialog: to Derrida to see if he'd like to
dialog: do the narration. But everything's
dialog: still kind of in development at
dialog: this point.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Hunh.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY(beat)
dialog: I work in a shoe store right now.
dialog: But it's cool. I'm not ashamed. I
dialog: mean, really, I have a much
dialog: stronger sense of self now. And,
dialog: uh, anyways, it's really very
dialog: temporary.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: That's good.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me.
dialog: What about you? I'd heard through
dialog: the grapevine you were producing
dialog: movies.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah. But not any more.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast

dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY (CONT'D)

dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)

speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: Huh. Kids?
dialog: 
speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)
dialog: Yeah.
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TOBY
dialog: How many?

speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)

speaker_heading: PAM (V.O.)

speaker_heading: EDITOR
