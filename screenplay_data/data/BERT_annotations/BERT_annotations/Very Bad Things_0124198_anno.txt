scene_heading: THE DEAD OF NIGHT
text: Pitch black. Dead quiet. Dim faint light appears in the
text: distance, approaching, growing larger. As the light nears,
text: we recognize car headlights. Closer and closer until the car
dialog: is bearing down upon us with great force...
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Two men in the front seat, FISHER and MOORE. Fisher drives.
text: All seems quite normal until we take a closer look, sweat
text: matts hair, dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are
text: blistered and bloody. They seem almost entranced.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: That ought to be about the end of
dialog: that.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yup.
text: SILENCE. PUSH IN ON Fisher...
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: "The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 -
text: 6 lead in a, tough, football game
dialog: and this crowd is standing..."
scene_heading: FISHER'S VISION - GRAINY - OUT OF THE PAST THREE RIVER STADIUM -
speaker_heading: DECEMBER 23RD, 1972
text: Playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh

dialog: to go, 4th quarter.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: "Hang on to your hats, here come the

scene_heading: INT. CAR - FISHER

speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: "It comes down to one big play, 4th
text: down, ten yards to go. Terry Bradshaw
dialog: at the controls..."
text: Bradshaw throws.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

text: Bradshaw throws.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

scene_heading: INT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - MARRIAGE LICENSE DEPT. - DAY
text: SLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids,
text: some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick
dialog: up their marriage license.
text: We HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his
text: fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him,
text: unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he
text: could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and
dialog: not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow
text: moving line.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: This is ridiculous.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Government cutbacks.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why can't we do it through the mail?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (patient)
dialog: We missed the deadline.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Can't we do it on the phone?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I don't think so.
text: In front of them a middle-aged MEXICAN COUPLE make-out
text: intensely while their chubby little THREE YEAR OLD stares at
dialog: Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why is this Kid staring at me?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm not sure.
text: Liz pulls a note-pad out of her daypack.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (reading from her
dialog: notes)
dialog: Did you send in all of the deposit
dialog: checks?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (pause)
dialog: What do you mean, you think so?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure
dialog: what all of them are.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: The wedding cake check?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Sent it.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Photographer?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Sent it.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Florist?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Caterer?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Hotel for my parents, the tent, the
dialog: band, the Judge...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I think I forgot the tent.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (somewhat alarmed)
dialog: You forgot the tent?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Why what?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why did you forget the tent check?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You can't play around with these
dialog: tent people.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm not playing around. I forgot.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What else have you forgot?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: How could I know what else I forgot?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I'm working my ass off here. I've
dialog: taken care of absolutely everything
dialog: Keith.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Because you wanted to. You wanted
dialog: this to be your wedding not your
dialog: parent's.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Don't you dare.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Don't you put this on me. Don't do
dialog: it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
text: A YOUNG TEENAGE COUPLE behind them stares at Liz, a bit
dialog: confused.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (trying to calm her)
dialog: Stop it. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (trying to control
dialog: herself)
dialog: You know how important this is to my
dialog: mother. You know that.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the
dialog: tent. I don't think I forgot anything
dialog: else.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (not bitchy)
dialog: I bet you didn't forget the bachelor
dialog: party checks.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Are we going to do this again?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I'm just saying I bet those checks
text: all found the mailboxes.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I wouldn't know.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It amazes me how organized you and
dialog: your little fun bunch can be when it
text: comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (patient)
dialog: They organized this, not me. I have
dialog: nothing to do with it.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Well it's bad timing.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: How do you figure?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Right before the wedding?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: It's a bachelor party. You sort of
dialog: have to do it before the wedding.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I suppose Boyd is the creative force
dialog: behind all this.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: He is.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He's a moron.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: He's my friend. He's not a moron.
speaker_heading: LIZ
text: David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
scene_heading: EXT. SANTA MONICA
text: TIGHT ON a "Fred Sands" realty sign being pounded into the
text: ground. Pictured on the sign, as "offered by," is realtor
text: DAVID BOYD, 30-ish, short hair, smiling with bizarre
dialog: sincerity.
text: WIDER to reveal, David Boyd in the flesh, suit jacket off,
text: pounding away, sinking the sign into the front yard of a
text: cute little house. His CELL PHONE RINGS. Boyd, gets the phone
text: from his jacket.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: David Boyd. Tina. Great. Okay. Here's
dialog: the deal, we're talking five guys.
dialog: Hard Rock. Nice guys Tina. My friends.
dialog: Yeah. I'm calling you directly so
dialog: you don't have to go through the
dialog: agency...
text: (suddenly, over his
dialog: shoulder)
text: HEY! DO NOT ENTER THE HOUSE!
dialog: (back into phone)
dialog: That's correct. Cash straight to
dialog: you. Yes. Twelve hundred? I don't
dialog: think so. It's just stripping. Just
text: a show. Hold on.
speaker_heading: (O.C.)
dialog: Could you please wait off the
dialog: property?
text: ANGLE ON A YOUNG COUPLE, obviously here to see the house.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: We're just trying to sneak a peak.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Just stay off the property until I'm
text: off the phone.
speaker_heading: MAN
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Cause that's the way they do it.
text: Bewildered and somewhat intimidated, they back off.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: (back into phone)
dialog: So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino.
dialog: Nine hundred bucks and you do the
dialog: thing with the rubber hoses. Are you
dialog: in? Tina, are you in? Good.
text: Boyd hangs up, puts on his jacket and turns with the same
text: bizarre insincere smile in his photo. Hand extended...
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: David Boyd, nice to meet you.
scene_heading: FISHER AND LIZ IN LINE
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why do you feel the need to explore
dialog: this side of your personality?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I'm talking about the kind of people
dialog: you hang out with... about growing
dialog: up, assuming responsibility of
dialog: yourself.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I asked you to marry me. I'm ready
dialog: for marriage. That's responsibility.
dialog: That's growth.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I just think that at some point you're
dialog: going to have to re-evaluate some of
dialog: your friendships...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Who else?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Charles Moore for instants.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: You don't like Moore? Since when?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It's not that I don't like him. But
dialog: the wedding has really got me thinking
dialog: and... I just keep myself opening
dialog: up. Growning. And I want you keeping
dialog: up with me here.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What does Moore have to do with your
dialog: growing?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I just don't see him in the big
dialog: picture.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I've known him since Cub Scouts.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He's weird.
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: He's quiet.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He's weird.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON - CHARLES MOORE
text: Late twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy KITCHEN.
text: His name, "Moore," is embroidered on his white chef's jacket.
text: Food orders fly all around as Moore works with a mesmerizing
text: focus, a poetic sense of purpose, fifteen things going on at
text: once; he chops, sautes, braises, etc..., in a perfect mute
dialog: silence.
text: FISHER AND LIZ STILL IN LINE
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: He just doesn't talk a lot.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Why? What's his problem?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: He's a great chef.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: He's weird. And I expect more from
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: You expect more what?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You're going to be hungover for three
dialog: days. Like those guys on "Oprah"
dialog: that get drunk and have disgusting
dialog: sex with prostitutes and then say
text: their vows with the stench of cheap
text: hotel whore sex all over them.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Time out.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: It's vile!
text: People are staring.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: That's absurd.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I've seen it on television.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm not going to marry you with the
dialog: smell of prostitutes on my body.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (starts to cry)
dialog: I am not common Keith. I am not
dialog: common. I am a creature like no other
dialog: and I will not be commoned! Is that
dialog: to much to ask?
dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Is that to much to ask!?!
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: You will not be common!!!
text: Finally, at the head of the line, Liz steps up to the clerk.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Marriage license please.
scene_heading: EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING
text: Fisher and Liz emerge, start for the parking lot. Liz stops
text: to look at Fisher, her eyes well with tears, vulnerable and
dialog: apologetic.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do you love me?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: How much?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: With all my heart.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (vulnerable)
dialog: Kiss me...?
text: FISHER takes her into his arms, pulls her to him, kisses her
dialog: hard, for all it's worth.
scene_heading: INT. A LARGE MONEY MANAGEMENT FIRM
text: Desk after desk after desk of identical men, seemingly
text: repeating the same task. We find Fisher at one of the desks,
text: number crunching. At the desk across from Fisher sits...
text: MICHAEL BRENN, short, compact, with a severe personality
text: disorder, masquerading as semi-appropriate behavior.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's just insecurity.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I don't know. She's really been
text: stressing out.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut
text: splinters.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It means she's insecure.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: About what?
text: Michael's phone rings.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (picks up)
text: Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5
text: for 6. At 29.83 at 9.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: I'm amazed the windows don't blow
dialog: out of their fucking sockets with
text: all the repressed, ass-puckering
dialog: rage in these soul-less lizards.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I just want her to be happy.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Same alarm clock every morning, same
text: two pops on the same snooze button...
speaker_heading: (PHONE RINGS; picks
dialog: up)
dialog: Michael Brenn. Yes... Yes...
dialog: (looking through stacks
dialog: of stats)
dialog: Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321
dialog: at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at
dialog: 3432.343.
dialog: (hangs up)
dialog: Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor,
dialog: hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic
dialog: Fisher and you better start addressing
dialog: it. You're getting married and I'm
dialog: not going to candy-coat it. It just
dialog: gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel
dialog: cement mixer that will crush every
dialog: bone in your body.
text: Fisher looks pale.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm not breathing right.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're not breathing right?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Lately I'll just start getting
text: lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I
dialog: haven't breathed in like two minutes.
text: ADAM BRENN, Michael's older brother, mid-30's, a bit soft in
text: the belly, approaches, more or less in charge.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (to Michael)
dialog: We're leaving from my house in three
dialog: hours. If you want to come, get your
dialog: numbers in order by then.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: First of all...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (cuts him off)
dialog: No first of all. I'm not in a game
dialog: mood.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're interrupting a personal
dialog: conversation.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (to Fisher)
dialog: Sorry Fish.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: We'll be ready Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I know you'll be.
dialog: (to Michael)
text: Three hours.
dialog: Adam goes.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I don't care for him.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: He's your brother.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: So?
text: Fisher's phone RINGS.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (pick's up)
dialog: Keith Fisher.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN
text: Liz sits at the kitchen table, in a mild panic.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: We've got problems here.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Problems?
text: INTERCUT Liz and Fisher.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Seating problems.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Keith do not trivialize this.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm not. What's the problem?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: We're supposed to have gold-trimmed
dialog: padded seats, now they're telling me
dialog: that there was a mistake and we can't
dialog: have padded.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What kind of seats can we have?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Not padded ones.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You go down there.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Go down where?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Go down to the seat place and
dialog: straighten this out.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Honey I don't have the time...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: We're leaving in three hours.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (starts to cry)
dialog: I need your help.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'll call them from the road.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do you love me?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: More than I ever imagined being able
dialog: to love anyone ever.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Take care of those chairs.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: We're leaving from Adam's. Come send
dialog: me off.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Maybe.
scene_heading: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SANTA MONICA
text: BOYD, MOORE, FISHER in the middle, MICHAEL and his older
text: brother, ADAM, all in suits pose in front of Adam's brand
text: new, state of the art, Chevy Minivan while Adam's very
text: aggressive wife, LOIS, mired in domestic resentment, focuses
dialog: her camera.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Notice how clean and well-behaved
dialog: they all appear, respectable members
dialog: of modern society. Timmy, Adam Jr.,
dialog: take a good look at this...
text: Adam's and Lois' kids, Timmy, 8, and Adam Jr., 10, watch
text: with Liz. (Adam Jr., in leg braces and crutches, suffers
dialog: from muscular dystrophy)
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: ...We will compare these before photos
dialog: with whatever form of degeneration
dialog: presented to us in 24 hours, no matter
dialog: how low, how vile...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: ...embarrassing, shameful...
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: ...regression of Modern Man to his
dialog: most primitive, ape-like state...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: The stone age.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: The post-Vegas Man.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: A mutant species.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Okay boys, smile!
text: Lois clicks off photos of the men.
speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: All right. As you were.
text: The guys break. Fisher goes to Liz.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Will you please call the chair people?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I will.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do you love me?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Of course.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Just call and let me know that your
dialog: okay.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I love you.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Have a nice bachelor party.
text: Adam kisses Lois and the kids goodbye. Adam Jr. nearly looses
text: his balance in the excitement, Adam catches him.
text: Boyd starts to get in the drivers seat.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Not on your life.
text: Boyd slides over shotgun, cranks the MUSIC. Fisher's the
text: last one in. He slides the big Minivan door shut and they're
dialog: off.
text: Adam looks in the rearview mirror, Lois, Liz, Timmy wave
text: goodbye. Adam Jr. waves one of his crutches.
scene_heading: EXT. HWY - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

scene_heading: INT. MINIVAN - LATER
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: You're a fucking moron.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: It's my fucking opinion.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's really a stupid opinion. You
dialog: have developed an annoying habit of
text: talking for what seems to be no other
dialog: reason than to hear yourself speak.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Because my opinion threatens yours,
dialog: it's poorly developed?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No, because your opinions are idiotic
dialog: and have nothing to do with what any
dialog: given conversation is about, which
dialog: makes 85% of your eagerly injected
dialog: thought process highly offensive to
dialog: me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: The hell I did!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The hell you didn't!
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: The hell I did!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You said one in two marriages end in
dialog: divorce.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: I never heard that.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: You said that Boyd.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Well, I didn't mean it.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're an asshole Adam.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You're an asshole.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Oh, and why am I an asshole?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Multiple reasons.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Name one.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I don't have to...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: SHUT UP!
text: DEAD SILENCE. As they ride through the lifeless desert, Fisher
text: dials his cell phone.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Is this Pico Party rents? Can I speak
dialog: to whomever is in charge of chairs?
text: Chairs.
text: Boyd checks his watch.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Four hours and fifteen minutes. I
dialog: can make Vegas in 3 and change.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm not getting a ticket.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (on cell phone)
dialog: Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're
dialog: doing my wedding and I'm calling
dialog: about the chair situation. Yeah,
dialog: I'll hold.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Who's up for making some real money?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Don't even start.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: You want to hear me out?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Nope.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Moore?
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: No I don't.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Fish?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Not really.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Prison Communication Systems.
dialog: (no response)
dialog: An acquaintance friend of mine is
dialog: professionally involved with a
dialog: communications outfit in Denver that
dialog: I just happen to know for a fact is
text: about to be rewarded a very large,
dialog: exclusive contract to rewire every
dialog: state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
dialog: Nobody gives a fuck.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs.
dialog: Keith Fisher. Okay.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: That would translate to government
dialog: guaranteed contract in excess of 35
dialog: million dollars.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: We need padded chairs.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Or a stock kick of approximately
dialog: 125% on shares which are currently
dialog: sitting around $4.38, or, in plain
dialog: English...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: SHUT UP!
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: NO!
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: What is wrong with you people? I'm a
dialog: helper here.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Your investment ideas never work
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: That's the whole point. They rarely
dialog: work out. But on occasion they do.
dialog: And when they do, they do big.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Your ideas never work out.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Oh really? Starbucks?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That's one idea.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: No... we want padded chairs... okay?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: One idea that if you had fucking
dialog: listened to, you would each be worth
dialog: approximately 15 million dollars.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You can't keep bringing up Starbucks.
dialog: That was your only real hit in like
dialog: 75 tries.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: I set up Fisher with the broker that
dialog: found his house. Took care of that
dialog: one, didn't I?
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Prison Communications.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I don't think so Boyd.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No
dialog: sir.
text: He turns away from the guys and stares out the window.
speaker_heading: FISHER (O.S.)
dialog: Yes, I was holding for Tony in chairs.
dialog: I have a chair problem. No, I'm not
dialog: Tony, I need to speak to Tony.

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: All the bullshit aside Fish, we've
dialog: been coming up here for what, eight
dialog: years?
text: Boyd, carving a branch with his boy scout knife...
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: More.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Over eight years of some of the
dialog: hardest raging experiences of my

speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Good times.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
text: Drum banging real times.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Real times.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: They've all been real times. And as
dialog: you prepare to enter into a new phase
dialog: of life, as you prepare for new roles;
dialog: father, husband, teacher, you will,
dialog: as I have, come to except the letting
dialog: go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing
dialog: will begin...
speaker_heading: BOYD

dialog: (struggles to remember)
dialog: Hell he said so many Goddamn things

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Right! That's exactly what I'm saying.

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: No. I think it's fucked.
speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Israel doesn't have a King.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Then what do they have?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: They have a president. A Benjamin
dialog: Yahoo something.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: I say to myself, look at the map.
dialog: Look what's all around you. People
dialog: who wish bad bad things for you and
dialog: your people. For thousands of years
dialog: the Jews are fighting everybody. It
dialog: used to be they'd throw rocks, then

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Now if I'm the King of Israel and

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The Israelis can protect themselves.

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: There's my point exactly.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: What? What's your point?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Take Mexico.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Look up the chickens, dig up the

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: That's what I'm saying. Let the
dialog: Israelis straighten it up. They got
dialog: plenty of room down there, number
dialog: one. Plus, and this is just a plus,
dialog: they kind of look alike -- the Jews

scene_heading: HOTEL SUIT - MONTAGE

speaker_heading: MOORE

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: ADAM

speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just
dialog: take a second here and take hold of
dialog: the situation, OK? Let's just review
dialog: our options here.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We have a dead woman bleeding all
dialog: over the bathroom. What options?
dialog: Call the police.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Call the police. Okay, that's one
dialog: option.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That is not an "option." There is no
dialog: multiple choice here.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Yes sir, there sure is an option
dialog: here. There are always options.
dialog: ON Fisher and Moore.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I've never seen a dead person.
text: As Moore moves in, transfixed, to take a closer look...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (enraged)
dialog: Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Well we can definitely call the

dialog: call the police... What happens?
dialog: (silence)
text: They find a dead prostitute in the
dialog: bathroom... They ask us... What
dialog: happened? We say, ah... our friend,
dialog: Michael...
dialog: (to Adam)
dialog: Your brother... got a little out of
dialog: control... they were making love...
dialog: and he got a little excited... and
dialog: he, ah, sort of beat her head into

text: her to death with a rubber hose...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Stop it!
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: There's more.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Just stop.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Just giving the facts.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm calling the police.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: What were we doing officer? Why didn't
dialog: we help her? Well... we're all a bit
dialog: high, you know, bachelor party, that
dialog: kind of thing. Fisher here is getting
dialog: married in three days... Beautiful
dialog: wife... he didn't have anything at
dialog: all to do with it... It was all
dialog: Michael here... just Michael...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You don't play games with Homicide
dialog: police. There are no options here.
dialog: There is not the luxury of worrying
dialog: about how the fallout will settle.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: I've known him for while maybe twenty
dialog: years kind of a close friend but hey
dialog: what the heck officer, take him away,
dialog: go on it's for his own good.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (outraged)
dialog: What are you talking about? Adam's
dialog: right. We don't have a choice here
dialog: Boyd... I mean what are you talking
dialog: about? What options???
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: (calm)
text: Bury her out in the desert.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (sarcastic)
dialog: Sure, why not.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: He's right.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: We can take her out to Red Rock.
dialog: Find some quiet place... and put her
text: in the ground.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You don't just casually walk out of
text: a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: We can do this. We can get her out
dialog: of here.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Have you completely lost your mind?
dialog: So you get her out of here. So you
dialog: get her out into the desert somehow,
dialog: without anybody seeing, so what, you
dialog: don't think at some point somebody
dialog: might notice that she's gone?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Nobody knows she's here. I called
dialog: her personally. Nobody knows.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody
dialog: must know she's here.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Nobody knows.
text: PAUSE, as the guys digest this point.
speaker_heading: ADAM
text: Her blood is all over the bathroom.
dialog: I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: It's a marble floor, we can clean it
dialog: up.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Oh God. This is insane.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: What's insane is the fact that Michael
dialog: here put a fucking girl's head through
dialog: a toilet. That's insane.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: They'll get us on accessory to murder.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Bullshit it's not accessory. I didn't
dialog: do shit. You call the cops, you
dialog: explain it was an accident...
speaker_heading: BOYD
text: Her fucking head was caved in.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: So! I didn't fucking do it!
speaker_heading: BOYD
text: She's got bondage burns on her wrists.
text: There's blow all over the room, Moore
text: looks like he went at it with a
text: mountain lion. This room looks like
dialog: the Manson Family stayed here a month.
text: Michael goes down, we all go down.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I'm not going to ruin my life over a
dialog: dead whore.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead
dialog: whore?" She's a person!
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (falling away)
dialog: I'm getting married...
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I've got a wife and two boys.
text: Fisher shuffles to a corner, collapses, head in hands.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: (unflappably calm)
dialog: Lets take a vote. A simple vote. Two
dialog: choices; we clean up the mess. Right
dialog: now. Bury it in the desert, go home,
dialog: and never look back. Or, we can call
dialog: the police... Open those doors, roll
dialog: the dice and hope that it's only
dialog: Michael who falls. Let's take a vote.
dialog: Desert... or police?
text: BOYD looks around. BEAT. Raises his hand.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Desert.
text: He looks at MOORE.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fucking desert.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (to Fisher)
dialog: Fish, I'm really sorry. I just... I
dialog: owe you man.
dialog: (puts up his hand)
dialog: Desert.
text: All eyes on FISHER, no response.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Nobody knows she's here.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Good God... Good God...
text: All eyes on ADAM. He takes a while... Finally,
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: How do we get her out of here?
text: A reasonable question. Boyd thinks. BEAT.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the
text: car around to the back of the hotel,
dialog: throw her off the balcony, put her
dialog: in the car... Done.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You don't think someone will have a
text: problem with a body being thrown off
dialog: a balcony?
speaker_heading: BOYD
text: We check out the area and wait for a
dialog: time when it's clear.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What about the blood?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Someone goes to Walmart, gets some
dialog: buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and
dialog: Span, the works.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Have you ever done this before?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: The reality is, you take away the
dialog: horror of this situation, take away
dialog: the tragedy of the death, take away
dialog: the moral and ethical implications
dialog: of all the crap you have had
dialog: conditioned, beaten, into your head
dialog: since grade one. What are we left
dialog: with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115
dialog: lbs. that must be moved from point A
text: to point B. Now, a straight line in
dialog: the shortest distance but we are
dialog: denied the luxury of a visible
dialog: straight line. But that line exists
dialog: and I see it. I see that line. Trust
dialog: me. Adam. Trust me... I can take
dialog: care of this.

dialog: Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?
text: Adam throws his head in his hands.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: (through door)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: RALPH (O.S.)
dialog: I'm with Tina. Is she there?
text: Boyd indicates to the guys to be cool.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: She's not here.
speaker_heading: RALPH (O.S.)
dialog: Where is she?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: She's here. She's just... Hold on a
dialog: second.
text: Boyd turns as the guys freak. Crazed bits of panicked
text: conversation -- GIBBERISH.
speaker_heading: KNOCK KNOCK.
speaker_heading: RALPH (O.S.)
dialog: Could you open the door please.
text: Boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it. Ralph steps
text: in. Takes a good look around.
text: RALPH'S POV of the fairly destroyed hotel room and five
text: severely traumatized men.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Okay. Hi.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: So who's the lucky guy?
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: The groom?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Me.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Cool...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You all dudes from L.A.?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Yup.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Doing the bachelor party thing?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Sin City. Devil's Playground. The
dialog: Black Bitch. All day every day.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Where's Tina?
speaker_heading: BOYD
text: She's in the bathroom... she's still
dialog: working.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: She's still working?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Sweet deal.
text: SILENCE. Ralph checks the rest of the guys. Some strange eye
text: contact. Extremely uncomfortable.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: Is everything okay?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Great. Fine. Perfect.
text: More SILENCE.
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: (indicating bathroom)
dialog: I'm gonna just tell her I'm waiting.
text: He starts for the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: She's in there!
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
text: And Ralph is on his way to the bathroom. And the guys are
text: freaking as Ralph moves through the bedroom up towards the
text: bathroom. Hand on door -- opening door -- stepping in -- and
text: Ralph sees Tina.
text: RALPH, in shock, staring, back-peddles...
speaker_heading: RALPH
dialog: My God!
text: As Ralph starts to turn --
speaker_heading: FISHER (O.S.)
dialog: No! NOOOO!!!
text: ON BOYD -- his Boy Scout knife raised above his head --
dialog: driving it into Ralph's neck!
text: MAJOR ARTERIAL SPRAY as Ralph's jugular is severed. Ralph
text: struggles. Boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Help me! Don't let him bleed on the
dialog: carpet!
text: And MOORE is there. Helping Boyd wrestle the SCREAMING
text: thrashing Ralph into the bathroom. Ralph fights like a gilled
text: Marlin. They shove him into the bathroom. Boyd slams the
text: door shut. Holds it tight as Ralph tries to force it back
dialog: open.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: He'll bleed out! He'll bleed dry.
dialog: Help me hold the door.
text: And help they do. Michael, Moore and Adam all hold the door
text: shut as Ralph continues to fight for his life. Slowly the
text: force of his POUNDING eases. We hear Ralph slowing down...
text: The thrashing slows... softer... The MOANS quiet... softer...
text: Just a slight GURGLE... Ralph is going... going... Ralph is
dialog: gone.
speaker_heading: AT THE DOOR
text: Eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door. Devastating
text: SILENCE as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of
text: developments... with Fisher staring, blotto.
scene_heading: INT. THE BATHROOM
text: The door slowly opens. Boyd first -- then the rest of the
text: guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Oh God.
text: And Moore is out the door, racing for a garbage can to relieve
dialog: himself.
speaker_heading: THE GUYS' POV
text: An absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's
text: arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has
text: somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub. A
text: bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes
dialog: charge.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: (with military
dialog: precision)
dialog: All right people. New plan. Not even
dialog: a new plan so much as a modification
dialog: of the old plan.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (beyond shock)
dialog: I'm calling the police.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: So help me God you touch that phone
dialog: and I bury you with them.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Surrender is no longer an option. I
dialog: repeat -- It is not an option. Is
dialog: there anyone who does not understand
dialog: that?
text: Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a
text: garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: A little gut check time fellas. A
dialog: time for some serious self-
dialog: exploration. How do I function? For
dialog: real? No more bullshit. Can I keep
dialog: my cool when they bounce my bananas?
dialog: When they won't play my fucking song?
dialog: etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get
dialog: me?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Not really. no.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Not a problem. Understand not my
dialog: words, but follow my orders. Follow
dialog: my orders
scene_heading: INT. WALMART - NIGHT
text: The boys move down the isles of the massive 24 hour everything
text: store, Boyd pushes a cart, grabbing; cleaning supplies, tarp,
text: tape, giant pruning shears, etc...
speaker_heading: BOYD (V.O.)
dialog: We will organize, we will mobilize,
dialog: we will maximize and prioritize.
text: Moore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in
dialog: it for all he's worth.
scene_heading: INT. HARD ROCK CASINO
text: The boys attempt to look natural as they stroll through the
text: casino with their supplies. Late night gamblers pay them
dialog: little notice.
scene_heading: INT. HOTEL SUITE
text: Boyd turns up the MUSIC.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Let's do it people.
scene_heading: MUSIC OVER SERIES OF SHOTS:
text: Moore and Fisher scrub blood from the carpet. Fisher keeps
dialog: forgetting to breath.
text: Michael and Boyd put Tina and Ralph in the bath tub.
text: Adam sits in shock on the floor.
text: Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair.
text: Boyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like
text: cutting the joints of a roasted chicken.
text: Adam stares at the wall.
text: Michael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a
dialog: suitcase.
text: Boyd saws. Michael wraps. Fisher and Moore clean.
text: Adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help.
text: UNTIL -- the last of the body parts, Tina's head, is wrapped
text: in plastic, packed in a suitcase.
text: The bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up. Just a bit of
text: blood left in the tub. Boyd looks pleased.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: All right. Looking good people.
scene_heading: EXT. RED ROCK CANYON ROAD
text: The minivan bumps along a deserted road at a snail's pace.
scene_heading: INT. MINIVAN
text: Adam drives, cringing with every bump and bang. Everyone is

speaker_heading: BOYD
text: Sun rises at 5:52.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I'm not wrecking the transmission!
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT
scene_heading: SERIES OF SHOTS:
text: The guys off-loading the suitcases.
text: Fisher and Boyd digging holes.
text: They start putting the suitcases in the holes.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Wait. Wait a minute.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We can't do this.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: We've already done this.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No, I mean the suitcases. We can't
text: bury them in suitcases.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It's sacrilegious.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: How do you figure?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: According to Jewish law, the blood
dialog: and limbs are considered to be part
dialog: of the human being. They must be
dialog: buried together or their souls won't
dialog: rest in peace.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: So that's what we're doing.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: No we're not. The bodies are all
dialog: mixed up. We can't do this to them.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: She's Asian. They don't have Jews in
dialog: Asia.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: That is absolutely not true.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Well what the fuck are we supposed
dialog: to do?
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (as if reasonable)
text: Open the suitcases, unpack the body
text: parts and reunite the limbs.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: No way.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: It has to be done.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: We have to get going.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I am not flexible on this.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Alright. Let's do it.
text: The guys start breaking down the body parts, ripping open
dialog: cases...
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: I got her arm.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Here's his head.
text: As the guys put limbs with bodies...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: Dirt being thrown on top of the reunited bodies until they
text: are all completely buried.
scene_heading: EXT. GRAVE SITE
text: As the last of the dirt is packed down by Boyd. The guys
text: stare down at the grave site.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Now I am the last to say that we
dialog: have done here is a good thing. It's
dialog: not. It's not a good thing. But it
dialog: was, given the circumstances, the
dialog: smart play. We did what had to be
dialog: done. And... well... I'm proud of
dialog: us. I'm proud of each and every one
dialog: of us. We performed. Under the most
dialog: complex and nerve shattering of
dialog: situations, we stood fast and we
dialog: delivered. I feel proud.
speaker_heading: SILENCE.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We are all going straight to hell.
dialog: Either hell or prison, whichever
dialog: comes first.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Wrong. That is flat out wrong. hell
dialog: is for cowards, for hypocrites who
dialog: fear to live by the strength of their
dialog: own convictions. This is war. Given
dialog: the circumstances and given the fact
dialog: that we are alive and they are not,
dialog: we have chosen life over death. Two
dialog: wrongs don't make a right. So our
dialog: conviction and execution would only
dialog: mean more death here, not less.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Boyd... I don't know man... It just
dialog: seems to me that ever since you took
dialog: Tony Robbins self-help thing... you're
text: all fucked-up in the head.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I got to agree with that.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: That is a load of shit. Personal
dialog: power has nothing to do with any of
dialog: this. Tony Robbins has helped me to
dialog: unlock energy and see my options
dialog: more clearly, yes, but to give him
dialog: credit for this, for all of this...
dialog: Well that's just more than the man
dialog: deserves.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I think we should say some words
text: over the grave.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: What kind of words?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm talking about prayer.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Go ahead.
text: Fisher steps to the grave, looks down.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Dear God... I don't know how to pray.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Just go ahead and say what's on your
dialog: mind.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Speak from the heart my brother.
text: Adam turns in disgust.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: This is pathetic.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You're pathetic.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: (turning on Michael)
dialog: What did you say?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: You're not a team player.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: Don't point at me.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You never were a team player. That's
dialog: why you never had any friends.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I have plenty of friends.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The hell you do.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: The hell I don't.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: You have acquaintances -- business
text: friends and superficial golf buddies.
dialog: You have always been a fringe player.
dialog: You have some serious male on male
dialog: intimacy problems.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: What are you fucking talking about?
text: Michael looks at Boyd.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Michael, now is probably not the
dialog: best time for this.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: No, this is the perfect time. This
dialog: is real time. Adam. Your brother and
dialog: I, as well as several others present,
dialog: have always suspected that you...
dialog: (points to Adam)
text: ...are a fully repressed, living in
text: major denial, locked down, fly-boy
dialog: butt-fucker.
text: DEAD SILENCE. Adam stares stupefied at Boyd, then Michael.
text: Finally, Fisher says his prayer.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Dear God, please forgive us for what
dialog: we have done here tonight. We have
dialog: lost our way. Speaking for myself,
dialog: let me say...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MINIVAN - DRIVING
text: Fisher's prayer over the guys driving home. Each lost in his
dialog: own thoughts.
speaker_heading: FISHER (V.O.)
dialog: ...I am deeply in love with the woman
dialog: I am about to marry and I look very
dialog: much forward to raising a family and
dialog: being a positive member of society.
dialog: We promise, if you forgive us, we
dialog: will never forget this tragedy and
dialog: will try with all our powers to use
dialog: it as a daily reminder that we are
dialog: here on earth to do good not evil.
dialog: Let us go from this day forward with
dialog: new purpose and spirit. You have
dialog: given us a second chance and let us
dialog: take that second chance and use it
dialog: as fuel to feed our fires of
dialog: productivity so that the spirits of
dialog: the two we now bury live on forever
dialog: in the good deeds and positive
dialog: achievements we from this moment on
dialog: shall make our life's work...
text: Continue as the minivan disappears down the freeway, heading
text: back to Los Angeles. A freeway sign reads, "Los Angeles, 358

speaker_heading: FISHER (V.O.)
dialog: Thank you lord, and again, we ask
dialog: for your forgiveness and guidance...
dialog: Amen.
scene_heading: EXT. CAR WASH - DAY

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Hey. It's me.
speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.)

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: We're on our way home. I just...
dialog: we're running a little late.
speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.)
dialog: How late?
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: No. Just like an hour or so.
speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.)
dialog: What about the chairs?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Okay.
speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.)
dialog: What okay?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What!
speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.)
dialog: The chairs.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I left a message. I think it's going
dialog: to be okay.
speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.)
dialog: You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: No. No. I'll see you in about four
dialog: hours.
text: As he hangs up the phone...
speaker_heading: LIZ (V.O.)
dialog: (distant; unheard)
dialog: Do you love me?
text: CLICK. Fisher, in a daze, turns and walks into right into
text: Adam who has been standing there listening. Adam doesn't
dialog: look so good.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: I want you to hear me out.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: You and I have done nothing. You
dialog: especially. We are innocent.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I don't think so.
speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We are. We go to the police. We tell
dialog: them the truth. Now. Before they
dialog: find out. Now. We save ourselves.
text: The HISPANIC CAR WASH WORKER beeps the horn, Adam jumps. The

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Let's go!

speaker_heading: ADAM
dialog: We save ourselves. It's our only

scene_heading: FADE TO BLACK:
scene_heading: EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: INT. MINIVAN

dialog: (screaming)
dialog: Daddy's home! Daddy's home!
text: Boyd addresses the fellas.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: The past is the past. Today is the

speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Today is the best day of the rest of

speaker_heading: FISHER

dialog: The first day.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: What?
text: As Lois, with camera, and Liz, come out the front door.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (disgusted &amp; depressed)
dialog: It goes; "Today is the first day of
dialog: the rest of our lives."
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: However it goes, the point is, nobody
dialog: says anything to anyone ever.
dialog: Right?... Right?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: That's right.
text: As the little kids put their lips up to the windows, making
dialog: funny faces,
speaker_heading: BOYD

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What's the word on the chairs?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm working on it.
speaker_heading: LIZ

scene_heading: INT. JUDGE'S OFFICE
text: ON JUDGE LAUREL TOWER.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: We don't say "love, honor and obey"
dialog: anymore. And we don't say "till death
dialog: do us part." Today we say, "respect,
dialog: honor and cherish, as long as you
dialog: both do love." How does that sound?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I kind of like "till death do us
dialog: part." I mean, this is forever. In
dialog: sickness and in health, through good
dialog: times and bad. Honey, what do you
dialog: think?
text: Liz looks at Fisher who is a nuclear wreck, barely coherent.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yea... It's great... seems like... I
dialog: don't know you've got all the
dialog: important stuff in there.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: All right then. It's refreshing to
dialog: see two young people not afraid of
dialog: real commitment. Will you have friends
dialog: or family saying words -- singing or
dialog: anything?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Are we supposed to?
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: It's not a question of supposed to,
dialog: it's an entirely personal decision...
dialog: Some do some don't.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: We don't think so. I mean, we just
dialog: want the singing when I come out.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: Okay great. What will that be?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: We're just going to have the leader
dialog: of the band sing alone with his
text: guitar. Acoustic.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: What song?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: "You Send Me."
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: Oh I know that. How does it go...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You know,

speaker_heading: FISHER

dialog: What's goosed?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: What is her disposition?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Regarding what?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Does she sound pissed, scared,
dialog: hostile? Did she mention the police?
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: No, but she's definitely pissed and

speaker_heading: MOORE

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: You can tell when people believe

speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: Don't sweet lip me.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: I don't understand where this personal

speaker_heading: LOIS

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Nothing happened in Vegas.
speaker_heading: LOIS

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Okay. Lois... here's the deal.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Adam was with a prostitute in Las
dialog: Vegas.

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: After you drop the kids off, take

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I don't think that's such a good
dialog: idea.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Just do it.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What are you going to do?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Take care of business.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (accusing)
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: And what does that mean?
dialog: (off no response)
dialog: Are you insane?!
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: You think I would hurt Lois?! She's

speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: Dad used to bring home these sparklers

dialog: 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold
dialog: 'em up to the sky and watch the
text: explosions of light. Sparks. And dad
dialog: would be all... "Get ready"... "watch

dialog: comes the "wahoo"
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: The wahoo?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: The sparkler would burn hot, then
dialog: hotter, then even hotter... and there
dialog: would be one moment of pure burn
dialog: when that little fucker would cook
dialog: just perfect. Perfect. It would only
dialog: last a second, but that second was
dialog: it. It was it. That's what dad had
dialog: us looking for... You get me?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: The wahoo moment?
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: That's my point! You see Man...

dialog: You get me?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I've been looking for that flash and

text: stumbles back. Lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a
dialog: side of beef.
text: They go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild

speaker_heading: LOIS
dialog: You picked the wrong woman mother-
dialog: fucker!

speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I don't think that's a good idea.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: I said out of respect. Respect for

dialog: here?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I appreciate it. I do, but... maybe

dialog: a bit.
speaker_heading: MICHAEL
dialog: No. No. No. This is my doing. You

speaker_heading: MICHAEL

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: That it was all an accident. She
dialog: wants to here it from Michael's mouth.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Now?

speaker_heading: BOYD

speaker_heading: MOORE

speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: A move?
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Greenpeace.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Greenpeace?
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Maybe go up to the North Pole, the
dialog: Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart
dialog: guns. I've always had a pretty good
dialog: aim...
text: A "POP" resounds from within the house. Moore and Fisher
text: lock eyes, frozen.
text: Boyd comes jogging out the front door, hops in the back seat.
text: Fisher and Moore turn, eyes wide.
speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Michael was having an affair with
dialog: Lois. That's what Michael and Adam
dialog: were arguing about in the parking
text: lot. Michael killed Adam in a jealous
text: rage. Lois broke it off with Michael,
text: he strangled her to death and then
text: shot himself in the head.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Happens all the time.
text: Boyd touches the painful scratches on his face.
speaker_heading: BOYD

scene_heading: INT. LAW FIRM
text: TIGHT ON BARRY MORRIS, mid-40's, attorney.
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: I don't see how this could have been
dialog: kept from you. The facts are quite
dialog: simple; last month Adam and Lois
dialog: changed their will. They requested
dialog: that you two, as a married couple,
dialog: be the Custodians of Record for their
dialog: estate including all properties,
dialog: cash holdings, security holdings
dialog: and... children. You are legal
dialog: custodians of the Brenn Trust.
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON
text: Liz and Fisher, flanked by Adam Jr. and Timmy, eyes wide,
text: they sit across from the attorney, totally bazooka'd. They
text: stare in horror at Morris.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: My god.
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: There's more.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: More?
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: Adam and Lois were not terribly
dialog: prudent in terms of providing for
dialog: the possibility of the unforeseen.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: I'm talking about Life insurance.
dialog: I'm talking about money.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Money?
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: Yes money. Adam had a five hundred
dialog: thousand dollar Term Life Insurance
dialog: Policy.
speaker_heading: PAUSE.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: That means we get five hundred
dialog: thousand to help raise the kids.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (amazed)
dialog: No.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: Actually, no. Adam was switching to
dialog: a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled
dialog: his medical exam... and failed to
dialog: make his last payment... so his Term
dialog: Life lapsed. So it's value is null
dialog: and void.
dialog: (off Liz's horror)
dialog: Now he did have a pension account,
dialog: worth another 150 thousand.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Well, oh...
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: So where's that leave us?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: 150 plus 350... we still get 500
dialog: thousand.
speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: (beat)
dialog: No. Not even close. With property
dialog: values down, the house is worth
dialog: 100,000 less than 450 he paid for
dialog: it. With three credit cards, the
dialog: minivan payments, and other
dialog: outstanding debts... Plus the Income
dialog: and Estate Taxes assessed on his
dialog: IRA...
dialog: (punches his calculator)
dialog: You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood
dialog: of, ah... 14,223 dollars.
text: Adam Jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his

dialog: Adam up.
speaker_heading: LITTLE ADAM
dialog: Get away from me!
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm just trying to help...
speaker_heading: LITTLE ADAM
dialog: I don't want your help!
speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: BARRY MORRIS
dialog: (breaking the tension)
dialog: So. When is the wedding.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Tomorrow
dialog: (at Fisher)
dialog: We are getting married tomorrow.
speaker_heading: INT. CAR
text: Fisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr. and Timmy in the back.

scene_heading: EXT. FISHER'S CAR
text: Fisher leans on the trunk, puking. Liz gets out to help him,

speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: LIZ

speaker_heading: FISHER

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What are you talking about?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (completely hysterical)
dialog: Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Michael
text: crushed her skull. She was dead.

speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Who's dead?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: The prostitute.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You fucked a prostitute?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: No Michael did. It was an accident.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You killed a prostitute.
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: Michael, by accident.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Call the police.
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: It's too late.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: My God. You've got to call the police,
dialog: tell them it was an accident. Where
dialog: is she?
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: She's in the desert. She's out in
dialog: the desert.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You left a dead prostitute out in
dialog: the desert? Alone?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: She's not alone... She's... Boyd...
dialog: Oh God... He's gone nuts... He killed
dialog: Lois and Michael... it's all...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Stop! You stop right here. I don't
dialog: want to know anymore. I told you not
dialog: to do this Bachelor Party thing. You
dialog: were warned.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: No buts. I told you your friends
dialog: were Jackasses.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: No buts. I've waited twenty-seven
dialog: years, twenty-seven years I have
text: focused and prepared to walk down
dialog: that aisle. I will not be derailed!

speaker_heading: BOYD

speaker_heading: BOYD
dialog: Blood money. Insurance dollars that

speaker_heading: FISHER

text: MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father,
text: She smiles radiantly.
text: Liz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand
text: before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His
text: head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until...
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: May we have the rings please?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: The rings?
text: Fisher looks at Moore.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH BASEMENT
text: Moore opens the closet. Boyd falls out.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH
text: Everyone waits patiently. Fisher is sweating. He looks at
text: Liz who stares straight ahead.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH BASEMENT
text: Moore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to
dialog: get blood on himself.
scene_heading: INT. CHURCH
text: Moore returns.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Got 'em.
text: He hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she,
text: Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff. The
text: Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: (continues)
dialog: These rings represent the commitment
text: Fisher and Liz make to each other on
dialog: the day. Fisher do you take Liz to
dialog: be your beloved wife, to respect,
dialog: honor and cherish till death do you
dialog: part?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I do.
text: Liz slides the ring on Fisher's finger.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: Liz do you take Fisher to be your
dialog: beloved husband, to respect, honor
dialog: and cherish him till death do you
dialog: part?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: I do.
text: Fisher slides the ring on Liz's finger.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TOWER
dialog: I now pronounce you husband and wife.

scene_heading: WEDDING RECEPTION - TENT NEXT TO CHURCH
text: Liz drinks champagne and talks with her guests.
scene_heading: EXT. CHURCH - REAR
text: Fisher and Moore load Boyd's body in the trunk of Fisher's
dialog: car.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: He came to me early today, was talking
dialog: about money, insurance money. Said
dialog: he was gonna get what was his.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: My God...
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: He said he was the Brain Trust. Said
dialog: he was smarter than all of us. He
dialog: started reading "Atlas Shrugged,"
text: staring at himself in the mirror.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Did he try to kiss you?
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: All week long.
text: Fisher slams the trunk closed.
scene_heading: WEDDING RECEPTION - MUCH LATER
text: Only a few guests remain. Fisher's parents watch the boys.
text: The caterers are cleaning up. Fisher and Liz sit alone.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: He kept saying he was protected.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: What does that mean?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Like if something happened to him,
dialog: he could still get us.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Like how?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I don't know. He could have told
dialog: someone. He could have, like in the
dialog: event of his death, somehow let
dialog: someone know where those bodies are
dialog: buried.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: The only proof is those bodies.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: So what do we do?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Move the bodies.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Move the bodies?
speaker_heading: OLD MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Excuse us?
text: Fisher and Liz look up at a sweet OLD COUPLE, who talk at
text: the same time, oblivious to each other.
speaker_heading: OLD MAN
dialog: We just wanted to say
dialog: congratulations and
dialog: wish you great
dialog: happiness. Mazeltov. I
dialog: just did. I said
dialog: Malzeltov. You never
dialog: listen to me.
speaker_heading: OLD WOMAN
dialog: We're your Uncle Henry's
text: parents. Opal and Earl.
dialog: Tell them from both of us.
dialog: Malzeltov. Wish them luck.
dialog: The secret to a good
dialog: marriage is to listen.
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (cheerleader smile)
dialog: Thank you. Thank you. We will. Bye
dialog: bye.
text: The Old Couple shuffles away. Fisher watches them go, he
text: suddenly breaks down, crying...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I... Liz... all I ever wanted, was
dialog: for you to be happy. I just wanted
dialog: to give you the wedding, the life
dialog: you always dreamed of...
dialog: (sobs)
dialog: ...I just love you so much... So
dialog: much...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: (beat; unmoved)
dialog: You and Moore move the bodies and
dialog: bury Boyd with them. In fact, put
text: Moore in the ground too.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: If you don't tie up all the lose
dialog: ends it'll never be over.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: No...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: You put him down or don't bother
text: coming back.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: But...
speaker_heading: LIZ
dialog: Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
dialog: OFF Fisher...
scene_heading: EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Fisher's car blasts past a road sign reading, "Las Vegas,
dialog: 358 miles."
scene_heading: INT. FISHER'S CAR
text: Fisher drives, Moore's in the passenger seat. They're still
text: in their tuxedos. Extreme silence. Fisher, almost in a trance.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: You alright?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yeah. I'm thinking about Michael's
dialog: Franco Harris fixation. You know how
dialog: Michael was always harping "Immaculate
dialog: Reception?" I've seen that play. A
dialog: lot of times... and I have to say
dialog: this... Franco was lucky. Flat out,
dialog: right place, right time. That's it.
dialog: He was where the ball bounced. You
dialog: get me?
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I guess.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You
dialog: work your entire life, all the
dialog: training, focus, all the dedication,
dialog: all irrelevant. Where does the ball
dialog: bounce? My father spent his whole
dialog: life trying to start a company,
dialog: practiced every day, worked like a
dialog: dog, finally got enough money. He's
dialog: paid the dues, he's ready, does all
dialog: the market research, picks his shot --
dialog: "Pup Corn."
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Pup corn?
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie
dialog: treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's
text: figured it out. There is a hole in
dialog: the market and he's going to fill
dialog: it. Spends all out money, works
dialog: himself into not two but three heart
dialog: attacks getting this shit up. After
text: fifteen months, the big day arrives,
text: the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off
text: the belt. He comes running home with
dialog: that box, pulls us out of school. We
text: all pile into the living room, must
dialog: be fifty of us, and in comes
dialog: "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here
dialog: Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got
dialog: that little fucking pup corn in his
dialog: hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat
dialog: anything, she eats rocks, anything.
text: She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks
text: down at the little pellet, licks it
text: once, turns around, walks out of the
text: room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn."
dialog: Fifteen months of my dad's life,
dialog: right there. Not one dog ate Pup
text: Corn. Not one. Three months later,
text: "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven.
dialog: My father never got over it. Never.
text: SILENCE hangs again.
scene_heading: EXT. DESERT - LATER
text: Fisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph
text: with flashlights and shovels.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I think it was over here.
text: They move into a new area and start poking around. Nothing.
speaker_heading: MOORE
text: It was over by those rocks.
text: Again they search, prodding into earth with their shovels.
dialog: Nothing.
text: Fisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light
dialog: around until...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: There.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Where?
text: Fisher moves to a new spot.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: There. This rock is where I stood
dialog: when I said the prayer.
text: He starts digging in front of the rock. The earth is soft.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Bingo.
text: Moore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's
text: shovel makes contact.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Got it.
dialog: And they dig some more.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: MOORE
text: in the hole, passing the suitcases up to Fisher.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: loads the cases into the car.
scene_heading: EXT. NEW BURIAL SITE
text: The suitcases are unloaded. Fisher and Moore dig a new grave.
text: Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I've been thinking about what you
dialog: said that day. The prayer. About
dialog: using this whole mess to bring out
dialog: the good in me...
text: Fisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking
text: down at the back of Moore's head.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yeah?
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I think there's a lot of truth in
dialog: that. I'm gonna pursue some options.
dialog: I want to join that Big Brother thing.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (slowly raises the
text: shovel over his head)
dialog: That's a good one.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: I want a black one. A little black
dialog: brother. That's a big problem it
dialog: seems to me. Lack of racial
dialog: integration. That's a big one. You
dialog: think?
text: Moore looks up to...
text: FISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above
text: his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull.
text: MOORE confused and then realization... CUT between Fisher
text: above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable.
text: Their eyes locked for several beats. Finally...
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: What do you think?
text: Slowly, Fisher lowers his shovel.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: I think you'd make an excellent Big
dialog: Brother.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: (back to work)
dialog: That's what I'm thinking.
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE:
scene_heading: THE GRAVE - LATER
text: The cases are in the hole with Boyd's body. As Fisher and
dialog: Moore re-fill the grave with dirt we...
scene_heading: SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. FISHER'S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT
text: Fisher drives, Moore rides shotgun, both mean are dirty,
text: sweaty and tired.
speaker_heading: MOORE
dialog: Well that ought to be about the end
dialog: of that.
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Yup.
text: TIGHT ON Fisher, staring deep into the road, a faint smile
text: creeps on to his face...
speaker_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: THE IMMACULATE RECEPTION
text: The distorted but definitely recognizable image of Franco
text: Harris running for his life.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
dialog: And it's Franco Harris running for...
text: Franco makes it into the Raider end zone.
speaker_heading: ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
text: A TOUCHDOWN FOR PITTSBURGH!
scene_heading: UNBELIEVABLE!
speaker_heading: CUT BACK TO:
speaker_heading: FISHER
text: Lost in his reverie, wakes up in a hair pin turn. The
text: speedometer reads 80. They run out of road. The car skids on
text: the shoulder, Fisher cranks the wheel, jumps the divider,
text: into oncoming headlights. Fisher and Moore lit up bright...
speaker_heading: HIGHWAY
text: Fisher's car SMASHES head-on into another car. IN SLOW MOTION
text: Fisher and Moore are launched through the windshield in an
text: IMPLOSION of glass and steel, flesh and blood.
scene_heading: CUT TO BLACK:
text: We hear the sounds of SCRUBBING.
scene_heading: SLOW FADE UP:
scene_heading: INT. FISHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY
text: TIGHT ON Liz, on her hands and knees, scrubbing around the
text: toilet of what is clearly a filthy kids bathroom; soiled
text: jockey shorts, Tonka trucks, mess everywhere.
text: O.S. we hear voices outside. Liz gets up off her knees,
text: brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out
text: the bathroom window.
scene_heading: TIGHT ON FISHER
scene_heading: EXT. BACK YARD
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Okay let's try it again.
text: Adam Jr. and Timmy, in ill-fitted Cub Scout uniforms, recite
dialog: the "Scout Laws."
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: A scout is thrifty,
dialog: saves for the future.
dialog: A scout is clean, he
dialog: keeps his body...
dialog: ADAM JR.
dialog: A scout is brave. A scout
dialog: can face danger, even if
dialog: he's afraid...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Let's see the salutes!
text: Timmy snaps out a fine salute. Adam balances on one crutch
text: to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face. He
text: starts SCREAMING.
text: REVEAL Fisher, in a wheelchair, both legs amputated above
text: the knee. He leans over, trying to help Adam Jr. up and his
text: wheel chair tips over. Fisher falls on top of Adam Jr. who
text: SCREAMS even louder, flailing arms and legs like a turtle on
dialog: its back.
text: REVEAL Moore, in an electric wheel chair he operated with a
text: mouthpiece. As he is paralyzed from the neck down, he's no
text: help at all. Timmy suddenly snaps.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: (to Adam Jr.)
dialog: Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: It's okay, it's okay.
text: THE BATHROOM WINDOW
text: Liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the
text: dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner.
speaker_heading: FISHER (O.S.)
dialog: Timmy SHUT UP! Help your brother!
dialog: ADAM! Let him help you!
text: TIGHT ON Liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished SILENT
speaker_heading: SCREAM.
text: OUT THE WINDOW - DOWN IN THE BACK YARD
text: Adam Jr. gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of
text: Timmy. As Fisher struggles to hoist himself up, back in his
dialog: wheelchair...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: Remember a scout is helpful! A scout
text: doesn't scream in the face of
dialog: adversity.
text: Suddenly, O.S. from the bathroom, Liz WAILS. Fisher looks up
text: at the window... LONG BEAT...
speaker_heading: FISHER
dialog: (to the boys)
dialog: Okay, let's skip to the Scout's
dialog: Oath...
scene_heading: ADAM JR. &amp; TIMMY
dialog: On my honor, I will do my best...
text: The boys recite the "Scout's Oath" as Liz's deep, heaving,
text: wailing SOBS grow in intensity O.C.
scene_heading: ADAM JR. &amp; TIMMY
dialog: ...to do my duty to God and my
dialog: country... To obey the Scout Law, to
dialog: help other people at all times...
text: SLOWLY PULL OFF Fisher, Moore and the kids...
scene_heading: ADAM JR. &amp; TIMMY
dialog: To keep myself physically strong,
text: mentally awake, and morally straight.
text: CRANE UP, past Liz at the window, out of the yard, over the
text: house, WIDER to reveal the surrounding track-like homes,
text: housing track-like families, with track-like nightmares as
text: Liz's plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human
dialog: village.
