speaker_heading: BOSTON, 1886
text: CAMERA DESCENDS to find a solemn, bespectacled child, EDITH
text: CUSHING, age 10, in a black coat and hat. Her delicate
text: features are half-hidden behind a mourning veil.
text: Frightened, the child clings to the gloved hand of her tall,
text: bearded father (CARTER CUSHING, 48). *
speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)
dialog: The first time I saw a ghost, I was ten.
dialog: It was my Mother's- *
text: The coffin passes before the child's pale face.
speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)
dialog: At that age, I barely understood what had
dialog: happened. She had died of Cholera- *

scene_heading: INT. YOUNG EDITH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)

text: floorboards CREAK. There's a rustle of silk as-
text: - a translucent tracery of cobweb ectoplasm crosses the
text: room, its desiccated feet not touching the ground.
text: The bed curtains move and the bedsprings sink down. Edith
text: freezes, her eyes wide, her head turned away. She hears a
text: low, asthmatic sigh.
text: A shimmering hand caresses the child's hair. Finger bones
text: are visible. In the dark, a glimpse of a tormented face...
speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)
text: -.-and I heard her voice. A throatless
text: whisper, low and grave and full of earth.
text: Her words seared my memory as if with
dialog: fire...
scene_heading: MOTHER'S GHOST
dialog: Edith... beware of Crimson Peak.
text: Crying out, the child sits up and looks around. Without her

text: A HAZY FIGURE is floating away. Edith puts on her glasses.
text: No one is there. The gas lamps come back on; the clock
text: resumes its ticking.
speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)
text: Then she was gone.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: It would be years before I again heard a

speaker_heading: EDITH
text: After skimming a single chapter, Father.

text: The ghost acts as a metaphor-
speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: Ah. A metaphor. That may be too
dialog: sophisticated for me, then-
speaker_heading: EDITH

speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: Well... does it?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: Need a love story?
speaker_heading: EDITH

speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: I agree.

text: Sudden silence as Sharpe complies.
speaker_heading: CUSHING (CONT'D)
dialog: So you come to us, having failed to raise

speaker_heading: SHARPE

dialog: counted for very little.
text: The door to the conference room is ajar. Edith stands there,

speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: I'm not discussing my name. This is a new
dialog: century. As a railroad man, you'll need
dialog: steel-
speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: We have no shortage of iron ore in this
dialog: country. Your holdings came to you
dialog: through inheritance, did they not?
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: All right, yes. My great grandfather was
dialog: Lord Middleton Sharpe, first Baronet of
dialog: Allerdale. But the Sharpe Mines are more
dialog: than a name, sir. More than nostalgia.
dialog: They are my birthright.
speaker_heading: CUSHING

speaker_heading: CUSHING (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)
dialog: I would rethink my book. I would try my

speaker_heading: CUSHING

speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: A bad actor, you mean. Nothing to swoon

speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Nobody's swooning. But tell me: were his
dialog: ideas so outrageous as to merit such a
dialog: quick dismissal?
speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: It wasn't his ideas, my love. I felt a
dialog: lack of focus. Is he the inventor of a

scene_heading: APPLAUSE.

speaker_heading: CUSHING
dialog: I congratulate you, sir. Only remarkable

text: once served as a nursery. The wallpaper features a parade of
text: merry animals. A CRADLE and TOY CHEST occupy the corner near
text: the window.
text: On a shelf, near a dented silver rattle and christening cup,
text: she finds a BLACK RUBBER BALL.
speaker_heading: THE CORRIDOR
text: In the corridor, Edith hears the dog WHINING on the other
text: side of a heavy pair of double doors. She tries the brass
text: knobs: locked.
text: Using another of Lucille's keys, she opens the doors onto a
text: long-forgotten passageway.
scene_heading: PASSAGEWAY â€” CONTINUOUS
text: A few SNOWFLAKES drift in from a half-open skylight. No sign
dialog: of the animal.
text: As Edith latches the skylight shut, a sudden YELP... and the
text: dog is sitting at her feet.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: There you are! All right, little girl:
dialog: fetch!
text: Edith throws the rubber ball. With a BARK, the dog takes off
text: after it, disappearing into the gloom.

dialog: 70.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Then, nothing.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Come on, silly. Come on...
text: THUMP... the ball comes bouncing back.
text: Edith moves deeper into the frigid passageway, moving in and
text: out of shafts of light from other skylights.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Here, girl. Here..?
text: She passes a stack of BRICKS, large GLASS BOTTLES filled
text: with roofing nails, an old wicker WHEELCHAIR... and finally
text: reaches a rusty iron door only three feet high.
text: Hearing SCRATCHING on the other side, she kneels down and
text: tries the handle: it won't move.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: How did you get in there?!
text: The SCRATCHING becomes intense, frenzied. Edith looks down
text: and realizes the dog is sitting alongside her - !!
text: Flesh crawling, she gathers up the dog and runs.
scene_heading: INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Reaching the double doors, she glances back.
text: Something small and skeletal is coming, scuttling over the
text: floor, in and out of the light.
text: It's a bony HAND! The jar of nails EXPLODES! The pile of
text: bricks tumbles over...
text: Edith slams the doors and throws the lock. She backs away,
text: but, like a spider, the fingers wriggle out from under the
dialog: door..!
scene_heading: ELEVATOR DOWN
text: Edith charges into the lift and yanks the lever - and
dialog: nothing happens.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Down, dammit! Down!!
text: Finally, the cab jerks, sways, and starts moving -
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 71.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: - but the hand - covered in rotten flesh - is pressed
text: against the outside of the glass, riding along!
text: The dog thrashes in her arms, strangling in her grip.
text: The ground floor is in sight! But the cab drops right past
dialog: itl!
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: No!
text: Desperate, Edith pulls on the control handle - to no avail.
scene_heading: INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
text: A filthy BASEMENT comes into view... shelving, canned goods,
text: an ancient washer and mangle.
text: And the elevator keeps going...
scene_heading: INT. LEVELS - CONTINUOUS
text: ..-passing dark, abandoned tunnels once active with iron
dialog: miners.
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: Finally, a gentle BUMP as the elevator stops. The HAND drops
text: off the glass and withdraws.
text: Edith puts down the dog and tries the lever, but the
text: elevator won't budge.
scene_heading: INT. MINE LANDING
text: Edith's groping fingers encounter a light switch. She twists
text: the knob and a few brownish bulbs come on.
text: Inky tunnels are everywhere, like an enlarged termite nest.
text: No movement, no sound except for the distant DRIP of water.
text: Edith starts down steep, rickety steps, which creak in
dialog: protest.
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
text: The dog trots ahead. On the rough-hewn walls hang mining
text: tools, chains and lanterns.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 72.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Edith moves carefully, keeping an eye out for the terrible
dialog: hand - or anything else.
speaker_heading: ALCOVE
text: In an alcove, she discovers a pile of women's shoes. The dog
text: sniffs at them, unleashing a stampede of COCKROACHES.
text: Edith lifts the lid of a STEAMER TRUNK and finds...
text: ...a STRAW HAT. A WHITE CANE. A woman's SPECTACLES with
text: BLACK LENSES. And an adorable flock of Finlay's HAND-CARVED
text: SHEEP. She examines a lace HANDKERCHIEF with an embroidered
text: monogram: ES. She smells it - recognizing the perfume.
text: Below it, she finds three ALBUMS of Kodak snapshots.
dialog: The handwritten labels on each album:
dialog: "Pamela Upton - London - 1887"
dialog: "Margaret McDermott - Edinburgh - 1893"
dialog: "Eleanora Schott - Leipzig - 1896"

dialog: befriended Edith.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Oh, my God-
text: A thin, malevolent WHISPER from the darkness...
speaker_heading: VOICE
dialog: Edith! Verstorben! Verstorben!!
text: Edith snatches up an IRON BAR and strides out into the empty
dialog: tunnel.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Who is it? Show yourself!
text: No answer. Edith frowns: FLIES are buzzing. The dog starts

speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: (to the dog)
dialog: No. Stay - !
text: The dog obeys. Looks up at her.
scene_heading: AT THE ELEVATOR
text: Brushing away hordes of flies, Edith climbs the stairs and

text: Waiting inside, a decomposing YOUNG WOMAN with a DEAD BABY
text: caught in her long hair...
text: The weeping thing holds out the infant's remains.
speaker_heading: YOUNG WOMAN
dialog: Er ist gestorben -! Wahrend Sie wird...
text: Edith screams and lashes out with the iron bar. The figure

text: bottom landing hard - something SNAPS!!!
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 74.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: EXT. HOUSE - DUSK

scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Hello, Edith. Don't try to move just yet,
dialog: all right?

speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Alan - ? Wh- what are you doing here? Is
dialog: it-
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Easy, easy. You're going to be fine. We

dialog: cast.
text: Groggy, Edith looks at them, then blurts out...
speaker_heading: EDITH
text: The dog ran away. I couldn't find it-
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL

speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: She spoke to me -
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Who spoke to you??
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: She knew my name -
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: It's shock. She'll be quite woolly-headed-

dialog: What is it, Edith? Are you in pain?
text: Tears are rolling down Edith's cheeks. Her lips are

text: hot TEA to her mouth.
speaker_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL (CONTâ€™D)
dialog: Here. Drink.
text: As she drinks, he places a small BROWN BOTTLE on the night

speaker_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: It's an opium derivative: no more than

dialog: lift.
dialog: (to Sharpe)
dialog: You see? It should be disabled, or locked-
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: But I told her - you remember, I warned
dialog: you, didn't I, Edith?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE

scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Excuse me.

speaker_heading: SHARPE

scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL

speaker_heading: LUCILLE

speaker_heading: EDITH

dialog: I'm dizzy - everything's upside down...
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL

speaker_heading: EDITH

speaker_heading: EDITH

text: Edith reaches the threshold and pushes the door aside. She

dialog: but...
dialog: -..sees Edith!
text: The man turns around- Is Thomas!!!!!

dialog: 87.
speaker_heading: CORRIDOR
text: Gasping, Edith blindly rolls herself toward the stairs.
text: The dog runs ahead, barking like a mad thing. Suddenly, the
text: wheelchair jerks to a stop. Sharpe is there, holding her in
dialog: place.
text: She flails at him... he fends her off, his face a picture of
dialog: calm.
text: Then Lucille looms up, stirring a glass of water and
text: bringing it to Edith's lips.
text: Edith hurls herself out of the wheelchair. She hits the
text: floor with a thump, only to be rolled onto her back.
text: Sharpe puts a knee on her chest and pins her arms. He
text: glances at Lucille and nods.
text: Lucille again comes close with the drinking glass. She SLAPS
text: Edith hard, then swiftly grabs her nose and forces the
text: solution down her throat.
text: Gagging, Edith spits the liquid at the woman's face.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Who are you? Who are you, really?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Who do you think?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: You're not his sister!
text: Lucille slaps her again and forces more liquid down.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: I am.
text: Edith struggles, reaching for the chair. She tries to crawl,
text: but Sharpe kneels next to her, holding her down.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: BLACK SCREEN:
text: Silence. Then, the boom of the DOOR KNOCKER.
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
dialog: 88.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SHARPE MANSION - DAY
text: The snow has stopped. Drifts are everywhere.
text: Lucille opens up to find Dr. McMichael on the doorstep,
text: carrying his black bag and a large book - one of the bound
text: volumes from the local paper.
text: His horse and sleigh are in the driveway.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Good afternoon, Miss Sharpe. How's Edith
dialog: doing?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: She's asleep right now, Doctor.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: That's fine. Fine. And your brother??
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: He's gone to the post office. He'll be
text: back shortly.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: I see.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Dr. McMichael, last night... didn't go
text: well. Edith awakened several times,
text: crying out. We were all of us up til
dialog: dawn.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: If she's in pain, I should see her-
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: No, no. She's finally getting her rest. I
dialog: wonder, do you have more opium? In the
dialog: dark, we broke the bottle.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Of course.
dialog: (pats his bag)
dialog: Right in here.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: But come inside. There's no reason for
dialog: you to freeze to death.
dialog: 89.
scene_heading: INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY
text: Still in his overcoat, Dr. McMichael is seated on the sofa,
text: decanting some liquid opium into another small bottle.
text: Lucille tends to the fire and sits opposite him, eyeing the
dialog: drug.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
text: Well. Back home, everyone's clamoring for
dialog: some news. Tell me, Miss Sharpe, how's
dialog: her book been going?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Oh, she talks of nothing else. Quite the
dialog: imagination, that one.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: A writer's talent is one I've always
dialog: envied.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: You have a taste for fiction, Doctor?
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: I do. Although in my experience, actual
dialog: events can go far beyond one's wildest
dialog: imaginings.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SAME
text: The bedroom is dark. Lying under the covers, barely moving,
text: Edith hears the distant voices, as if in a dream.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: (raising herself up)
dialog: Alan - ?
text: Across the room, the dog is alert, tail thumping.
text: Edith looks at the open door, then reaches for the rubber
text: ball on the night stand. With supreme effort, she rolls it
text: into the hallway.
text: It almost reaches the stairs when the dog scampers and -
dialog: brings it back!
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: No - no...
text: Fighting off nausea, she again picks up the ball. Throws
dialog: it...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 90.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: The dog instantly goes after it. But, in the hall, the
text: animal recoils as one of the hissing spectres - Pamela
text: Upton, the blind girl - springs forth from the shadows!
text: A dry, bony hand guides the rolling ball to the steps...
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - SAME
text: Dr. McMichael is about to give Lucille the bottle of opium,
text: but almost teasing, he pulls it away.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: You know, Miss Sharpe, I really should
dialog: examine the patient before doling this
dialog: out.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: (thin smile)
dialog: And her doctor's orders, what of them? As
dialog: I recall, he was quite insistent on rest
dialog: and sedation.
text: A moment of silence as they size each other up.
text: Suddenly, the RUBBER BALL bounces down the stairs and into
text: the room. The dog follows, barking happily.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
text: Ah. Someone's awake.
text: He pockets the opium vial and exits.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM â€”- DAY
text: Dr. McMichael strides into the bedroom and draws back the
text: curtain, revealing Crimson Peak. He sits at Edith's bedside.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: There. Now - if you'll just look at me.
text: Edith gazes into Dr. McMichael's eyes; he checks her pupils,
text: then takes her pulse.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: Help- help me- take me away...
text: Dr. McMichael picks up the brown bottle, checks the liquid.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Yes. But not now. You're in no shape-

speaker_heading: EDITH

text: Lucille appears in the doorway. Dr. McMichael changes his
dialog: demeanor.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: (to Lucille)
text: She's showing signs of anemia and
dialog: exhaustion. I'm going to take her to a
dialog: hospital -
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: That won't be necessary.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Miss Sharpe, under the circumstances -
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Doctor, we appreciate everything... you
dialog: coming here so fortuitously, doing what
dialog: you can. But we have decided to seek the
text: assistance of a bone specialist.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: You didn't mention anything before -
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: I didn't want to trouble you - or appear
text: unkind. An osteopath is coming from
dialog: London. Tonight.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Is he, now?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: In fact, my brother has gone to fetch him
text: at the station.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Then you won't mind if I stay and make
dialog: his acquaintance.
text: A NOISE from outside signals the arrival of a motorcar.

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 92.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)

speaker_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL (CONTâ€™D)
dialog: All right. Show me you can stand up.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - DAY
text: Lucille opens the front door. Sharpe is already out of his

speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: (seeing Lucille)
dialog: How long has he been here?
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
text: Half an hour. He won't leave.
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: I'll deal with him.
text: Sharpe hands a large postal ENVELOPE to Lucille as he heads
dialog: for the grand staircase.
speaker_heading: SHARPE (CONT'D)
dialog: Here. From her solicitor. And the Boston
dialog: bank.
text: Lucille pulls a thick wad of papers and contracts out from
dialog: the envelope.
scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM - SAME

scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Good afternoon, Sir Thomas. We were just
dialog: going.
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: Leave her be.
text: Lucille comes alongside her brother. She's holding something
text: in the folds of her skirt.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Do you know the Brathwaite Daily Ledger?
dialog: "The newspaper of record for northern
dialog: Cumberland." I've borrowed some back

speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)

speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

speaker_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL (CONT'D)
dialog: (to Edith)
dialog: Edith. It seems that your mother-in-law,
dialog: Lady Edwina Sharpe, was murdered, here in
dialog: this house.
text: Edith stares at him in puzzlement. Then she looks at the
dialog: open book.
text: Headline: "AXE MURDER AT SHARPETON." CAMERA lingers on a

text: library downstairs.
speaker_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL (CONTâ€™D)
dialog: No suspect was ever arrested.
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: Did you understand what I said? Leave.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: (turning)
dialog: You, Sir Thomas, were only thirteen at
dialog: the time. After questioning by the
dialog: police, you were sent off to boarding
dialog: school in Surrey.
dialog: (to Lucille)
dialog: Your story, Lucille, is less clear. A
dialog: convent education in Switzerland, it
dialog: said.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: (to Sharpe)
dialog: What are you waiting for?
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: An entire paragraph describes the
text: condition of the body as it was found. A
dialog: grisly thing, a hatchet or something
dialog: similar. Thirty blows -
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Enough-
text: BAMM!!! She darts forward and stabs Dr. McMichael in the
text: NECK with a boning knife.
dialog: Edith screams!!!
text: The Doctor arches back, the knife jutting from under his
text: ear. He staggers out the door, struggling to remove it.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 94.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
text: Edith is on her feet, reeling, trying to catch up. SOCK!
text: Lucille smacks her back into the wheelchair.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SHARPE MANSION - DAY
text: Bleeding profusely, the Doctor gropes his way down the ice-
text: covered front stairway. He finally pulls out the knife, then
text: slips and falls.
text: The knife bounces off the stone steps.
text: Rolling over, he sees Lucille coming- calmly picking up the
text: knife. Then Sharpe is there, followed by the excited DOG.
text: The Doctor scrambles backwards, clutching his wound. He
text: points at Lucille.
scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL
dialog: Who is she, Sharpe? Where did you find
dialog: her -?
text: Lucille hands the knife to Sharpe.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: (to Sharpe)

scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL

speaker_heading: LUCILLE

scene_heading: DR. MCMICHAEL

speaker_heading: LUCILLE

speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 95.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:

scene_heading: INT. THE SHARPE MANSION - DAY
text: Lucille and Thomas drag Dr. McMichael into the elevator.
text: Lucille goes through the man's pockets and retrieves the

scene_heading: INT. CRYPT â€”- DAY
text: CAMERA follows a BLOODY SMEAR along the floor of the mine

text: He tosses the Doctor's black bag and the bound book of

text: For several seconds, all is still. Then, very slowly, the
text: Doctor's eyes open. He coughs and a surge of blood rolls

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM â€”- DAY
text: Lucille appears at the bedroom door; in her bloody hands, a

speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: There. I just put a poor creature out of

scene_heading: INT. BEDROOM â€”- DAY
text: Edith is tied to the bedposts. Like an animal, she tugs

speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Still the clever one, I see. That's fine.

dialog: - Boston.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: Yes, Boston - all had what was necessary:

dialog: always - we specialized in provoking it.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: And your mother? You killed your own
dialog: mother...
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: (mild)
dialog: She caught us, one day. We were a bit

speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: There is no answer! That's the madness of
text: it - the power of it. Even now. Lucille
dialog: is me- and I am her. That dark thing -
dialog: she lives inside me. All our lives we
dialog: felt it - something stronger than love or
dialog: hate. She is my fate - she made me and
dialog: she will destroy me.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: But not me.
text: She puts on her glasses and takes a few faltering steps. He
text: catches hold of her arm, but she tears free.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: I can walk -!
text: She throws a coat over her shoulders.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 105.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: For all your words, the truth is plain
dialog: enough. You're free of her and she's
dialog: helpless without you.
dialog: (pause)
dialog: Now. You're going to help me. Down those
text: stairs, out the front door - then into
dialog: town.
text: They look at each other for a long moment. Edith has no idea
dialog: what he'll do. Finally:
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: We only need to reach the motorcar. Stay
dialog: close to me no matter what.
text: He cracks open the bedroom door. Looks around... all quiet.
text: As they start forward-
speaker_heading: SHARPE (CONT'D)
dialog: Wait! You signed the papers - !?
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: There's no time-
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: No! I know her. You must get them back-!
dialog: Stay here.
scene_heading: INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
text: Sharpe walks into the deserted kitchen. The bank papers are
text: still on the table.
text: But Lucille steps out from behind a cupboard, holding the
text: boning knife. Her face is contorted with grief.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: I thought so. I could see it in your
text: eyes.
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: She will live.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: What have you told her -? What did you
dialog: promise her??? A country bungalow?? A
dialog: rose garden?? Sweet children??
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: You're not to touch her, or even get near
dialog: her.
speaker_heading: (MORE )
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 106.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
speaker_heading: SHARPE (CONT'D)
dialog: (Lucille eyes him)
dialog: Is that clear? Answer me!
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: And me?? What happens to me in your happy
dialog: dreams?? What happens to this house?? To
dialog: Crimson Peak and the mine?? Or the bodies
dialog: down there?? Our blood- my fingers, my
dialog: lips and flesh. Will you forget all
dialog: that??
text: She lowers the knife, blinking back tears. Sharpe picks up
text: the papers and reaches out for the knife.
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: We knew this day had to come. And now
dialog: it's happened. It's over, Lucy. She will
dialog: live.
text: But then, with a MOAN, the house "breathes" again and
dialog: Lucille -
text: - stabs Sharpe in the chest. He tries to grab the knife from
text: her, but she slashes at his hands and arms.
text: As they struggle-
scene_heading: INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
text: Edith leans out into the corridor.
text: She hobbles to the railing and looks down past the grand
text: staircase into the foyer below.
text: The distant CRASH of glassware. A GROAN.
scene_heading: AT THE ELEVATOR
text: Edith goes to the elevator and stares at the call button.
text: She reaches for it... but - CLUNK - ! The motor starts...
text: the cab comes up.
text: Edith can see a figure through the elevator's glass panels.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: (backing away)
dialog: Thomas -?
text: The lift stops; the doors open and Sharpe is there.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: His shirt is soaked in blood. More blood is pooling at his
text: feet. She grabs him before he collapses.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Thomas-
text: He hands her the bank papers.
speaker_heading: SHARPE
dialog: Let's go- now- Edith-
text: A NOISE from below: Lucille is marching up the stairs,
text: holding the knife.
text: Edith squeezes into the elevator next to Sharpe. She quietly
text: closes the door and puts her hands on the bloodied control
dialog: handle.
text: Then she waits and waits...
text: +..-until Lucille reaches the upstairs landing. Their eyes
text: meet -and Edith jerks the handle to the down position!
text: A long, maddening PAUSE - and with a lurch, the elevator
dialog: goes down!
text: SCREAMING, Lucille rushes forward..! Too late.
scene_heading: INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS
text: Fearing the worst, Edith watches the ground floor getting
text: closer and closer. She reaches past Sharpe and centers the
dialog: control lever.
text: The lift comes to a perfect stop. She turns to Sharpe, but
text: he's slumped over now. When she pushes open the doors, he
text: tumbles out onto his back, dead.
text: Edith limps through the gloomy foyer to the -
speaker_heading: FRONT DOOR
dialog: - which is LOCKED!
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (0.S.)
dialog: Where do you think you're going?
dialog: 108.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
text: In no hurry, the knife at her side, Lucille stops and looks
text: at the iron rack near the hearth. Among the fireplace tools,
text: the SHOVEL is missing.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Edith - You wish to hurt me, is that it?
dialog: Very well -
text: Very carefully, she enters the foyer.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (CONT'D)
dialog: - but I warn you, in this sort of
dialog: business, I'm far more-
text: THUNK!!! - the shovel swings out from the darkness and
text: smacks Lucille in the face, slamming her against the front
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
text: Hobbling, Edith makes it back to the elevator. Lucille is
text: right behind her. Edith gets in and jams the lever to
dialog: "down."
text: Descending, she catches a glimpse of Lucille's flayed-open
text: face, contorted in hatred.
scene_heading: INT. STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucille runs downstairs as fast as she can, trying to keep
text: up with the elevator.
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
text: The lift stops one floor below. Edith sees Lucille coming.
text: She pushes the lever again: DOWN.
text: BAMMM!!! The elevator doors shudder as Lucille pounds them.
text: Edith watches in horror as the woman cracks open the doors
text: and pins Edith's face against the mirrored back wall.
text: The flailing knife cuts Edith's blouse and arms, but ina
text: second she's descending again. There's just enough time for
text: Lucille to snatch off Edith's GLASSES.
text: Slashed, trapped, Edith goes down... down...
dialog: 109.
scene_heading: INT. CELLAR - CONTINUOUS
text: Lucille crushes the eyeglasses under her shoe. Then she
dialog: hurries on!!!
scene_heading: INT. MINE LANDING
text: As if possessed, the elevator STOPS at the first mine level.
text: Edith furiously works the DOWN lever just as Lucille again
text: reaches the doors and tries to pry them open!!!
text: This time Edith jabs with the shovel to break the grip of
dialog: the clawing hands!!
text: Suddenly, the elevator drops like a stone!!!
scene_heading: INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
text: Edith SHRIEKS as the cab hurtles past dim, rocky walls...
text: ..-and jerks to a hard stop, four feet short of the bottom!!
text: SMASH! Edith's head cracks one of the glass panels! As blood
text: streams down her face, she tries the control handle, to no
dialog: effect.
text: Acting quickly, she forces open the doors, drops the shovel
text: and squeezes out the small opening.
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS
text: Edith gropes her way down the stairs and turns on the
text: ceiling lights.
text: Behind her, the empty cab goes back up!!
scene_heading: INT. PENTAGONAL ROOM
text: Once again, Edith enters the pentagonal room. Looks at the
text: crypts, her eyes beseeching...
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: (whisper)
dialog: Help me! I understand now. I know who you
dialog: are..!
text: Her voice echoes off the walls... she hears only the distant
text: elevator cables humming.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 110.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: There's fresh BLOOD on one of the ledges. And on the floor,
text: an open medical bag. But no other sign of Dr. McMichael.
speaker_heading: ELEVATOR
text: Bleeding heavily, Lucille steps from the arriving lift. The
text: knife glints as she comes down the wooden steps.
text: Up ahead, a woman's skirts disappear around a corner.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: There's nowhere to run, Edith.
speaker_heading: MINE TUNNELS
text: Under the pulsating lights, Lucille confidently stalks her
text: prey through a maze of passageways.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: (weird smile)
dialog: Yes, that's the way! Do you see it yet?
text: She rounds another corner... her victim is closer now.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (CONT'D)
dialog: The end of our labors, a bottomless place
dialog: where this family came to nothing.
text: Suddenly, the figure ahead stops short, unable to proceed.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Good. You've found it.
speaker_heading: PIT
text: The rough-edged PIT yawns before them; Lucille closes in on
text: her victim, who stands at the brink, with nowhere to go.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: You killed him, Edith. And he loved you.
text: Down comes the knife - only to slice into diaphanous,
text: boneless flesh. Smoke wafts from the wounds. The figure
text: turns- a dead baby caught in its hair!!!
text: It's the ghost of the German woman, smiling from ear to ear.
text: Lucille SCREAMS, suddenly seeing the other dead women
text: arrayed before her, their spectral bodies rigid, their
text: mouths agape.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 111.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: Lucille instinctively lashes out with the knife -
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (CONT'D)
dialog: You're dead... you're dead -!
text: - slashing at nothing.
text: Wheezing, exhausted, Lucille realizes that Edith stands
text: among them, calm and unafraid.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE (CONT'D)
dialog: Let me pass!
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: You've made them suffer enough.
speaker_heading: LUCILLE
dialog: They are nothing! Nothing! Let me pass, I
dialog: say!
text: Edith comes forward, eye to eye with Lucille.
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: With you gone, they will be free, all of
dialog: them.
text: Hissing, Lucille raises the knife-
text: Suddenly, Edith's father is there, a plume of blood rising
text: from his head into the air like smoke.
text: Then the shovel clangs against LUCILLE's head!!! Wielded by-
dialog: -Edith.
text: The blow sends Lucille stumbling backwards!! Her feet fly up
text: as she disappears over the edge of the pit.
text: A final WAIL as she's swallowed up in the darkness.
text: The flickering ghost of Carter Cushing turns toward his
text: daughter. His sad smile is full of love.
speaker_heading: EDITH (CONT'D)
dialog: Father -!?
scene_heading: FATHER'S GHOST
dialog: Leave... live.
text: Edith's face is suddenly lit by shimmering warm light...
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 112.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED: (2)
speaker_heading: EDITH
dialog: (half-blinded)
dialog: Wait - Father, wait..!
text: But its too late, he's gone. Gradually, the light fades and
text: the diaphanous women recede into the walls. Edith looks
text: down: she's holding the shovel.
text: Edith realizes that Dr. McMichael is leaned up against the *
text: rock wall, wrapped in bloody bandages; his face is rigid in
text: shock at what he has witnessed. As their eyes meet...
text: She rushes to him and catches him before he collapses.
scene_heading: DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: INT. MINE TUNNEL - LATER
text: Edith limps down a mine tunnel, supporting the barely
text: conscious Doctor. A gust of cold air brushes her cheek.
text: The tunnel slopes upward, toward a glow of daylight.
scene_heading: EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY
text: The Sharpe mansion is a half mile away.
text: Old sheds and rusted mining equipment poke up from the snow
text: drifts. In the middle of the debris, a tumbled-down MINE
scene_heading: ENTRANCE.
text: Edith comes out and approaches CAMERA. Her face is smudged,
text: bloodied, but set in determination. She clings to the
text: Doctor, urging him on.
speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)
dialog: As I left the nightmare behind me, I knew
dialog: that peace had come to the loving souls
dialog: who sought only to help me. And damnation
dialog: would be the fate of the real monsters of *
dialog: Crimson Peak. *
text: She raises her eyes to the mountain, glowing red under *
text: lowering skies.
speaker_heading: EDITH (V.O.)
dialog: It was here that I found myself empty yet *
dialog: content with the universe. It was here- *
dialog: in the cold indifference of winter, on
dialog: the edge of death, that I decided to live
dialog: once and for all.
speaker_heading: (CONTINUED)
dialog: 113.
speaker_heading: CONTINUED:
text: SNOW begins to fall in big, wet flakes as they make their
