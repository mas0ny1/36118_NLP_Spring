speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: To most of America in 1913, the Age
dialog: of Innocence had arrived and the
dialog: stories of the Indian Wars and the
dialog: Gold.RuSh and the Great Gunfighters
dialog: had become either barroom ballyhoo
dialog: or front-porch remiraiscences... .But
dialog: on both sides of the $io Grande men
dialog: still lived as thia7 had in the 1 70's
dialog: and 1 80's -- unchanged. men in a
dialog: changing land.
text: THEY WEAR THE KHAKI UNIFORMS OF THE UNITED STATES CnVALJRY..
text: The horses bear the government brand and the saddles are
dialog: regulation.
text: PIKE BISHOP,. wearing lieutenant's bars, rides slightly ahead
text: of the others. He rides stiffly; always slightly in pain...
text: Pike is a not unhandsome, leather-faced man in his early
text: forties. A thoughtful, self-educated top gun with a penchant
dialog: for violence who is afraid of nothing - except the. changes
text: in himself and those around him.
dialog: Make no mistake, Pike Bishop is not a hero -- his values are
dialog: not ours -- he is a gunfighter, a criminal, a bank. robber, a
dialog: killer of men. His sympathies are not for fences, for
text: trolleys.and telegraphs or better schools. He lives outside
dialog: and against society because he believes in that way of life
dialog: and if he has moments of sympathy for others, moments of
dialog: regret, t hey ' are short lived. He is not a 'good man'
dialog: according to the righteous... To them he is totally bad,
dialog: and he wouldn't have it any other way.
text: Next to him DUTCH ENGSTROM wears the uniform of a sergeant.
text: Dutch is bigâ good-natured with a fast gun hand, strong
text: loyalty and, like Pike, a bone deep distaste for rules and
dialog: regulations. He can sing,. has more than his share of charm,
text: but believes in nothing except two men, and Pike is one.
text: Behind them ride two brothers, LYLE and TECTOR GORCH,
text: dressed as corporals. Lyle and Tector are big, tough, hot
text: tempered and sudden. They work together, eat together and

dialog: sometimes sleep together with the same whore. Brutal,
dialog: vicious in a fight, illiterate,. they are always pressing
dialog: for an advantage and once they get it -- they never let go.
dialog: They are without loyalty or honor, to anyone except each
dialog: other and that is limited.
text: A fifth man wears the single stripe of a PFC. This is. AL'GEL.
text: Angel is a good-looking, bilingual Mexican boy in his middle
dialog: 20's who has seen so much blood and violence and cruelty
dialog: under Diaz that he rebelled -- but his rebellion was not with
dialog: Villa or Obregon, his was a one-man revolution against them
dialog: all. He believes in his family, his village and the inherent
dialog: dignity of. man (some men at least). " He is faster than his
text: companions with a gun -- and a better shot -- but he can't.
dialog: laugh at the loss of love or suffer the loss of pride --
dialog: Mexican pride - a pride that can kill him, but if it does,.
dialog: he will have no regrets.
