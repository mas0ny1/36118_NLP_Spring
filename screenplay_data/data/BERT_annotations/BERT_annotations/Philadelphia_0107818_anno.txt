dialog: September 21, 1992
speaker_heading: FADE IN:
scene_heading: VARIOUS SHOTS OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS (EXT./DAY) ...
dialog: which may include the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market,
dialog: scenes along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers,
dialog: Independence Square, the Russian Orthodox neighborhood, the
dialog: ghettos of North Philly.
text: MAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a
dialog: SHOT OF...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: PHILADELPHIA'S GLORIOUSLY ORNATE CITY HALL (EXT./DAY) ...
dialog: TITLE: "Philadelphia City Hall."
scene_heading: CITY EMPLOYEES, JUDGES, COPS, LAWYERS, CRIMINALS, TOURISTS
text: pour into City Hall, into...
dialog: TO:
text: TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY).
text: Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying
text: an accordion file under his arm like a football.
text: Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP.
text: Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time
dialog: TO:
text: JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS
dialog: making a racket...
text: Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE."
text: RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:
speaker_heading: JOSEPH MILLER (OS)
dialog: This construction site is
dialog: causing mortal and irreparable
dialog: harm to an unsuspecting public!
speaker_heading: ANDREW BECKETT (OS)
dialog: My client has one of the finest
dialog: and most respected safety records
dialog: in the business, Your Honor!
text: Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO
scene_heading: CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT
text: (in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes).
speaker_heading: JUDGE TATE
dialog: One at a time. Mr. Miller?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp.
dialog: began construction, the
dialog: surrounding residential
dialog: neighborhood has been enshrouded
text: in a cloud of foul-smelling,
text: germ-carrying, pestilent dust.
dialog: My client is being forced to
dialog: breathe known carcinogens daily!
dialog: Other residents are coming forth
dialog: on a daily basis to add their
dialog: voices of outrage!
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Your Honor, I submit there were
dialog: no complaints until Counselor
dialog: began knocking on doors,
dialog: drumming up business. And the
dialog: dust, which Counselor refers to,
dialog: has appeared on only three
dialog: occasions. Each time it has
dialog: been examined and the results...
text: Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs
text: a document into Andrew's hand.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
text: Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.
text: Andrew submits the report to the Judge.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Innocuous?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: Defined by Webster's as harmless.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know what it means. Your
dialog: Honor, imagine how the children
dialog: in this neighborhood have been
text: made to feel. The pounding of
text: construction ringing in their
dialog: ears as this skyscraper, a
dialog: tribute to mankind's greed,
text: grows daily, casting an ominous
text: shadow over their lives, filling
text: them with dread even as they are
text: surrounded in a black, toxic
text: fog, blocking out the sun while
dialog: poisoning their lungs! And
dialog: Counselor calls it harmless?!
text: His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to
text: Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again:
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Your Honor, Counselor is
dialog: attempting to portray my client
text: as a hideous manifestation of
dialog: evil and corruption. But
dialog: nothing could be further from
dialog: the truth. Rockwell has
dialog: generously contributed ten
dialog: thousand dollars to this
dialog: neighborhood's schools, clinics
dialog: and youth centers! Granting a
dialog: restraining order on the
dialog: construction site will throw
dialog: hundreds of Philadelphians out
dialog: of work, and will lend
dialog: validation to this contemptible
dialog: and groundless nuisance suit,
text: which speaks directly to the
dialog: kind of greed and treachery that
dialog: today is threatening the very
dialog: fabric of our society.
text: Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.
speaker_heading: JUDGE TATE
dialog: Let's not go off the deep end,
dialog: gentlemen. I thought we were
text: talking about some dust.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS
text: joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ...
text: As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro-
text: cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite
text: corner of the elevator, does exactly the same thing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW JOE
dialog: ... plaintiff seeks to re- ... whereas decedent had
dialog: strain defendants from con- pre-existing asthmatic
dialog: tinued improper use of trade condition and ride on
dialog: name without... Ultra Loop caused sub-
dialog: sequent death...
text: Andrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other...
text: And turn toward the corner, seeking privacy.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.) JOE (CONT.)
dialog: ... plaintiff's permission or ... complainant seeks
dialog: authorization... relief...
text: There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their
text: portable telephones at the same time.
text: They look at each other: which phone is ringing?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You.
text: Andrew resumes his telephone conversation.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right.
dialog: (into phone)
dialog: Miller.
text: The ELEVATOR OPENS: Andrew breezes past the MAN ON
dialog: CRUTCHES, saying to Joe:
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Client of yours?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Funny.
text: Andrew hurries down the corridor. Joe waits a moment... then
text: pursues the MAN ON CRUTCHES.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: Excuse me..? Sir? Yo!
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ANDREW EKERGES FROM CITY HALL, ONTO DILWORTH PLAZA BUSTLING with
scene_heading: PEDESTRIANS (EXT./DAY) ...
text: ... DARTS into the street, hailing a cab.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE CAB PULLS UP TO A BROWNSTONE ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET,
text: Andrew hopping out, stuffing papers into his briefcase
dialog: (EXT./DAY) ...
text: RUSHING to the door marked "Dr. Roberta Gillman, Internal
dialog: Medicine."
text: Coming out is a YOUNG ASIAN MAN with a cotton ball taped to
text: the inside of his elbow.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: CLASSICAL MUSIC (INT./DAY) ... AS CAMERA PANS PATIENTS
text: (MOSTLY YOUNG MEN) in a cheerful room... some, like a UPS
text: DELIVERY MAN, are attached to IV's, some sit with arms
text: extended, waiting to be hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a BLACK
speaker_heading: PHYSICIAN'S AID.
text: CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running
text: into his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of
text: the CLASSICAL MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most
text: of the people in the room look SICKER than Andrew.
scene_heading: DIALOGUE CAN BE HEARD under the CLASSICAL MUSIC (although
text: MUSIC dominates the SOUNDTRACK).
speaker_heading: TYRONE
dialog: (slapping a thin
speaker_heading: PATIENT'S wrist)
dialog: Gonna have to start looking for
dialog: veins in your feet, sweetheart.
text: DR. ROBERTA GILLMAN, passes through, speaking to Andrew:
speaker_heading: DR. GILLMAN
dialog: Andy. Can you stop at my office
dialog: on your way out?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Sure.
text: Andrew is distracted by A HISPANIC MAN across the room,
text: rolling up his sleeve for an IV -- his bare arms, hands,
text: face and neck are marked with PURPLE BLOTCHES.
text: Andrew closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment on the
text: CLASSICAL MUSIC... then goes back to work.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ANDREW HURRIES OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, HAILING A CAB
dialog: (EXT./DAY) ...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: ANDREW HOPS OUT OF THE CAB, IN FRONT OF AN IMPRESSIVE
text: skyscraper in downtown Philly, at the end of the work day
dialog: (EXT./DAY) ...
text: Andrew pushes through glass doors into the plush "Wheeler
text: Building," pressing through the tide of WORKERS headed home.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A BLACK PARALEGAL, ANTHEA BURTON, LEADS A YOUNG, BLACK LAW
text: CLERK (in suit and tie) to the elevators, at the sedate,
text: expensively appointed offices of Wyant Wheeler Hellerman
dialog: Tetlow and Brown (INT./DAY) ...
speaker_heading: ANTHEA
dialog: ... up to Tax, on fourteen, and
dialog: get right back, I need you.
text: Andrew BLASTS out of the elevator, flashing Anthea a four-
text: star smile. They stride down the corridor together.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Just the dazzling paralegal I
dialog: wanted to see.
speaker_heading: ANTHEA
dialog: (friendly)
dialog: I know what that means, and the
dialog: answer is no. I have a class
dialog: tonight. Exploit someone else.
dialog: And since you've asked ...
text: They pass a silver-haired partner, KENNETH KILLCOYNE.
speaker_heading: KILLCOYNE
dialog: Solid work on the Rockwell
dialog: situation, Andy. Top-notch.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thanks, Kenneth.
dialog: (to Anthea)
dialog: Your exam!
speaker_heading: ANTHEA
dialog: Thank you. 98. I gotta go...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Ninety-eight?! Ninety-eight!
text: Andrew reaches the secretaries' station. A cheerful
text: secretary, SHELBY, shoves documents at him.
speaker_heading: SHELBY
dialog: Conference call's up. They just
dialog: started the roll call. Here's
dialog: the settlement agreement, the
dialog: red-lined copy's on your desk.
dialog: Need me in there?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No. Great. Thanks, Shelby.
dialog: (checking his watch)
dialog: It's 6:30, go home.
text: Andrew passes a colleague on her way out, RACHEL SMILOW:
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: Rach.
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I'm late, I have to pick up Amy
dialog: from her afterschool but I want
dialog: to talk to you about that Hansen
dialog: thing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Catch me later, I'll be here.
dialog: And tell Amy, I love her
dialog: painting, it's on my wall.
text: Andrew SAILS toward his office.
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
text: ANDREW ENTERS HIS OFFICE, KICKING THE DOOR SHUT (INT./DAY).
text: ... DROPPING the documents on his desk, SCANNING them.
text: ... ADMIRING a child's painting taped to the wall.
text: ... PUNCHING into the speaker phone on his desk.
scene_heading: The SCREEN SPLITS, REVEALING A TELECONFERENCE OPERATOR:
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: ... Karen Hargreave, representing
dialog: Lloyd Management Corporation?
text: The SCREEN SPLITS INTO THIRDS: Andrew, the OPERATOR, and
dialog: HARGREAVE (a sharp, California lawyer.)
speaker_heading: HARGREAVE
dialog: Present.
text: As the OPERATOR continues the roll call, the SCREEN
text: CONTINUES TO SPLIT and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF
scene_heading: LAWYERS in offices around the country, (MOSTLY WHITE MALES)
text: saying "Present" while in Andrew's section of the screen...
text: ... Andrew dials a number on another telephone line,
speaker_heading: OPERATOR
dialog: Andrew Beckett, representing
dialog: Saunders International?
text: Andrew punches into the conference call
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Present.
text: The MULTI-IMAGE SCREEN is now joined by SARAH BECKETT, a
text: suburban, 60ish American MOM, in her backyard garden,
text: answering a portable phone.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Hello?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hi, Mom. It's me.
text: The LAWYERS are into the conference, in their portions of
text: the screen, (their VOICES HEARD underneath Andrew's
text: conversation with his mother).
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Andy! This is a nice surprise.
dialog: How are you, hon?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm fine.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: What's Dr. Gillman say?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Hold on, Mom.
dialog: (punching into the
dialog: conference call)
dialog: There's no way my client will go
dialog: along with that.
speaker_heading: HARGREAVE
dialog: Who's this?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm
dialog: sorry I interrupted...
text: He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing
text: over his shoulder to make sure the door is shut).
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: Gillman says I'm fine. My blood
text: work is excellent. T-cells are up.
dialog: Just a sec ...
dialog: (conference call)
dialog: Yes, I think that would alleviate
dialog: most of our concerns.
dialog: (back to Mom)
dialog: My platelets look good too.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Are you on one of those conference
dialog: calls? I hate when you put me on
dialog: hold.
text: CUT ON ANDREW'S LAUGHTER TO:
scene_heading: THE MOON ABOVE THE WHEELER BUILDING LATE AT NIGHT (EXT.)
dialog: TITLE: "One-thirty a.m."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ANDREW AT WORK IN THE FIRM'S LIBRARY (INT./NIGHT) ...
text: Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer.
text: Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from
text: the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of
dialog: Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a
text: computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather
dialog: than a book.)
text: Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a
dialog: relevant citation:
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Ah hah! Yes!
dialog: (chewing a string bean)
dialog: Rentworth v. Pennsylvania...
dialog: court of appeals affirms jury
dialog: award of punitive damages for
dialog: wrongful interference with
dialog: prospective economic
dialog: relations...
text: A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT.
scene_heading: ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says:
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Look at this fucking guy. He's
text: an animal.
text: Andrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Walter.
text: The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible
text: This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Are we interrupting, Andy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: In a word, Bob...
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
text: Charles is right behind me.
text: ANOTHER SILHOUETTED FIGURE APPEARS. This image has a
dialog: horror-film feeling to it.
text: Andrew WHIPS AROUND to face them.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I was just about to take a
dialog: break. Good evening, Charles.
text: CHARLES WHEELER, also in tuxedo, remains in shadow.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Andy? Could you step into my
dialog: office for a sec?
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: I feel like firing someone
dialog: tonight.
text: Andrew throws an arm over Seidman's shoulder.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: We're gonna miss you around
dialog: here, Bob...
text: CUT ON LAUGHTER TO:
scene_heading: THE RECEPTION AREA (INT./NIGHT): A DOMINO'S PIZZA DELIVERY
text: MAN, waiting for clearance from a SECURITY GUARD, on
text: Andrew's dim and quiet floor, WATCHES AS...
text: Seidman, Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide,
text: carpeted staircase. Wheeler finishes a story and everyone
text: LAUGHS...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: A BOX OF CIGARS BEING HANDED AROUND (INT./NIGHT) ...
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Andy's expressed a keen interest
dialog: in the Kronos Inc. situation,
dialog: Charles. Is that correct, Andy?
text: The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with
text: its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: The fate of the participants
dialog: interests me, yes sir.
text: Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of
text: preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass
text: clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the
text: cigars in and out of their rounded mouths.
text: Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches
text: with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye.
text: Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter.
text: He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: It's good to be King, hey
dialog: Charles?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Kings are out of fashion. I'd
dialog: rather be thought of as a
dialog: benevolent tyrant.
dialog: (prompting Andrew)
dialog: It's an anti-trust action.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It is, and it isn't, Charles.
dialog: Macrosystem's new software
dialog: copies all the best-known
text: elements of Kronos' spreadsheet
dialog: program. If they're allowed to
dialog: sell it, Kronos will get undersold
dialog: right out of business. For me, the
dialog: legal principle, involved is
dialog: copyright infringement.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Bearing in mind that Bill
dialog: Wright, the chairman of
dialog: MacroSystems, is a close, personal
dialog: friend of mine... which side of
dialog: this mess would you desire to be
dialog: on, Andy? And don't allow my very
dialog: tight, personal relationship with
dialog: Bill to influence your answer in
dialog: any way.
dialog: Andrew knows this is a test. And he loves it.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Sorry, Charles, but...
text: Andrew is distracted -- BY A LIGHT FALLING ACROSS HIS FACE.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: I'd like to see Kronos win.
text: Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its LIGHT FALLS
text: ACROSS ANDREW'S FACE, REVEALING: a faint purple blotch
text: about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw
text: on the HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrew's doctor's office.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Why, Beckett?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Because they deserve to, Walter.
text: Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed
text: back, revealing the blotch.
text: He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to
text: cover the blotch.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
text: If MacroSystems wins, an energetic,
dialog: young company will be destroyed,
dialog: five thousand Americans will be
dialog: out of work. Moreover, the laws of
dialog: copyright and anti-trust were
dialog: enacted to prevent exactly the
dialog: kind of bullshit Macrosystems is
text: trying to pull.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Andy, do you know who reps Kronos
dialog: Inc.?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Bailey, Brackman.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Get with the program, Andy. As
dialog: of this evening, about 8:05 this
dialog: evening, right after the soup
dialog: course... Kronos Incorporated is
dialog: represented by Wyant Wheeler
dialog: Hellerman Tetlow and Brown. Or,
dialog: more specifically, senior
dialog: associate Andrew Beckett.
text: A moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist
text: in a victory salute.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes!
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: You'll have to get right on it,
dialog: Andy, we're up against the
dialog: statute of limitations.
text: An ASSOCIATE LAWYER in shirtsleeves taps on the office door.
speaker_heading: ASSOCIATE LAWYER
dialog: Tokyo on four, Bob.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Great. Excuse me, fellas.
dialog: (picking up a phone,
dialog: speaking Japanese)
dialog: Connichiwa. Itsumo osewa ni nari
dialog: mashita. Arigato gozaimasu.
text: Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thanks, Walter.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: What's that on your forehead,
dialog: pal?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
text: Whacked with a racquetball.
dialog: (taking Wheeler's hand)
dialog: I appreciate your faith in my
dialog: abilities.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Faith, Andy, is the belief in
dialog: something for which we have no
dialog: evidence. It doesn't apply to
dialog: this situation.
dialog: (slapping his shoulder)
dialog: Go home. I mean, get back to
dialog: work.
text: Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (warmly, softly)
dialog: Thanks, Charles.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: (with a father's
dialog: affection)
dialog: No sweat, buddy.
text: Smiling, Andrew exits the office.
text: CLOSE ON WALTER KENTON, THINKING...
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
text: ANDREW STEPPING INTO THE EMPTY CORRIDOR, TAKING A FEW STEPS
text: away from Wheeler's office (INT./NIGHT), then...
text: ... DOING a JOYFUL END ZONE DANCE, running in place the way
text: football players do when then score a touch down, saying
text: "Yes! Yes! Yes!" to himself, soundlessly.
text: The SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a
text: maintenance worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his
text: little dance and starts to laugh.
text: Smiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS
dialog: at Helena and says:
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (in a funny, kind of
dialog: medieval way)
dialog: It's good to be King.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ESTABLISHING: ANDREW'S LOFT BUILDING (EXT. DAY)
dialog: TITLE: "Ten days later."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CLOSE ON ANDREW'S FACE MARKED WITH FOUR BLOTCHES (WE'RE IN
scene_heading: Andrew's loft -- INT./DAY)
text: It's a mirror image. The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a
text: dime, to the size of a half-dollar. He looks awful.
text: A YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's
text: face, trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend
speaker_heading: CHANDRA.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA (O.S.)
dialog: You want to apply the foundation
dialog: as evenly as you can, Andy. You
dialog: don't want to look like you've
text: thrown it on with a spoon.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (O.S.)
dialog: Uh huh.
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his
text: loft, a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup.
text: Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend
text: named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's
text: command post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend,
text: BRUNO, sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: Okay. You try.
text: Andrew tries applying makeup to his face.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Chandra? Don't you think this
dialog: color's a little... orange for me?
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: Tahitian Bronze works best on
dialog: lesions.
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Think of it as the "I just back
dialog: from Aruba" look.
text: IN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in
text: Andrew's "work area": desk, personal computer, etc.).
speaker_heading: BRUNO
dialog: I got it.
text: Bruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to
text: Andrew, handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (giving the fax
dialog: a quick scan)
dialog: Thanks, Bruno.
dialog: (to Alan and Chandra)
dialog: I've been out of the office four
dialog: days. I don't want them to
dialog: think I've been to the beach.
dialog: (searching for something)
dialog: Okay. Check this out.
text: Andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell
text: frames, meant to help conceal the blotches.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: Hides everything, right? What
dialog: do you think?
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: You know who you look like,
dialog: Andy? That actor, in that
dialog: movie. Not the one where he was
dialog: autistic, the one where he
text: dressed up like a lady on a soap
dialog: opera...
speaker_heading: ALAN
dialog: Dustin Hoffman.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (horrified)
dialog: Tootsie!
speaker_heading: BRUNO
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: You want to try Light Egyptian?
text: Suddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA (CONT.)
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (clearly in pain)
dialog: Excuse me a sec...
text: Andrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN.
speaker_heading: CHANDRA
dialog: Just like my cousin Fredo.
text: CAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR
text: slamming shut.
text: Bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom
dialog: door.
speaker_heading: BRUNO
dialog: You okay, Andy?
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
text: TIGHT SHOT ON ANDREW, FACE TWISTED IN PAIN (INT./DAY) ...
text: Andrew rests his head against the wall, sweat covering his
text: face. A storm of fire has passed through him, and he's hoping
dialog: it's over for now.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I think I need to go to the
dialog: hospital.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: MIGUEL ALVAREZ RUNS URGENTLY DOWN SPRUCE STREET, DODGING
text: traffic as he crosses Eleventh Street, toward Jefferson
text: Hospital (EXT./DAY). He hustles up the ramp toward the
dialog: Emergency Entrance...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: MIGUEL SHOVES THROUGH GLASS DOORS, INTO THE BUSTLING
speaker_heading: Emergency Room (INT./DAY), FINDING
text: ANDREW sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against
text: his arm, where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over
text: his shoulders, fighting chills.
text: Chandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew. They exchange
text: quick hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and
dialog: goodbyes.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thanks, you guys.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Yeah. Thanks, guys.
text: Miguel puts his arms around Andrew.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Gillman's out of her office today.
dialog: I told her to take a day off, and
dialog: she did, can you believe it? Did
dialog: you get someone to cover your
dialog: class?
text: Miguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Don't worry about it. They took
dialog: blood? A specimen?
text: Andrew holds an empty specimen cup.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Aren't you giving an exam?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I said, don't worry about it.
text: Miguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL (CONT.)
dialog: You got a fever, baby.
text: Suddenly, the facade cracks and TEARS STING Andrew's eyes.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I almost didn't make it to
dialog: the bathroom, Miguel. I almost
dialog: lost control right in front
dialog: of everybody.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: (holding him)
dialog: So what? It's nothing to be
dialog: ashamed of. You have nothing to
dialog: be ashamed of, okay?
text: Andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in
text: control of his emotions once more.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Wait, here's my guy... Hey!
text: Andrew catches the attention of a harried INTERN, whose
text: surgeon's greens are covered with blood.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: About my blood work?
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: We're waiting...
text: Miguel opens a small notebook, making notes.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: ... meanwhile, I'd like to
dialog: prepare you for a colonoscopy,
dialog: so we can take a look inside.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Sounds delightful.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Why do you need to do this?
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Who are you? Doctor... ?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: This is my partner. We keep
dialog: records of hospital visits.
dialog: Nothing personal.
speaker_heading: INTERN
dialog: Dr. Klenstein.
dialog: (to Andrew)

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: INTERN

speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Don't apologize for me.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He's not sorry, okay, fine.
dialog: (the diplomat)
dialog: Why don't we see what we find

dialog: work on getting a specimen, I'm

speaker_heading: INTERN

speaker_heading: JAMEY
dialog: I went down to Word Processing

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: SEIDMAN

speaker_heading: SEIDMAN (CONT.)
dialog: What in God's name... ?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Bob...
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Big trouble.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Charles, I must apologize again,

dialog: (smiling)
dialog: It was a scary few minutes
dialog: around here. Wow. But thank

dialog: And no damage was done.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: This time. What about next time?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: There won't be a next time, I
dialog: guarantee it.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Andy. It seems that something
dialog: has come over you, lately: A
dialog: kind of... stupor, a fogginess,
dialog: a lack of focus... Earth to
dialog: Andy. Anybody home?
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Helloooo...
speaker_heading: KILLCOYNE
dialog: That's right, Andy. The last
dialog: four, five months you've seemed
dialog: really out of it...
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: At least... different, somehow.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (keeping it positive)
dialog: Perhaps... you're right. I've
dialog: certainly been busy. With the
dialog: Kronos complaint, a preliminary
dialog: injunction hearing and the
dialog: Saunders trial all falling at the
dialog: same time...
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Some people think you have an
dialog: attitude problem, Beckett.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Really? Who thinks that, sir?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: I do.
text: Wheeler seems very grave.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I had no idea there was a concern

speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: We've been talking it over, Andy.

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Honesty is always best.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Do you really think so, Andy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes, Bob, I do.
dialog: (to the group)
dialog: Excuse me? Am I being fired?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Let's put it this way, Andy:
dialog: your place in the future of this
dialog: firm is no longer secure.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: In a word, yes.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: We don't think it's fair to keep
dialog: you here, where your future is
dialog: limited. But we wish you luck,
dialog: Andy, all the luck in the world.
text: Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.
speaker_heading: WHEELER (CONT.)

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: ... we've got a committee meeting.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Excuse me, Charles. With all
dialog: due respect... this is...
dialog: preposterous! It doesn't make
dialog: any sense, it sounds as if we're
text: talking about someone else.
dialog: Pardon the lack of humility, but
dialog: I've had the distinct impression
dialog: I was kind of... one of the
dialog: rising stars around here. And I
dialog: feel that wasn't just my
dialog: imagination. And I also think I
dialog: deserve to know what's really
dialog: going on here, Charles.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Oh, you're right, Beckett, you
dialog: don't have an attitude problem.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Take it easy, Walter.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: If you'd lost confidence in me,
dialog: why did you give me the Kronos suit?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: I hoped the challenge would
dialog: improve your performance. You
dialog: could say it was a carrot.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: A carrot?!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I buy that.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: As in, the vegetable?
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: (suddenly emotional)
dialog: Andy, you nearly blew the case,
dialog: for God's sake! That alone is
dialog: inexcusable. It would have been
dialog: catastrophic for us. Put
dialog: yourself in our shoes, Andy.
dialog: There's no coming back from an
dialog: error like that, regardless of
dialog: who you are!
dialog: (softer)
dialog: I'm sorry, Andy.
dialog: Andrew FREEZES -- the full nature of this situation hitting
text: home. He looks each of the PARTNERS in the eye...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Uh huh... Okay... I see...
text: ... at last LOOKING DIRECTLY AT Wheeler's secretary Lydia,
text: whose pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone
dialog: to say something.
text: Wheeler breaks the silence.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Good luck, Andy.
text: Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out.
text: Andrew doesn't move.
text: A SECURITY GUARD enters the room.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Who are you?
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: I'm here to escort you to your
dialog: office so you can organize your
dialog: belongings.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM ANDREW, WE'RE IN JOE'S OFFICE (DAY) ...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay. Explain to me like I'm a
dialog: two year old, because there's an
dialog: element to this I can't get
dialog: through my thick head: Didn't
dialog: you have an obligation to inform
dialog: your employer you had this
dialog: dreaded, deadly, infectious
dialog: disease?
text: Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to
dialog: disguise the effects of chemo.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: The law says people with
dialog: disabilities cannot be
dialog: terminated, so long as they can
dialog: perform the duties required by
dialog: their position...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay, okay... They discover you
dialog: have this horrible, disgusting,
dialog: terminal illness, and they
dialog: panic, for any number of
dialog: perfectly valid reasons.
dialog: They're frightened for
dialog: themselves, their families...
dialog: Maybe it's the homo angle.
dialog: Maybe they don't want to rub
dialog: elbows with someone who's just
text: popped out of the closet with a
dialog: terminal case of acne. And how
dialog: do they explain your status to
dialog: the client for Chrissake?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Joe, from the day I arrived to
dialog: the day they fired me, I
dialog: performed consistently,
dialog: thoroughly and with absolute
dialog: excellence. And if they hadn't
dialog: fired me, that's what I'd be
dialog: doing today.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay... They want you out. It's
dialog: against the law to fire you for
dialog: having AIDS, so they make you
dialog: look like a fuck up. Which
dialog: leads us to the mysterious, lost
dialog: file.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: They sabotaged me.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I knew you were going to say
dialog: that. I don't buy it, and I
dialog: don't see a case.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Look. I know I have a case. If
dialog: you don't want to take it for
dialog: personal reasons...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Correct. I don't.
text: Andrew rises, thoroughly business-like.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thanks for your time.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Beckett? I'm sorry about...
dialog: what's happened to you. It's a
dialog: fucking kick in the head.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm
dialog: not dead yet.
text: Andrew exits.
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
text: ANDREW LEAVES JOE'S OFFICE, MOVING DOWN THE CORRIDOR
dialog: (DAY) ...
speaker_heading: IRIS
dialog: (still uncomfortable,
dialog: as Andrew's leaving)
dialog: Have a nice day.
text: Andrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler
text: named FILKO, who STARES SHAMELESSLY.
text: Joe approaches Iris's desk.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Find out if Armbruster can see
dialog: me this afternoon.
speaker_heading: FILKO
dialog: (still staring)
dialog: What the hell's wrong with him?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE STREET: ANDREW EMERGES FROM THE LAWYER'S BUILDING

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A SUBURBAN DOCTOR'S OFFICE IN A MIDDLE-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD
dialog: (EXT./DAY) ...
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER (OS)
dialog: You had contact with someone who
dialog: has AIDS, and you're worried.
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
scene_heading: A DOCTOR UNRAVELLING A BLOOD PRESSURE GAUGE (INT./DAY)
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'm not worried. What are you doing?
text: Joe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table.
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: Checking your blood pressure,
dialog: relax.
text: The DOCTOR wraps the blood pressure unit around Joe's arm.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I didn't have contact. What do you
dialog: consider "contact?" We were sitting
dialog: in the same room, three, four
dialog: feet... What if you shake hands?
dialog: Wait. I know the answer. Only sex,
dialog: or sharing needles. I know that.
dialog: We didn't shake hands, anyway.
text: Dr. Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump,
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: The HIV virus can only be transmitted
dialog: through the exchange of bodily
text: fluids, namely blood and semen.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Right.
text: Joe begins rolling down his sleeve.
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: Leave that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they
dialog: keep finding out new things about
dialog: this disease? So you tell me, today,
dialog: there's no danger, and I go home,
dialog: and I hold my baby, and six months
dialog: from now I hear on the news: "whoops!
dialog: We were wrong.' You can carry it on
dialog: your clothes, your skin, and now I've
dialog: got to worry about my kid. What
dialog: are you doing?
text: Dr. Armbruster has been preparing a syringe.
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: We're going to draw blood.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why are we going to do that?
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: Joe. I don't care a whit about your
dialog: private life.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You want to give me an AIDS test?!
text: Joe HOPS off the table.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: The guy sat in my office! You can't
dialog: get AIDS that way, right?
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: Right.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It doesn't travel through the
dialog: air, by breathing, or touching,
dialog: right?
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: Not by touching, or shaking hands,
dialog: or hugging, using the same toilet...
dialog: Even kissing someone with AIDS is
dialog: safe. But it there's something in
dialog: your past you're worried about...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an
dialog: AIDS test. Are you crazy? But
dialog: thanks for the information. Really.
text: Joe throws on his jacket, opens the door... then TURNS BACK:
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: In my past?
speaker_heading: ARMBRUSTER
dialog: IV drug use.
text: Joe shakes his head.
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER (CONT.)
text: A homosexual encounter.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Get real.
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
text: Unprotected sex with a prostitute.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (thinking it over)
dialog: Uh.... No. Not really.
speaker_heading: DR. ARMBRUSTER
dialog: Or unprotected sex with someone you
dialog: didn't know very well, any time
dialog: during the last twelve years.
text: A MOMENT.
text: Joe returns to the examining table, and rolls up his sleeve.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: ESTABLISHING: JOE'S HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS (EXT./NIGHT) ...
speaker_heading: LISA (VOICE OVER)
dialog: You have a problem with gays,

scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Not especially.

speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: How many gays do you know?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How many do you know?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Lots.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My
dialog: cousin Tommy who lives in
dialog: Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the
dialog: office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of
text: the partners. His lover, Greg.
dialog: Stanley, the guy who's putting in
dialog: our kitchen cabinets.
text: For a moment, Joe is struck dumb. Then he says:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That
dialog: beautiful, sensuous woman is a...
dialog: lesbian?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Duh...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Since when?
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Probably since she was born.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Allright. I admit it: I'm
dialog: prejudiced. I don't want to work
dialog: with a homosexual. You got me.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Okay, Joe...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I mean, two guys, doing the
dialog: horizontal thing? I don't get
dialog: it. Don't they get confused?
dialog: "Is that mine? I thought it was
dialog: yours." Hey, call me old
dialog: fashioned, call me
dialog: conservative... I think maybe
dialog: you have to be a man to get just
dialog: how nauseating the whole basic
dialog: idea really is.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: Fine, Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: And the way they work out,
dialog: pumping up, so they can be macho
dialog: and faggot at the same time... I
dialog: can't stand that shit. Now I'm
dialog: being totally honest with you.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: That's perfectly clear.
text: CLOSE ON JOE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Would you take a client if you
dialog: were constantly thinking: "I
dialog: hope this guy doesn't touch me.
dialog: I don't even want him to breathe
dialog: on me?"
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: THE STREETS OF PHILLY ARE DUSTED WITH SNOW, STORE WINDOWS

dialog: TITLE: "Two weeks later."
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY
text: books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami
text: sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN
text: saunters by (INT./DAY) ...
text: A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE:
text: Andrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been
text: reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew
text: removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a
text: package of tissues, blowing his nose.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (under his breath)
dialog: Shit...
text: Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or
text: eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him.
text: JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS:
text: Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes
text: something. Sneezes.
text: A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: This is the supplement. You're
dialog: right, there is a section on...
dialog: (lowers her voice)
dialog: ... HIV related discrimination.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thank you.
text: Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: We have a private research room
dialog: available.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm fine, thanks.
text: Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching.
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Wouldn't you be more comfortable in
dialog: a research room?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (pleasantly)
dialog: No. But would it make you more
dialog: comfortable?
speaker_heading: LIBRARIAN
dialog: Whatever, sir.
text: The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating
dialog: she's done all she can do.
text: As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks
text: up his books and moves away.
text: Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye
text: on Andrew, who concentrates on his work.
text: Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be
text: sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Fine.
text: Andrew goes back to his work.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who'd you get?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Find a lawyer?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What's her name?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Rayisha.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Rayisha. Very nice.
text: Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away.
text: Joe comes back.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How did they find out?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (a second, then:)
dialog: One of the partners spotted a
text: lesion on my forehead.
text: Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she
dialog: hears the word "lesion."
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Uh huh...
text: Andrew concentrates on his work once more.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: How do you get from one lawyer
text: spotting a lesion, which could
dialog: have been a bruise, to the
dialog: partners deducing you had AIDS
dialog: and basing a decision to
dialog: terminate you on that
dialog: conclusion?
text: The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Good point.
text: Andrew removes a legal pad with "KENTON" written in big
text: letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: The partner who spotted the
dialog: lesion, Walter Kenton, used to
dialog: work for Benton, Myers, in D.C.
dialog: There's a paralegal there, Maria
dialog: Torres. She's had lesions on
dialog: and off for three years. She
dialog: says it was common knowledge
dialog: around the office that her
dialog: lesions were caused by AIDS.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: They didn't fire her?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No. They didn't fire her.
text: Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So Kenton connected the... lesion,
dialog: and whatever suspicions he had about
dialog: your personal life... to this
dialog: woman, Maria... and blew the
dialog: whistle on you. Suddenly you're
dialog: losing files, and it's time to
dialog: let you go. But, up to this
dialog: point, you've been their Golden
dialog: Boy, their rising star... Their
dialog: behavior is... inconsistent.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thank you.
text: Andrew goes back to work.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: There is no relevant precedent.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (not looking up)
dialog: Arline decision. Supreme Court.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Arline?
text: Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe.
text: CLOSE ON ANDREW'S HANDS (with one blotch) on the book's white
dialog: pages.
text: The book is still facing Andrew. If Joe wants to read it,
dialog: he'll have to turn it around.
text: Joe looks at Andrew's hands. A MOMENT.
text: Joe turns the book around, begins to read:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: "The Federal Vocational
dialog: Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits
dialog: discrimination..."
text: CAMERA CRANES UP, TOWARD THE CEILING... JOE CONTINUES

speaker_heading: ANDREW (VO)
dialog: "Subsequent decisions have held
dialog: that AIDS is protected as a

dialog: because of the physical

text: DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO
text: NIGHT): Joe pacing, Andrew reading. Their section of the
text: library is COMPLETELY EMPTY but for Andrew and Joe.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (VO) (CONT.)
dialog: "But because the prejudice
dialog: surrounding AIDS exacts a social
dialog: death which precedes the actual,
dialog: physical one..."
text: DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE, LATER: Andrew and Joe sit on the
text: same side of the table, reading the same book.
speaker_heading: JOE (VO)
dialog: "This is the essence of

text: Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby.
text: Wheeler turns the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling
text: lovingly at the boy.

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE BRIGHTLY LIT, RESTRICTED, INNER CORRIDOR OF SPECTRUM

speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: ... interview every employee,

dialog: Did any of them know Andy was sick?
dialog: How did they know? Did he tell them?
dialog: Did they notice something was wrong
dialog: with his appearance? None of this
dialog: information got to the managing
dialog: partners. We know that. Make sure
dialog: everyone else does too... And
dialog: Beckett: I want to know everything
dialog: about his personal life. Did he

speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Jesus.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: (ignoring Seidman)
dialog: What about other homosexual

speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Charles...
speaker_heading: WHEELER

dialog: What is it, Bob?!
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Let's settle with Andy and put
dialog: this whole tragic mess behind
dialog: us.
text: They arrive at a quiet, semi-private cul de sac.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Andrew brought AIDS into our
dialog: offices, into our men's room.
dialog: He brought AIDS to our annual
dialog: goddamn family picnic.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: We ought to be suing him.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: For Christ's sake, where's your
dialog: compassion?
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Compassion? Andy sucks cocks,
text: Bob. He takes it up the ass.
dialog: He's a pervert.
text: Only Seidman shows any kind of REACTION.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: That's kind of... extreme, Walt.
dialog: Andy's private life is none of
dialog: our business.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Bob. You're trying my patience.
dialog: Andrew Beckett is making his
dialog: private life our business. We
dialog: gave him Kronos. Did he say,
dialog: "I'm sick. I might not be able
dialog: to see this through?"
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: He was doing a great job.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Bob. I must ask you to shut the
dialog: fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say
dialog: "I might not be able to serve our
dialog: clients to the best of my ability?"
dialog: He said nothing. And now, Andrew
dialog: Beckett proposes to haul me into a
dialog: court of law, to sling accusations
text: at me, in full view of the entire,
dialog: Philadelphia, judicial
dialog: establishment. My God.
speaker_heading: KILLCOYNE
dialog: Beckett doesn't want to go to court,
dialog: he's hoping for a quick tasty

speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: A jury might decide that Andy has a

speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Wait a minute. The man was fired for
dialog: incompetence, not because he has

speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN

dialog: Zero. Get the picture, Filko?
dialog: Discrimination! You find

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Low-life, sleazy scumbags. Of

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

scene_heading: REVERSE ANGLE -- DOWN AN OPPOSITE CORRIDOR:
text: A PHALANX OF LAWYERS -- at least ten -- APPROACHING CAMERA, a

scene_heading: ON ANDREW AND JOE:
text: Andrew's hair is short, but growing back, the blotches have

scene_heading: ON THE OTHER LAWYERS:
text: Charles Wheeler (seeming ironic) and Walter Kenton (he's

speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: HUSHED VOICES (INT./DAY) ...
text: A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a
text: loose circle, like a casual living room.
text: Joe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team
text: takes up several chairs. Belinda Conine and Jerome Green sit
text: next to Wheeler and Kenton. Some of their ASSISTANTS stand.
text: Wheeler is looking across the room at...
text: Andrew, who catches Wheeler's stare.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: You're looking better, Andy.
dialog: How do you feel?
text: SILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Fine, thanks, Charles.
text: JUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a
text: Judge's robe). He shakes hands with Wheeler and Kenton.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Charles, Walter...
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Congratulations on the new
dialog: grandson.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Thank you. We're very happy.
text: The Judge brushes by Joe and Andrew without a word. The room
text: becomes SILENT as the Judge takes a seat.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Attorney for the plaintiff?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Joseph Miller, Your Honor.
dialog: Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: I've seen your television commercials.
dialog: "If you or anyone you know has
dialog: been injured through the fault of
dialog: others... It should say, "through
dialog: the negligence of others."
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll take that under consideration,
dialog: Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: On behalf of the defendants?
speaker_heading: BELINDA CONINE
dialog: Belinda Conine. Of Petersen,

dialog: You're outnumbered four to one.
dialog: (to the others)
dialog: Whom do I address?
dialog: I can't talk to four lawyers at
dialog: once.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: I'm chief litigator, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Fine. I've asked the litigants to be
dialog: present for this conference, in the
dialog: hope we can settle this matter
dialog: today, among ourselves... There is
dialog: nothing I hate more, than to see
dialog: lawyers suing each other. If you
dialog: look at the opinion polls, when Mr.
dialog: John Q. Citizen is asked to rank
dialog: professions according to the
dialog: respect he holds for them... Where
dialog: are the lawyers? Somewhere below
dialog: personal fitness trainers and only
text: slightly above child pornographers.
dialog: If we keep suing each other, if we
dialog: fail to settle the smallest
dialog: difference among ourselves with
dialog: mutual respect, if we continue to
dialog: scrap like bucks in heat, we'll
dialog: fall lower on that list. And when
dialog: people lose respect for lawyers,
dialog: they lose respect for the law. And
dialog: when this society loses all respect
dialog: for the law, we'll be murdered in
dialog: our beds, my friends, our cherished
dialog: institutions will be burned to the
dialog: ground and our children and our
dialog: grandchildren will live like
dialog: savages.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If it please Your Honor, we hope to
dialog: settle this matter.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: By God you will settle it! If you
dialog: force this case to trial, young man,
dialog: you'll regret it for the rest of
dialog: your natural-born days...
dialog: Now, Joseph. What would you
dialog: require to settle this matter
dialog: today?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Reinstatement at full salary.
dialog: Back pay covering the period of
dialog: unemployment and...
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Hold it, Joe.
dialog: (to Wheeler)
dialog: He wants to come back to work,
dialog: Chuck.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: That's impossible, Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: That's impossible, Joe.
speaker_heading: BELINDA CONINE
dialog: If it please Your Honor, we're
dialog: prepared to offer a cash
dialog: settlement of twenty-five
dialog: thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your generosity overwhelms me,
dialog: Belinda, considering my client
dialog: was earning over a hundred thou
dialog: when he was terminated almost six
dialog: months ago.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Give me a break, Joe. Let's cut
dialog: through these false attitudes.
dialog: Give them a figure. How much do
dialog: you want?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I want to go back to work, Your
dialog: Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: You're here at my indulgence,
dialog: young man. I'm waiting for a
dialog: figure, Joe.
text: Andrew and Joe confer with each other.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Based on what my client would
dialog: have earned over the next three
dialog: years, including benefits and
dialog: projected raises, and the
dialog: extraordinary cost of medical
dialog: care for someone with Acquired
dialog: Immune Deficiency Syndrome...
dialog: We would settle today for the
dialog: very fair amount of one million
dialog: five hundred thousand dollars.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda,
dialog: I've got a figure over here, of
dialog: one million, five. I...
text: Andrew WHISPERS to Joe, who interrupts the Judge:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: One more thing, Your Honor...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (jumping in)
dialog: Any settlement agreement must
dialog: include, and this is critical,
dialog: a letter of exoneration, making
dialog: clear my termination had nothing
dialog: to do with the quality of my work.
text: Charles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine.
speaker_heading: BELINDA CONINE
dialog: Your Honor, Mr. Beckett's
text: incompetence nearly sabotaged a
dialog: 350 million dollar suit.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I was the one who was sabotaged.
speaker_heading: BELINDA CONINE
dialog: We have complaints about Mr.
dialog: Beckett's lack of preparation,
dialog: his disorganization, his
dialog: arrogant, defensive attitude...
text: The list goes on.
speaker_heading: JEROME GREEN
dialog: We have letters.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Why haven't you produced these
dialog: letters?
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Take it easy.
dialog: (to Wheeler)
dialog: What's the big deal, Chuck? The
dialog: boy wants a letter, to show to
dialog: his mother, for her to keep after
dialog: he's gone. Why are you being hard-
dialog: assed about this?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: I wish I could exonerate you, Andy.
dialog: But I'd have to lie to do it.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (very calm)
dialog: You can save it for the jury,
dialog: Charles. I want to hear you say,
text: under oath, in front of a judge and
dialog: a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.
dialog: (rises)
dialog: Gentlemen.
dialog: (to Belinda)
dialog: Counselor.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Don't do this, Andy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Whoa, whoa...
dialog: (to Andrew)
dialog: What do you expect them to say,
dialog: you're Alan Dershowitz?
speaker_heading: KENTON
text: A trial takes time, Beckett. Do
dialog: you know what I'm saying?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I think I catch your subtle drift,
dialog: Walter.
text: Andrew saunters out.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: You'll be sorry, Beckett.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Andy, you don't want this.
text: Joe scans the room, all eyes are on him. His frown turns into
text: a grin. He faces the Judge.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: With all due respect, Your Honor,

dialog: constitutionally guaranteed

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Things might be said, at the

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What do you think, Jill?
speaker_heading: JILL
dialog: To be honest, I'm worried about

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thanks, Mom... Dad?
text: There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Supposedly, the Lord doesn't

dialog: hard time believing that these days.
text: Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears

speaker_heading: BUD (CONT.)
dialog: Andy, the way you've faced this

speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Hey. You're my kid brother, Andy.

speaker_heading: REVEREND JIM (CONT.)

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: You are presented with a simple
dialog: fact: Andrew Beckett was fired.
dialog: You will hear two explanations for
dialog: why he was fired. Ours. And
dialog: theirs...
text: Joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of...
text: ANDREW, whose appearance has changed: thinner, paler than we've
text: ever seen him, some blisters on his lips. But the most disturbing
text: thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a
text: much older man. He's taking notes (which he will do
text: relentlessly throughout the trial.) And he has a cane at his
dialog: side, which he'll use throughout the trial.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: It's up to you, to sift through

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: There are certain points in our
dialog: version, that I must prove to
dialog: you... Point number one: Andrew
dialog: Beckett was... is a brilliant
dialog: lawyer. A great lawyer. Point
dialog: number two. Andrew Beckett,
text: afflicted with a debilitating
dialog: disease, made the legal,
dialog: understandable, personal choice
dialog: to keep the fact of his illness
dialog: to himself... Point number three:
dialog: His employers discovered his
dialog: illness. And ladies and gentlemen,
dialog: the illness I'm referring to, is
dialog: AIDS...
text: Joe pauses, letting that sink in.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
text: Point number four. They panicked.
dialog: And, in their panic, they did what
dialog: most of us would like to do with
dialog: AIDS... Get it, and the people
dialog: who have it, as far away from us
dialog: as possible.
text: Joe walks away from Andrew.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: The behavior of Andrew Beckett's
dialog: employers may seem reasonable to
dialog: you. It does to me. After all, AIDS
dialog: is a deadly, incurable, disease...
text: CLOSE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: But however you come to judge the
dialog: behavior of Charles Wheeler and
dialog: his partners in moral, ethical,
dialog: human terms... When they fired
dialog: Andrew Beckett because he had
dialog: AIDS, they broke the law.
text: With a swift, direct glance at the Judge, Joe speaks with
dialog: considerable power and emotion:
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: And, when lawyers break the law,
dialog: when this society loses respect
dialog: for the law, when that day comes,
dialog: our cherished institutions will be

dialog: lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is
dialog: the victim of lies and deceit.
dialog: Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his
dialog: employers, going to great efforts
dialog: to conceal his disease from them.
dialog: Fact. He was successful in his
text: duplicity. The partners at Wyant
dialog: Wheeler did not know Andrew
dialog: Beckett had AIDS when they fired

text: Belinda pauses in front of the plaintiff's table
speaker_heading: BELINDA (CONT.)

speaker_heading: BELINDA (CONT.)
text: Fact. Andrew Beckett is dying.
text: Joe watches Andrew for his reaction.
speaker_heading: BELINDA (CONT.)
text: Fact. Andrew Beckett is angry.
dialog: Because his "lifestyle," his

dialog: wants someone to pay.

speaker_heading: LAIRD

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: LAIRD
dialog: We were satisfied.

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: LAIRD
dialog: We were satisfied.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Mr. Laird, when I approached you
dialog: about being a witness at this
dialog: trial, and you agreed, you gave
text: sworn testimony in a deposition.
dialog: Is that correct?
speaker_heading: LAIRD
dialog: That's correct.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: According to the deposition, you
dialog: said you were "thrilled, impressed,

dialog: Andrew Beckett's work. Do you
dialog: remember saying that?
speaker_heading: LAIRD
dialog: I may have said something like
dialog: that. But that's not how I feel at
dialog: this moment.
text: Joe takes on a street-tough tone:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to
dialog: me like I'm a four year old: Did
dialog: Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit
dialog: for you or not?
speaker_heading: LAIRD
dialog: We won.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Did that thrill, impress and
dialog: overwhelm you?
speaker_heading: LAIRD
dialog: It satisfied me.
text: Joe STARES at the guy.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It's a long way between being
text: overwhelmed and being satisfied.
dialog: A cheeseburger may be satisfying
dialog: whereas caviar and champagne and
dialog: roast duck and baked Alaska for
dialog: dessert might be considered
dialog: overwhelming. Do you agree?
speaker_heading: LAIRD
dialog: I might.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Five months ago you characterized

dialog: you're calling him a cheeseburger.
dialog: Your standards have shifted a
dialog: great deal, and I'd like to know

speaker_heading: JOE

speaker_heading: JOE

dialog: You had one guy "like that?"
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Yeah. But we took care of him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: How did you do that?
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: We stuck his head in the

scene_heading: JURORS. ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS.

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You taught him a lesson.
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: Yes, we did.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Like firing Andrew Beckett
dialog: taught him a lesson?
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll withdraw.
dialog: (moving on quickly)
dialog: You were aware, when you worked
dialog: with Maria Torres, that she had
dialog: AIDS, correct?
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: She didn't try to conceal it.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: So you are aware of the
dialog: difference between a lesion and
dialog: a bruise, is that correct?
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: I know the difference. That
dialog: doesn't mean I'm always able to
dialog: recognize the difference.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: But didn't you avoid contact
dialog: with Ms. Torres, after you found
dialog: out she had AIDS? She says you
dialog: acted repulsed by her and you
dialog: avoided her, is that correct?
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: I felt, and still feel, nothing
dialog: but the deepest sympathy and
dialog: compassion for people like
dialog: Maria, who have contracted this
dialog: terrible disease through no
dialog: fault of their own.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: MIGUEL

speaker_heading: (to the POLICEMAN)

speaker_heading: POLICEMAN
dialog: It's not a costume, I just got

speaker_heading: JOE

text: with him. He is no longer in costume.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: You survived your first gay
dialog: party intact.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Let me tell you something, okay?
dialog: When you're brought up, like the
dialog: rest of us, in a place like where
dialog: I was brought up, there's not a
dialog: whole lot of discussion about...
dialog: homosexuals.
dialog: As a kid, you're taught right away
dialog: that queers are weird, queers are
dialog: funny, they're a danger to kids,
dialog: they're afraid to fight, and they
dialog: all want to cop your joint. And
dialog: that pretty much sums up the
dialog: general thinking out there, if you
dialog: want to know the truth.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thank you for sharing that with me,
dialog: Joe.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Let's review these notes for your
dialog: testimony. We have a big day on
dialog: Monday.
text: Joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: When you refer to Wheeler, call him
dialog: Charles, to show how you'd been
dialog: admitted to the inner circle, you
dialog: were considered one of them.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (distracted)
dialog: Uh huh...
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: Beckett?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Charles. Okay. Miller?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Do you... pray?
text: Joe hesitates. They're having a personal conversation?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Yeah. Sure.
dialog: Joe goes back to the notes:
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: Then we establish how Wheeler's
dialog: boys recruited you after law
dialog: school...
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What have you prayed for?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: For a healthy baby. For Lisa to
dialog: make it through the delivery.
dialog: For the Phillies to get into the
dialog: playoffs.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (no self-pity)
dialog: There's a possibility I won't be
dialog: around for the end of this
dialog: trial.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I've considered that.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What happens?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: We proceed, representing your
dialog: estate.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I've made provisions in my will
dialog: for some charities. Miguel will
dialog: need a lawyer. I know it's not
dialog: your area...
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I know a good probate lawyer.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (a beat)
dialog: Do you like opera?
text: Andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Opera?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Want to hear my favorite aria?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Opera?
scene_heading: SUDDENLY, AN ARIA BY MARIA CALLAS FILLS THE ROOM --

speaker_heading: ANDREW
speaker_heading: (over the MUSIC)
dialog: Andrea Chenier, by Giordano.
dialog: This is Madeleine. She's
dialog: telling how, during the French
dialog: revolution, a mob set
text: fire to her house. Her mother
text: died, saving her.
dialog: "I look...
dialog: The place that cradled me was
dialog: burning!"
dialog: Do you hear the heartache in her
dialog: voice? Then, here come the
text: strings. Everything changes.
text: The music fills with hope.
dialog: Madeleine says...
text: Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV
text: at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: "It was during that sorrow that

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I think I'll... I told Lisa.
text: Andrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Right.
text: Andrew follows Joe to the door.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: (businesslike)

speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You're ready, don't worry.

text: And begins to weep.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT.
scene_heading: FADE IN: PANORAMIC SHOT OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS...
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

scene_heading: DIALOGUE OVERLAP AND DISSOLVE TO:
scene_heading: ANDREW ANSWERING A QUESTION AN HOUR OR SO LATER (INT./DAY).
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Wyant Wheeler had aggressively
dialog: recruited me. They were the
dialog: most prestigious firm in
dialog: Philadelphia, full of
dialog: opportunity. And I was
dialog: impressed by the partners.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Including Charles Wheeler?
text: (Andrew frequently wipes sweat from his forehead with a
text: handkerchief. His voice is hoarse, raspy.)
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Particularly, Charles.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON WHEELER.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What impressed you about him?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: He was... the kind of person I
dialog: thought I wanted to be.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What kind of person is that?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Possessed of an encyclopedic
dialog: knowledge of the law. A razor
dialog: sharp litigator, a genuine
dialog: leader, gifted at bringing out
dialog: the very best in others. An
dialog: awesome ability to illuminate
dialog: the most complex of legal
dialog: concepts to colleagues,
dialog: courtrooms, the person on the
dialog: street.
dialog: (a smile)
dialog: The kind of person
dialog: who plays three sets of tennis but
dialog: doesn't sweat. But underneath the
dialog: elegant surface, was an
dialog: adventurous spirit.
text: Belinda Conine MAKES A NOTE ABOUT THAT.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Obviously, at this time, you
dialog: weren't sick.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's possible I was infected with
dialog: the HIV virus at that time, but I
dialog: wasn't diagnosed until several years
dialog: later.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You didn't look then, the way you
dialog: look now?
text: REVERSE -- ON ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND, BUT NOW HE LOOKS
scene_heading: COMPLETELY DIFFERENT (The healthy. pre-AIDS Andrew.)
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No. I was thirty pounds heavier.
dialog: I was athletic.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: A regular all-American guy?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I suppose you could say that.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Except... you were gay?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I still am.
scene_heading: SPECTATORS CHUCKLE.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: In the years you worked at Wyant
dialog: Wheeler, did you ever tell
dialog: Charles Wheeler you were gay?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No. I didn't.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Can you explain why you didn't?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: You don't bring your personal
dialog: life into a law firm. You're
dialog: not supposed to have a personal
dialog: life, really. Anyway, I did
dialog: plan to tell Charles,
dialog: eventually. But then, this
dialog: thing happened at the tennis
dialog: club...

dialog: What do you call a woman who has

speaker_heading: SECOND MAN
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: FIRST MAN
dialog: A bitch who knows everything.
text: LAUGHTER. Andrew keeps his eyes closed, leaning against the

speaker_heading: CHARLES WHEELER
dialog: How does a faggot fake an orgasm?
text: Andrew opens one eye.
speaker_heading: CHARLES WHEELER (CONT.)
dialog: He spits on your back.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN

text: All the men LAUGH, and Wheeler LAUGHS THE HARDEST.
speaker_heading: JOE (VOICE OVER)
dialog: How did that make you feel?
scene_heading: IMAGE: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND (And
dialog: it's the sick, thin Andrew with AIDS).
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Relieved. That I'd never told
dialog: him I was gay. Very relieved.
text: ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER: shakes his head, a denial.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Are you a good lawyer?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm an excellent lawyer.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What makes you an excellent
dialog: lawyer?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I love the law. I know the law.
dialog: I excel at practicing it. It's
dialog: the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you love about it?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Well... many things. But I
dialog: think the thing I love the most,
dialog: is that every once in a while,
dialog: not that often, but
dialog: occasionally... you get to be
text: part of justice being done.
dialog: It's really quite a thrill when
dialog: that happens.

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Something like that.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Do you take risks?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: In my work? Yes. Calculated
dialog: risks. You have to.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: In general. Do you take risks
dialog: in other areas of your life?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Not unnecessary ones.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Have you ever been to the Apollo

scene_heading: BACK TO THE COURTROOM (INT./DAY):
text: Joe sits with a stone-sober expression: this isn't easy.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: When? Approximately what year did
dialog: this event take place?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I guess it was 1984, 85.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Were you aware in 1984 or 1985
dialog: that there was a fatal disease
dialog: out there, called AIDS, and that
dialog: you could contract it through
dialog: sexual activity?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: It's impossible to know exactly
dialog: when or how I was infected with HIV.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: But you were having anonymous
dialog: sex in porno theaters in 1984
dialog: and 1985?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That happened once. People
dialog: weren't talking about AIDS then,
dialog: the way we are now. Or safe
dialog: sex.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'd heard of something. The gay
dialog: plague, gay cancer, but... we
dialog: didn't know how you could get it,

dialog: could to make sure no one knew
dialog: you were an active homosexual,
dialog: correct?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That is not correct. I never lied
dialog: about it.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Did you keep a picture of your
dialog: lover on your desk?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No.

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Some do. I didn't.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: As a homosexual, one is often forced
dialog: to conceal one's sexuality, is
dialog: that right?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: In some situations.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Isn't it true you have spent your
dialog: life pretending to be something
dialog: you're not, so much so that the
dialog: art of concealment and dishonesty
dialog: has become second nature to you?!
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Objection!
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett?
dialog: Were you living with Miguel

dialog: had your anonymous sexual encounter
dialog: in the porn theater?
text: ANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: You could have infected him, isn't
dialog: that right?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Miguel has not been infected. As
dialog: I said, we weren't aware of AIDS,
dialog: then, or how it is spread.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes.
text: Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: You've testified the lesions on
dialog: your face were visible to the
dialog: people you worked with, correct?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: That's right.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: And it's your contention, that
dialog: when the partners were made
dialog: aware of the lesions, they
dialog: jumped to the conclusion you had
dialog: AIDS and fired you.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Absolutely.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Do you have any lesions on your
dialog: face at this time?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: One. Here, in front of my ear.
text: An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it

text: Answering truthfully.

speaker_heading: ANDREW

speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: No. I can't really see it.

speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: Do you have any lesions on any

dialog: that resemble the lesions that
dialog: were on your face at the time
dialog: you were fired?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Yes. On my torso.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: If it please the court, I'd like
dialog: to ask Mr. Beckett to
dialog: remove his shirt, so that the
dialog: jury can have an accurate idea
dialog: of what we're talking about.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: We object, Your Honor. It would
dialog: unfairly influence the jury.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was
dialog: forced by his illness to use a
dialog: wheelchair, would the defense
dialog: ask him to park it outside?
dialog: We're talking about AIDS, we're
dialog: talking about lesions. Let's
dialog: see what we're talking about.
scene_heading: ANGLE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY -- LOOKING APPREHENSIVE.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: (a moment, then)

speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: (venomous)
dialog: What's the point, Bob?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: (calm)

dialog: that, too.
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: (weary)
dialog: Charles...
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: If you feel differently, Bob, you
dialog: should say so, when you're called
dialog: to the stand. After all, this
dialog: isn't a conspiracy.
text: Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the
text: high-ceilinged corridor.
text: Belinda hesitates, before re-grouping with Wheeler and the
text: rest, casting a curious glance toward Bob Seidman.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM CHARLES WHEELER -- ON THE STAND...
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett
dialog: to your firm?
text: Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate.
text: Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: If you're the owner of a major
dialog: league ball club, you recruit the
dialog: hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously
text: promising as a young attorney.
dialog: That's why we went after him,
dialog: that's why we hired him, and
dialog: that's why we stuck with him,
dialog: year after year... waiting for
dialog: the promise to be fulfilled. But
dialog: it never was.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: You kept giving him another chance?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Of course we did. When you've
dialog: groomed someone they way we groomed
text: Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all
dialog: kinds of special treatment on him...
dialog: you've made quite an investment.
dialog: We were waiting for his promise to
dialog: kick in, and deliver. But,
dialog: ultimately, we could no longer
dialog: ignore the gap between the promise
dialog: and the reality... This is one of
dialog: the saddest times in my life. To
dialog: sit in this court, testifying to
dialog: Andy's ultimate failure to make
text: the grade. To discover that he is
dialog: one of those people who wants to
dialog: benefit by the system, but doesn't
dialog: want to play by the system's
dialog: rules. To think you know someone,
dialog: only to find out... you don't know
text: them at all. It's heartbreaking.
speaker_heading: BELINDA
dialog: Thank you. That's all for now,
dialog: Your Honor.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Mr. Miller?
text: Joe rises. Adjusts his jacket. Wheeler waits.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (very gentle)
dialog: Explain to me, if you can, Mr.
dialog: Wheeler, explain this to me like
dialog: I'm a ten year-old. This trial is
dialog: not about a disease, is that what
dialog: you're saying? Not about your
dialog: understandable, if unfounded, fear
dialog: of catching AIDS through casual
dialog: contact with someone who has it?
dialog: You're saying, this trial is about
dialog: Andrew Beckett's character. Am I
dialog: getting this right?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Yes, character. To the extent that it
dialog: affects a person's ability to do
dialog: a great job.
text: Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing
text: difficult. He takes in the rest of the court, while
text: Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH THE AIR...
speaker_heading: WHEELER (CONT.)
dialog: Andy worked when he wanted to work,
dialog: telling us what he thought we
dialog: needed to know about his
dialog: lifestyle...
text: ANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel
text: begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get
text: the feeling she's giving her testimony).
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: I didn't mind covering for Andy,
dialog: but I did wonder... when was he
dialog: planning to deal with his problem?
text: Andrew blinks... what's going on?
text: Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler.
text: Everything seems normal.
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: Sometimes it seems like society
dialog: is run by these kinds of people.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What kind of people?
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: People who want to bend the rules...
scene_heading: ANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table:
speaker_heading: KILLCOYNE
dialog: If you want to be a leader in this
dialog: society, you have to make
dialog: certain sacrifices.
dialog: Wheeler keeps speaking:
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: ... to suit their personal desires,
dialog: and the rest of us have to live
dialog: with it.
scene_heading: ANDREW'S POV -- WALTER KENTON:
speaker_heading: KENTON
dialog: You have to make a decision: is
dialog: this guy partner material?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler?
dialog: You?
scene_heading: ANDREW'S POV -- BOB SEIDMAN:
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: Yes, I did see the lesions. I
dialog: suspected he was sick...
text: CLOSE ON ANDREW: closing his eyes.
text: THE VOICES GET LOUDER, FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER:
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: The everyday, common person with
dialog: decent values...
speaker_heading: RACHEL
dialog: It seems like he wasn't willing to
dialog: face the reality of his situation...
text: Andrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER:
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: I didn't tell the others, I
dialog: was afraid to...
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: ... But now, we're standing up for
dialog: ourselves...
speaker_heading: SEIDMAN
dialog: ... But we shouldn't have fired
dialog: him...
speaker_heading: WHEELER
dialog: ... It's time to get this society
dialog: back on track!
text: Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV:
text: The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned.
text: ANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor.
text: Andrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion.
text: He lies on the floor, looking up.
text: ANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Could you call an ambulance,
dialog: please?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: A CRISIS IN A HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./DAY) ... MEDICAL STAFF
text: working frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS
text: HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The
text: tube they're trying to put in place seems to be making
dialog: matters worse.
text: Miguel stands to the side, furious:
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: It's making it worse. Take it
dialog: out. Take it out!
text: Dr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes,
text: obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries
text: assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and
text: Andrew GASPS for breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over
text: Andrew's face and he drinks in the air. His eyes are wide
text: open with fear, sweat covering his face.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: PHILADELPHIA CITY HALL, A BUSINESS DAY (EXT./DAY).
dialog: TITLE: "Two weeks later."
speaker_heading: LESBIAN JUROR (VO)
dialog: If he was "mediocre," why did
dialog: they gave him this major
dialog: assignment three weeks before
dialog: they fired him?
speaker_heading: POSTAL WORKER JUROR (VO)
dialog: They were testing him.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: JURORS SITTING AROUND A LONG TABLE IN A ROOM WITH TALL,
text: grimy windows (INT./DAY) ...
dialog: TITLE: "Jury deliberations."
speaker_heading: WAITRESS JUROR
dialog: They wanted to see if he'd rise
dialog: to the challenge.
text: An American flag hangs on the wall.
scene_heading: SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR
dialog: They wanted to give him a final
dialog: chance.
scene_heading: POSTAL WORKER JUROR
dialog: Makes sense.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN JUROR
dialog: I'd still love to know what
dialog: happened to that missing file.
speaker_heading: HOMEMAKER JUROR
dialog: Wouldn't we all?
scene_heading: POSTAL WORKER JUROR
dialog: Ask the computer.
scene_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT JUROR
dialog: They say he wasn't competent. But,
dialog: you heard him on the stand.
scene_heading: ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
dialog: He sounded pretty smart to me.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN JUROR
dialog: Why would they fire him? Why
dialog: not a medical leave, or...
scene_heading: COLLEGE STUDENT JUROR
dialog: They freaked out over the AIDS.
scene_heading: SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR
dialog: They hate homosexuals.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN JUROR
dialog: It's not against the law to
dialog: disapprove of homosexuals.
speaker_heading: LESBIAN JUROR
dialog: It is against the law to fire someone
dialog: for having AIDS. That's why we're
dialog: here.
speaker_heading: BUSINESSMAN JUROR
dialog: You're the foreman. You haven't said
dialog: anything. What do you think?
text: ANGLE ON -- THE MARINE, sitting at the head of the table.
text: CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY ON HIM:
speaker_heading: MARINE JUROR
dialog: They're saying he wasn't a good
dialog: lawyer. He was mediocre. And the
dialog: fact that they gave him the most
dialog: important lawsuit they'd ever had,
dialog: for one of their most important
dialog: clients... they say that doesn't
dialog: prove anything, because that was
dialog: just a test. What did they call
dialog: it? A carrot. To see if he'd rise
dialog: to the occasion... Okay... Say
dialog: I've got to send a pilot into
dialog: enemy territory, and he's gonna
dialog: be flying a plane that cost 350
dialog: million dollars...
dialog: Who am I going to put into that
dialog: plane? A rookie who can't cut the
dialog: grade, because I want to see if
dialog: he'll rise to the challenge? Or am
dialog: I going to give that assignment to
dialog: my best pilot, my most experienced,
dialog: my sharpest, my top gun... The very
dialog: best I've got?
scene_heading: CLOSE ON THE MARINE:
speaker_heading: MARINE JUROR (CONT.)
dialog: Could somebody please explain that
dialog: to me... like I'm a six year old?
text: HOLD ON THE MARINE, AS THE JUDGE'S VOICE FADES IN:
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT (VO)
dialog: Members of the jury, have you
dialog: reached a verdict?
dialog: AND CUT TO:
scene_heading: THE COURTROOM -- NO ONE STIRRING (INT./DAY).
text: Joe is utterly cool. Sitting beside Andrew's empty chair.
text: Among the spectators, Andrew's siblings, Jill, Matt, Randy, and
text: his parents, Bud and Sarah... Rachel, Anthea and Miguel's
dialog: sister Maria.
text: The Marine rises to his feet.
speaker_heading: MARINE
dialog: We have, Your Honor...
text: Charles Wheeler looks the Marine in the eye.
speaker_heading: MARINE (CONT.)
dialog: We find for the plaintiff,
dialog: Andrew Beckett.
text: Joe smiles, just barely, remaining calm.
text: Charles Wheeler whispers to Belinda Conine.
speaker_heading: JUDGE GARNETT
dialog: Have you awarded any damages?
speaker_heading: MARINE
dialog: Yes, we have, Your Honor.
dialog: (referring to a list)
dialog: For back pay and loss of benefits
dialog: ... one hundred fortythree
dialog: thousand dollars.
text: Joe shakes his head, disappointed, writing down the amount.
text: Wheeler and his crew SMILE -- THIS IS THEIR VICTORY.
speaker_heading: MARINE JUROR (CONT.)
dialog: For damages related to mental
dialog: anguish and humiliation... we give
dialog: no award.
text: Joe is extremely disappointed.
speaker_heading: MARINE JUROR (CONT.)
dialog: And punitive damages we award...
dialog: Four million, eight hundred and
dialog: eighty two thousand dollars.
text: Joe throws his pen over his shoulder.
text: COURTROOM BURSTS INTO AN UPROAR.
text: Andrew's supporters, Joe's colleagues from his office rush
text: forward, pounding him on the back. Andrew's family members
dialog: hug each other...
text: CAMERA CRANES AWAY FROM THIS GROUP, RISING TOWARD THE
text: CEILING AS THE SOUNDS OF THE CROWD FADE...
text: OPERA MUSIC FADES IN, TAKING US TO...
text: ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING... JOE STEPPING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF
text: a hospital (INT./NIGHT), carrying two shopping bags from the
dialog: Famous 4th Street deli...
text: Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room.
text: Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low
text: voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them,
text: entering Andrew's room, he hears:
speaker_heading: DR. GILLMAN
dialog: ... if he comes out of the
dialog: hospital this time, you mustn't
dialog: expect him to be like he was
dialog: before...
text: Joe steps into...
scene_heading: ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ...
text: A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed:
dialog: "Victory."
text: OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a
text: hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face.
text: JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand,
text: smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free
text: hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an
text: amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various
dialog: parts of his body.)
text: Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV.
text: JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while
text: Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering
text: the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it.
text: As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags
text: from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.
text: People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and
text: happiness evident in the room.
text: ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling
text: eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.
text: ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.
text: Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he
dialog: wants Joe to sit there.
text: Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.
text: With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His
text: voice is raspy, weak:
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: What do you call a thousand lawyers
text: chained together at the bottom of the
dialog: ocean?
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: A good start.
text: Joe smiles.
speaker_heading: ANDREW (CONT.)
dialog: Excellent work, Joe. I thank
dialog: you.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: It was good working with you, Andrew.
dialog: You're welcome.
dialog: (sees the oxygen mask)
dialog: Hey. Shouldn't you put
dialog: that thing back on?
text: Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are
text: weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears.
speaker_heading: JOE (CONT.)
dialog: I better get home. Lisa and I
dialog: are having some friends over.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (muffled by the mask)
dialog: Sure thing.
text: Joe stands.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: I'll see you, Beckett.
text: Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes
dialog: are dancing.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (through mask)
dialog: Thanks for coming by.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: You bet. We'll see you later.
text: Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: (to Miguel)
dialog: He's looking good. I wouldn't
dialog: be surprised if he gets out of
dialog: here soon.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: We just want to get him home.
dialog: Thanks for stopping by, Joe.
text: Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps
text: Miguel's back.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Night.
text: Joe leaves.
text: Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying:
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: He's tired. He ought to sleep.
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
scene_heading: JOE STEPPING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT), AND
text: saying to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES:
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: What do you call a thousand

dialog: the bottom of the ocean?
text: The elevator doors close.
scene_heading: CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
scene_heading: ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM...
text: Matt gives Andrew's hand a squeeze, before leaving.
speaker_heading: MATT
dialog: Night, Andy. See you tomorrow,
dialog: buddy.
text: Rev. Jim pats Andrew's shoulder.
speaker_heading: REV. JIM
dialog: God bless you, Andy.
text: Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek.
speaker_heading: BUD
dialog: Goodnight, son.
dialog: Get some rest, okay?
text: Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead.
speaker_heading: SARAH
dialog: Goodnight angel, my sweet boy...
text: Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug
text: his brother. He begins to sob.
speaker_heading: RANDY
dialog: Andy.
text: Andrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected,
text: around his brother Randy, to comfort him.
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: (through mask)
dialog: I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow.
text: Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room.
text: Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door.
text: Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes.
text: Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the
text: remote control, and TURNS ON THE TV.
text: Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say:
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: I'm ready...
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: Ready for what, baby?
speaker_heading: ANDREW
dialog: Whatever.
speaker_heading: MIGUEL
dialog: I hope you're ready for "Studs,"
dialog: because that's what's on.
text: Andrew replaces the oxygen mask.
text: They lie next to each other, watching television.
speaker_heading: FADE OUT/FADE IN:
text: EXTERIOR: JOE'S HOUSE AT NIGHT, ESTABLISHING...
text: From inside the house: the phone rings.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
scene_heading: JOE AND LISA'S DARK BEDROOM, QUIET (INT./NIGHT) ...
text: Lisa is sitting up in bed, having answered the phone.
text: Joe is just waking up.
speaker_heading: LISA
dialog: (to Joe)
dialog: It's Miguel.
text: Joe sits bolt upright.
speaker_heading: JOE
dialog: Miguel?
speaker_heading: CUT TO:

text: A TAXI ARRIVES and an elegant, well-dressed older COUPLE
dialog: step out.
speaker_heading: CUT TO:
text: RACHEL OPENS THE DOOR OF THE LOFT, FINDING MIGUEL'S FAMILY
text: on the other side: very dignified, handsome people who have
text: just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where...
text: A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories
text: about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying
text: as they hug each other.
text: Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew
dialog: at various stages of his life, and things that meant something
text: to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his
dialog: favorite cat, etc.
text: THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the
dialog: music ("You're Miguel's parents?" "Do you remember when
dialog: Andy..." "I went to college with Andy..." etc.)
text: Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet.
text: Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises,
text: extending his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his
text: head in sadness, reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for
text: an embrace.
text: CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEMING TO SEARCH FOR
text: SOMETHING...
text: CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND
text: WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone...
text: AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the
text: images are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video...
text: THE HOME MOVIES FEATURE a bright-eyed LITTLE BOY...
dialog: Andrew...
text: Riding a bike with training wheels...
text: Swinging wildly at a wiffle ball...
text: AS CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE TV, PARTY SOUNDS AND THEME MUSIC
text: FADES... People are still talking, still laughing, still
dialog: crying, but we CAN'T HEAR THEM ANY LONGER. Instead...
text: We hear only the SOUNDTRACK from the HOME MOVIES...
text: Andrew SHOUTING GLEEFULLY as he chases a new puppy...
text: Andrew SQUEALING as he jumps into a tiny swimming pool...
text: Andrew on a swing, going higher and higher...
text: And laughing.
text: FADE TO BLACK.
