speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Everyone's got that one summer when
dialog: they were a kid... a summer so perfect
dialog: that it stays with them forever. It
text: stays caught in time, like Camelot.
dialog: pause That summer is like a book with
dialog: a million blank pages that you get to
dialog: fill with the greatest story you could
dialog: ever dream up.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: This is a story about a legend. And
dialog: for us, that summer was the one when
dialog: the legend got made.

text: of that green "tropical-look" privacy fiberglass lashed to
dialog: the fence.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: remains undercover, but he's bustin' to join in.
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: never notices him. As they work:
speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: Fifth grade's history, man. A hundred
dialog: days, man. A Hundred days of baseball.
dialog: All Day, everyday, as much as we can.
dialog: That's the best.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: We got all summer.
speaker_heading: REPEAT
dialog: We got all summer.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Let's play.
speaker_heading: YEAH-YEAH
dialog: Yeah-Yeah... let's play.
text: The guys round up in the infield. As they play catch, they

dialog: little diamond; scrappy, happy kids.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK
dialog: Tract homes - everybody's got a different thing going in the

speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Everyone but the Timmons twins lived

text: FROM HIS DRIVEWAY

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
text: They lived in a house by the sandlot

scene_heading: FROM BENNY'S PORCH
text: Benny is the last to go in. He sees Scotty watching. So, he

speaker_heading: THE BLOCK
text: clears to empty. The street lamps arc on, drawing soft white

speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Even before I knew any of them I envied

scene_heading: INT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT

speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: When I moved in that summer, I'd never
dialog: played baseball, but it wasn't too
dialog: tough figuring out who these guys'
dialog: heroes were. So, after a week of
dialog: watching... I figured baseball seemed
dialog: like the best way to get in with them.
speaker_heading: BENNY 'S

text: Jr. Chemistry set. Heath Kit gadgets. An unbelievable
text: Set contraption with little motors and stuff. An autographed

dialog: bothered and unhappy. This stuff is too damn easy for him.
text: He whips on a last bolt and connects the itty-bitty motor.
speaker_heading: SWITCHES ON
speaker_heading: THE CONTRAPTION
text: a tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble. Drops it on
text: a roller coaster track. The marble whips around corners and

speaker_heading: THE MARBLE

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
speaker_heading: (FEELING LOW)
dialog: I know - but it's just nighttime.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Scotty, have you made any friends yet?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: No
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Why not, honey?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: "Cause I'm still "new."
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Honey, I don't want you sitting in

dialog: the one before that.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Scotty, look at me. I know you're

dialog: play.
text: She sits across from him, trying to get through.
dialog: 10
speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: I want you to get out in the fresh air

dialog: your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees
dialog: and hop fences. Get in trouble for
text: crying out loud.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Not too much, but some. You have my
dialog: permission. Now how many mothers do
dialog: you think say that to their sons?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: None mothers I guess.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: I want you to make friends this summer
dialog: Scotty. Lots of them.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I know, but I don't - I'm no good at
dialog: anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an
speaker_heading: EGGHEAD -
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: - and you'll always be just an egghead
dialog: with an attitude like that. So promise
dialog: me, alright?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: "Kay.
speaker_heading: MOM

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Yeah, maybe tomorrow.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Mom? Do you think Bill - I mean Dad -

speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Are you kidding, he'd love it, you

scene_heading: INT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

dialog: 11
scene_heading: INT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
text: Scotty peeks through a slightly open door. BILL moves around
text: inside, unpacking boxes. Scotty reaches to knock. Stops.
text: Almost walks away. Then musters the gumption. KNOCKS.
speaker_heading: BILL (0.S.)
dialog: Yeah...
text: Scotty takes a few cautious steps into...
scene_heading: INT. BILL'S DEN - NIGHT
text: ...a trophy room. Ribbons, plaques, trophies. Bill must've
text: been some athlete; but he limps now. Scotty lingers...
dialog: gathering more courage.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: My real dad died when I was just a
dialog: little kid. My mom married Bill a
dialog: year before we moved to the
dialog: neighborhood.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: At the time, he and I were still getting
dialog: used to each other.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Um, Dad - sorry, I mean Bill, remember
dialog: you promised you'd teach me to play
dialog: catch?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Um hum...
text: He dusts a batting trophy.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Well, could you teach me?
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Sure.
text: He places a pitching plaque. Scotty waits awkwardly. Waits
dialog: for more words. They don't come.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Okay. Great. Thanks.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: Um hum.
text: Scotty leaves, bringing the door with him on his way out.
text: Through the cracked portal he sees Bill set a silver
dialog: pedestal
text: on the main shelf. On this he sets a baseball...
dialog: 12
dialog: just a baseball.
scene_heading: INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
text: Scotty wakes up. Checks his (Theme) clock. 8:30. He bolts
text: out of bed. Dashes through the house to the front door.
text: Throws it open and runs down to...
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: ...the sidewalk. Fan sprinklers water all the lawns. Way
dialog: far down the block
speaker_heading: HE GLIMPSES
text: Ham, at the HELMS BAKERY TRUCK, buying a donut, then
text: scrambling
text: around the far corner.
speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: Hey-hey, come on! Wait up - wait up!
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: panics. Runs back inside and...
scene_heading: INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - DAY
text: ...strips off his cowboy pj's. Redresses. Digs through his
speaker_heading: CLOSET
text: finding a vinyl, "toy" baseball glove. It's still in the
dialog: package, with a note attached: "To Scotty Boy - Love,
dialog: Grandma!"
text: It's all he's got. He shovels through a pair of Mickey Mouse
text: ears - a cowboy hat - finds the closest thing he's got to a

dialog: embroidered trout.
dialog: emerging
speaker_heading: sandlot
scene_heading: EXT. ENROUTE TO THE SANDLOT - DAY

speaker_heading: A 5 & DIME
speaker_heading: A BOYS CLUB
text: A LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD,
text: where he slows momentarily, envious of the crisply uniformed
dialog: kids... wow. Moving on down
scene_heading: EXT. THE BLOCK OF SANDLOT COMMON HOUSES - DAY
text: whose backyards we already know. Scotty flat out stops at
dialog: 13
speaker_heading: THE HOUSE
text: with the fiberglass panels out back. Scary place.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
text: Scotty slips quietly through the secret fence doorway,
speaker_heading: IN
speaker_heading: DEEP LEFT FIELD
text: where he hugs the perimeter, moving slowly toward the
text: common houses. Winded, Scotty finds
speaker_heading: THE GANG'S
text: already playing "over the line."
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: They never kept score. They never
dialog: chose sides. They never even really
dialog: stopped playing the game... it just
dialog: went on forever. Everyday they picked
dialog: up right where they left off the day
dialog: before. It was an endless "dream game."
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: There was only 8 of them, so they didn't
dialog: have a whole team. It didn't matter
dialog: though... Benny was so good he took
dialog: everyone's position when it was there
dialog: ups.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I didn't know any of that then... I
dialog: just knew they were having the time of
dialog: their lives and I wanted to be a part
dialog: of it.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: watches and listens (as he goes) to the SHARP, satisfying
text: sound of the hardball, SNAPPING CLEANLY in the oily leather
dialog: of their gloves.
speaker_heading: HE LOOKS AT
dialog: his own toy glove... how embarrassing.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: continues around the perimeter, trying to be seen and become
text: invisible. He goes unwittingly CLOSER TO those green
text: fiberglass panels.
dialog: 14
speaker_heading: DENUNEZ
text: winds up and pitches to
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: who connects big. CRACK!
speaker_heading: SCOTTY'S
text: come too close to the green fence. Something has overcome
text: him... fear! He stares with serious woollies at
text: A HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS
text: and sees only dust rising in time with some great, SOUNDS OF
text: EXHALATION. And then, before he can draw any conclusions...
dialog: disaster.
speaker_heading: GANG (0.S.)
dialog: Hey! Look out!
dialog: ducks...
dialog: of
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: whips a look up and sees
speaker_heading: THE FLY BALL
text: coming right at him.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: tracks it, frozen stiff. Scared shitless. At the past
text: possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and
dialog: social suicide.
speaker_heading: THE BALL
text: beans him at the glove covering his noggin.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: hits his butt. The ball rolls a bit. Comes to an "I-dare-
dialog: you" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels
text: that preternatural fence. Scotty pulls his arms away from
text: his face.
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: LAUGHS uproariously.
speaker_heading: TIMMY
dialog: Nice catch!
dialog: 15
speaker_heading: REPEAT
dialog: Nice catch!
speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: Hey! Throw the ball back!
speaker_heading: YEAH-YEAH
dialog: Yeah-yeah, hurry up!
speaker_heading: BERTRAM
dialog: We gotta a game here, man!
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: moves for the ball. As he goes, he sweats:
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: "Kay, I'll get it!
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: Don't be a goofus - don't be a goofus -
dialog: don't be a goofus.
text: He reaches the fence and the ball and stops. It's hard to
text: move. The force emanating from the backyard has got him:
text: DUST THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS
text: keeps perfect time with the monster-breathing.
scene_heading: AN OLENADER BUSH
text: moves. It scares the living kapok out of
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: who snatches up the ball and back-pedals 10 feet.
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: WE'RE WAITING...
text: He throws back the ball. And his chances of getting in with
dialog: these guys are over. Because Scotty... throws like a girl!
speaker_heading: THE BALL
text: droops forward in the air. Lands 6 feet from him. Rolls
text: slowly up to the gang, finally coming to a dainty stop at
text: DeNunez' feet.
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: looks from the ball to Scotty... they CRACK UP!
dialog: 16
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: walks away... crying.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
speaker_heading: (TO HIMSELF)
dialog: My life is over.
speaker_heading: BENNY
text: is the only one that isn't laughing. He stares the others
dialog: down.
speaker_heading: DENUNEZ
dialog: Come on, Benny-man, didn't you see
dialog: that throw?
text: He imitates it, "flipping" his glove to Ham. The gang BUSTS
text: UP again.
speaker_heading: HAM
speaker_heading: (TRULY STUNNED)
dialog: That kid's got the gaw'damn panty-
dialog: waistiest arm I ever saw in my whole
dialog: life.
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: I seen a guy once that threw like that.
dialog: I mean not that bad, but at least so
dialog: bad that he hadda move in the fourth
dialog: grade 'cause they nicknamed him
dialog: "Bloomers."
text: Benny's look stifles the bunch.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: I bet not one of you knows how The
dialog: Babe got his nickname.
speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: Easy, 'cause of the way he looked like
text: a little kid face.
speaker_heading: BERTRAM
dialog: Bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids
dialog: and stuff.
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: Wrong. The Babe was called The Babe,
dialog: because he was like the child of Yankee
dialog: Stadium.
dialog: 17
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: I knew it. You're all full of crap.
dialog: George Herman Ruth got his nickname
dialog: because his mom died when he was just
dialog: a little kid, and he hadda go live in
dialog: an orphanage.
text: Silence. None of the other guys has heard this before.
speaker_heading: BENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Nobody liked him there. The bigger
dialog: guys picked on him all the time. And
dialog: when they messed with him he couldn't
dialog: fight back, 'cause he was just... like
dialog: scared. So when they messed with him,
dialog: he cried about it.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: He cried... so they called him The
dialog: Babe.
dialog: This hits home real good.
speaker_heading: BENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: How ya think that kid just felt?
text: Benny exits the sandlot, leaving the others with a lesson
dialog: learned.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: Everyone knew Benny was different.
dialog: Nobody ever voted or anything, but he
dialog: was the leader.
scene_heading: EXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK
text: As Benny goes into his house, the other's round the corner
text: far behind him.
speaker_heading: THE MOON
text: is up. Full. Like a big baseball.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR

dialog: pickle.
dialog: Scotty
dialog: When they'd all tried out for youth
dialog: league, they'd all made it. But when
dialog: they found out they'd have to play on

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Here.

speaker_heading: SCOTTY (CONT'D)

speaker_heading: BILL

speaker_heading: (STUNNED)
dialog: Smalls, you mean to tell me you went
text: home and swiped a ball that was signed

speaker_heading: REPEAT
dialog: And actually played with it?!
dialog: 76
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Yeah, but I was gonna put it back.
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: But it was signed by Babe Ruth!
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Well, who is she?!
speaker_heading: HAM

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: (that did it)
dialog: OH, MY GOD! THAT'S THE SAME GUY?!
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest
dialog: baseball player that ever lived. People
dialog: say he was less than a God, but more
dialog: than a man. Ya know... like Hercules
dialog: or somethin'.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: The ball that you just aced to The
dialog: Beast is worth... well, more than your
dialog: whole life.
text: Scotty falls to his knees. Grabs his stomach.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I don't feel so good.

dialog: 77
speaker_heading: SCOTTY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (HEARTFELT)
dialog: We gotta get that ball back.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: When does your old man get home from

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: He's gone on business for a week.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Okay, we need 98 cents. So, everybody
text: spread out and find some soda bottles

speaker_heading: CUT TO:

speaker_heading: DENUNEZ
dialog: I dunno, Benny-man.
speaker_heading: YEAH-YEAH
dialog: Yeah-yeah, it's pretty crappy.
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: He ain't gonna buy that, Benny. It

speaker_heading: BENNY
text: It doesn't matter what it looks like.

speaker_heading: CcuT TO:
scene_heading: INT. BILL'S DEN - DAY
text: Scotty's HAND ENTERS FRAME. Little anxious FINGERS wrapped

speaker_heading: MOM (0.S.)
dialog: Scotty?
speaker_heading: DEN
text: Scotty whips 'round like he's been slapped by a wet mackerel

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Huh?!
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Honey, what are you doing in here?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Ah... just looking at Bill's - I mean
dialog: Dad's baseball.
text: Scotty hurries away from the "autographed" ball.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: You know he doesn't like you touching

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: Has he ever told you about that ball?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Uh - no, not really, I don't think so -
dialog: no, he hasn't at all - I don't know
dialog: _anything_ about it.
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It's signed by Babe Ruth...

speaker_heading: MOM (CONT'D)
dialog: ...the greatest baseball player that
dialog: ever lived.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Um... really?
speaker_heading: MOM
dialog: It sure is. Dad's father gave it to

dialog: you.
dialog: 79
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
speaker_heading: (DAZED)
dialog: Uh... neat.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: It was salt in an open wound. Even my

dialog: knew who Babe Ruth was.
scene_heading: INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY
dialog: The gang's all here. Big plans. War conference.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: So, how do we get it back?
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: I have no idea.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: I was dead meat. I knew it. They
dialog: knew it. We had thought that those
dialog: cards Benny had gotten meant that
dialog: something great was going to happen.
dialog: Now I figured that they'd just meant
dialog: my life was over.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Can't we just hop the fence and get
dialog: it?
speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: Remember Davy Stodenrous.
speaker_heading: TIMMY/REPEAT
dialog: Poor Toad.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Oh, yeah. I forgot.
speaker_heading: (A THOUGHT)
dialog: Hey? Why don't we just go over there
dialog: and knock on the door, and ask Mr.
dialog: Mertle to get it for us?
text: Everyone looks at Scotty - the kid just sprouted a dunce

speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: Are you outta your mind?! Mr. Mertle
dialog: is the meanest old man that ever lived!
dialog: He's the one that sicked The Beast on
dialog: The Toad!
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: That's not an option, Smalls. Forget

dialog: 80
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Oh. Okay. I will.

speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: We need to assess the situation!
speaker_heading: GANG
dialog: (better than nothing)
dialog: Of course! Right! Good one, Squints!
dialog: Access (sic) the situation! Okay!
speaker_heading: BERTRAM
dialog: Um, Squints? How do we do that?
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: First we survey the enemy's environment,

dialog: terrain.
speaker_heading: HAM
dialog: What?...
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
speaker_heading: (COPPING)
dialog: I heard that on "Combat." Let's just
text: look out the window.

text: The house is a godforsaken stucco'd corpse.
speaker_heading: THE YARD

text: hundreds of little empty craters - that used to cradle
dialog: baseballs.
scene_heading: THE RUSTY TOW CHAIN

speaker_heading: GANG
speaker_heading: (REVERENT)
speaker_heading: SOUNDS
dialog: Poor Toad.
speaker_heading: HAM

speaker_heading: BERTRAM
dialog: Think he's pissed?
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Is Doby Gillis a dork? Anybody got
dialog: any bright ideas?
text: THE BIG MONTAGE STARTS WITH:
text: A tree house debate. Much shouting. Much disagreement.
text: Many hands miming mechanical contraptions.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: We had absolutely no idea what the
dialog: hell we were gonna do. So things
text: started primitively.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY
text: The gang hurries out from the Timmons' yard carrying a broom
text: stick. They wriggle it under the fiberglass fence. Squints
text: peers through the peep hole motioning directions to Ham.
text: Suddenly - SNAP! Ham pulls the stick back. 'Tis toothpick'd.
dialog: 82
scene_heading: EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY
text: The guys fell the clothes line pole with a hack saw. 6 feet
text: of inch thick pipe. They heft it up - go out to
scene_heading: EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY
text: and shove the pipe under the green fiberglass. HORRIBLE
text: ERUPT from the Badlands. Dust mushrooms over the fence. The
text: pipe draws under in FEROCIOUS JERKS. Gone. Moments. The

scene_heading: INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY
text: Bertram arrives. Hands "it" over. How embarrassing:
speaker_heading: BERTRAM

scene_heading: INT./EXT. TREE HOUSE - THE BADLANDS - DAY
speaker_heading: THE GANG
speaker_heading: DRIFTS THE
speaker_heading: COOTIE N' CHUTE

dialog: sticks.
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: hauls it in.
speaker_heading: THE BALL
text: slowly rises. Suddenly
dialog: 83
speaker_heading: THE BEAST'S JAWS

speaker_heading: THE GANG

text: Takes his glasses off. Only his eyes show white.
speaker_heading: SQUINTS
dialog: We've been going about this all wrong.

scene_heading: INT./EXT. TREE HOUSE - DAY

scene_heading: EXT. TREE HOUSE - DAY
text: ...it comes to life. A 35 foot hollow erector-beam and

scene_heading: EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY

speaker_heading: NARRATOR

speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: We can't get it back, Babe.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: I'm sorry.

text: Benny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall.
dialog: done this in years:
speaker_heading: BENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: M- M - Mom?...
text: The closet door CREAKS open... by itself. Everything inside
text: is oddly devoid of color.
speaker_heading: BENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Who's there?!
text: BABE RUTH steps out of the closet. He exists in the only way

speaker_heading: DUST RISES

speaker_heading: IT MATERIALIZES

dialog: This is the biggest dog that ever lived! 300 lbs. 4 1/2

speaker_heading: A PICKLE

speaker_heading: CLINK

speaker_heading: THE BEAST'S

speaker_heading: BENNY
text: leaves scrambling footprints. He slides - grabs the ball -
text: "Pops-Up" Maury Wills fashion - heads back for the fence.
text: The ball slips from Benny's fingers. Re-grabs it - shoves

speaker_heading: THE BEAST

speaker_heading: BENNY

speaker_heading: THE BEAST

speaker_heading: BENNY
speaker_heading: YOWWWWW !

scene_heading: INT. BOYS CLUB AUDITORIUM - DAY
text: ON THE MOVIE SCREEN Kong does battle with T Rex.
speaker_heading: BENNY

speaker_heading: KIDS' HEADS
text: turn to watch him. KONG ROARS! They look back at
scene_heading: THE MOVIE SCREEN
text: where, just as Kong proclaims himself king over the dead T

speaker_heading: THE BEAST

dialog: comes...
text: ...Sliding across the water-slippy deck like an out-of-

text: Benny cuts back through the pool building. The Beast follows
dialog: parting our guys and the other Kids.
scene_heading: EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY
text: Game in progress. From outta nowhere, Benny jams across the

scene_heading: EXT. CITY PARK - PICNIC AREA - DAY
text: Big banner: "FOUNDER'S DAY!" Perfectly arranged picnic

speaker_heading: BENNY

speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: rages after him, through:

scene_heading: EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NEARBY - DAY

dialog: Founder's Day parade (et al).
speaker_heading: BENNY
text: rips into the square. He rubba-leg zigzags, nimbly avoiding

speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: Is a runaway freight train. He PLOWS through CLOWNS.
speaker_heading: CHILDREN

speaker_heading: VATS & DISPENSERS
text: EXPLODE! The VOLUNTEERS dash out SCREAMING - "tar n'

text: with baked beans and potato chips.
speaker_heading: BENNY
text: zips through the MARCHING BAND - ducking trombone slides -
text: leaping glockenspiels.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
dialog: ain't so graceful. He "barn-doors" the band. CRASH! An

speaker_heading: THE ONLOOKERS
text: pour into the street, knocking the MAYOR from his
dialog: convertible,
text: and the FOUNDER'S DAY QUEEN from her float.
speaker_heading: FROM THIS HEIGHT

scene_heading: BENNY & THE BEAST
text: Are coming right at them! They race across the sandlot.
text: Kill- anxious beast-drool splashes the seat of Benny's
dialog: pants.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST'S
text: muscles flex.
speaker_heading: BENNY
text: just runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him.
text: lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: LOOK OUT!
text: He lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE.
text: careens toward the bottom of
scene_heading: MR. MERTLE'S FENCE
text: hits it and, defying gravity, RUNS STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN
scene_heading: FIBERGLASS PANELS!
speaker_heading: BENNY
text: jets upward, leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps -
text: standing out from the fence 90 degrees - the Donald O'Connor
dialog: "Singin' In The Rain" trick!
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: sucks air - ROARS - EXPLODES from the ground - soars, gaping
dialog: maw first, right for
speaker_heading: BENNY
text: who pushes off the top of the fence.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: GNASHES up at Benny's heels - misses by an inch. He plummets
text: toward the Badlands. Then, the unspeakable happens,
dialog: 104
speaker_heading: BENNY
speaker_heading: DROPS
scene_heading: THE BABE RUTH AUTOGRAPH
text: and comes tumbling down after the ball.
speaker_heading: BENNY (CONT'D)
dialog: Oh noooooo!
scene_heading: EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
text: Benny HITS the dirt with a gut twisting THUD! Dust
dialog: everywhere.
scene_heading: EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
text: The gang climbs the fence. They look down into
dialog: struggles
scene_heading: EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY
text: where, when the dust clears, they see
speaker_heading: BENNY
text: holding the Babe Ruth Autograph up high like a trophy.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: I Got IT!
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: hops down and races over. Suddenly, from the
speaker_heading: FENCETOP
text: His shirt snagged:
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help
dialog: him!
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: is hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He
text: choking to death - right below Scotty.
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: petrifies where they stand.
dialog: 105
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: tears his shirt loose. Scrambles to where The Beast hangs.
dialog: Tries to lift the tow chain free - too heavy! He'll die in
dialog: seconds.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can
dialog: let him off!
speaker_heading: (DESPERATE)
dialog: COME ON!
speaker_heading: NOBODY
dialog: moves. They wanna but they can't!
speaker_heading: SCOTTY

text: Beast's head.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (CONTACT)
dialog: Easy. Easy, boy.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: whimpers. Scotty balances atop the fence. Grabs the tow
text: chain. Lifts with all his might... his fingers bleed. The
text: Beast goes limp. An inch. That did it! The beast falls.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: goes with him - 8 feet to the dirt. The FENCE COMES DOWN -
text: breaking the barrier to the sandlot. He lands on the ground
dialog: NOSE TO NOSE
dialog: with The Beast.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: leaps to his feet.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: rises with him.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: freezes solid.
dialog: 106
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: watches in horror.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
dialog: That's
dialog: scans them instinctively - He might kill them all where they
dialog: stand.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY'S
text: about to load up his fruit o' da looms.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: sticks his mammoth head right in Scotty's face. SNIFFS.
text: it! The kid is lunch! His jowls part - hot BEAST-BREATH
text: BLOWS Scotty's hair back.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: closes his eyes.
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: SLAP their hands to their eyesockets.
speaker_heading: THE BEAST
text: leans closer. Mouth opens. Cold-leather nose presses against
text: Scotty's forehead. Then... He licks Scotty's face.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: wipes away the Beast slob. He doesn't even have to kneel
text: down to read the name on The Beast's "doggy tag." It says...
dialog: ..-Hercules.
text: This time Scotty gives Benny "Thumbs Up."
scene_heading: UNDER THE LEAN-TO
text: Hercules digs, then stands away.
speaker_heading: THE GANG
text: steps closer. Look into the hole. Their faces light up with
dialog: wonder. In
speaker_heading: THE HOLE
dialog: Are 150 baseballs.
dialog: 107
text: THE GANG'S BLOWN AWAY
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: We can play forever now.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
text: takes The Beast by the collar. He and Benny go to
scene_heading: MR. MERTLE'S BACK DOOR
text: Scotty KNOCKS. MR. MERTLE answers the door. An old man with
text: dark glasses. He comes out on the porch.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: Hello?...
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Um, we brought your dog home.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: Hercules? How'd he get out?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Well, sir... um, we kind of, well,
dialog: what happened was —
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: - we hit a baseball into your yard.
dialog: Then we tried to get it and -
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: - why didn't you just come to the
dialog: door... I'd have gotten it for you.
text: Squints, Yeah-Yeah, Ham, DeNunez, Repeat, Timmy and Bertram

speaker_heading: (BEAT)

scene_heading: INT. MR. MERTLE'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Fairly spartan, except for one room, where it seems that Mr.

speaker_heading: INTO
scene_heading: THE BASEBALL ROOM
text: Mr. Mertle sits at a table. Benny and Scotty stare at the
text: tabletop.
dialog: 108
text: It holds a scale model Baseball Diamond: green felt field
dialog: and
text: little bases, outfield wall and miniature player figures. A
text: picture on the wall of Mr. Mertle and Babe Ruth.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: You knew Babe Ruth?
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: Yeah. And he knew me too.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: They never let us play together, but
dialog: we were friends. Good friends. He was
dialog: almost as great a hitter as I was.
dialog: But, he'd of told you he was better.
dialog: The picture is signed: "To Thelonius Johnson Mertle, the
dialog: second
dialog: greatest slugger I ever saw... Babe Ruth."
text: A baseball game on the RADIO. As each play is CALLED, Mr.
text: Mertle's hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct

speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (HOLDING BALL)
dialog: This the one that went over my fence?
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Yeah.
text: Mr. Mertle brushes his fingers over the leather.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: This is an old ball, boys. Really
dialog: old.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't
dialog: he?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
speaker_heading: (WEAK)
dialog: Yes, sir.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: You sound upset, son - what's wrong?
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Well, you see... that ball belongs to
dialog: my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed
dialog: by Babe Ruth.
text: Mr. Mertle shakes his head... hands the ball to Scotty.
dialog: 109
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will
dialog: understand.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: I don't think so.
text: On the RADIO, Wills steals second.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
speaker_heading: (TO BENNY)
dialog: Son, move Maury Wills to second base
dialog: for me, will ya?
text: Benny moves the little figure to second base.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE (CONT'D)
dialog: If he steals third that'll be number
dialog: 100.
speaker_heading: (TO SCOTTY)
dialog: Helluva pickle you're in, boy.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Yes, sir...
text: Mr. Mertle retrieves something from a glass case. A
dialog: baseball.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
dialog: I'll make you a deal. If you boys
dialog: come over once a week and talk baseball
dialog: with me, I'll trade you balls.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Well, that's really nice of you... but
dialog: this ball really is signed by The Babe.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
speaker_heading: (CHUCKLES)
dialog: This one really is too... and all the
dialog: rest of the '27 Yankees.
text: He hands his baseball to Scotty... Benny stares at it in
dialog: disbelief.
speaker_heading: BENNY
dialog: Oh my God - Murderers' Row.
text: As they ogle the ball:
speaker_heading: BENNY (CONT'D)
speaker_heading: (AWED)
dialog: Lou Gehrig...

speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Babe Ruth.
speaker_heading: MR. MERTLE
speaker_heading: (SMILING)

text: Scotty hands Mr. Mertle the chewed up Babe Ruth ball. Shakes
text: his hand.
speaker_heading: SCOTTY
dialog: Deal.
text: On the RADIO, Maury Wills steals 3rd for his 100th stolen
text: base. Scotty notices the wall clock:
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY
text: Mom's car is in the driveway. Scotty goes up the walkway
text: slowly. Benny just behind him. The gang lingers at the
text: sidewalk. Scotty sets one foot on the
speaker_heading: PORCH
text: and Bill comes out. He looks none-too-pleased. He towers
text: over Scotty. The gang hangs their heads.
speaker_heading: BILL
dialog: This better be good.
text: Benny unpockets a little felt bag. Hands it to Scotty. He
text: holds the bag up to a perplexed Bill, who opens it. He looks
text: from Scotty to Benny and back again. Then...
text: ...Stares down at the "Murderers' Row" ball.
speaker_heading: CcuT TO:
scene_heading: EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
text: A BASEBALL sailing through the air. SMACK! it's caught ina
text: brand new glove. Scotty's new glove. Scotty snap throws the
text: ball back to Bill. He and Scotty are having a great game of
dialog: catch.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR
dialog: It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth
dialog: was like the Hercules of baseball, and
dialog: then The Beast's name turned out to be
dialog: Hercules.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It was also strange that Mr. Mertle
dialog: had a Murderers' Row ball to replace
dialog: the one signed by The Babe.
dialog: 111
text: Bill and Scotty smile as they fire the cowhide back and
dialog: forth.
speaker_heading: NARRATOR (CONT'D)
dialog: Some people might say that it was all
text: a coincidence... but looking back at
dialog: it now, it seems like everything was
dialog: connected, just like me and Benny.
speaker_heading: (BEAT)
dialog: It was like we were a part of the same
dialog: myth as The Babe... the Myth of
dialog: Baseball.
text: Scotty's mom sticks her head out the back door. She smiles,

speaker_heading: MOM

scene_heading: MR. MERTLE'S DIAMOND

speaker_heading: HERCULES

speaker_heading: THE GUYS
