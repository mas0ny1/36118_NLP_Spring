scene_heading: 1 INT. BILLY OFFICE (BREWSTER KEEGAN INVESTMENT BANK)- 4:50 PM
speaker_heading: 1
text: BILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting
text: at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex-
dialog: girlfriend.
speaker_heading: MAN (O.S.)
dialog: Billy Boy!
text: J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
dialog: the office.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Get your ass ready! It's almost five
dialog: o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his
dialog: drink on!
text: J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Oh God. Give me that. I'm burning it
dialog: once and for all.
text: J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as
text: the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Don't!
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Dude, it's been six months. You have to
dialog: move on.
text: BILLY nods knowingly.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot
dialog: chick riding your jock all night long.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: You're such a romantic, J.D.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: It would help get your mind off of Sarah.
text: BILLY ponders this for a moment.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other
dialog: women, I wouldn't even know what to do.
dialog: I've been out of the game so long.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Billy, you come out with me tonight, and
dialog: I promise you'll get laid.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson
dialog: needs me to update the financial models
dialog: for his meeting with the foreign
dialog: investors.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: So what? It's Friday! You have all
dialog: weekend to do that.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: No I don't. The Germans are taking an
dialog: earlier flight back, so the meeting's
dialog: been moved to tomorrow.
text: J.D. thinks for a moment.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Well, why don't you just get somebody
dialog: else to do your work then?
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Who?
text: J.D. gets a big smile on his face. He has an idea.
scene_heading: 2 INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - 4:55 PM 2
dialog: HAROLD LEE (22 years old, the typical Asian-American
dialog: workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up
text: his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day.
text: BILLY and J.D. approach...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Harold, listen, I need you to update
dialog: these models for me.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (confused)
dialog: But aren't you supposed to...
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: I know, but something came up. I have to
dialog: meet with some clients tonight, so I
dialog: won't be able to get to it. It's your
dialog: responsibility now. Okay?
text: Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to
text: protest, J.D. steps forward...
dialog: J.D.
dialog: And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine

speaker_heading: J.D. (cont'd)
text: With all the downsizing going on around
dialog: here, we wouldn't want to have to tell
dialog: Berenson that you've been slacking. He's
dialog: just dying to figure out who he should
text: fire next.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Uh...okay...no problem...
text: BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.
scene_heading: 3 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - 5:00 PM 3
text: BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot.
speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Wow! I can't believe how easy that was!
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Dude, how do you think I get all my shit
dialog: done? I'm telling you -- those Asian
dialog: guys love crunching numbers. You
dialog: probably just made his weekend.
text: The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.
scene_heading: 4 INT. J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE 4
text: Billy and J.D. enter the car.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Now get ready. It's time we embark
dialog: on...Operation Get Some!
text: And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes
text: the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy
text: song kicks in.
dialog: Intercut:
scene_heading: 5 INT/EXT. J.D'S CONVERTABLE 5
text: Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through
text: the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick
text: in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it.
text: When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats
text: in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner.
text: J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his
text: car zooms out of the parking lot.
dialog: 
text: QUICK BOOM UP from J.D.'s Convertible and PUSH IN to Harold
text: standing at a window watching as Billy and J.D. zoom off.

scene_heading: 7 INT. DR. WOODRUFF'S OFFICE - NYU MEDICAL SCHOOL 7
text: KUMAR PATEL (22, Indian, Funky Hair) is answering questions
dialog: from his NYU Medical School interviewer, DR. Woodruff (middle
text: aged, erudite, very professional). Kumar has NO ACCENT.
dialog: He's American.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Mononucleosis or mono is an infection
dialog: caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
dialog: Symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
text: headaches, white patches on the back of
dialog: your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness
dialog: and loss of appetite.
speaker_heading: DR. WOODRUFF
dialog: Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're
dialog: one of the best applicants I've ever
dialog: interviewed. Not that it's a surprise.
dialog: Your father is very respected in his
dialog: field. You know he and I had some pretty
dialog: wild times when we were in med school.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: DR. WOODRUFF
dialog: Yeah. We started our own basketball team--
dialog: the Hemoglobin Trotters...
dialog: (cracking up)
dialog: Yeah, we were crazy.
text: Kumar nods and smiles. Woodruff finally stops laughing...
speaker_heading: DR. WOODRUFF
dialog: Anyway-- just one more question.
dialog: (reading from a clipboard)
dialog: What are some potential symptoms of
dialog: pancreatitis?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Let's see. There might be epigastric
text: tenderness, diffuse abdominal
dialog: tenderness...
text: Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
text: gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody
text: smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls
text: out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 5.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Dr. Woodruff)
dialog: I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second?
text: Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (into the phone)
text: Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking.
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Oh, hey.
dialog: (listening)
dialog: Nothing important. I can talk. What's up?
text: Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of
text: coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office.
dialog: Intercut:
scene_heading: INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - SIMULTANEOUS
text: Harold is talking on his office phone...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm not gonna be able to partake in our
dialog: usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta
dialog: stay late at the office.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (into the phone)
dialog: Fuck that shit! We had plans!
text: Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I know, but I gotta get this work done.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Oh come on! When has getting high ever
dialog: prevented you from finishing your work?
text: Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply
text: slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt.
text: Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: Listen, I'd love to go home, but...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter
dialog: of the finest herb in New York City, and
dialog: I'm not smoking it alone.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 6.
speaker_heading: KUMAR (cont'd)
dialog: So you're just gonna have to chill the
dialog: fuck out, bring your work home, and
dialog: prepare to get blazed, because in a
dialog: couple of hours I expect both of us to be
dialog: blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay
dialog: good. See you later.
text: Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down. Dr. Woodruff is
text: stunned.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Dr. Woodruff)
dialog: Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More
dialog: symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased
text: bowel sounds, possibly fever,
dialog: dehydration, and sometimes even shock.
speaker_heading: DR. WOODRUFF
dialog: (livid)
dialog: Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a
dialog: proper interview. Do you actually believe
dialog: after the way you've behaved that I would
dialog: ever even consider recommending you for
dialog: admission?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: No. I'd actually be pretty surprised.
text: Dr. Woodruff is flustered. He doesn't know how to react.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad
dialog: will keep paying for my apartment. I'm
dialog: not really planning on going to med
dialog: school.
speaker_heading: DR. WOODRUFF
dialog: (confused)
dialog: But...you have perfect MCAT scores!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Well, I'm not an idiot.
text: Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words.
text: Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr.
text: Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Wow! Is this your daughter?
text: A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's

text: Harold shuts down his laptop. He then puts the laptop along
text: with all his paperwork into a bag and leaves the office.
scene_heading: 9 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT 9
text: Harold walks to the end of the parking lot, where his car is
text: parked. As he walks, the strap of his laptop bag breaks and
text: falls to the ground. Harold is frustrated as he picks it up.
scene_heading: 10 EXT. PARKING LOT EXIT GATE 10
text: After other cars zoom through uninterrupted, the ELDERLY
text: PARKING ATTENDANT stops Harold and checks his ID before
text: letting him leave.
scene_heading: 11 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING PARKING LOT - 6:21 PM 11
text: Harold's driving his WHITE INFINITI G20. He finds a spot...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes! Right in front...
text: Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he
text: starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND.
text: The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a
text: KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof.
text: Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (frustrated, to himself)
dialog: Those assholes.
text: The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud
text: mouth), puts down his window...

speaker_heading: COLE

text: He ends up parking far from the building. He has to parallel

text: of times, until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot.
scene_heading: 11B EXT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING 11B
text: Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He
text: walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building...
text: Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he
text: sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of
text: Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators.
text: HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl.
text: Harold takes a deep breath...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous.
scene_heading: 11C INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY 11C
text: Harold enters the building and walks over to Maria. They
text: give each other a friendly smile. We hear a "BING" sound,
text: indicating the elevator has arrived. The doors open and
text: Harold and Maria walk inside.
scene_heading: 12 INT. ELEVATOR 12
text: HAROLD and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes
text: up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So Maria, what's been going on?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week.
dialog: How about you?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I
dialog: caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy
dialog: who works next to me decided to bathe for
dialog: a change.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (deadpan)
dialog: Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
dialog: that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And
text: the guy next to me still smells like
dialog: crap. But a man can dream, right?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 9.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Maria laughs. Harold's pleased that his joke worked.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So what are you up to tonight?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a
dialog: little bit, clean up the apartment, and
dialog: then go over to my boyfriend's place.
dialog: He's cooking me a really nice dinner.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Really?
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (smiling)
dialog: Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
dialog: that.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'll actually probably just sit on my
text: ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch
dialog: Blind Date.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (playful)
dialog: That sounds awful.
text: Harold laughs, as does Maria. They smile at each other...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, if you want some company, maybe you
dialog: could sit on your ass at my place.
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: (flirty)
dialog: Maybe.
dialog: 
text: We hear the "BING" of the elevator...
scene_heading: 13 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING(LOBBY) 13
text: We're back in the lobby. EVERYTHING THAT JUST HAPPENED WAS A
text: FANTASY. Harold and Maria enter the elevator.
scene_heading: 14 INT. ELEVATOR 14
text: HAROLD and MARIA stand silently while the elevator goes up.
text: It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have
text: the courage. They reach their floor and exit the elevator.
scene_heading: 15 INT. HALLWAY 15
speaker_heading: MARIA
dialog: Bye.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 10.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: MARIA walks over to her apartment and goes inside.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Bye.
scene_heading: 16 INT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT - 6:30 PM 16
text: Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place
text: is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a
text: poster of "BILLY MADISON."
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Kumar?
speaker_heading: KUMAR (O.C.)
dialog: Yeah, I'm in here!
text: Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's
text: Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the
text: floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap
text: posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a
text: Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar
text: is not in the room, however.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Kumar?
speaker_heading: KUMAR (O.C.)
dialog: In here...
text: Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA
text: furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN
text: FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a "clipping sound"
text: coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked
text: and appalled. Harold walks inside...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Kumar, what the hell are you doing!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I'm trimming my pubes.
text: Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple
text: more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Why aren't you doing this in your room!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: The mirror's in here.
dialog: (re: his crotch)
dialog: Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai
dialog: tree!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 11.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Chill out. It makes my Johnson look
dialog: bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll
dialog: end up with pubes like my dad. You've
dialog: seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right?
text: HAROLD notices something...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Are those my scissors? Oh my God! I
dialog: trim my nose hair with those!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with
dialog: them for the past six months.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM!
text: Kumar puts the scissors down and EXITS THE ROOM. Harold
text: shakes his head and sets up his laptop on his desk...
scene_heading: 16A INT. KUMAR'S BEDROOM 16A
dialog: Kumar puts on some boxers and a T-shirt (I love Bush: the
dialog: pussy not the president).
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (calling out to Harold)
dialog: So what the hell is your problem, anyway?
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.C.)
dialog: Other than my roommate's boney ass?
scene_heading: 17 INT. HAROLD'S BEDROOM 17
text: Harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: One of the senior analysts asked me to do
dialog: a bunch of his work for him tonight.
text: Kumar walks back into Harold's room...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I assume you gave him the appropriate "go
dialog: fuck yourself."
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: If by "go fuck yourself" you mean "no
dialog: problem sir" then yes, he got the message
text: loud and clear.
text: KUMAR shakes his head in disgust...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 12.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me
dialog: today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say
dialog: "no" once in a while. Now lets get high.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. I got a lot of work to finish.
text: Kumar shuts Harold's laptop.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to
dialog: get that shit done later. Come on, let's
text: smoke a couple joints.
text: Harold thinks for a moment and then caves...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: One joint.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: One and a half. Now let's do this...
text: Kumar exits the room...
text: HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see
text: organized in rows of suits and button downs.
scene_heading: 18 INT. LIVING ROOM 18
text: Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds
text: AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar lifts open the cover--
text: inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana.
text: Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy.
text: The phone next to the book starts to ring. Kumar doesn't
text: care. He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up.
scene_heading: MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT
dialog: (on the answering machine)
dialog: Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your
dialog: interview today was good. I'm calling to
dialog: remind you that you have another one
dialog: tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from
dialog: Cornell at 10:00 a.m. Do not be late!
text: Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the M.C.A.T.
text: book and starts rolling a fat blunt...
scene_heading: MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT
dialog: It is very important you show up on time!
dialog: Mommy and I will be very upset if you do
dialog: not go. Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the
dialog: meeting is at ten o'clock. Bye bye.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 13.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harold (still wearing his button-down shirt, only now
text: untucked) enters the living room. Kumar is now licking the
dialog: blunt.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Don't you think you should take at least
dialog: one of your interviews seriously? At some
dialog: point your dad's gonna get really pissed.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: So what? It's not like there's a
dialog: shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My
dialog: dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor.
dialog: Just because everyone in my family went
dialog: to med school, doesn't mean I have to.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, then what are you going to do?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm
dialog: gonna smoke this fat blunt, get
dialog: ridiculously high, and then get something

text: HAROLD and KUMAR turn their attention to the TV, where they
text: see A WHITE CASTLE COMMERCIAL taking place. In the
text: commercial, we see DOZENS OF TINY BURGERS lined up in a row.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON TV
dialog: Then come to White Castle and try our
dialog: Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and
text: a soft drink for only 2.99.
text: HAROLD and KUMAR start salivating, as they see THE STEAM RISE
text: FROM THE BURGERS ON THE T.V.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON TV
dialog: Imagine all those burgers in your stomach
dialog: right now. Mmmmmh....
text: HAROLD and KUMAR move closer to the TV to smell the burgers.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON TV
dialog: Don't you like food that's tasty and
dialog: delicious?
text: Almost in a trance, HAROLD and KUMAR nod agreeingly.
speaker_heading: VOICE ON TV
dialog: Then what are you waiting for? Head over
dialog: to White Castle. It's what you crave.
text: The commercial ends. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other--
text: this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them.
scene_heading: 22 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - 7:45 22
text: HAROLD and KUMAR exit their apartment.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You're sure you know how to get there? I
dialog: haven't been to White Castle in ages.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I'm telling you, there's one right around
dialog: the corner from that multiplex in New
dialog: Brunswick.
text: They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment.
text: On the side of the doorway is a MEZUZAH IN THE SHAPE OF A
text: NAKED WOMAN. Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking...
scene_heading: 23 INT. ROSENBERG AND GOLDSTEIN'S APARTMENT 23
text: HAROLD and KUMAR walk into an apartment that looks almost
text: identical to theirs. (Instead of a "BILLY MADISON" poster,
text: there's one of "HAPPY GILMORE.")
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 17.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Sitting on the couch is ROSENBERG (a seemingly "nice Jewish
text: boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and GOLDSTEIN (a more
text: depraved Jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the
text: OLSEN TWINS-- underneath the picture we see the words,
text: "FINALLY LEGAL ON JUNE 13, 2004"). Both of them are taking
text: bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching TV as Harold
text: and Kumar enter...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up. We're
dialog: going to White Castle.
text: Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV...
speaker_heading: ROSENBERG
dialog: Wait-- we're watching The Gift on HBO.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: No waiting. We're starving...
text: Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing
text: a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg &amp; Goldstein's coffee
dialog: table.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (scolding Harold)
dialog: ...Put that down! We're not eating `til
dialog: we get to White Castle.
text: Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as
text: soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and
text: Goldstein, he slips it his pocket.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Rosenberg and
dialog: Goldstein)
dialog: Now come on guys, let's go.
speaker_heading: GOLDSTEIN
dialog: Sorry man! We're not going anywhere.
text: Supposedly, Katie Holmes shows her milk
dialog: paps in this movie!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Is that all you Jews ever think about?
dialog: Tits?
speaker_heading: ROSENBERG
dialog: We're talking about Katie Holmes here.
dialog: You would never think a sweet, innocent
dialog: girl like her would ever take her top
dialog: off. Which is precisely why we have to
dialog: watch her do it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 17A.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: GOLDSTEIN
dialog: Dude, the things I'd eat out of her ass,

speaker_heading: GOLDSTEIN
dialog: So is "I want to pound Britney Spears in

speaker_heading: ROSENBERG
dialog: TouchÃ©.
dialog: (to Harold and Kumar)
dialog: Anyway, if you guys want to wait till the
dialog: movie's over...
text: HAROLD and KUMAR have already shut the door.
scene_heading: 24 INT. BY THE ELEVATOR - 7:50 PM 24
text: HAROLD presses the "down" button. KUMAR notices that Harold
text: has his LAPTOP BAG on his shoulder...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What the hell are you bringing that for?
text: Harold hands Kumar his keys.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You're driving. I'm gonna try to get
dialog: some of my work done in the car.
text: Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Shit, I forgot my cell phone.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Why don't you just run back and get it?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (thinks for a moment)
dialog: Nah, we've gone too far.
text: Reveal that the guys are less than 20 feet from their door.
text: "Bing!" The elevator door opens and the guys enter.
scene_heading: 25 INT. ELEVATOR 25
text: As Harold and Kumar enter, we hear a DOOR SLAM behind them.
text: They turn around and see MARIA locking her door. She hasn't
dialog: noticed Harold and Kumar yet.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey, there's your girlfriend. You
dialog: actually gonna talk to her this time?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 19.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the "door closed"
text: button repeatedly. The door closes before Maria sees them.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What the hell are you doing? That was a
dialog: perfect opportunity! You could have asked
dialog: her if she wanted to go to White Castle.
text: Harold doesn't say anything. He looks down in shame.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: You're worthless.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm not worthwhile.
scene_heading: 26 INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY) 26
text: Harold and Kumar exit the elevator...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, it's only awkward because you're a
dialog: pussy. Just talk to her once and I
dialog: promise you it won't be weird anymore...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It doesn't matter. The only girls
dialog: interested in me are girls I have no
dialog: interest in. Like Cindy Kim.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier.
dialog: One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is
text: throwing a party at her dorm tonight.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: God, she invites me to everything.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: So what? She's fucking cute. Let her

scene_heading: 26A EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING 26A
text: Harold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see COLE and

speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Hey look, it's the Brother's McFag!
dialog: (to Harold and Kumar)
dialog: Let me guess, the yellow one's the

dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 20.

scene_heading: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
dialog: Extreme!

speaker_heading: KUMAR

dialog: (beat)
dialog: And what kind of parking job is this?
dialog: You're like a mile away from the curb.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Don't even start.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (laughing)
dialog: Just fucking with you. Now let's go out

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, give me thirty-five cents.

speaker_heading: KUMAR
text: What's going on? It didn't register.

dialog: Dude, give me thirty-five more cents.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I don't have anymore change.
speaker_heading: KUMAR

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. I don't like breaking the law.

dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 22.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I can see that.
text: A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a

scene_heading: BIG BURLY GUY
dialog: Hey! Move your ass!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Harold)
dialog: I'm going through.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of

dialog: happened.
text: The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door...
scene_heading: BIG BURLY GUY
dialog: (over the honking)
dialog: Move, you fucking twat!
text: Kumar can't take it anymore. Just as Harold is about to get
text: out of the car, Kumar hits the gas and screeches away.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Are you crazy?
text: A LOUD ALARM GOES OFF BEHIND THEM...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh shit, we're dead!
text: Harold throws the joint out the window.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What the fuck is wrong with you?!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (paranoid/looking back)

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: That was the last of our weed.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Look, I get a little paranoid sometimes.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Now we're in Newark of all places. You
dialog: know we're gonna get shot.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Maybe it's not as bad as they say. It's
text: probably just a bunch of hype.
text: They look out the window and see another ASIAN and INDIAN guy

text: THREE HOODS jump out from an alley and start beating the
dialog: living shit out of Daniel and Shankar.
text: Kumar gives Harold a dirty look.
speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: Come on. How do you know they're not
dialog: peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys?
text: With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS
text: HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently
text: bumps chests with his teammates.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Turn the car around.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Why? Are cars not allowed to go through
dialog: when a game's going on? When we were
dialog: kids, we used to move to the side when we
text: were playing in the street.
text: The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: For some reason, I don't think this is
dialog: the same thing.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I'm going through.
text: KUMAR begins inching forward.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Don't!

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Look. They're moving. I told you.
text: Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar,

speaker_heading: HAROLD

scene_heading: HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN

scene_heading: HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN
dialog: Shit. I can't do it.

scene_heading: HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: KUMAR

scene_heading: BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
dialog: Excuse me?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: There used to be a White Castle right in
dialog: this spot. Where is it?
scene_heading: BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
dialog: (remembering)
dialog: Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here.
dialog: Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad

speaker_heading: KUMAR

speaker_heading: HAROLD

scene_heading: BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE

dialog: be unsure about something like this?
text: HAROLD and KUMAR are freaking out.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Shit. What are we gonna do?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I don't know. Should we just eat here?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Do you really think that'll satisfy us?
text: The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation.
scene_heading: BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
dialog: There's a 24 hour White Castle in Cherry

dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 28.

dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Forget about the med school interview.
dialog: It's a non-issue.
scene_heading: BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
dialog: If I may interject for a moment...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I've been an employee here for three
dialog: years now, and if there's one thing I've
dialog: learned, it's that when you're craving
dialog: White Castle, the burgers here simply
dialog: won't cut it.
dialog: (in his own little world)
dialog: In fact, just thinking about those tender
dialog: little White Castle burgers and those
dialog: grilled onions makes me want to burn this
dialog: place to the ground and re-build a White
text: Castle in its place.
dialog: (back to reality)
dialog: If I were you, I'd suck it up and make
dialog: the trip.
text: KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.

dialog: moment for the guys...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (enticing Harold)
dialog: You can always do your work in the car.
text: HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Let's do it.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Then it's settled. No matter what, we're
dialog: not ending this night without White
dialog: Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?
text: KUMAR puts his hand out. HAROLD shakes it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Agreed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 29.
dialog:

scene_heading: BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
dialog: Wise choice. Besides, you wouldn't want

scene_heading: BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: White Castle, here we come. I just wish

text: on for the PRINCETON EXIT.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here.

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Why?
speaker_heading: KUMAR

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh no. I'm not seeing Cindy.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the

speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: She calls me. Then she rambles on about

speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 30.
speaker_heading: HAROLD (cont'd)
dialog: And I have to pretend like I actually
dialog: give a shit, or she'll call me a twinkie.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: A twinkie?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You know, yellow on the outside, white on
dialog: the inside.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our
dialog: weed out the window, so now it's your
dialog: duty to make sure we're high as shit by
dialog: the time we're eating those burgers.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy
dialog: doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
text: As long as she buzzes us into a dorm,
dialog: we're set. Give me ten minutes in there
dialog: and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim.
scene_heading: 51 INT. CINDY KIM'S DORM ROOM - 11:OO PM 51
text: HAROLD is sitting on a bed, next to CINDY KIM (very cute,

scene_heading: DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy

speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: I'm so glad you showed up, Harold!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (unenthusiastic)
dialog: Yeah. Me too.
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued
dialog: to the envelope I sent you?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Uh, yeah. They were...nice.
text: Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises
text: his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to
dialog: Cindy. "Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?"
text: Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while...
speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: Uh, yes?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 31.

speaker_heading: HAROLD

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Uh, this is actually a two-part question.
dialog: I'm applying for a summer internship at
dialog: Brewster Keegan, and I was wondering a)
dialog: what it's like being an investment banker
dialog: and b) if you would write me a
dialog: recommendation.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What it's like being an investment
dialog: banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's
dialog: pretty...
text: HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian
dialog: students. He can't bear to tell them the truth...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: ...awesome?
text: All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: As for the recommendation, I may be able
dialog: to make a call or two...

scene_heading: 52 INT. DORM HALLWAY - 11:15 PM 52
text: KUMAR is standing in the hallway, accosting random students.
text: He sees one RANDOM STUDENT walk by...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey! You know where I can get some
dialog: chronic?
text: The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What kind of Ivy League school is this?
scene_heading: 52A EXT. PRINCETON DORM - 11:16 PM 52A
text: Kumar exits the dorm, and walks throughout the quad, asking
text: random students for drugs. Eventually, a HIPPIE-LOOKING
text: STUDENT (Phish t-shirt, Birkenstocks) taps KUMAR on the back.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up?
text: KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime
dialog: of your finest herb.
text: The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A
text: GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Oh my dear sweet lord...
text: Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his
dialog: hand away...
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: Yo, man! Not cool! This is my baby,
dialog: man!
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 33.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Hippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a
dialog: measly dime bag...
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: That'll be eighty bucks.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops,
dialog: bro!
text: The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel
dialog: like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy
dialog: it. That's cool with me. I can find lots
dialog: of people who want to get high. I can
dialog: smoke it myself, man.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are
dialog: you?
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: One who understands the concept of supply
dialog: and demand, dude.
text: Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a
text: couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes
text: out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: (laughing like a prick)
dialog: Dumbass.
text: Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE,
scene_heading: BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying
text: take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making
dialog: their deal.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hey, you guys about to smoke?
text: KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS. They're
text: both floored by their hotness.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: (to the Twins)
dialog: Yeah. Wanna come back to my place?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Please. Like they want to go listen to a
dialog: bunch of Phish records while you read
dialog: your lame ass poetry.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 34.
speaker_heading: KUMAR (cont'd)
dialog: (to the Twins, showing his
dialog: bag of weed)
dialog: Ladies? Wanna get high and have some fun?
text: CHRISTY and CLARISSA look at each other. They like this dude.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY CLARISSA
dialog: Sure! Sure!
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: (butting in)
dialog: Hey, my poetry isn't lame! It's actually
dialog: quite good.
text: The girls clearly aren't convinced. The ignore him and turn
text: to Kumar. Hippie Asshole is oblivious to the fact he's not
text: part of the crowd.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: (re: bag of food)
dialog: We're just gonna eat before this gets
dialog: cold. What do you say we meet you back
dialog: in our room in twenty minutes?
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: We're in room 109.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: 109. Got it. I'll see you later.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: Yeah, see you there.
text: THE TWINS walk away. Kumar's excited. Hippie Asshole tries
text: to pound fists with Kumar like they're all of a sudden
text: friends. Kumar snubs him and runs off.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: Not cool, man.
scene_heading: 52B INT. DORM HALLWAY 52B
text: Kumar runs down the hall and finds HAROLD walking with CINDY
text: and the ASIAN STUDENTS. He runs over to them...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick!
dialog: There are these two filthy pussies who
dialog: are just aching to get boned by us.
text: KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely,
dialog: young pussies who would like to have a
dialog: chat with you and I.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 35.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Sorry. Harold's coming with us.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: That's bullshit. He's coming with me.
dialog: Isn't that right, Rold?
text: CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to Kumar)
dialog: Let's go to the party for a little while.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Fuck that!
text: KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room,
text: and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in
text: his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Here-- this is Harold's understudy. You
dialog: can do whatever you want with him.
dialog: (to Harold)
dialog: Let's go.
text: KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY
text: looks pissed as she watches HAROLD being taken away from her.
scene_heading: 53 INT. DORM HALLWAY (DIFFERENT WING) - 11:30 PM 53
text: KUMAR takes the first puff of a joint.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I can't believe you were gonna ditch me
dialog: for the Joy Luck Club. You know what
dialog: their parties are like.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Look, what do you want me to say? I was
text: under pressure.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Just say "no"! That's all it takes. Now
dialog: take a hit of this.
text: Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens
text: and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and
text: KUMAR with drugs.
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey, what are you two doing?!
text: HAROLD and KUMAR start running down the hallway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 36.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey, get back here!
text: HAROLD and KUMAR duck around the corner. They see a door to
text: the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Quick. In here.
text: The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.
scene_heading: 54 INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM 54
text: HAROLD and KUMAR try to decide where to hide.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Shit! What if he finds us?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for
text: us in the women's bathroom.
text: Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Shit! Get in that stall!
text: There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD
text: RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO (the middle one). KUMAR sees the
text: BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER
text: TWO and shuts the door behind him.
text: The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL. Harold's
text: laptop bag keeps smacking Kumar.
text: CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom. They're
text: in mid-conversation.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hurry up, I want to go smoke pot with
dialog: that cute Indian bloke.
speaker_heading: INTERCUT:
text: IN STALL NUMBER TWO, KUMAR'S ears perk up, as we see HAROLD
text: and KUMAR both standing on the toilet bowl. From Kumar's POV,
text: he sees CHRISTY and CLARISSA through the crack of the door.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: It'll be a few minutes, I'm about to have
dialog: the worst case of the taco shits.
text: KUMAR is clearly upset to hear this.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 37.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Ew...gross.
text: CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door.
text: The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
text: look over at that stall.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Oh great. Now I think I have to go.
text: CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door.
text: The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
text: turn their attention to the other stall. They then look at
text: each other grossed out.
text: From above, we see HAROLD and KUMAR struggling, while the
text: girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls.
text: WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DIARRHEA HITTING THE BOWL.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Ahhhhh!
text: HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified. There is silence for a few
dialog: seconds until....
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle
dialog: shits?
text: We see HAROLD quizzically mouth "battle shits?"
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Oh my God. We haven't played that since
dialog: back in camp!
text: HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.
text: WE HEAR A LOUD FARTING NOISE, THEN THE SOUND OF SHIT HITTING
text: THE WATER...
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Wait for it. Wait for it. Ahhhhh!
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Hit!
text: HAROLD and Kumar look terrified.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 38.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 55 EXT. DORM COMMON ROOM 55
text: Meanwhile, CINDY has left the other students and is roaming
text: the hallways, looking for Harold. She sees Hippie Asshole
text: walking by, counting Kumar's money...
speaker_heading: CINDY
dialog: Have you seen a Korean guy around here?
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of
dialog: them in this dorm.
dialog: (to himself, but audible)
dialog: `Tard.
text: Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid.
scene_heading: 56 INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM 56
text: We hear the sound of diarrhea splattering against the bowl.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Hit!
text: We see HAROLD dry heave.
text: We hear the sound of diarrhea hitting the bowl again.
text: CLARISSA smiles.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: You sank my destroyer! Scag!
text: KUMAR almost pukes as HE DROPS THE POT INTO THE TOILET BOWL.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Shit!
text: THEY SEE THE MARIJUANA UNPROTECTED FLOATING IN THE TOILET.
text: WE THEN HEAR THE MOST DISGUSTING DIARRHEA SOUND YET.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I CAN'T TAKE THIS!
text: With that, HAROLD runs out of the stall and exits the
text: bathroom. The girls look shocked.
speaker_heading: CHRISTY
dialog: Who was that?
text: KUMAR looks nervous. He quickly bolts from the bathroom.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Christy, are you still here?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 39.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Silence until...We hear a SUPER LOUD FART. CHRISTY starts
text: laughing.
speaker_heading: CLARISSA
dialog: Damn! You sank my battle shit!
scene_heading: 57 EXT. HALLWAY 57
text: Harold and Kumar run down the dorm hallway, grossed out. As
text: they run, they suddenly see--
scene_heading: 57A INT. COMMON ROOM 57A
text: Harold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST
text: ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the
text: "nerdy" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each
text: other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP.
text: Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the
text: dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the
text: couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES.
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: Pot brownies for everyone!
text: Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at
text: them. Harold and Kumar can't believe it.
text: Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth...
speaker_heading: CUTE ASIAN CHICK #1
dialog: Hey, K-dog! Can we have some brownies?
speaker_heading: KENNETH
dialog: To tell you the truth, I'm running low.
dialog: But a quick titty flash may persuade me.
text: The Korean chicks look at each other. "Should we?" "Okay!"
text: They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, I'm starting to think you made a
dialog: mistake by not going to this party...
text: Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY
text: GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER
scene_heading: SECURITY GUARD (#2)--
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Hey, you!
text: The guys turn and see the guards running at them. HAROLD AND
text: KUMAR RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN DOWN THE HALLWAY, WITH THE
text: GUARDS CHASING AFTER THEM...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 40.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Further down the hall, they pass the party. The partygoers
text: watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a
text: quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs. When she
text: notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing.
text: Cindy Kim notices Harold...
speaker_heading: CINDY KIM
dialog: Harold!
text: They keep running, past the bathrooms, where Christy and
dialog: Clarissa exit...
scene_heading: CHRISTY AND CLARISSA
dialog: Kumar!
text: They continue running.
text: The guards are still running after Harold and Kumar, who see
text: the EXIT DOORS just ahead. Suddenly, the Hippie Asshole
text: walks by, blocking their path.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Where the hell is 109, man?
text: Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close
text: and the two of them BASH INTO THE Hippie Asshole-- KNOCKING
scene_heading: HIM ON HIS ASS.
text: Harold and Kumar burst out the doors and EXIT THE DORM...
text: The Security Guards run by the Hippie Asshole, but stop when
text: they see his backpack, which is half-open, and is exposing
text: THE GIANT BAG OF WEED. The Security Guard picks it up...
speaker_heading: SECURITY GUARD
dialog: Well, well, well. What have we here?
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: (reaching for the bag)
dialog: Aw, dude! Don't take it! It's mine!
text: He continues to protest as SECURITY GUARD #2 holds him down.
scene_heading: 58 EXT. DARK ROAD (PRINCETON) -11:45 PM 58

scene_heading: 59 INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI 59
text: KUMAR is pissed off as he drives.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 41.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (using his fingers)
dialog: I can't believe it. We were this close
dialog: to getting high and getting laid.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh, come on, you always exaggerate. We
dialog: weren't gonna get laid.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex
dialog: with us! And what about Cindy?! She was
dialog: looking hot tonight! The fact that you're
dialog: not into her just might make you gay!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I know Cindy's cute, it's just...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What? You'd rather have Maria?
text: From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end
dialog: up with Cindy anyway. It's just more
dialog: practical. Now can we drop this and get
dialog: our asses to White Castle?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Fine.
text: Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Now what are you doing?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Daddy needs to urinate.
text: Harold rolls his eyes.
scene_heading: 60 EXT. WOODS NEAR ROAD - 11:50 PM 60
text: KUMAR gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). He
text: walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards
text: until HE FINDS A NICE BUSH. HE UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND STARTS
text: PEEING ON THE BUSH..
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Oh yes! Yes, that's nice.
scene_heading: 61 INT. CAR 61
text: HAROLD TAKES OUT HIS LAPTOP AND BEGINS WORKING FEVERISHLY.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 42.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: As he types, A RACCOON JUMPS INTO THE CAR AND CRAWLS INTO THE
text: BACK SEAT. HAROLD doesn't see this.
scene_heading: 62 EXT. BUSH NEAR DARK ROAD 62
text: KUMAR is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF
text: NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants
text: and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR!
text: Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The
text: Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that
text: Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple
text: seconds, until he can't take it anymore...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask
dialog: you...why are you peeing here?
speaker_heading: CREEPY GUY
dialog: What do you mean?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Why did you decide to piss here right
dialog: next to me? Why not that bush over there?
speaker_heading: CREEPY GUY
dialog: Well, this looked like a good bush to pee
dialog: on. Why'd you choose this bush?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Nobody was here when I chose this bush.
speaker_heading: CREEPY GUY
dialog: (getting heated)
dialog: So you can pee here and nobody else can,
dialog: is that it?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I was just saying....
speaker_heading: CREEPY GUY
dialog: Is this like your special bush or
dialog: something?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: No, I just...
dialog: (beat)
dialog: You know what? Forget about it. I'm not
text: in the mood to get stabbed right now.
text: The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate
text: next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy
text: Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.
speaker_heading: CREEPY GUY
dialog: Nice pubes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 43.

speaker_heading: KUMAR

scene_heading: 63 INT. CAR - 11:55 PM 63
text: KUMAR gets into the car and shuts the door. He hits the gas
text: and continues driving down the dark road...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Do you even know where you're going?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But
dialog: don't worry. Once we get on the highway,
dialog: we'll be there soon.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: We better.
text: It starts to rain...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Shit, now it's raining.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What's the big deal?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Look, I'm completely on edge right now,
dialog: okay? After all the shit we've been
dialog: through tonight, I don't know how much
dialog: more of this I can take.
text: AT THAT MOMENT, THE RACCOON JUMPS OUT FROM UNDER HAROLD'S
text: SEAT, CRAWLS OVER THE LAPTOP, ONTO HIS CHEST, AND STARTS
text: BITING HIS NECK...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: AHHHHH!!! FUCK!!!!
text: KUMAR turns and sees the raccoon on Harold.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Holy shit!

text: tries to help him.
scene_heading: 64 EXT. DIRT ROAD 64

scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 43A.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 65 INT. CAR 65
text: HAROLD FINALLY GETS THE RACCOON OFF OF HIM. He holds it as
text: far away from his face as possible. The raccoon's arms and
text: legs are scurrying around-- trying to escape.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: How the hell did that get in here?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have
dialog: rabies now or something!
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 44.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (looking at Harold's neck)
dialog: Don't worry. He didn't even break your

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh, that's not good!

speaker_heading: KUMAR

text: Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF
text: HEADLIGHTS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM!
speaker_heading: HAROLD KUMAR
dialog: Shit!!! Shit!!!
text: KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD
text: and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch
text: nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins
text: walking over to them.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Uh-oh.
text: KUMAR rolls down his window. The DRIVER peers inside...
speaker_heading: GOLDSTEIN
dialog: What the hell do you think you were

speaker_heading: GOLDSTEIN

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Great, let's get out of here.
text: Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT...
scene_heading: MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (O.S.)
dialog: Kumar!!!
dialog: Kumar know that voice all too well...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Shit.
dialog: 
text: KUMAR turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS
text: BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five
text: years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come
dialog: to the hospital.
text: Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.
speaker_heading: KUMAR'S FATHER
dialog: (thick accent)
dialog: I hope you are here to apologize for what
dialog: you did in your interview today. Dr.
dialog: Woodruff is a very good friend of mine,
dialog: and let's just say he was not at all
dialog: amused by your antics...and neither am I.
speaker_heading: SAIKAT
dialog: (no accent)
dialog: What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar?
dialog: Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a
dialog: beamer. And I get laid whenever I want.
dialog: You can have all that too, if you'd just
dialog: get off your ass and go to med school.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Eat my balls, Saikat.
speaker_heading: SAIKAT
dialog: God, you're 22 years old already! When
dialog: are you gonna grow up and stop with this
dialog: post-college rebel bullshit? Like your
dialog: life is so tough.
text: Kumar doesn't have a response. Saikat's right.
speaker_heading: KUMAR'S FATHER
dialog: I will not tolerate this business from
dialog: you any longer. You have one more
dialog: interview tomorrow and it is the last one
dialog: I'm setting up for you.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 48.
speaker_heading: KUMAR'S FATHER (cont'd)
dialog: If I hear from Dr. Wein that you were
dialog: anything short of spectacular, I'll
dialog: completely cut you off!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Oh, come on, dad!
speaker_heading: KUMAR'S FATHER
dialog: "Daddy will not be coming on anything!"
dialog: You will be there and you will behave!
dialog: I've put too much time and effort into
dialog: you to let you go and fuck it all up.
text: KUMAR lowers his head. He's been put in his place.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: You're right. I'm sorry.
text: KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug. He even gives SAIKAT a hug.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: It won't happen again.
speaker_heading: KUMAR'S FATHER
dialog: Good. I'll speak with you tomorrow.
text: KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he
text: and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Wow. So I guess you're going to med
dialog: school after all, huh?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Fuck that! Like I care what my dad
dialog: thinks. I can't wait to see the look on
dialog: his face when he finds out I skipped the
dialog: interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me
dialog: off? Fine! I don't need his money!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (extremely confused)
dialog: But...you just hugged him...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I just needed to get my hands on these...
text: KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Two words-- medical marijuana.
text: HAROLD shakes his head in disgust.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 49.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 74A INT. DOCTOR'S LOUNGE 74A
text: Using the SCAN CARDS, Harold and Kumar walk into a room where
text: there are loads of medical supplies, including SCRUBS. Kumar
text: grabs a couple and hands one to Harold. They put them on...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Look, I'm telling you, they see an Indian
dialog: and Asian guy wearing these and they'll
dialog: just assume we're doctors. Then we walk
dialog: right into the pharmacy and get the weed.
text: Harold does not appear happy he's doing this.
scene_heading: 75 INT. HALLWAY 75
text: HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks)
text: walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: If we get caught, you're taking the
dialog: blame. This wasn't my idea.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna
dialog: get toasted and then we're gonna eat
dialog: delicious White Castle-- just like we
dialog: planned.
text: All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked
text: out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy
dialog: feely).
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Dr. Patel, thank God I found you! I need
dialog: your help immediately!
text: The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room...
scene_heading: 76 INT. EMERGENCY ROOM 76
text: The scene is very fast paced, with several YOUNG MEDICAL
text: TECHNICIANS rushing around. Harold is confused and concerned
text: as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a patient...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (whispering to Kumar)
dialog: What the hell's going on here?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry.
dialog: Leave the talking up to me.
text: On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST.
text: He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 50.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: The patient was brought in by EMS five
text: minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds
text: with entry in the anterior abdomen. No
text: exit wounds.
text: HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh shit! This guy's gonna die!!!
text: THE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD.
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: It's a good thing I found you two. All
text: the other surgeons are working on other
dialog: patients...
text: The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all
dialog: wrong. We're not doc...
text: KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we
dialog: need to sedate the patient first or else
dialog: he could go into cardiac arrest.
text: HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Alright. I'll get the anesthesiologist.
text: The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hold on. What we should probably use is
dialog: marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate
dialog: the patient for surgery.
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: (confused)
dialog: Marijuana? But why...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: We don't have time for questions! We
dialog: need marijuana now! Get as much of it as
dialog: possible! Like a big bag of it!
text: KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 51.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: But doctor, we don't have marijuana in
dialog: this hospital.
text: HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to himself)
dialog: Shit.
text: Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest.
text: Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous...
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: We're losing him! You gotta do something!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (disappointed)
dialog: Very well. I guess we'll have to do this
dialog: the old fashioned way.
text: KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face.
text: Harold gives Kumar a look-- "What the fuck are you doing?"
speaker_heading: KUMAR (CONT'D)
dialog: First, we need to clear his C-spine. I
text: want stat x-rays of the chest and
dialog: abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and
dialog: start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we
dialog: need 2 units of O neg on board.
text: Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing
dialog: bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe
dialog: what's going on.
text: Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's
text: gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate
text: begins speeding up to an insane pace.
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Doctor! The patient is desatting!
text: Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed
dialog: lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat!
text: After a couple seconds go by...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What's taking so long?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 52.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The NURSE hands KUMAR what is essentially a LARGE NEEDLE!
text: Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the Patient's
text: chest. It's a tense moment. The Patient is scared. So is
text: Harold. The Nurse looks hopeful. Kumar looks determined.
text: With a quick thrust, Kumar jabs the needle into the Patient's
text: chest, causing a rush of air! The Patient breathes easier.
text: His heart rate drops back to normal.
speaker_heading: MALE NURSE
dialog: Great catch doctor! His sat is up to 94!
text: Kumar is cool and collected. He turns to the YOUNG MEDICAL
text: TECHNICIANS who have been aiding the surgery.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (casual)
dialog: Will one of you guys put the chest tube
dialog: in and wrap this up?
text: A chorus of "yes, doctors."
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (taking off his gloves)
dialog: Well, it looks like my work here is done.
text: Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his
text: face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous.
text: He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just
text: barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits...
speaker_heading: KUMAR (CONT'D)
dialog: Say, you wouldn't happen to know the
dialog: quickest way to get to the White Castle
dialog: in Cherry Hill from here, do you?
scene_heading: 77 EXT. TOWN STREETS - 1:00 AM 77
text: Harold's car is cruising down some streets lined with stores.
scene_heading: 78 INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI 78
text: Harold is very excited. Kumar is proud of himself, but
dialog: playing it cool.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm telling you. That was amazing! Even
dialog: your dad would've been impressed!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (nonchalant)
dialog: Yeah. It wasn't bad.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 52A.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: This is perfect! We're back on the road.
text: We have directions now. The rain let up.
dialog: And guess what...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 53.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: HAROLD clicks on the "SAVE" option on his laptop...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm officially done with my work.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I'm telling you, things are finally
dialog: starting to go our way.
text: While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his
text: surroundings and notices something...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey, check it out! Your movie's playing.
text: Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater
scene_heading: we see: "JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00.
scene_heading: SIXTEEN CANDLES - 11:00.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: And look who went to see it...
text: Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA
text: standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Holy shit.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: You see? You thought you two had nothing
dialog: in common. But it turns out you both
dialog: have the same lame taste in movies. Hey,
dialog: you wanna see if she wants to come with
dialog: us to White Castle?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No way. Forget about it. Just drive.
text: Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his
text: undivided attention.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an
dialog: hour from home. And who do we see, but
dialog: your dream girl standing outside a
dialog: theater playing your favorite movie. I
dialog: mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic
dialog: comedy, and I was your annoying gay
dialog: friend, this would be the moment I'd tell
dialog: you "this is a sign."
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Stop it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 54.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy
dialog: Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina
dialog: Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you
dialog: yourself said things are starting to go
dialog: our way...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Let's just go!
text: KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What are you doing?!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hey Maria!
text: MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN
text: REACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR
text: STARTS PEELING OUT...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey, get your hand off the gas!
text: Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas. Just then,
text: THE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (looking up)
dialog: Oh shit!
text: Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING
text: DOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL.
text: KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car
text: safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill.
text: Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You asshole! My car's probably all
dialog: scratched up now!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us
dialog: off the road!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I told you I didn't want to speak to her!
dialog: (composing himself)
dialog: Whatever. Let's jut get back on the
dialog: highway.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 55.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Fine.
text: KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a "POP!" Harold and
text: Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated.
scene_heading: 79 EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - 1:15 AM 79
text: HAROLD examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby.
text: There's not another car in site.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Godammit. You know how to change a flat?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know
dialog: how to change a tire.
text: Harold looks in his trunk for the spare. It's missing.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Where's my spare tire?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I don't know.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Shit, where the hell is it?
text: Kumar suddenly remembers...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we
dialog: got baked and started throwing shit off
dialog: that bridge to see if it would float?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What bridge? What the hell are you
dialog: talking about?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (realizing)
dialog: Oh shit. That's right. I was with
dialog: Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day.
dialog: My bad.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Your bad? What are the hell are we gonna
dialog: do now?!
text: Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their
text: direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops
text: in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins
text: walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon
text: as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 56.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: It's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties,
text: wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE
text: BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE. Harold and Kumar jump
text: back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.
speaker_heading: UGLY MAN
dialog: You boys need some help?
text: The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is
text: freaky. He has a SKULLET (A MULLET BUT WITH NO HAIR ON TOP).
text: HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out.
scene_heading: 80 EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:20 AM 80
text: The UGLY MAN'S TRUCK tows Harold's Infiniti down a dirt road.
scene_heading: 81 INT. TRUCK 81
text: The UGLY MAN is driving. KUMAR is in the front seat, on the
text: passenger side. HAROLD is sandwiched between them.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Thanks for helping us out.
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded
dialog: there and thought to myself, "what would
dialog: Jesus do?"
text: Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a
text: JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard...
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: So, you boys worship Christ?
text: The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.
speaker_heading: HAROLD KUMAR
dialog: Uh...Yeah. Sure, he's great.
speaker_heading: UGLY MAN
dialog: Great. Good to hear it. The name's
dialog: Randy...but everyone calls me Freak Show.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I'm Kumar. This is Harold. Good to meet
dialog: you, Mr...Freak Show.
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: Pleasure's all mine.
text: After a while, HAROLD starts to notice that they're driving
text: in the middle of a dark woods. It looks very sketchy.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So where exactly are we going?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 57.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: Don't worry. My place isn't too far from
dialog: here. Once we get there, I'll have your
text: ride fixed up in a jiffy.
text: The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a
text: RASH OF BOILS ON FREAK SHOW'S NECK.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (whispering to Harold)
dialog: Eww-- check out those boils on his neck!
text: HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at
text: FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Oh my God! You gotta look! One of
dialog: them's actually pulsating!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Will you shut up? He's right next to me!
dialog: He can hear you!
text: KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Now there's some sort of puss! It's the
dialog: most disgusting thing I've ever seen!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: What's the matter with you? You think
dialog: that just because you're whispering, he
dialog: can't hear what you're saying? He's two
text: feet away from us. He can hear this
dialog: entire conversation. He can hear me
dialog: talking right now.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (whispering)
dialog: Don't worry, he can't hear anything. Not
text: with all that crust in his ear.
text: HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then
text: looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard
text: a thing. Harold seems relieved.
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: I heard every word you said.
text: FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't
dialog: know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact
text: that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 58.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 82 EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE - 1:30 AM 82
text: HAROLD (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as
text: FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new tire from his
text: house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere.
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: Now it's gonna take me a little while
dialog: here, so if you boys like you can go
dialog: inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have
dialog: something to drink, watch tv-- anything
dialog: you want. Mi casa es su casa. Just
dialog: don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do.
text: FREAK SHOW gives HAROLD a pat on the back and starts changing
text: the tire. KUMAR and HAROLD look at each other. Slowly, they
text: walk towards FREAK SHOW's house...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck
dialog: his wife?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: He couldn't have said that.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: But he did! It may have been in mid-
text: sentence, but it was still clear as day.
text: They reach the front door and are about to enter...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What
dialog: do you think his wife is gonna look like?
scene_heading: 83 INT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE 83
text: HAROLD and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL
text: TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy
text: Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Hi. I'm Freak Show's wife, Liane. Would
dialog: you boys like some pink lemonade?
text: HAROLD and KUMAR can't move. They're awestruck.
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Let me go bring in a pitcher.
text: LIANE leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she
text: turns on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG
text: ABOUT JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house.
text: There are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with
text: Freak Show and Liane's wedding picture...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 59.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Okay. It's official. We've entered the
dialog: Twilight Zone.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, Liane is fucking hot!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: She's not ugly.
text: LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade. She pours them
text: drinks and hands them the glasses...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Thanks.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: So, tell me Liane-- how are things
dialog: between you and Freak Show presently?
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Oh, never been better. We love each
dialog: other very much.
text: KUMAR looks disappointed. HAROLD, however, is intrigued...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak
dialog: Show...end up with a woman like yourself?
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Well, I met him at choir practice `bout
dialog: four years ago. Freak Show was very shy
dialog: back then-- you know, because of all the
text: hideous boils on his face and neck. But
dialog: he had the most amazing voice -- like a
dialog: baby canary.
text: Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
dialog: talking about the same Freakshow?"
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Well, one day after Easter service, I
dialog: told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and
dialog: he just mustered up some courage and
dialog: asked me out. The rest is history. And
dialog: we've been in love ever since.
text: HAROLD ponders this for a moment. He and KUMAR begin
dialog: drinking their lemonade.
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: So you boys gonna fuck me or what?
text: HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They
text: look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 60.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: KUMAR
text: Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes
dialog: first?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Wait a second-- what about Freak
dialog: Show...and this whole Christian thing you
dialog: guys have going on?
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: (a little offended)
dialog: Oh, so just because we're passionate
dialog: about our Lord, you assume we don't know
dialog: how to have a good time?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No, I just...
text: Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and
text: Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window,
text: where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Nevermind.
dialog: (to Kumar, swinging his
dialog: hand)
dialog: Okay, rock, paper, scissors...
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do
dialog: me at the same time.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Come on. Give me the double stuff.
text: HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I'm not sure we quite understand...
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: I want you both inside me simultaneously.
text: HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and
text: kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Um, are we talking about one hole or two?
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: However you want to do it.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 61.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Sorry, no thank you.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Harold)
dialog: Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Shotgun anus!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Forget it! I don't want our balls
dialog: rubbing against each other. No way!
text: KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow
dialog: jobs!?
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: Well...okay.
dialog: (to Harold)
dialog: Can you help me with this...?
text: Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous
text: and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and
text: puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar,
text: who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the
text: cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her
text: shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her
dialog: breasts.
speaker_heading: LIANE
dialog: (to Harold, re: breasts)
dialog: Do you want to play with them?
text: Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Okay, let's do that.
text: Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts.
text: Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold
text: starts to massage her chest.
text: AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a
text: particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: Hey boys-- I changed your tire...
text: FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE...
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: What the hell are you doing with my wife!
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 62.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (scared shitless)
dialog: Uhh...you said outside that we can have

speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: (calming down)
dialog: Are you sure?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Positive.
text: FREAK SHOW ponders this.
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: Oh...my mistake then.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: No problem.
speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: Well, since we're all here, why not make

speaker_heading: FREAK SHOW
dialog: Who wants the first reach-around?
scene_heading: 84 EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE 84
text: HAROLD and KUMAR burst out the front door and run towards
text: their car. They get in and peel out as fast as they can.
scene_heading: 85 EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:45 AM 85
text: Harold's Infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods.
scene_heading: 86 INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI 86
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Okay, let's agree never to talk about

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Agreed.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 63.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: KUMAR searches for some clue of where they are.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, I have no idea where we are.
text: All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: And get chopped to bits? Are you crazy?
text: Kumar pulls over to the side of the road...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know
dialog: how to get us back on the highway.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Fuck that! It's my car! We're not
dialog: picking up a hitchhiker!
text: The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yo, man, thanks for picking me up.
text: HAROLD and KUMAR look at NEIL and then look at each other.
text: THEY ARE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. Harold is no longer angry.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to Neil)
dialog: Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil
dialog: Patrick Harris?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Yep.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was
dialog: my favorite TV show growing up! You were
dialog: my idol!
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: (curt)
dialog: Hey, that's great. Do you think we could
dialog: get going? I'm bored as shit back here.
scene_heading: 87 EXT. DIRT ROAD 87
text: We see Harold's Infiniti drive back onto the road...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 64.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: 88 INT. CAR 88
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you
dialog: ever get it on with Wanda off the set?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on
dialog: that show.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Even the chick who played the hot nurse?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: No, I didn't go all the way with her.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Hey, you don't know how to get back on
dialog: the highway, do you?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I don't even know where the fuck I am
dialog: right now. I was at this party earlier
dialog: tonight, and this dude hooked me up with
dialog: some killer X. Somehow I ended up
text: getting thrown out of a moving car, and
dialog: I've been tripping balls ever since.
text: HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Well, our night's been pretty crazy too.
dialog: We've been driving around for hours,
dialog: trying to get to White Castle, but we
dialog: keep getting sidetracked.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: Dude, forget White Castle. What we need
dialog: is some pussy.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Huh?
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: It's a fucking sausage fest in here.
dialog: Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll
dialog: go to White Castle.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: You don't understand, Neil. We've been
dialog: craving these burgers all night.
speaker_heading: NEIL
dialog: I've been craving burgers too. Fur
dialog: burgers, that is.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 65.
speaker_heading: NEIL (cont'd)
dialog: Let's pick up some trim at a strip club.
dialog: The Doogie line always works on
dialog: strippers.
text: HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- weirded out.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop
dialog: and get directions.
text: KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET
text: leading up to a gas station in the distance...
scene_heading: 89 EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE - 1:50 AM 89
text: HAROLD and KUMAR get out of the car. NEIL is still in the
text: backseat. The car is still running.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: We'll be right back, Neil.
text: NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start
text: walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
dialog: Why's he so horny?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I don't know. But we can't let him
dialog: interfere with our quest.
text: Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have
text: to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits with
text: TWO OF THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Late night math league meeting, homos?
scene_heading: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
dialog: (to Cole)
dialog: Extreme!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (upset)
dialog: Oh shit. These idiots.
text: Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk
text: into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them...
scene_heading: 90 INT. CONVENIENCE STORE 90
text: HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and
text: the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from
text: the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a
scene_heading: HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS
text: SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 66.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: INDIAN CASHIER
dialog: (to Cole and the punks)
dialog: Please...the pies...do not...
text: Cole and the Punks ignore him. Harold and Kumar then
dialog: approach the Indian Cashier...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get
dialog: onto the highway from here?
text: The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Harold)
dialog: He probably can't speak English...
text: KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE
text: CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the
dialog: directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to
text: explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It
dialog: sounds like it's very complicated.
text: Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
text: MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK
text: AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.
text: Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the
text: CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches
text: nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Who knew that learning Hindi would
dialog: actually pay off? The guy says the
dialog: highway's just down the road. We should
dialog: be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes.
text: HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to Kumar)
dialog: Huh? Oh, good.
speaker_heading: COLE (O.S.)
text: EXTREME KAYAKING!!!
text: HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and
text: look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY
text: THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH
text: THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR...
text: In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid-
text: air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS,
scene_heading: GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC.
text: The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR,
text: and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 67.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The kayak lands on the floor. COLE gets out and celebrates
text: with his friends.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: That was so fucking extreme, man!
scene_heading: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
dialog: Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten--
dialog: one being not so extreme, ten being
dialog: extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine
dialog: point five.
text: Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy
text: throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves,
dialog: bothering other customers.
text: The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI.
text: Extreme Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of
text: various kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an
text: other. Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS.
text: He goes apeshit over his find.
scene_heading: EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
dialog: Extreme Cheddar!
text: He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth,
dialog: getting the chips all over the place.
text: The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling. Cole picks up the
dialog: Cashier...
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Extreme Cashier!!!
text: Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER
text: around and around.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Somebody should do something.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Cole)
dialog: Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy
dialog: alone and go jerk off to some
dialog: snowboarding videos or something.
scene_heading: EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS
dialog: Oooooooooh!
text: Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the
text: floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get
text: their asses kicked.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 68.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (to Kumar)
dialog: I didn't mean you should do something.
text: Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face.
text: Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior.
text: It's a tense moment.
text: Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit
text: Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground
text: without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks
text: don't know what to think as their leader is shown up.
text: Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as
text: if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back,
text: doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard,
text: this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (pissed off at himself)
dialog: Shit.
text: Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking
dialog: with me one more time. Just try it!
text: Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Kumar, embarrassed)
dialog: Come on, lets get out of here.
text: Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated. With their
text: leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.
speaker_heading: COLE
dialog: (like Apu)
dialog: Thank you, come again!
scene_heading: 91 EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE 91
text: HAROLD and KUMAR walk back towards their car...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Kumar-- you okay?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Yeah, I just hate those dicks.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: Fuck it. At least now we know where we're
dialog: going. I'm so friggin' hungry...
text: SUDDENLY, WE HEAR A CAR ENGINE START. HAROLD AND KUMAR STOP
text: WALKING AND LOOK OVER AT KUMAR'S CAR.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 69.
dialog: 
text: THEY SEE NEIL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, TURNING THE KEY. THEY
text: WATCH AS HE PUTS THE CAR INTO DRIVE, HITS THE GAS, AND TAKES
text: OFF, DRIVING THROUGH A SIGN, AND GETTING ON THE ROAD...
text: Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without
text: saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the
text: distance. Eventually, Harold breaks the silence...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (calm)
dialog: Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking
dialog: car?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I think he did.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: FUCK!!!!!!
dialog: (to Kumar)
dialog: You! You had to pick up a hitchhiker!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Rold, calm down!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Why the hell did you leave the keys in
dialog: the car?!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a
dialog: trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to
dialog: know that he'd fuck us over?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: This is all your fault! This whole
dialog: fucking night! You know I leased that
dialog: car! They're gonna make me pay for it!
text: Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Where are you going?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm going to call the police! I don't
dialog: want to talk to you anymore!
text: Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and
text: throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face.
dialog: "Extremes" all around!
speaker_heading: KUMAR
text: There's a pay phone across the street, if
dialog: you don't want to deal with those
dialog: assholes.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 70.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar
text: walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street.
text: On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE "DON'T WALK" SIGN LIT
text: UP. Harold presses the "WALK" BUTTON on the post next to him.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: So after you talk to the cops we're still
dialog: going to White Castle, right?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'm not speaking to you.
text: Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It
text: doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE "WALK" BUTTON REPEATEDLY.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: You know, pressing the button a bunch of
dialog: times doesn't make the sign change any
text: faster. The computer responds to the
dialog: first press. Every press after that is
dialog: extraneous.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Thank you, Mr. Wizard.
text: HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't
text: change, he begins pressing the button again.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Jesus Christ! When are they gonna
dialog: fucking develop button technology that'll
dialog: understand urgency?
text: The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the
text: left and then to the right. The street is completely empty
text: and there is no place for a police car to hide.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: This is ridiculous. Just walk across.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: It'll change in a second.
text: They stand there for another ten seconds. It doesn't change.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Come on, there's not a car in sight!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Alright fine. You want me to cross?
dialog: I'll cross. Just leave me alone!
text: Harold starts walking angrily across the street.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Finally.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 71.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Before Kumar has a chance to follow, a POLICE CAR FROM OUT OF
text: NOWHERE FLASHES ITS LIGHTS AND STOPS HAROLD DEAD IN HIS
speaker_heading: TRACKS.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Shit!
text: Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as
text: OFFICER PALUMBO (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the
text: car and walks over to them...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (looking at cop's name-
dialog: tag)
dialog: Good evening. Is there a problem,
dialog: Officer...Palumbo?
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Is there a problem? Ever hear of
dialog: jaywalking?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise
dialog: I'll never do it again.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Yeah, like I give a fuck. I'm writing
dialog: you up a ticket.
text: OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket. Kumar walks over,
text: flabbergasted...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: A ticket?! Are you serious?
dialog: Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up!"
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: (to Kumar, unthreatened)
dialog: Who the fuck are you, shitwad?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (stepping in front of
dialog: Kumar)
dialog: Let me apologize for my friend. I promise
dialog: I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm
dialog: glad you're here. You know the TV show
dialog: Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie
dialog: Howser just stole my car and...
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Pipe down and give me your ID.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Officer Palumbo)
dialog: Wait. Hold on.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 72.
speaker_heading: KUMAR (cont'd)
dialog: How can you give him a ticket for
dialog: jaywalking? I mean, look at this street!
dialog: He wasn't causing traffic or anything!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Kumar, shut up...
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: (to Kumar)
dialog: Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on
dialog: a cop who could bust your ass.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Bust my ass?!
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass.
dialog: (to Harold)
dialog: What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with
dialog: like three o's and shit. What happened to
dialog: good old fashioned American names like
dialog: Dave, Jim...
text: Harold points to his ID.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Harold.
text: Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Yes. Harold. That's a great name. You
dialog: should be proud of that name, son.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Thank you.
text: OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk
dialog: away.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: As you were, ladies.
text: Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: 220 dollars!? Are you crazy?
text: Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Officer Palumbo)
dialog: No, no, no. I understand what's going on.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 73.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block
text: him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement
text: towards him.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Hey, hands down! No sudden moves!
text: Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with
text: Palumbo improvising little responses.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Let me guess. You were probably the big
dialog: asshole in your high school, right?
dialog: You'd pick on guys like us every day.
dialog: But then graduation came, and we went to
dialog: college and you went nowhere, so you
dialog: thought, "How can I still give them shit?
dialog: I know! I'll become a cop!" Well,
dialog: congratulations. Your dream's come true.
text: Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed.
text: Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to
dialog: Palumbo.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (to Officer Palumbo)
dialog: Hey, while you're at it, why don't you
dialog: write him up another ticket? Or better
dialog: yet, arrest him. Lock him up!
text: With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees
text: Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends
text: up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh shit.
scene_heading: 92 INT. JAIL CELL - 2:30 AM 92
text: The CELL DOOR SLAMS. Harold is behind bars.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (calling out)
dialog: Hey, are you gonna do something about my
dialog: car? Hello?
text: Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE
text: ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation
dialog: to our Police Charity is very
dialog: appreciated.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 74.
dialog: 
dialog: 
scene_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S MOM
dialog: Well, thank you for being so
dialog: understanding about Bradley. I promise
dialog: you he won't ever do it again.
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the
dialog: talk we had, right Brad?
text: Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look.
speaker_heading: HIPPIE ASSHOLE
dialog: (shaken)
dialog: Mom-- please take me home...
text: The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a
text: frightened child.
text: Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we
text: see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's
text: WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on
dialog: Harold...
text: Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Can I at least give you my car's licence
dialog: plate number?
text: Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...
speaker_heading: RADIO ANNOUNCER
dialog: The search for the escaped cheetah
dialog: continues tonight. It was last spotted in
dialog: Randolph Township, heading South...
text: Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him
text: is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold
text: sits down, across from Tarik.
text: While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the
text: cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: So what are you in here for?
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: For being black.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Come on. Seriously.
text: TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his
text: Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 75.
dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: I am serious. You wanna know what
dialog: happened?
text: Harold nods.
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble,
text: and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black
dialog: man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore,
dialog: since I'm black, it was probably me,
dialog: right?
text: Harold shrugs his shoulders.
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: Well that was the logic the cop used. I
dialog: told him I haven't even been to Newark in
text: months. Then he pointed a gun at me and
dialog: told me to stop resisting arrest. I
dialog: said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything."
text: So he starts beating me with his gun,
dialog: screaming at me, telling me to stop
dialog: resisting.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Holy shit. What did you do?
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: I kept saying, "I understand that I'm
dialog: under arrest. Please stop beating me."
dialog: But that didn't work. Then another cop
dialog: showed up. Then another. When it was
dialog: all said and done, it took nine cops to
dialog: bring me in here.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That fucking blows!
text: Tarik nods and continues reading his book. Harold sees that
text: Tarik is remarkably relaxed.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I don't understand how you're able to be
dialog: so calm about all this.
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: Son, I'm fat. I'm black. I can't dance.
dialog: And I have two gay fathers. I've had
dialog: people messing with me my whole life.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: I learned a long time ago, there's no
dialog: point in getting all riled up every time
dialog: a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time.
dialog: Because in the end, the universe tends to
text: unfold as it should.
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 76.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Harold takes this all in.
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: So what are you in here for?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
text: Assaulting an officer.
speaker_heading: TARIK
dialog: They tried to pin that shit on you too?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. I actually did hit the cop. But
dialog: only because I was trying to hit my
dialog: friend. Well, ex-friend.
dialog: 
text: Suddenly, OFFICER REILLY hangs up the phone on his desk. He
text: shouts out to the other officers in the room:
speaker_heading: OFFICER REILLY
dialog: Hey, listen up guys! Multiple gun shots
dialog: fired in Millbrook Park! It sounds bad!
speaker_heading: OFFICER PALUMBO
dialog: Finally, some action! I'm going!
text: Another cop, OFFICER MARTONE, gets up...
speaker_heading: OFFICER MARTONE
dialog: No-- I'm going!
text: All six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run
text: for the door. Harold and Tarik can't believe it.
scene_heading: 93 EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS 93
text: We see the officers get into their POLICE CARS and drive off.
scene_heading: 94 INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS 94
text: Harold and Tarik are now left all alone in their cell.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: That was strange.
text: Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a VENTILATION
text: SHAFT on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What the hell was that?
speaker_heading: KUMAR (O.C.)
dialog: (from inside the shaft)
dialog: Rold? Is that you?
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 77.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: Although his voice is muffled, we can hear Kumar's words.
text: Tarik is very confused.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (shouting out)
dialog: Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?!
speaker_heading: KUMAR (O.C.)
dialog: Are the cops still there?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No, they... Wait a second, did you...
speaker_heading: KUMAR (O.C.)
dialog: I called and made up some story about a
text: shooting in Millbrook park...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?!
speaker_heading: KUMAR (O.C.)
dialog: I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust
dialog: you out, and we'd get over to White
dialog: Castle.

scene_heading: 132 EXT. CHERRY HILL ROAD 132

scene_heading: 133 INT. COP CAR 133

scene_heading: 138 EXT. CLIFF - 6:40 AM 138
text: We see the jeep stop just short of the cliff. Harold and

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (pointing)
dialog: Rold! Look out there!

text: THEY THEN HEAR A POLICE SIREN COMING FROM BACK IN THE WOODS.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh shit! We're trapped!
text: Kumar notices something...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Not necessarily.
text: KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No. No way. Not a chance. I'd rather
dialog: turn myself in than die.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Dude, it's okay. I used to hang-glide
dialog: with my dad all the time when I was kid.
dialog: I know how to do it.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: You hang-glided? I don't remember that.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: We did it on our trips to India. I
dialog: swear. I know exactly what I'm doing.
dialog: I've even done it with two people at the
dialog: same time. My brother and I did it.
speaker_heading: (MORE)
dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 97.
speaker_heading: KUMAR (cont'd)
dialog: Just hold onto the outside bars and let

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over
text: a bunch of hamburgers.
text: KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: You think this just about the burgers,
dialog: huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about
dialog: far more than that.
text: KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
text: the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The
dialog: scene is very picturesque...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Our parents came to this country,
dialog: escaping persecution, poverty, and
dialog: hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very,
dialog: very hungry. And they wanted to live in
dialog: a land that treated them as equals. A
dialog: land where their kids could study and get
text: into good colleges. A land filled with
dialog: hamburger stands. And not just one type
text: of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with
dialog: different sizes, toppings, and
dialog: condiments. That land was America.
text: THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: (turning to Rold)
dialog: You think this is just about the burgers?
dialog: No. This is about achieving what our
dialog: parents set out for. This is about the
dialog: pursuit of happiness. This is about the
dialog: American dream.
text: KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: And so we've reached this point. The
dialog: point which all men eventually have to
text: face. The point of no return.
dialog: (beat)
dialog: We can stay here, get arrested and end
dialog: our hopes of ever going to White Castle.
dialog: Or we can take the hang-glider and make
dialog: our leap towards freedom. I leave the
dialog: decision up to you.
text: From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are

dialog: tight.
text: HAROLD does as he's told. They are both holding onto the
dialog: bars (Harold behind Kumar).
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On
dialog: the count of three, we're gonna run to
dialog: the edge of the cliff. When I say
dialog: "jump," launch yourself forward as if you
dialog: were diving into a pool, got it?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (nervous)
dialog: I think so.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine.
dialog: Are you ready?
text: HAROLD's too nervous to speak. KUMAR gets into position.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Okay, here goes. One...two...three!
text: HAROLD and KUMAR START RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLIFF.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Good job, Rold! Keep running!
text: THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Rold, there's something I gotta tell you.

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: WHAT???
speaker_heading: KUMAR

dialog: 
scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 99.
dialog: 
dialog: 
text: The hang glider coasts through the air for a couple seconds.
text: THEN, SUDDENLY, THE GUYS START GOING DOWN AT A SHARP ANGLE!
speaker_heading: HAROLD KUMAR
text: AHHHHHH!!!!!!!! AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
text: JUST THEN, THE HANG GLIDER CATCHES ONTO THE WIND AND STARTS
text: GLIDING THROUGH THE SKY.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
speaker_heading: KUMAR

speaker_heading: OFFICER BRUCKS
dialog: (to the walkie-talkie)
dialog: Good news. I found enough dope in the

text: Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth

speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty
dialog: cool saving that guy's life last night.
text: Somewhere between that, getting yelled at
dialog: by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick
dialog: Harris, I realized that I've always
dialog: wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been
dialog: too scared to admit it.
text: KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Hey, Rold, are you listening to me? I'm
text: having a major epiphany here.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: I'll be right back...
text: At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with
text: their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like
text: some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On

dialog: J.D.
dialog: Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what?
speaker_heading: BILLY

dialog: At the start of last night, all I really

dialog: what I'm trying to say is...
speaker_heading: HAROLD (O.S.)
dialog: What the fuck is going on here?

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Harold? What are you...?
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Never mind me. What are you doing here?

speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Back off, cock boy! What I have to say
dialog: to him goes double for you!
text: KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just
dialog: call me "cock boy?"
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Yeah, you know I did. You're just
dialog: stalling because you're not quick enough
dialog: to think of a comeback.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: Oh, I'm not quick enough?
dialog: (to Billy)
dialog: He thinks I'm not quick enough.

speaker_heading: BILLY
dialog: Listen Harry...
dialog: J.D.
dialog: (to Billy)
dialog: Don't even bother with him. We'll just
dialog: tell Berenson later...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Tell him what? That I'm your work horse!
dialog: That you guys think you can just party
dialog: all weekend and leave all your work to
dialog: the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh?
text: J.D. is stunned. Now he's a little nervous.
dialog: J.D.
dialog: No, no-- you don't understand...
speaker_heading: HAROLD

dialog: And if either one of you douchebags ever
dialog: tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to
dialog: Berenson and tell him what's really going
dialog: on.
text: Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: And I'll tell everyone in the office how
dialog: you both caught gonorrhea from that

dialog: week.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after
dialog: all.

scene_heading: DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003 112.
speaker_heading: LUIS (cont'd)
dialog: She seemed so sweet at first, but it
dialog: turns out she's into some pretty freaky
dialog: shit. She even did this thing where she
text: took a lollipop and shoved it...
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: (grossed out/depressed)
dialog: Look, I really don't need to hear it. I
dialog: guess I just made a mistake. Sorry for
dialog: interrupting you guys...

speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: Hey-- if you're looking for Maria, she

speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps

dialog: 
dialog: 
speaker_heading: LUIS
dialog: (to Harold)

speaker_heading: KUMAR

dialog: To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now
dialog: and take the next plane.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: What are you talking about? Are you out
dialog: of your mind? What about your interview
dialog: with the med school guy?
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule
dialog: it. He won't have a problem, as long as
dialog: I'm taking it seriously for a change.
dialog: Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: She's coming back in ten days! It's not
dialog: like I'm never gonna see her again.
speaker_heading: KUMAR
dialog: For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is
dialog: the kiss of death. There are gonna be
text: suave, sophisticated guys all over her.
text: By the time she gets back, she may not be
dialog: available.
text: Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying.
speaker_heading: HAROLD
dialog: Forget it. I'll just wait till she comes
