text: panties, bra and a pair of black Jimmy Choo shoes. She’s
text: rubbing lotion on herself. She walks over to the shower and
text: cuts it off. Then she hands Richard the lotion she’s holding
dialog: and says--
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: You made it. I was thinking you
dialog: might not come. I thought you'd
dialog: get scared and not show up.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: Scared of what?
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: I don’t know. Just scared. Could
dialog: you rub some of this on my back?

speaker_heading: PRINCE
text: I MET HER IN A HOTEL LOBBY
text: MASTURBATING WITH A MAGAZINE...
text: Richard stares back at Nikki. Then with his back to her he
text: pats his crotch. He can’t believe how hard he is. This
text: Viagra shit works. Nikki is on the bed laid out. She’s
text: looking hard at Richard. All we see of her is her head and
dialog: her breast as she says-—-
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: What are you doing all the way over
dialog: there? I thought you weren’t

dialog: Then she says--
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: So what are you waiting for?
text: AT THAT MOMENT, we see Richard reach down and take off her
dialog: panties. Remember we never see her crotch. The reason we
dialog: know that Richard took off her panties is because we saw them
text: come past her left shoe. Richard starts to pounce on her and
dialog: Nikki says--
speaker_heading: NIKKI
dialog: Wait. Take off you sweater.
text: Richard begins to take off the turtleneck until only his face
dialog: shows.
text: AT THAT MOMENT, he turns to see himself in the MIRROR next to
text: Nikki on the bed and FREEZES. He looks horrified by what he
text: sees because what he sees is the turtleman. The character he
text: acts out with his son and daughter. We FLASH back to see
text: Richard in the earlier scenes playing turtleman with his
text: kids. THE MUSIC DROPS OUT SUDDENLY. THERE IS NO SOUND. NO
scene_heading: MUSIC, NO AMBIENT SOUND. TOTAL SILENCE.
text: The silence is broken as he takes a deep breath and looks in
text: the mirror. He pulls the shirt back on, gathers up his
text: things and leaves the apartment as fast as he can. The MUSIC
text: starts back up where we HEAR Prince screaming “Nikki, Nikki!”
text: The music keeps playing.

dialog: few calls to return.
scene_heading: INT. RICHARD’S OFFICE - SAME

speaker_heading: MUSIC STARTS
text: Richard and Erica start to talk/sing at each other, but not

text: White or Rick James and Teena Marie record. Romantic music
text: plays throughout the end of this scene.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: You know, baby, I.just wanna tell
dialog: you how sorry I am for being so
dialog: cold. It’s not that I don’t like
dialog: being married. It’s just that
dialog: sometimes it feels like the walls
dialog: are closing in on me.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: I understand, baby. But it’s not
dialog: just you. I gotta admit that I’ve
dialog: been distant too. I haven’t always
dialog: been nice. As a matter of fact,
dialog: sometimes I’m as cold as ice.
speaker_heading: RICHARD
dialog: So cold. So cold. You’ve been
dialog: very cold, baby.
speaker_heading: ERICA
dialog: But one thing I have to ask you,
