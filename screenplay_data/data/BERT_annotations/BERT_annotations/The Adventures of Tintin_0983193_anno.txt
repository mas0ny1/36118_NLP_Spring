scene_heading: ICONIC TINTIN MOVIE CREDIT SEQUENCE
text: CREDITS play over a fast-paced mini-ACTION ADVENTURE, giving
text: a flavour of who TINTIN is, and the exotic places he finds
text: himself. A sense of the history of the character, placing him
text: in context for both a long-time READER, and new MOVIEGOER.
text: As the CREDIT SEQUENCE ends, we push in towards a brilliant
text: ORB, which separates into swirling colours and transforms
dialog: into...
scene_heading: EXT. STREET MARKET - DAY
text: The SWIRLING COLOURS of an ARTIST'S PALATE.
text: A STREET ARTIST, bearing an uncanny resemblance to HERGE, is
text: sketching a young man with his back to the camera. They are
text: in the middle of a busy street market.
speaker_heading: STREET ARTIST
dialog: Very nearly there, sir. I have to
dialog: say, your face is familiar. Have I
dialog: drawn you before?
speaker_heading: TINTIN (0.C.)
dialog: Occasionally.
speaker_heading: STREET ARTIST
dialog: Of course, I've seen you in the
dialog: newspaper. You’re a reporter?
text: ANGLE ON: A WHITE DOG is sitting, looking a little bored, at
text: the subject’s feet. The DOG whimpers.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I'm a journalist. Be patient, Snowy
dialog: - not much longer.
text: Two patent leather shoes enter frame, distracting SNOWY.
text: SNOWY leaves to follow the MAN, who deftly picks the pockets
text: of market patrons as he goes.
text: ANGLE ON: SNOWY as he trots through the crowd, keeping his
text: eyes on the PICKPOCKET.
text: The PICKPOCKET bumps into another market patron and snatches
dialog: their wallet.
speaker_heading: PICKPOCKET
dialog: I do beg your pardon.
dialog: 
text: ANGLE ON: SNOWY follows the PICKPOCKET as a hand continues to
text: snatch wallets and handbags from their unsuspecting owners.
speaker_heading: STREET ARTIST
dialog: There. I believe I’ve captured
dialog: something of your likeness.
text: The STREET ARTIST hands TINTIN the picture, showing the
scene_heading: CARTOON TINTIN.
text: Our fully-dimensional TINTIN admires it.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Not bad. What do you think, Snowy?
text: TINTIN looks around - SNOWY isn’t there.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: (exasperated)
dialog: Snowy...
text: TINTIN hands money to the artist and leaves, in search of
speaker_heading: SNOWY.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: There you are, sir. Now, where's he
dialog: run off to?
text: As TINTIN stroils through the market, he passes two pairs of
text: eyes (the THOM(P)SONS), peering through holes cut in a
speaker_heading: NEWSPAPER.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
dialog: Anything?
speaker_heading: THOMSON
dialog: Nothing!
text: TINTIN crosses behind them.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Snowy!
text: TINTIN has paused by a stall selling mirrors, which reflect
text: multiple images of his famous quiff. A DOG BARK.
text: SNOWY runs over.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where have you been, heh? Chasing
dialog: cats again?
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN, just as something has caught his eye in the
text: reflection of a stall selling cheap antiques.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Snowy - look at this!
text: CLOSE ON: A magnificent model sailing ship in a glass case.
text: TINTIN and SNOWY walk towards it and bend down to take a
text: closer look.
text: TINTIN leans in closer. Intricate detail fills the frame, as
text: if the boat were real. We can almost hear the sea, the shouts
text: of sailors, the cry of gulls.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT‘D)
text: Triple masted, double decks, fifty
dialog: guns. Isn’t she a beauty?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE (0.S.)
dialog: That's a very unique specimen, that
dialog: is.
text: The seller, CRABTREE, is sitting at his stall.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE (CONT’D)
text: From an old sea captain’s estate,
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: The Unicorn...
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
text: Unicorn. “Man-o-War” sailing ship.
dialog: It's very old, that is. Sixteenth
dialog: century!
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Seventeenth, I would think.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Reign of Charles the First!
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Charles the Second.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: That's what I said, Charles the
dialog: Second. As fine a ship as ever
dialog: sailed the seven seas. You won’t
dialog: find another one of these, mate.
dialog: And it’s only two quid.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I‘ll give you a pound.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (relieved)
dialog: Done!
text: CRABTREE stands as TINTIN pays him.
text: ANGLE ON: BARNABY, a large man in a tight blue suit, is
text: lumbering through the market, distracted and under pressure.
text: CRABTREE lifts the model ship from the case and hands it
dialog: over.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE (CONT'D)
text: Gently does it.
text: BARNABY continues to shove his way through the crowd.
speaker_heading: MARKET PATRON
dialog: Excuse me!
text: CRABTREE releases the boat into TINTIN’s hands.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: There you go, careful!
scene_heading: SUDDENLY: An AMERICAN VOICE!
speaker_heading: BARNABY (0.S.)
dialog: Hey, bud...
text: BARNABY arrives at the stall, out of breath.
speaker_heading: BARNABY (CONT'D)
dialog: ...how much for the boat?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: I'm sorry, I just sold it to this
text: young gent.
speaker_heading: BARNABY
dialog: Oh yeah? Tell me what you paid and
dialog: I'll give you double.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (appalled)
dialog: Double?
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Thanks, but it's not for sale.
speaker_heading: BARNABY
dialog: Look, kid, I’m trying to help you
dialog: out - I don't think you realize
dialog: this, but you're about to walk into
dialog: a whole mess of danger.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: What kind of danger?
dialog: 
text: BARNABY’s expression changes to a look of alarm.
speaker_heading: BARNABY
dialog: I’m warning you - get rid of the
dialog: boat and get out while you still
dialog: can! These people do not play nice.
text: BARNABY moves back into the crowd.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: What people?
speaker_heading: VOICE (0.C.)
dialog: Wonderful!
text: TINTIN turns around to find a TALL, STOOPED-MAN standing
text: behind him - this is SAKHARINE. He wears a long macintosh and
text: tall bowler, with a coal black beard, fierce bright eyes and
dialog: pince-nez.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: It's just, wonderful! Don't bother
dialog: wrapping it, I'll take it - ‘as
dialog: is’. Does anybody object if I pay
dialog: by cheque?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: If you want to buy it, you'll have
dialog: to talk to the kid!
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: I see. Well, let the kid name his
dialog: price.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: (quiet despair)
dialog: Name his price?? Ten yeare I've
dialog: been flogging bric-a-brac and I
dialog: miss “name your price” by one
dialog: bleedin’ minute!
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I'm sorry. I already explained to
dialog: the other gentleman -
text: SAKHARINE frowns, locking around.
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: American - he was. All hair oil and
dialog: no socks!
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: It’s not for sale.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: Then let me appeal to your better
dialog: nature. I have recently acquired
dialog: Marlinspike Hall and this ship, as
dialog: I’m sure you’re aware, was once
dialog: part of the estate.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Of the late sea captain?
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: The family fell upon hard times,
dialog: lost everything. They’d been living
text: in a cloud of bad luck ever since.
dialog: We are talking generations of
dialog: drinking and irrational behavior -
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I‘m sorry but as I told you before,
dialog: it‘s not for sale.
text: SAKHARINE glares at TINTIN.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Good day to you, sir.
text: TINTIN tucks the MODEL SHIP under his arm, nods politely, and
text: leaves. SNOWY cocks his snout indignantly and follows.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: That young man - what‘s his name?
speaker_heading: CRABTREE
dialog: Him? Everybody knows him. That's
dialog: Tintin.
text: CLOSE ON: SAKHARINE as the camera closes in on his
text: inscrutable face.
scene_heading: INT. TINTIN’S APARTMENT - DAY
text: TINTIN and SNOWY enter.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: What is it about this ship? Why has
dialog: it attracted so much attention?
text: He sets the model down on his sideboard.
text: TINTIN studies the MODEL SHIP ...
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What secrets do you hold?
dialog: 7.
text: TINTIN hurries to the next room. He takes off his coat and
text: sets it down on the couch. He enters a small office and hunts
text: around his desk for his magnifying glass; an old typewriter
text: sits there in pride of place, surrounded by artifacts from
text: far-off places.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Ah! Where ia that magnifying glaas?
text: As TINTIN looks around - we see glimpses of his LIFE: framed
text: PICTURES and NEWSPAPER STORIES, featuring past adventures.
text: TINTIN posing with familiar CHARACTERS from early travels.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Could have sworn it was... No.
dialog: Where could it possibly be? Snowy,
dialog: you haven't seen...
text: He moves to the large bookcase.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Where is it?
text: SNOWY surprises him, he is holding the magnifying glaas in
text: his jaws.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT‘D)
dialog: Thank you.
text: TINTIN takes it.
text: CLOSE ON: MAGNIFYING GLASS. He turns around to find the cat
text: standing in the doorway. SNOWY turns and GROWLS!
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: No, Snowy!
text: ANGLE ON: A WHITE CAT has slipped in through the open window.
text: SNOWY instantly BARKS and chases the CAT, which springs back
text: up into the living room.
text: TINTIN rushes back into the living room, and finda SNOWY
text: chasing the CAT.
text: The CAT swings wildly from a chandelier, climbs up the drapes
text: and over a bookshelf; SNOWY goes above it. As he races across
text: the sideboard after the CAT, he knocks over the UNICORN!
text: TINTIN chases the CAT towards the window and slides on the
dialog: floor.
text: He hears the CRASH! TINTIN spins around the SOUND.
dialog: 
text: CLOSE ON: The MODEL SHIP lies on the floor... mast broken off
text: near the base,
text: TINTIN gently picks up the BROKEN MODEL SHIP.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: (annoyed)
dialog: Look what you did. You broke it!
dialog: Bad dog!
text: He turns the ship over, not noticing a SMALL METAL TUBE that
text: drops onto the FLOOR.
text: CLOSE ON: TINTIN moves closer to the sideboard and
text: unknowingly kicks the tube under the low cabinet. SNOWY tries
text: to PAW at it, but it rolls away... the more SNOWY paws at it,
text: the further he pushes it... until it rolls all the way under
dialog: the cabinet.
text: CLOSE ON: TINTIN examines the damage ... the mast is hollow,
text: and has snapped near the deck, TINTIN pute the MAST loosely
text: back in place.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Something happened on this ship.
dialog: And we're going to the one place
dialog: that could have the answer ...
text: TINTIN grabs hia coat and heads out of the apartment.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: c'mon, Snowy.
text: TINTIN and SNOWY leave the apartment. Someone is watching
text: through binoculars from outside the window. They focus on the
speaker_heading: SHIP.
scene_heading: INT. LIBRARY - EVENING
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN site in the gothic library, a tiny figure
text: dwarfed by towering shelves.
text: CLOSE ON: TINTIN is reading a old thick maritime
text: encyclopedia. He turns the page and whispers to SNOWY.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: (low whiaper)
dialog: Here it is! "Sir Francis Haddock of

speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
text: The ship set sail from Barbados in
dialog: 1676 on one of the most ruinous
dialog: voyages in maritime history... ship
dialog: never reached destination...
text: An old illustration of the UNICORN under full sail.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: «-.attacked by pirates, all hands
dialog: lost except for one survivor. When
dialog: Sir Francis was rescued and
dialog: returned home, he was convinced his
dialog: name had been cursed. The Unicorn's
dialog: manifest stated that it was
text: carrying a cargo of rum and tobacco
dialog: bound for Europe, but it was long
dialog: claimed the ship was carrying a
dialog: secret cargo...
text: TINTIN glances at SNOWY, puzzled...
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: What was the ship carrying, Snowy?
text: TINTIN turns another page and keeps reading ...
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Historians have tried and failed to
dialog: discover what happened on that
dialog: fatal voyage - but Sir Francis’s
dialog: last words: ‘Only a true Haddock
dialog: will discover the secret of the
dialog: Unicorn.’
text: TINTIN turns the page to continue, then puts the book down
text: and grabs another, flipping through the pages.
text: A familiar blue-suited figure sneaks between the aiales...
text: TINTIN takes a look behind his shoulder - there is no one.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
text: TINTIN is a little creeped out. A storm is brewing,
text: and rain beats on the library windows. TINTIN thinks he’s
text: being watched. Lightning strikes outside.
scene_heading: INT. 26 LABRADOR STREET HALLWAY - EVENING
speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
text: TINTIN enters the hallway.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I've missed something, Snowy. We
dialog: need to take a closer look at that
dialog: model.
dialog: 10.
text: He walks up the stairs.
scene_heading: INT. TINTIN’S FLAT - EVENING
text: TINTIN opens the door and enters. The model ship has
dialog: vanished.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Of course it’s gone! How could I be
dialog: so stupid?
scene_heading: EXT. MARLINSPIKE HALL COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
text: A faded sign indicating “MARLINSPIKE HALL” can still be read.
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN and SNOWY hurry along in the shadows of a
text: high brick wall that surrounds a country estate.
text: A full moon casts spooky shadows through skeletal trees,
text: blowing in the wind. With every gust, a carpet of dead leaves
text: lift into the air.
text: ANGLE ON: The rusting iron gates, covered with ivy.
text: TINTIN reaches the gate he tries to open them, to no avail.
text: Suddenly, SNOWY appears on the other side.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: How'd you do that?
text: SNOWY shows TINTIN a hole in the crumbled wall.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Clever boy.
text: TINTIN squeezes through the hole, with SNOWY close behind...
scene_heading: EXT. MARLINSPIKE HALL GROUNDS - NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN and SNOWY cross the heavily wooded estate to
text: a dark mansion.
text: ANGLE ON: MARLINSPIKE HALL ... a once-grand chateau-style
text: COUNTRY HOUSE, now looking very sad and neglected. Empty and
dialog: dark.
text: TINTIN walks up to the steps.
dialog: 
dialog: ll.
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN’S flashlight sweeps and settles on a COAT OF
text: ARMS, carved into stone above the front door. A large fish
text: dominates the design.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: (whispers)
dialog: A coat of arms... why does that
dialog: look familiar?
dialog: (realizes)
dialog: Hang on a minute... that fish! It's
dialog: a Haddock! Of course - Marlinspike
dialog: Hall is the old Haddock estate...
text: SNOWY quickly heads off on in the wrong direction.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Snowy!
text: A slavering GUARD DOG growls and charges at TINTIN from out
dialog: of the shadows!
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN races away from the DOG, leaping fallen
text: trees and ducking low branches, with the hound snapping at
text: his heels.
text: TINTIN approaches a stone wall as the DOG is almost upon him.
text: Suddenly, SNOWY leaps from the bramble and barks angrily at
text: the GUARD DOG. The larger dog cowers and whines, submitting
text: to SNOWY’S ferocity.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT‘D)
dialog: Well done, Snowy! Good boy.
text: TINTIN pets his head.
text: The GUARD DOG playfully runs about SNOWY on the front lawn,
text: as TINTIN unlatches a broken window and climbs inside.
scene_heading: INT. MARLINSPIKE HALL - NIGHT
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN slowly pushes open the window inside the
text: mansion and carefully sweeps his FLASHLIGHT through a
text: darkened room. Everything is coated in layers of dust and the
text: furniture is covered in great white sheets. A shadowy figure
text: stealthily walks alongside him.
text: TINTIN moves through a door into a side room, where he sees a
text: distinctive SHAPE hidden beneath a sheet. In one swift
text: movement, he sweeps the sheet aside.
text: ANGLE ON: The MODEL SHIP sitting in a display case, bathed in
text: a shaft of ghostly moonlight.
dialog: 12.
text: CLOSE ON: TINTIN can’t believe hia luck ... he grabs the
text: MODEL SHIP. He shines the flashlight on the boat before
text: picking it up.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: (softly)
dialog: Well, well, well... it seems we've
dialog: caught our thief.
text: He starts to back away from the case holding onto the ship.
text: He turns to see a tall, SILHOUETTED FIGURE standing in front
text: of him ... the MAN raises a CANDLESTICK and whacks TINTIN on
dialog: his HEAD!
dialog: THUNK!
text: TINTIN slumps to the FLOOR, head spinning. The room lights
text: are turned on.
text: NESTOR takea the UNICORN from TINTIN asa he is lying on the
text: floor, making sure his head is still attached. SAKHARINE
text: enters, completely cool and calm.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: Welcome to Marlinspike Hall. I see
dialog: you let yourself in.
text: TINTIN gets up.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I came to retrieve my property.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: I'm sorry - I’m not sure I follow
dialog: you?
text: TINTIN sits up, rubbing the back on his head. NESTOR is
text: holding the UNICORN MODEL.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Oh, I think you do. This ship was
dialog: atolen from my apartment leas than
dialog: an hour ago!
text: TINTIN tries to get the MODEL SHIP from NESTOR - as if he's
text: thinking of making a dash for it.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: I'm afraid you're mistaken, Mr.
dialog: Tintin.
text: NESTOR pulls the ship back from TINTIN.
dialog: 
dialog: 13.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: There’s no mistake. It belongs to
dialog: me!
text: He pulls back again away from NESTOR.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: Are you sure?
text: NESTOR begins to pulls the ship away from TINTIN.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: of course I’m sure.
text: TINTIN takes the SHIP.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: I took it home. I put it ona
text: _ cabinet in the living room and then
text: Snowy chased the cat and knocked it
dialog: over and it ...
dialog: (dawning realization)
dialog: ++. fell.
text: TINTIN’S eye is drawn to the mast. This mast is not broken
text: and split like that on his own ship.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: {stunned)
dialog: This isn't my ship.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: No, indeed.
text: NESTOR takes the SHIP back, and goes back to the case and
text: puts it inside.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I - I’m sorry. It looks —
dialog: identical.
text: SAKHARINE takes TINTIN by the arm and leads him out towards
text: the door.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: Well, looks can be deceiving.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Yes, indeed ...
text: TINTIN pulls away from SAKHARINE and walks back to the case
dialog: and the ship.
dialog: 
dialog: 14,
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: +». but I don’t understand! Why did
dialog: Sir Francis make two ships exactly
dialog: alike? And you have one already.
dialog: Why do you want another? What is it
dialog: about this model that would cause
dialog: someone to steal it?
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: Goodness me, why so many questions?
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: It‘s my job. There could be a story
dialog: here. It’s what I do, you see.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: Well, it's no great mystery. Sir
dialog: Francis Haddock was a drunkard and
dialog: a hopeless reprobate! He was doomed
dialog: to fail and he bequeathed that
dialog: failure to his sons.
text: He starts to walks away from TINTIN, TINTIN follows him.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: So it’s true! The Haddock line is
dialog: cursed!
text: He stops TINTIN with his cane.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: What else have you found out?
text: TINTIN pushes the cane away.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: What is there to find?
text: SAKHARINE swings the cane to TINTIN’s other shoulder.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: That depends what you're looking
dialog: for.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: I'm looking for answers, Mr.
dialog: Sakharine ...
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: You're looking in the wrong place.
text: SAKHARINE offers TINTIN a THIN SMILE.
dialog: 
dialog: 15.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE (CONT’D)
dialog: It's late ... I think you should go
dialog: home.
text: NESTOR handa the torch to TINTIN.
speaker_heading: NESTOR

speaker_heading: TINTIN

text: Beneath that, a few seemingly meaningless strokes and dashes.
dialog: 17.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT‘D)
dialog: What are these markings? Some kind
dialog: of secret language, or code? It
dialog: makes no sense. But it does explain
dialog: why they ransacked the flat. They
dialog: were looking for this, and they
dialog: didn't find it, which means ...
dialog: they'll be back.

speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Quiet right, laddy, quiet right.
text: The STORM outside worsens, and the PLANE does a BARREL ROLL.
text: Once TINTIN rights the PLANE, HADDOCK makes another grab for
text: the SPIRITS. He unscrews the CAP as the PLANE goes into a
text: DIVE. The PILOTS float off the floor of the COCKPIT and the
text: ALCOHOL emerges in the form of large GLOBULES that hover in
text: front of HADDOCK’s face.
text: SNOWY floats into view and SLURPS up the ALCOHOL! TINTIN
text: pulls the PLANE out of the dive at the last moment and SNOWY

speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: No, no, no!
text: A RED LIGHT FLASHES next to the FUEL GAUGE.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
text: Fuel tank! It’s almost empty.
dialog: Captain! This may sound crazy but

dialog: tank,
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Christopher Columbus!

speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT’D)
dialog: Captain! Captain! Can you hear me?
dialog: Captain! Captain!
text: HADDOCK'S head slowly appears in TINTIN‘'s window.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)

dialog: on fumes!
text: HADDOCK has an idea.
dialog: 66,
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Fumes!
text: HADDOCK straddles the plane and opens the FUEL CAP. Inside
text: the cockpit, the empty ALCOHOL BOTTLE hits TINTIN’S foot.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Oh, no.
text: HADDOCK takes a big breath and releases an ENORMOUS BELCH
text: into the TANK. Inside the ENGINE, PISTONS fire manically and
text: FLAMES shoot out from the propellor as it spine again.
text: HADDOCK sits up and block the WINDSHIELD.
speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Captain! I can’t see!

speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: No, LAND!!!
text: Suddenly, a SAND DUNE appears and the PLANE is headed
dialog: straight for it!
speaker_heading: HADDOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Turn!!
text: TINTIN does his best to avoid a the DUNE. The plane pitchea
text: wildly back and forth.
text: The PILOTS have regained consciousness in the back and shake
dialog: their heads.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK (CONT’D)
dialog: Starboard! Starboard! Starboard!!
text: TINTIN swerves the PLANE again. The PILOTS have freed

dialog: 
dialog: 67.
text: The PLANE hits a dune, catches fire and comes to a stop.
text: TINTIN is thrown through the WINDSHIELD and slides down the

speaker_heading: HADDOCK (CONT'D)
dialog: Hang on, Tintin! I‘m coming!!
text: SNOWY tries to pull him to safety, but his QUIFF is trimmed
text: by the ROTORS.
text: HADDOCK reaches the PLANE and pulls TINTIN to SAFETY, before

scene_heading: LATER... THE ICONIC SHOT
text: WIDE ON: SUN BLAZES DOWN mercilessly, as TINTIN, HADDOCK and

speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Captain, we have to keep going. One

speaker_heading: ANGLE ON:
speaker_heading: CONFUSED,
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
speaker_heading: TINTIN

dialog: Everything Granddaddy told me. The

speaker_heading: his CHAIR.
scene_heading: INT. AFGHAR OUTPOST OFFICE - DAY
text: HADDOCK is back on his feet; he moves around the room and

speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Sir Francis knew he was doomed,
dialog: that he‘d be hung from the highest
dialog: yardarm but they didn’t reckon on

dialog: Haddock and a Haddock always has a
text: trick up his sleeve.
text: HADDOCK moves around the table, looking at everyone,

scene_heading: INT. AFGHAR OUTPOST OFFICE - DAY
speaker_heading: HADDOCK

dialog: forward!
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: On the pirates? Like that? Unarmed?

text: TINTIN puts his hands on the BOTTLE and takes it away from
speaker_heading: HADDOCK.
dialog: 
dialog: 
dialog: 80.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: And then he stops. ‘This is not

text: that, he puts down the bottle and -
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: (dismissively) )
text: Yes, yes, he puts down the bottle

speaker_heading: HADDOCK (0.8.)

speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Did what?
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Sank his own ship! Sir Francie sent

speaker_heading: THOMPSON

speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Barnaby! ?
dialog: 107.
speaker_heading: THOMPSON
text: One of their agents. Hot on
text: Sakharine‘s trail from the start.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
text: It still doesn’t make any sense. He
dialog: has the key to the treasure of the
text: Unicorn, which is sitting somewhere
dialog: on the ocean floor. Why would he
dialog: come back home?
text: ANGLE ON: The CAR swings over and lands in front of the
text: waiting group; they approach the CAR.

speaker_heading: HIS GRIP.
text: The CRANE ARM swings wildly, and TINTIN and the THOM(P)SONS
text: leap for their lives as SAKHARINE’S CAR swings across the
text: ROOF, slams into a WALL and is lifted INTO THE AIR.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE (CONT’D)
dialog: What's going... ?
dialog: 108.

speaker_heading: SAKHARINE (CONT'D)
dialog: Not that way! Not that way, you
dialog: fool, the other way!
text: HADDOCK sneaks in behind ALLAN, throws him from the ROOM, and

text: the CRANE CONTROLS.

scene_heading: EXT. ESTABLISH POSITION OF CRANES
text: SAKHARINE and HADDOCK jump into action, and the CRANES
text: approach each other and COLLIDE!
text: HADDOCK and SAKHARINE duel, as the MASSIVE METAL ARMS of the
text: CRANES violently SLAM into each other. TINTIN and the
text: THOM(P)SONS dive to safety as SAKHARINE’S CRANE ARM swings
text: just over their heads. SAKHARINE then uses the arm to throw a
text: PALETTE of CEMENT BAGS into HADDOCK’S CAB.
scene_heading: EXT. COLLISION / CRANES DUELING
text: HADDOCK fights to clear the CAB of the DUST and DEBRIS; the
text: ARM of SAKHARINE’S CRANE crashes into the front window of his
speaker_heading: CAB.
text: ANGLE ON: A POLICE CAR is split in two by a CRANE.
text: HADDOCK slams his CRANE ARM onto the SAKHARINE'S CABIN,
dialog: ripping away the ROOF!
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: Close, but no cigar!
dialog: 109.
text: SAKHARINE knocks out the SUPPORTS of HADDOCK’S CRANE with a
text: PALETTE of BOXES. HADDOCK hits his head on the CABIN ROOF.
text: BOXES and CRATES rain down on TINTIN, SNOWY and the TWINS.
text: TOM runs at them with a GUN, but is trapped as several TIRES
text: land on him. A group of THUGS rush to TOM’S aid, but SNOWY
text: opens a CRATE of CANS that trip them up!
text: HADDOCK charges with his CRANE; SAKHARINE and HADDOCK are
text: face to face.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: (deadly)
dialog: Red Rackham!
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: That’s right, my ancestor. Just as
dialog: Sir Francis was yours.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: (grim)
text: Unfinished business.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: I‘m glad you know the truth,
dialog: Haddock. Until you could remember,
dialog: killing you wouldn't have been this
dialog: much fun!
text: SAKHARINE’S CRANE slides backward, the ARM SWINGS WILDLY and
text: knocks HADDOCK'S CRANE over!
text: ANGLE ON: TINTIN watches as HADDOCK’S CRANE falls.
text: HADDOCK’S CRANE lands on the DECK of the KARABOUDJAN; he
text: tumbles out of the cabin with other debris from the CRANE.
text: SAKHARINE walks down the ARM of the CRANE toward HADDOCK.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Who gave you permission to board my
dialog: ship?!
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE
dialog: I don't need it.
text: SAKHARINE pulls a SWORD from his CANE.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE (CONT‘’D)
dialog: I’ve never needed it.
text: As HADDOCK stands, he grabs a METAL LEVER off the GROUND.
dialog: 110.
text: ANGLE ON: HADDOCK and SAKHARINE duel, just like their
text: ANCESTORS did... and just as RED RACKHAM did, SAKHARINE
dialog: fights DIRTY.
text: CLANG! The METAL of the SWORD meets the STEEL of the LEVER.
text: SAKHARINE kicks HADDOCK to the ground. As HADDOCK tries to
text: get up, SAKHARINE grabs a FISHNET and throws it at HADDOCK;
text: it wraps around his neck. SAKHARINE pulls HADDOCK to him and
text: then spins him around. SAKHARINE lets go on the final turn,
text: and HADDOCK slams against CRATES filled with WHISKEY BOTTLES.
text: SAKHARINE walks away from HADDOCK.
text: As HADDOCK starts to get up slowly, a BOTTLE rolls onto his
text: HAND. HADDOCK looks up at SAKHARINE.
text: A BOTTLE slams into SAKHARINE’S BACK. Suddenly, SAKHARINE is
text: bombarded with BOTTLES - he tries to FEND THEM OFF but THERE
dialog: ARE TOO MANY!
text: HADDOCK has his arms filled with bottles, throwing them at
text: SAKHARINE with all his might as he crosses the DECK.
text: As SAKHARINE ducks for cover, he falls over the edge onto a
scene_heading: LOWER PLATFORM.
text: HADDOCK slowly walka up with one BOTTLE left in his hand.
text: SAKHARINE comes up with the SCROLLS in one hand and a LIGHTER
dialog: in the other.
speaker_heading: SAKHARINE (CONT‘D)
dialog: The legend ssya only a Haddock can
dialog: discover the secret of the Unicorn
dialog: — but it took a Rackham to get the
dialog: job done! So you've lost again,
dialog: Haddock. That‘s right, why don’t
dialog: you have a drink? That’s all
dialog: you've got left, isn’t it?
dialog: Everything that was rightfully
dialog: yours is now mine, including this
dialog: ship!
text: SUDDENLY, TINTIN swings in and retrieves the scrolls from
dialog: SAKHARINE!
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
text: Thundering typhoons. Nobody takes
dialog: my ship.
text: HADDOCK punches SAKHARINE in the FACE, sending off the ship's

speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Blistering barnacles! They're
dialog: coordinates!
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: It took all three scrolls to form
dialog: the numbers.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Latitude and longitude ... that is
dialog: it! That’s the location of the
dialog: treasure!

scene_heading: EXT. MARLINSPIKE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
text: CLOSE ON: The WIND rushes through SNOWY's fur, and then
text: TINTIN'S COIF. HADDOCK raises a SEXTANT to his eye, checking
text: location against the position of the sun. Puffy clouds tower
text: above, and we assume he’s at sea.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: Almost there, Mister Tintin. A
dialog: nudge to starboard should do it.
text: CLOSE ON: TINTIN... low angle, looking up towards the SKY,
text: WIND blasting his HAIR.

speaker_heading: HADDOCK

dialog: it. I meant the other cellar.
dialog: 114.
speaker_heading: NESTOR
dialog: I’m sorry, sir - there is no other
dialog: cellar.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: It was bigger than this...
text: ANGLE ON: SNOWY runs away and suddenly DISAPPEARS!
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: Snowy! Snowy, where are you?
text: TINTIN moves over to the other side of the room, there ia a
text: wall with furniture all stacked up. The GUARD DOG is looking
text: around trying to get to the other side.

text: And then shines forth, the Eagle's
dialog: Cross...
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: I can see the cross but where's the
dialog: eagle?
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: St. John the Evangelist, who was
text: always depicted with an eagle, and
dialog: he’s called the Eagle of Patmos. He
dialog: is the eagle.
dialog: {at the statue)
dialog: But what is he trying to tell us,
dialog: Captain? I’m at a loss.
text: A CARVED, STONE GLOBE. HADDOCK leans close to study
text: The GLOBE has detailed islands and coastloands in raised
text: relief. HADDOCK traces an ARCHIPELAGO of TINY ISLANDS.
speaker_heading: CLOSE ON:
speaker_heading: HADDOCK
dialog: That island, the one in the middle,
dialog: that doesn’t exist.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: How do you know?
speaker_heading: HADDOCK

dialog: It's a mistake.
text: TINTIN; an idea is forming in his mind.
speaker_heading: TINTIN
dialog: What if it isn’t... ?

speaker_heading: TINTIN (CONT'D)
dialog: Sir Francis wanted his inheritance
dialog: to go to a man who was worthy of
dialog: it... a man like himself, who knows
text: the seas like the back of his hand.
dialog: A man who could look at a globe and
dialog: tell if one tiny island was out of
dialog: place.
text: HADDOCK takes TINTIN's meaning. He leans forward and slowly
text: presses the TINY ISLAND that shouldn't be there...
text: CLICK!! The top of the GLOBE pops open, like a lid!
text: TINTIN and HADDOCK lean forward, peering into the GLOBE.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK

dialog: Blistering treasure! It’a Red
dialog: Rackham's barnacles!
text: TINTIN dips his hand in and brings out a HANDFUL of TREASURE.
speaker_heading: HADDOCK (CONT’D)
dialog: What's this?
text: HADDOCK lifts out the lining containing the rest of the
text: TREASURE and chuckles. He recognizes that it is SIR FRANCIS'S
text: HAT. He empties the contents of the HAT into another
